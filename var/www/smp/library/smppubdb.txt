$abstract=Nuclear ribosomal DNA regions (i.e. large subunit, internal transcribed spacer, 5.8S and intergenic
 spacer) were sequenced using a direct-polymerase chain reaction method from <i>Armillaria ostoyae</i>
 genets collected from the western USA. Many of the <i>A.&nbsp;ostoyae</i> genets contained heterogeneity among
 rDNA repeats, indicating intragenomic variation and likely intraspecific hybridization. Intragenomic
 variation was verified by visually editing base-sequence offsets in regions with insertions/deletions,
 and using sequence-specific internal primers to resequence heterogeneous regions. Phylogenetic
 analyses with Bayesian Inference methods were used to define groups within <i>A.&nbsp;ostoyae.</i> Analysis of
 <i>A.&nbsp;ostoyae</i> from outside the western USA indicated the presence of a Circumboreal group of <i>A.&nbsp;ostoyae</i>
 that also occurs in Utah; two other phylogeographic groups were associated with the Rocky Mountain
 and Pacific Northwest regions of the USA. Mixed sequence types, an indication of intraspecific
 hybrids, were common in some geographic regions. Hybridization events may have influenced species
 evolution, contributing to variation in pathogenicity and virulence. The occurrence of these groups and
 intraspecific hybrids also indicates that paleogeography and paleoclimate may have influenced the
 phylogeography of <i>A. ostoyae.</i> In addition, other <i>Armillaria</i> species were examined for evolutionary
 relationships with the groups of <i>A.&nbsp;ostoyae.</i> These findings will provide a basis for future research
 relating ecological function to genetic diversity within <i>A.&nbsp;ostoyae.</i>

$abstract=Volcanic ash from the eruption of Mt. Mazama ~77,700 years ago has a strong influence
 on many forested landscapes of the Pacific Northwest and Intermountain regions of the  USA and  Canada.
 Because  of the  unique biological, physical and  chemical properties of the ash,
 it is closely tied to plant communities and forest productivity, and 
 should therefore be considered as a resource to protect when harvesting, burning, or
 site preparation activities occur on it.
 How did this symposium get started?
 There has been a steady stream of questions, problems, and research on volcanic ash-cap soils for many decades.
 This symposium was designed to assemble experts to discuss our state-of-knowledge about
 volcanic ash-cap soil management and restoration.
 About 200 scientists and natural resource managers participated in this conference,
 which was held at the Coeur d'Alene Resort, Coeur d'Alene, ID in November 2005.

$abstract=Wood stake weight loss has been used as an index of wood decomposition in mineral soil, but it may not give a reliable estimate in cold boreal forests where decomposition is very slow. Various wood stake strength tests have been used as surrogates of weight loss, but little is known on which test would give the best estimate of decomposition over a variety of soil temperature conditions. Our study showed that radial compression strength (RCS) was a better indicator of wood strength change in southern pine (<i>Pinus</i> spp.) and aspen (<i>Populus tremuloides</i> Michx.) than surface hardness or longitudinal shear. The suitability of using the RCS to measure wood decomposition in boreal mineral soils was tested in six Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L.) plantations along a North-South gradient from Finland to Poland. After 3 years RCS losses ranged from 20% in northern Finland to 94% in central Poland, compared to dry weight losses of 3% and 65%. RCS was a sensitive indicator of initial wood decomposition, and could be used in soils where decomposition is limited by low temperature, lack of water or oxygen, or where a rapid estimate of wood decomposition is wanted.

$title=Characterization of North American <i>Armillaria</i> species: Genetic relationships determined by ribosomal DNA sequences and AFLP markers

$abstract=Phylogenetic and genetic relationships among 10 North American <i>Armillaria</i> species were analysed using sequence data from ribosomal DNA (rDNA), including intergenic spacer (IGS-1), internal transcribed spacers with associated 5.8S (ITS + 5.8S), and nuclear large subunit rDNA (nLSU), and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Based on rDNA sequence data, the nLSU region is less variable among <i>Armillaria</i> species than the ITS + 5.8S and IGS-1 regions (nLSU < ITS + 5.8S < IGS-1). Phylogenetic analyses of the rDNA sequences suggested <i>Armillaria mellea</i>, <i>A. tabescens</i> and <i>A. nabsnona</i> are well separated from the remaining <i>Armillaria</i> species (<i>A. ostoyae</i>, <i>A. gemina</i>, <i>A. calvescens</i>, <i>A. sinapina</i>, <i>A. gallica</i>, NABS X and <i>A. cepistipes</i>). Several <i>Armillaria</i> species (<i>A. calvescens</i>, <i>A. sinapina</i>, <i>A. gallica</i>, NABS X and <i>A. cepistipes</i>) clustered together based on rDNA sequencing data. Based on the isolates used in this study, it appears that techniques based on IGS-1, ITS + 5.8S, and/or D-domain/3' ends of nLSU are not reliable for distinguishing <i>A. calvescens</i>, <i>A. sinapina</i>, <i>A. gallica</i> and <i>A. cepistipes</i>. However, AFLP data provided delineation among these species, and AFLP analysis supported taxonomic classification established by conventional methods (morphology and interfertility tests). Our results indicate that AFLP genetic markers offer potential for distinguishing currently recognized North American Biological Species (NABS) of <i>Armillaria</i> in future biological, ecological and taxonomic studies.

$abstract=White pine blister rust disease, caused by the introduced pathogen <i>Cronartium ribicola</i>, has severely disrupted five-needled pine ecosystems in North America. A 100-year effort to manage this disease was predicated in part on the premise that the pathogen utilizes only species of <i>Ribes</i> (<i>Grossulariaceae</i>) as alternate hosts on this continent. The current study presents the first conclusive demonstration that some species in the family <i>Orobanchaceae</i> (<i>Pedicularis racemosa</i> and <i>Castilleja miniata</i>) are functioning as alternate hosts in a natural ecosystem of North America. This finding has implications for improving our understanding of epidemiology, pathogen adaptation and host&minus;pathogen interactions within white pine blister rust.

$abstract=<i>Fusarium</i> species can cause severe root disease and damping-off in conifer nurseries. <i>Fusarium</i> inoculum is commonly found in most container and bareroot nurseries on healthy and diseased seedlings, in nursery soils, and on conifer seeds. Isolates of <i>Fusarium</i> spp. can differ in virulence; however, virulence and colony morphology are not correlated. Forty-one isolates of <i>Fusarium</i> spp., morphologically indistinguishable from <i>F. oxysporum</i>, were collected from nursery samples (soils, healthy seedlings, and diseased seedlings). These isolates were characterized by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and DNA sequencing of nuclear rDNA (internal transcribed spacer including 5.8S rDNA), mitochondrial rDNA (small subunit [mtSSU]), and nuclear translation elongation factor 1-alpha. Each isolate had a unique AFLP phenotype. Out of 121 loci, 111 (92%) were polymorphic; 30 alleles were unique to only highly virulent isolates and 33 alleles were unique to only isolates nonpathogenic on conifers. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses of DNA sequences from all three regions and the combined data set showed that all highly virulent isolates clearly separated into a common clade that contained <i>F. commune</i>, which was recently distinguished from its sister taxon, <i>F. oxysporum</i>. Interestingly, all but one of the nonpathogenic isolates grouped into a common clade and were genetically similar to <i>F. oxysporum</i>. The AFLP cladograms had similar topologies when compared with the DNA-based phylograms. Although all tested isolates were morphologically indistinguishable from <i>F. oxysporum</i> based on currently available monographs, some morphological traits can be plastic and unreliable for identification of <i>Fusarium</i> spp. We consider the highly virulent isolates to be <i>F. commune</i> based on strong genetic evidence. To our knowledge, this is the first reported evidence that shows <i>F. commune</i> is a cause of <i>Fusarium</i> disease (root rot and damping-off) on Douglas-fir seedlings. Furthermore, several AFLP genetic markers and mtSSU sequences offer potential for development of molecular markers that could be used to detect and distinguish isolates of <i>F. oxysporum</i> nonpathogenic to conifers and highly virulent isolates of <i>F. commune</i> in forest nurseries.

 <a>Effects of slash, machine passes, and soil moisture on penetration resistance in a cut-to-length harvesting.</a>
 <b>International Journal of Forest Engineering</b> 17(2):11-24.
$abstract=Multiple entries into forest stands are often needed for fire hazard reduction and ecosystem restoration treatments in the Inland Northwest U.S.A. region.
 However, soil compaction occurring from mechanized harvesting operations often remains for many years and may 
 contribute to a decline in long-term site productivity.
 A controlled experiment on a silt loam soil was conducted to determine (a) the effectiveness of logging slash to buffer 
 compaction, (b) the influence of the number of machine passes, and (c) the contribution of soil moisture to changes in 
 penetration resistance during a cut-to-length harvest in northern Idaho.
 Penetration resistance was measured at three soil depths (10, 20, and 30 cm) for three different moisture contents 
 (low, medium, and high) and slash amounts (none, light, and heavy) after each of 12 machine passes (one pass each with 
 a harvester and an empty forwarder, and 10 passes with a fully-loaded forwarder).
 At all three soil depths the main effect of moisture content and machine passes on penetration resistance was 
 significant, but slash amounts alone did not significantly affect penetration resistance.
 After 12 passes, we measured the greatest penetration resistance in the medium soil moisture treatment at 5 to 15 cm of 
 soil depth.
 When evaluated at similar moisture contents after harvesting, the soil that was driest during machine traffic (low 
 moisture treatment) had the lowest penetration resistance.
 Slash was important for protecting the soil against compaction in the medium and high soil moisture treatments.
 Penetration resistance did not significantly increase after the second pass of a fully-loaded forwarder (31,752 kg) at 
 any moisture content or slash level.
 Managing felling operations to take advantage of dry soil conditions or using slash when soils are moist may help 
 reduce ruts and avoid long-term compaction impacts on this soil type.

$abstract=The wildland fires of 2000, 2002, and 2003 created many opportunities to
 conduct post-fire logging operations in the Inland Northwest. Relatively little information
 is available on the impact of post-fire logging on long-term soil productivity or
 on the best method for monitoring these changes. We present a USDA Forest Service
 Northern Region study of post-fire logged sites using a variety of methods to assess
 changes in soil productivity and site sustainability after timber harvesting activities.
 The disparate soil and climatic conditions throughout the Northern Region made it
 an ideal area to study post-fire logging operations. Our results indicate that post-fire
 logging during the summer creates more detrimental disturbance (50% of the stands)
 than winter harvesting (0% of the stands). In addition, on the sites we sampled, equipment
 type (tractor &gt; forwarder &gt; rubber-tired skidder) also influenced the amount
 of detrimental disturbance. Number of sample points is a critical factor when determining
 the extent of detrimental disturbance across a burned and harvested unit.
 We recommend between 80 and 200 visual classifi cation sample points, depending on
 confidence level. We also provide a summary of methods that will lead to a consistent
 approach to provide reliable measures of detrimental soil disturbance.

 <b>Canadian Journal of Forest Research.</b> 36(3):565-576.
$abstract=This study describes the main treatment effects of organic matter removal and compaction and a split-plot effect 
 of competition control on mineral soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools. Treatment effects on soil C and N pools are
 discussed for 19 sites across five locations (British Columbia, Northern Rocky Mountains, Pacific Southwest, and Atlantic
 and Gulf coasts) that are part of the Long-Term Soil Productivity (LTSP) network and were established over 5 years ago.
 The sites cover a broad range of soil types, climatic conditions, and tree species. Most sites showed increased soil C
 and N levels 5 years after study establishment; however, the rate and magnitude of the changes varied between sites.
 Organic matter removal, compaction, or competition control did not significantly affect soil C and N contents at any site,
 except for the Northern Rocky Mountain site, where competition control significantly affected soil C and N contents.
 The observation that, after 5 years, the soil C and N contents were not negatively affected by even the extreme treatments
 demonstrates the high resiliency of the soil, at least in the short term, to forest management perturbations.

 <b>Canadian Journal of Forest Research.</b> 36(3):551-564.
$abstract=The impact of forest management operations on soil physical properties is important to understand,
 since management can significantly change site productivity by altering root growth potential, water infiltration
 and soil erosion, and water and nutrient availability. We studied soil bulk density and strength changes as indicators
 of soil compaction before harvesting and 1 and 5 years after harvest and site treatment on 12 of the
 North American Long-Term Soil Productivity sites. Severe soil compaction treatments approached root-limiting bulk densities
 for each soil texture, while moderate compaction levels were between severe and preharvest values.
 Immediately after harvesting, soil bulk density on the severely compacted plots ranged from 1% less than to 58% higher
 than preharvest levels across all sites. Soil compaction increases were noticeable to a depth of 30 cm.
 After 5 years, bulk density recovery on coarse-textured soils was evident in the surface (0.10 cm) soil,
 but recovery was less in the subsoil (10.30 cm depth); fine-textured soils exhibited little recovery.
 When measured as a percentage, initial bulk density increases were greater on fine-textured soils than on
 coarser-textured soils and were mainly due to higher initial bulk density values in coarse-textured soils.
 Development of soil monitoring methods applicable to all soil types may not be appropriate, and more site-specific
 techniques may be needed for soil monitoring after disturbance.

$abstract=We examined fifth-year seedling response to soil disturbance and vegetation control at 42 experimental locations representing 25 replicated studies within the North American Long-Term Soil Productivity (LTSP) program.
 These studies share a common experimental design while encompassing a wide range of climate, site conditions, and forest types.
 Whole-tree harvest had limited effects on planted seedling performance compared with the effects of stem-only harvest (the control); slight increases in survival were usually offset by decreases in growth.
 Forest-floor removal improved seedling survival and increased growth in Mediterranean climates, but reduced growth on productive, nutrient-limited, warm.humid sites.
 Soil compaction with intact forest floors usually benefited conifer survival and growth, regardless of climate or species.
 Compaction combined with forest-floor removal generally increased survival, had limited effects on individual tree growth, and increased stand growth in Mediterranean climates.
 Vegetation control benefited seedling growth in all treatments, particularly on more productive sites, but did not affect survival or alter the relative impact of organic matter removal and compaction on growth.
 Organic matter removal increased aspen coppice densities and, as with compaction, reduced aspen growth.

$abstract=Forest management objectives continue to evolve as the desires and needs of society change. The practice of silviculture has risen to the challenge by supplying silvicultural methods and systems to produce desired stand and forest structures and compositions to meet these changing objectives. For the most part, the practice of silviculture offers a robust set of procedures well suited for the timely and efficient production of timber crops, but often leaving simplified forests that do not necessarily reflect historical conditions, do neither provide a full range of wildlife habitats, nor provide a sense of place for many different forest users. We propose a silvicultural system that we call &quot;free selection&quot;. This multi-entry, uneven-aged system is intended for use in forests in which the remaining structure and composition is paramount. It is well suited for restoring the old-growth character of forests as well as reducing the risk of wildfire within the urban interface. Rather than using precise stand structural guidelines to define the stand treatments, we suggest that a well articulated &quot;vision&quot; of the immediate and desired future conditions is used to guide the planning and control the marking. This vision accounts for the interaction of all components of a forest from below ground to the high forest canopy. It relies on an integrated ecological view of how forests function. We have applied free selection guided by such a vision in both the moist (<i>Thuja plicata</i> Donn. ex D. Don, <i>Abies grandis</i> (Dougl. ex D. Don) Lindl., <i>Tsuga heterophylla</i> [Raf.] Sarg.) forests of northern Idaho to reduce the risk of wildfire damaging historical buildings and in the dry (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i> Dougl. ex Laws.) forests of southern Idaho to restore their old-growth character.

$abstract=<i>Armillaria ostoyae</i> is an important root-rot pathogen of conifers in the western United States. This thesis reviews what is currently known about <i>A. ostoyae</i> biology, distribution, and management, and provides a map of <i>A. ostoyae</i> worldwide distribution based on available literature. A range of hosts and a detailed description of host symptoms are outlined. Morphological, biological, and phylogenetic species concepts used in the identification of <i>Armillaria</i> species are described. A comprehensive assessment of strategies and concepts to manage sites impacted by this pathogen are included, with an emphasis on the role of tree stress as a predisposing factor to the pathogen. In addition, a direct-PCR method and phylogenetic analyses were used to assess genetic diversity among genets of <i>A. ostoyae</i> in the western United States. This method defined several phylogeographic groups and showed that much of the sequence information showed heterogeneity among ribosomal DNA repeats, an indication of intraspecific or interspecific hybridization. Information on genetic diversity is important to understanding varying levels of pathogenicity within <i>A. ostoyae</i> and its diverse environmental conditions.

$abstract=White pine blister rust (<i>Cronartium ribicola</i>) causes extensive damage to white pines and their associated ecosystems across North America. The anatomical and cellular characteristics of <i>C. ribicola</i> colonization in <i>Pinus monticola</i> branch and stem tissues were studied as a basis for understanding host tree reactions that may be related to resistance. Samples examined showed typical fusiform swelling and some had produced aecia. The reaction of phloem and xylem tissues was compared with non-infected tissue using light and electron microscopy. Cortical parenchyma and phloem polyphenolic parenchyma cells underwent mitotic division, cell swelling, and ca sixfold greater accumulation of phenolic compounds in colonized vs. control stems. In the cortex and secondary phloem, haustoria were common in parenchymatous cells, and hyphae were abundant in the intercellular spaces, but cell death was rare, unless aecia had ruptured the stem cortex. Hyphae were also common in xylem rays, tracheids and between tracheids. Disease-induced changes in the cambial zone included development of cambium-derived xylem traumatic resin ducts. Results demonstrate that diverse host defence responses were activated in the bark of apparently susceptible trees, but lack of mechanical damage by <i>C. ribicola</i> to the phenol-containing host cells and the resin duct system allowed extensive colonization and development of aecia despite elicitation of these stem defences. Interactions between <i>P. monticola</i> and <i>C. ribicola</i> are discussed and compared with other conifer&minus;fungus pathosystems.

Fort Collins, CO: U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station. 32 p. 
$abstract=After nearly 100 years of fire exclusion, introduced pests, and selective harvesting, a change in forest composition has occurred in many Inland West forests of North America. This change in forest structure has frequently been accompanied by increases in root diseases and/or an unprecedented buildup of fuels. Consequently, many forest managers are implementing plans for fuels treatments to lower the risk of severe wildfires. Impacts on root disease should be considered before selecting appropriate fuels treatments. Complex interactions exist among conifer root diseases, fuels treatments, forest structure, species composition, stand history, and other environmental factors. As forest managers prescribe fuels treatments, their success in lowering the risk of severe wildfire will depend in part on the impacts of these treatments on root disease. Root diseases are one of many factors to be considered when developing plans for fuels treatments. Choices must be made on a site-by-site basis, with knowledge of the diseases that are present. This paper provides examples of how fuels treatments may increase or reduce specific diseases and demonstrates their importance as considerations in the fuels management planning process. Several root diseases prevalent within Inland West of North America are addressed: Armillaria root disease, annosus root disease, laminated root rot, black stain root disease, Schweinitzii root and butt rot, Tomentosus root disease, Rhizina root rot, and stringy butt rot. For each disease, general information is provided on disease identification, management options, and potential effects of fuels treatments. However, many long-term studies are needed to assess effects of specific interactions among fuels treatments, root diseases, and host trees.

Jackson, WY. 
$abstract=Naturally occurring Cronartium ribicola infections were discovered in August and September, 2004 on <i>Pedicularis racemosa</i> and <i>Castilleja miniata</i> in a mixed stand of white pine blister rust-infected whitebark pine (<i>Pinus albicaulis</i>) and western white pine (<i>P. monticola</i>) in northern Idaho, at Roman Nose Lakes, ca 30 km west of Bonners Ferry. Infections were confirmed by ITS rDNA sequencing of teliospores. The ability of these species to act as host was confirmed by laboratory inoculations using aeciospores from whitebark pine. Isolates recovered from <i>P. racemosa</i> after artificial inoculations were able to infect <i>Ribes nigrum</i> and were thus not specific to an alternate host genus, and also infected western white pine seedlings. <i>Cronartium ribicola</i> was detected on additional <i>P. racemosa</i> and <i>C. miniata</i> at the site in 2005. Infections were confirmed by ITS sequencing and transfer to <i>R. nigrum</i>. In 2005, exposure of local plants to local inoculum at a second site, ca 200 km to the south, caused infections on <i>P. racemosa</i>, and laboratory inoculations implicated <i>C. rhexifolia</i> from this site as a third non-Ribes alternate host. Identification of these alternate hosts may significantly alter our concepts of blister-rust hazard and epidemiology, particularly for those upper montane to subalpine stands where the newly identified hosts are abundant. The use of these hosts by the introduced pathogen also raises the possibility that fungal adaptation may be one factor allowing change in this dynamic and evolving pathosystem.

 <b><a>The North American Long-Term Soil Productivity Experiment: Coast-to-Coast Findings From the First Decade</b></a>.
$abstract=The National Forest Management Act of 1976 mandates that a site.s
 productive capacity must be protected on federally managed lands. Monitoring the
 effects of management on a site.s productive capacity is not easy, and in 1989 a
 national program of Long-Term Soil Productivity (LTSP) research was established to
 assist National Forests toward this end. The LTSP program focuses on disturbances
 associated with timber harvest, but fi ndings apply to any activities altering vegetation
 or soil. LTSP centers on core experiments that manipulate site organic matter,
 soil porosity, and the complexity of the plant community. Results from a dozen
 decade-old LTSP installations in the Sierra Nevada and the Southern Coastal Plain
 do not indicate that site productivity has been impaired despite substantive soil
 compaction and massive removals of surface organic matter. The strongest effect of
 treatment on planted tree growth on sites governed by temperate and subtropical
 climates was the control of competing vegetation. With only one-fi fth of the LTSP installations
 reporting, fi ndings should not be generalized to other sites and climates.

$abstract=First decade findings on the impacts of organic matter removal and soil compaction are reported for the 26 oldest installations
 in the nation-wide network of long-term soil productivity sites. Complete removal of surface organic matter led to declines in
 soil C concentration to 20 cm depth and to reduced nutrient availability. The effect is attributed mainly to the loss of the forest
 floor. Soil C storage seemed undiminished, but could be explained by bulk density changes following disturbance and to
 decomposition inputs of organic C from roots remaining from the harvested forest. Biomass removal during harvesting had no
 influence on forest growth through 10 years. Soil compaction effects depended upon initial bulk density. Soils with densities
 greater than 1.4 Mg m<sup>-3</sup> resisted compaction. Density recovery was slow, particularly on soils with frigid temperature regimes.
 Forest productivity response to soil compaction depended both on soil texture and the degree of understory competition.
 Production declined on compacted clay soils, increased on sands, and generally was unaffected if an understory was absent.

 <b><a>Fuels Planning: Science Synthesis and Integration Fact Sheet No. 70 Fuels Reduction and Compaction</b></a>.
$abstract=Moving equipment and logs over the surface of forest soils causes gouges and ruts in
 the mineral soil, displaces organic matter, and can cause compaction. Compaction is
 measured by pore volume (the size spaces between soil particles), bulk density (soil
 weight per unit volume), soil aeration (the amount of air in the soil), water infiltration
 (rate of water movement into the soil), and saturated hydraulic conductivity (the ability
 of soil to transmit water). Compaction is the component of soil productivity most
 influenced by forest management, but the degree to which soils may be compacted
 depends upon initial soil bulk density. For example, low bulk density soils (such as
 volcanic ash-cap soils) are much easier to compact than those soils with a high baseline
 bulk density.

$abstract=We evaluated nutrient uptake efficiency and subsequent leaching fractions for western white pine (<i>Pinus
 monticola</i> Dougl. ex D. Don) seedlings grown with exponentially increasing or conventional (constant) fertilization in a
 greenhouse. Conventional fertilization was associated with higher leachate electrical conductivity and greater nutrient
 losses, which were more pronounced for the more mobile NO<sub>3</sub>-N than for NH<sub>4</sub>-N.
 Exponential fertilization increased
 seedling nitrogen (N) uptake efficiency (75%), which helped reduce leaching losses compared to conventional fertilization
 (50%). Although exponentially fertilized plants received 45% less fertilizer
 (20 mg N<sup>.</sup>plant<sup>-1</sup>)
 during the establishment
 and accelerated growth phases compared with conventional cohorts
 (36 mg N<sup>.</sup>plant<sup>-1</sup>),
 seedling morphological
 characteristics and nutrient status were similar at the end of greenhouse culture and after 2 years of growth in the field,
 except that exponential fertilization increased root volume after the first year and also increased ectomycorrhizal
 colonization.
 Reduction of applied fertilizer quantities and enhanced fertilizer uptake efficiency through exponential fertilization
 allows for production of high-quality seedlings while simultaneously minimizing fertilizer inputs and mitigating
 potential environmental contamination.

 <b><a>The contribution of red wood ants to soil C and N pools and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in subalpine forests</b></a>.
$abstract=Little information is available regarding red wood ant (RWA; Formica rufa group) impacts on soil carbon (C)
 and nitrogen (N) cycling in forest ecosystems.  We found that RWA mound density (number per ha) was linked to forest
 tree species composition, slope aspect, and canopy closure.  The size of RWA mounds was positively correlated with
 successional age of the stands.  C and N concentrations of mound material were significantly higher than in the
 forest floor, while C:N ratios were not. RWA mound C and N pools were found to be significantly lower
 (&lt; 990 kg C/ha and &lt; 21 kg N/ha) than in the forest floor.
 RWA mounds were "hot spots" for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
 ranging from 12.4 (mid-July) to 3.5 (early September) times higher than the adjacent forest floor.
 Overall, they contributed 0.7-2.5% to total forest soil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
 Consequently, the contribution of RWA to total forest soil C and N pools and forest CO<sub>2</sub> emission is minor and
 likely not important when calculating or modeling C and N pools or C fluxes.
 Yet, RWAs increase the spatial heterogeneity of soil C and nutrients and alter the flow of energy within their habitat.

$abstract=In northern Rocky Mountains moist forests, timber harvesting, fire exclusion, and an introduced stem disease have contributed to the decline in western white pine (<i>Pinus monticola</i> Dougl. ex D. Don) abundance (from 90% to 10% of the area). Relations between canopy openings (0.1..15 ha) and western white pine growth within different physical settings are identified. Objectives include relating western white pine seedling and sapling growth to canopy opening attributes (defined by fisheye photography), identifying western white pine competitive thresholds (occupancy, competitive advantage, free-to-grow status) in relation to opening size, and relating canopy opening attributes to overstory density descriptors. We sampled 620 western white pine plus competing trees, canopy opening characteristics, landscape position, and overstory density descriptors. Analysis included log-linear and polynomial regression. Visible sky (canopy opening) and tree age were significantly related to growth of selected pines. Radiation explained less variation in growth than canopy opening. Thresholds for western white pine to occupy a site (>23% canopy opening), gain a competitive advantage (>50% canopy opening), and achieve free-to-grow status (>92% canopy opening) over western hemlock were developed. There was a significant although weak (R2 < 0.12) relation between canopy opening and overstory density descriptors.

$abstract=Introduction of <i>Cronartium ribicola</i> into the Western United States created major disruptions in forests where fiveneedle pines were important components. In response, various control measures were implemented on two commercially important species&minus;western white pine (<i>Pinus monticola</i>) (WWP) and sugar pine (<i>P. lambertiana</i>) (SP). The USDA Forest Service developed three programs to breed for resistance: one directed at northern Rocky Mountain WWP; a second for WWP and SP in Oregon and Washington; and a third for SP in California. The Rocky Mountain program developed a resistant population composed of durable or multigenic resistance that shows no evidence to date of any R genes (i.e., genes for &quot;Major Gene Resistance&quot;). The Cascade WWP program utilizes a mixture of an R gene and multigenes. Washington populations correspond to the Rocky Mountain model, but resistance of the Oregon populations seems to be partly due to an R gene. An R gene is the threshold basis for selection of SP for the California program. Progeny that carry R genes are screened for additional resistance mechanisms to develop populations with multiple sources of resistance. These breeding programs have created large seed banks, several seed orchards, and numerous additional plantings of pedigreed material. However, new concepts for examining genotype by environment (G x E) interactions, recognition of phenotypic plasticity of hosts and pathogens and of induced defenses, and evidence of disease attenuation in the blister rust pathosystem may have important consequences for future breeding, integrated management, and ecosystem restoration efforts in five-needle pine ecosystems. Reanalysis of some old results and update of data from some long-term plantings were coupled with current knowledge of additional pathosystems to suggest an altered paradigm for white pine blister rust in which complex interactions among the pine, rust, and environmental components are the norm.

The objectives of these studies were to assess genetic and environmentally related variation in needle surface traits in rust..resistant western white pine (<i>Pinus monticola</i> Dougl.). Statistically significant differences were found in 14 needle traits (needle length and width, number of stomatal rows, number of stomata per row, total stomata per needle, adaxial surface area, stomatal density, major axes of stomata, stomatal shape, stomatal area, stomatal occlusion, epistomatal wax degradation, weight of wax per dry weight of needle, and the contact angles of water droplets) of western white pine seedlings grown from the same seed orchard source in three nurseries in northern Idaho. Waxes on needle surfaces were tubular in structure and the amount of surface wax appeared to be associated with surface wettability. In a separate study, stomata on needles from susceptible families were found to be significantly wider and larger than those from genetically resistant families and from genetically improved bulked lots from the seed orchard. Neither the percent of stomatal occlusion nor the amounts of degraded epistomatal wax were statistically different among the seed sources. Contact angles of water droplets on needles of the resistant families were significantly larger than those of the susceptible families and the seed orchard lots. Results of both the genetic study and the nursery study should be more broadly tested to determine their generality and applicability to refining rust screening procedures. Information from this study may be useful in refining protocols for selecting genotypes for tree improvement programs and/or for quantifying levels of rust resistance in selectively bred western white pine stocks. Rust screening protocols may be made more efficient if any of the traits prove to be reliable indicators of resistance.

$abstract=Growth conditions for nursery-grown western white pine seedlings have been shown to affect levels of blister rust infection (from <i>Cronartium ribicola</i>). In an experiment initially designed to test the influence of environmental conditions at two nurseries in northern Idaho on the blister rust pathosystem, western white pine seedlings of a single resistant seedlot were unintentionally held in cold storage for 6 months longer at one nursery than at the other. Inoculation of these long-stored seedlings with blister rust spores occurred at 1 month after growth resumed under nursery conditions, versus 7 months for those with shorter storage. Infection percent was nearly double and infection efficiency (infections per unit area of stomata) was 70 times greater on the seedlings with only 1 month of growth than on the seedlings with the more mature foliage. Since the seedlings had originated from the same genetic source, the overwhelming difference suggests that phenology and/or nursery regimes can strongly influence infectability of seedling needles in western white pine using artificial inoculations. If phenology is the key factor, it may help explain why infection levels have been relatively high on northern Idaho resistant selections when grown at milder locations. Furthermore, if resistance genes can be selectively activated by manipulating phenology, molecular tools that examine gene expression might be employed to enhance our understanding of environmental regulation of genes for blister rust resistance.

$abstract=The use of molecular genetics in forest pathology has greatly increased over the past 10 years.
 For the most part, molecular genetic tools were initially developed to focus on individual components
 (e.g., pathogen, host) of forest pathosystems.
 As part of broader forest ecosystem complexes, forest pathosystems involve dynamic interactions among living components
 (e.g., pathogens, hosts, antagonists, hyperparasites, endophytes, epiphytes, symbionts, etc.),
 as well as responses to their surrounding biophysical environments.
 These biotic and abiotic components shape and influence overall pathosystem functions through effects at
 the molecular level (e.g., genetic selection, gene expression, gene flow, etc.).
 By exploiting molecular tools and by broadening our studies of forest pathosystems to its various components,
 our understanding of forest pathosystems will be improved.
 These tools, including genetic markers, and more recently, genomics approaches,
 provide powerful approaches for molecular diagnosis, genetic mapping, DNA fingerprinting, and studies of phylogenetics,
 population genetics, and hybridization within forest pathosystems.
 Genetic studies of pathogens, hosts, and their interactions with biophysical environments are primary topics
 of forest pathosystem studies that employ diverse molecular genetic tools.
 This chapter provides a brief introduction of DNA-based genetic markers, examples of their application
 in forest pathosystems, and their potential integration into disease management.
 Because most recent molecular studies in forest pathology have focused solely on the pathogen,
 pathogen studies provide the predominant information for this chapter.
 However, the exciting potential to simultaneously examine the pathogen and host components is also discussed.

$abstract=The National Forest Management Act of 1976 mandates that a site's productive capacity must be protected
 on federally managed lands.
 Monitoring the effects of management on a site's productive capacity is not easy,
 and in 1989 a national program of Long-Term Soil Productivity (LTSP) research was established
 to assist National Forests toward this end.
 The LTSP program focuses on disturbances associated with timber harvest,
 but findings apply to any activities altering vegetation or soil.
 LTSP centers on core experiments that manipulate site organic matter, soil porosity,
 and the complexity of the plant community.
 Results from a dozen decade-old LTSP installations in the Sierra Nevada and the Southern Coastal Plain
 do not indicate that site productivity has been impaired despite substantive soil compaction and massive removals
 of surface organic matter.
 The strongest effect of treatment on planted tree growth on sites governed by temperate and subtropical climates
 was the control of competing vegetation.
 With only one-fifth of the LTSP installations reporting, findings should not be generalized to other sites and climates.

Proceedings of the 51st Western International Forest Disease Work Conference; 2003 August 18-22; Grants Pass, OR. Flagstaff, AZ: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station.
$abstract=Both R-gene and multigenic resistance to the introduced pathogen white pine blister rust (<i>Cronartium ribicola</i>) appear to be present in five-needle pines and Ribes of North America. R-gene resistance that confers immunity is well documented in some populations of three North American species of five-needle pines. Rust virulence factors have overcome two of these R-genes in local areas. Partial resistance in pines is due to the interaction of at least several genes and is sensitive to environment. Resistance in wild <i>Ribes</i> species may also be due to a combination of R-gene and multigenic resistance. R-gene resistance might be inferred from 1) dominant resistance in related Eurasian <i>Ribes</i> and 2) patterns of susceptibility in cross inoculations of Ribes clones with rust from different geographic sources. If R-gene resistance occurs in North American <i>Ribes</i>, additional undetected blister rust virulence factors may exist in North America. Either a &quot;cost of virulence&quot; or local adaptation might cause reduced rust aggressiveness in local populations, although local adaptation to increased aggressiveness is also conceivable. Reductions in rust aggressiveness might enhance, and increases in aggressiveness might erode the effectiveness of multigenic resistance in pines and Ribes. The future effectiveness of both R-gene and multigenic forms of resistance of both hosts may thus be dependant upon the combined effects of resistance traits artificially deployed or generated through natural selection; local or regional blister rust structure with differences in virulence, aggressiveness, and local adaptation; and diversity of environments.

$abstract=Western white pine (<i>Pinus monticola</i>) is an economically and ecologically important species from western North America that has declined over the past several decades mainly due to the introduction of blister rust (<i>Cronartium ribicola</i>) and reduced opportunities for regeneration. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) was used to assess the genetic variation in northern Idaho populations of western white pine (including rust-resistant breeding stock) in relation to blister rust. A total of 176 individuals from four populations was analyzed using 163 AFLP loci. Within populations, an average 31.3% of the loci were polymorphic (P), and expected heterozygosity (He) was 0.123. Genetic differentiation values (Gst) showed that 9.4% of detected genetic variation was explained by differences among populations. The comparison between the rust-resistant breeding stock and a corresponding sample derived from multiple natural populations produced similar values of P (35% vs. 34.4%) and He (0.134 vs. 0.131). No apparent signs of a genetic bottleneck caused by rust-resistance breeding were found. However, a comparison of two natural populations from local geographic areas showed that the population with low pressure from blister rust had higher polymorphism and heterozygosity than the population that had experienced high mortality due to blister rust: P (30.7% vs. 25.1%) and He (0.125 vs. 0.100), respectively. In addition, the population from low blister-rust pressure had twice as many unique alleles as the blister rust-selected population. The genetic distance and Dice's similarity coefficients among the four populations indicated that the local population that survived high blister-rust pressure was genetically similar to the rust-resistant breeding stock.

 (<i>Cronartium ribicola</i>) and reduced opportunities for regeneration.
 Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) was used to assess the genetic variation in northern Idaho populations 
 of western white pine (including rust-resistant breeding stock) in relation to blister rust. A total of 176 individuals 
 from four populations was analyzed using 163 AFLP loci. Within populations, an average 31.3% of the loci were 
 polymorphic (P), and expected heterozygosity (He) was 0.123. Genetic differentiation values (Gst) showed that 9.4% of 
 detected genetic variation was explained by differences among populations. The comparison between the rust-resistant 
 breeding stock and a corresponding sample derived from multiple natural populations produced similar values of P (35% 
 vs. 34.4%) and He (0.134 vs. 0.131). No apparent signs of a genetic bottleneck caused by rust-resistance breeding were 
 found. However, a comparison of two natural populations from local geographic areas showed that the population with low 
 pressure from blister rust had higher polymorphism and heterozygosity than the population that had experienced high 
 mortality due to blister rust: P (30.7% vs. 25.1%) and He (0.125 vs. 0.100), respectively. In addition, the population 
 from low blister-rust pressure had twice as many unique alleles as the blister rust-selected population. The genetic 
 distance and Dice.s similarity coefficients among the four populations indicated that the local population that 
 survived high blisterrust pressure was genetically similar to the rust-resistant breeding stock.

$abstract=White pine blister rust, <i>Cronartium ribicola,</i> has plagued the forests of North America for almost a century.
 Over past decades, eastern white pine (<i>Pinus strobus</i>) that appear to tolerate the disease have been selected 
 and incorporated into breeding programs. Seeds from <i>P. strobus</i> with putative resistance were collected from 
 Oconto River Seed Orchard, Nicolet National Forest, WI. Seedlings were grown for 5 months and artificially inoculated 
 with basidiospores of <i>C. ribicola</i> in two replicated greenhouse experiments. Needles from infected seedlings were 
 fixed, sectioned, and stained with a variety of histological reagents,and rate of mortality for the remaining seedlings 
 was monitored. The most susceptible families suffered 50% mortality in approximately half the time of the more 
 resistant families. Extensive inter- and intracellular hyphae were observed in needles from seedlings of susceptible 
 familes, whereas hyphal proliferation was restricted in needles of resistant seedlings. Needles from resistant families 
 had pronounced responses to infection. Phenolics, observed with phloroglucinol-HCl staining, were deposited around 
 infection sites where dense mycelial masses were present. Abnormal host cell growth and rapid cell death in the 
 immediate area of infection were also observed in some eastern white pine families.

$abstract=Statistically significant differences were found in 14 needle traits of western white pine (<i>Pinus monticola</i> Dougl.) seedlings grown from the same seed orchard source in the three nurseries in northern Idaho. Traits with significant variation included needle length and width, number of stomatal rows, number of stomata per row, total stomata per needle, adaxial surface area, stomatal density, major axes of stomata, stomatal shape, stomatal area, stomatal occlusion, epistomatal wax degradation, weight of wax per dry weight of needle, and the contact angles of water droplets placed on adaxial needle surfaces.Wax crystallites on needle surfaces were hollow and tubular and the amount of surface wax appeared to be associated with surface wettability. Our results may have important implications for tree improvement programs that require successful inoculation of nursery-grown seedlings with spores of <i>Cronartium ribicola</i> J. C. Fisch. ex Rabenh. to reliably screen white pines for resistance to blister rust.

$abstract=Uniparentally inherited mitochondrial (mt)DNA and chloroplast (cp)DNA microsatellites (cpSSRs) were used to examine population genetic structure and biogeographic patterns of bird-dispersed seed and wind-disseminated pollen of whitebark pine (<i>Pinus albicaulis</i> Engelm.). Sampling was conducted from 41 populations throughout the range of the species. Analyses provide evidence for an ancestral haplotype and two derived mtDNA haplotypes with distinct regional distributions. An abrupt contact zone between mtDNA haplotypes in the Cascade Range suggests postglacial biogeographic movements. Among three cpSSR loci, 42 haplotypes were detected within 28 cpSSR sample populations that were aggregated into six regions. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was used to determine the hierarchical genetic structure of cpSSRs. AMOVA and population pairwise comparisons (FST) of cpSSR, and geographical distribution of mtDNA haplotypes provide insights into historical changes in biogeography. The genetic data suggest that whitebark pine has been intimately tied to climatic change and associated glaciation, which has led to range movements facilitated by seed dispersal by Clark's nutcracker (<i>Nucifraga columbiana</i> Wilson). The two hypotheses proposed to explain the genetic structure are: (i) a northward expansion into Canada and the northern Cascades in the early Holocene; and (ii) historical gene flow between Idaho and the Oregon Cascades when more continuous habitat existed in Central Oregon during the late Pleistocene. Genetic structure and insights gained from historical seed movements provide a basis on which to develop recovery plans for a species that is at risk from multiple threats.

$abstract=Maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in whitebark pine (<i>Pinus albicaulis</i> Engelm.) were used to examine the maternal genetic structure at three hierarchical spatial scales: fine scale, coarse scale, and interpopulation. These data were used to draw inferences into Clark&acute;s nutcracker (<i>Nucifraga columbiana</i> Wilson) seedcaching flight distances. Statistical analyses of fine-scale and coarse-scale distribution of haplotypes showed no apparent signs of deviation from a random pattern. This suggests nutcrackers are effective in dispersal of seed within populations, which is consistent with data gathered on nutcracker seed-caching behavior. However, the lack of homogeneity in haplotype frequencies among populations indicates nutcrackers rarely disperse seeds across large gaps (>20 km) in subalpine habitat.

$abstract=Increasingly more research has focused on characterizing diversity within forest pathogen populations using molecular markers but few studies have characterized features of the landscape that help create or maintain this diversity. Forest diseases commonly occur in patchy distributions across natural landscapes which can be reflected in the genetic composition of the fragmented pathogen populations. This metapopulation structure has seldom been examined by forest pathologists but we believe it offers a potential means to understand the genetic ecology of pathogens in natural landscapes. Molecular markers can be used to detect, identify, and measure detailed differences among subpopulations of forest pathogens. Geographical information systems, spatial analysis and modeling, digital imagery of remotely sensed images, and other tools of landscape ecology provide the means to detect and interpret patterns associated with genotypic asymmetry. Integrating the tools and concepts of molecular biology and landscape ecology by focusing on metapopulation disease phenomena offers a way of conceptually linking molecules and ecosystems.

$abstract=Needle traits were evaluated on three groups of western white pine (<i>Pinus monticola</i> Dougl.) seedlings: four open-pollinated families that ranked high for the ..reduced needle lesion frequency. type of resistance to blister rust; four blister rust susceptible families; and two bulk lots from a seed orchard selected for blister rust resistance. No statistically significant differences were found for most traits in pairwise comparisons among the three groups. However,
needles of susceptible families had significantly wider and larger stomata (greater area) than did those of resistant families and seed orchard lots; their stomata were also rounder (smaller ratio of stomatal length to width) than those of the seed orchard lots. Needles of the resistant stocks were significantly shorter than those from seed orchard bulks. Contact angles of water droplets on adaxial needle surfaces were also significantly larger on resistant families compared with
the other genetic stocks. Results suggest the possibility of some threshold stomatal size and (or) critical stomatal shape related to infection by the blister rust fungus, <i>Cronartium ribicola</i> J.C. Fisch. ex Rabenh., and possible differences among the groups in wax chemistry and (or) surface textures, both of which may alter behavior of blister rust germ tubes and (or) be altered by blister rust infection.

$abstract=For assessments of intraspecific mating using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, two compatible basidiospore-derived isolates were selected from each of four parental basidiomata of North American Biological Species (NABS) X. The nuclear status in NABS X varied with basidiospore-derived isolates. Nuclei within basidiospore-derived isolates existed as haploids, diploids (doubled haploids), or a mixture of haploids and diploids (doubled haploids). Depending on the nuclear status of the basidiospore-derived lines of NABS X, intraspecifically mated cultures can exist as diploids or tetraploids, and possibly triploids or aneuploids under in vitro conditions. Based on previous in vitro mating studies, seven basidiospore isolates were specifically selected to assess rare, interspecific mating among <i>Armillaria cepistipes</i>, <i>A. sinapina</i>, NABS X, and NABS XI. Cultures from basidiospore-derived isolates were paired to produce four interspecifically paired cultures, and matings were assessed using flow cytometry and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses. Based on flow cytometric analysis, the <i>A. cepistipes</i> isolate exhibited compatibility with a NABS X isolate, and the <i>A. sinapina</i> isolate exhibited compatibility with a NABS X isolate, and the <i>A. sinapina</i> isolates were individually compatible with isolates of NABS X and NABS XI. Mean fluorescence intensities of <i>A. cepistipes</i> <sup>&chi;</sup> NABS X, <i>A. sinapina</i> <sup>&chi;</sup> NABS X, and <i>A. sinapina</i> <sup>&chi;</sup> NABS XI mated cultures revealed a triploid or tetraploid nuclear status compared to the haploid or diploid (doubled haploid) nuclear status of initial basidiospore-derived isolates. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and RFLP of the intergenic spacer (IGS) region generated banding patterns for basidiospore-derived isolates and mated cultures. Four species-specific RFLP banding patterns were observed in basidiospore-derived isolates of <i>A. cepistipes</i>, <i>A. sinapina</i>, NABS X, and NABS XI. PCR-RFLP analysis showed combined banding patterns from mated cultures. Flow cytometry and PCR-RFLP analysis are effective tools to assess matings of <i>Armillaria</i> species.

$abstract=In the north central United States, leaf rust caused by <i>Melampsora medusae</i> is a major disease problem on <i>Populus deltoides</i>. In this study we identified molecular markers linked to a <i>M. medusae</i> resistance locus (<i>Lrd</i>1) that was segregating 1:1 within an intraspecific <i>P. deltoides</i> family (C9425DD).

Using bulked segregant analysis we identified two random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers (OPG10<sub>340</sub> and OPZ19<sub>1800</sub>) that are linked to <i>Lrd</i>1. Based on segregation in a total of 116 progeny, the genetic distances between OPG10<sub>340</sub> and OPZ19<sub>1800</sub> and the resistance locus were estimated as 2.6 and 7.4 Haldane centimorgans (cM), respectively. Multipoint linkage analyses strongly suggest the most likely order for these loci is <i>Lrd</i>1, OPG10<sub>340</sub>, and OPZ19<sub>1800</sub>.

$abstract=Fire, competition for light and water, and native forest pests have interacted for millennia in western 
 forests to produce a countryside dominated by seral species of conifers. These conifer-dominated ecosystems exist in 
 six kinds of biotic communities. We divided one of these communities, the Rocky Mountain Montane Conifer Forest, into 
 31 subseries based on the ability of shrubs and forbs to predict soil-moisture regimes and conifers to predict 
 soil-temperature regimes. This classification facilitated correlation of fire regimes, ecophysiological theory, and 
 genetic theory to create an analytical framework for assessing ecological change. Using this tool we assessed likely 
 ecologic impacts resulting from the introduction of white pine blister rust. Because large-scale disturbance, fire and 
 cutting, have been greatly reduced in western ecosystems most heavily impacted by blister rust, their restoration will 
 require large-scale replacement of the role of fire. Reduced net primary productivity is a natural consequence of 
 forest succession. As forests age, photosynthetic and water use efficiencies decline, while decomposition in the 
 standing biomass increases. Most forests reach a point where carbon release exceeds carbon sequestration the pathologic 
 rotation. Effective management of these forces will require exact knowledge, ecosystem by ecosystem, of resource 
 availability and system processing efficiencies. Using the classification presented, theories of competition, 
 ecophysiology, genetics and pest behavior can be combined to examine site-specific ecosystem behavior. Finally, a 
 preliminary plan to achieve process sustainability is presented.

$abstract=<i>Armillaria</i> species cause root and butt rots of woody plants throughout the world.
 Molecular genetic techniques were used to augment species identification, determine nuclear status,
 address issues of gene flow, and analyze mating of <i>Armillaria</i> isolates.<br><br>
 Twenty-six isolates representing nine North American <i>Armillaria</i> species were investigated with flow cytometry
 and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses to determine their genome size and RFLP profile.
 Putatively diploid isolates of <i>A. ostoyae</i>, <i>A. gemina</i>, <i>A. calvescens</i>, <i>A. sinapina</i>,
 <i>A. mellea</i>, <i>A. gallica</i>, <i>A. nabsnona</i>, North American Biological Species (NABS) X, and
 NABS XI were analyzed.
 Genome sizes of <i>Armillaria</i> species ranged from 0.11&nbsp;pg to 0.17&nbsp;pg per diploid nucleus,
 depending on species.
 <i>A. ostoyae</i>, <i>A. gemina</i>, and <i>A. mellea</i> possessed relatively small genome sizes
 (0.11 pg-0.12 pg per diploid nucleus), whereas <i>A. gallica</i> possessed a relatively large genome size
 (0.17 pg per diploid nucleus).
 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and RFLP of the intergenic spacer region-1 (IGS-1) generated characteristic banding patterns
 for nine <i>Armillaria</i> species.<br><br>
 Thirty-five <i>Armillaria</i> isolates were collected from northern Idaho and eleven isolates were collected from
 northern Nebraska.
 Based on RFLP patterns of northern Idaho isolates, fifteen were identified as <i>A. ostoyae</i>, fourteen were identified
 as NABS X, and six were identified as <i>A. sinapina</i> or <i>A. calvescens</i>.
 All isolates from northern Nebraska were identified as <i>A. gallica</i>.
 Genome sizes of 46 <i>Armillaria</i> isolates ranged from 0.11 pg to 0.18 pg per diploid nucleus, depending on species.
 <br><br>
 For assessments of intraspecific mating using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy,
 two compatible basidiospore-derived isolates were selected from each of four parental basidiomata of NABS X.
 Seven basidiospore isolates were specifically selected to assess rare, interspecific mating among <i>A. cepistipes</i>,
 <i>A. sinapina</i>, NABS X, and NABS XI.
 Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopic analyses provided evidence of intraspecific mating within NABS X and
 interspecific mating among <i>A. cepistipes</i>, <i>A. sinapina</i>, NABS X, and NABS XI isolates.
 In addition, PCR-RFLP analysis of IGS-1 showed combined banding patterns from interspecifically mated cultures.

 <a><i>The effects of forest management on erosion and soil productivity,</i></a>
 chapter 12 of <b>Soil Quality and Soil Erosion;</b> CRC Press, Soil and Water Conservation Society, Ankeny, Iowa
$abstract=In forest conditions, surface runoff and soil erosion are generally low because of the surface litter cover. 
 Hydraulic conductivities are in excess of 15 mm/hr, and erosion rates are generally less than 0.1 mg ha<sup>-1</sup>.
 If the litter layer is disturbed, then runoff and erosion rates can increase by several magnitudes.
 Disturbances can be natural, such as wildfire, or human induced, such as harvesting or prescription burning for 
 ecosystem management, where conductivities can drop to under 5 mm/hr and erosion rates can exceed 20 mg ha<sup>-1</sup>.
 Roads adversely impact forest soil productivity by directly reducing the productive area and by causing the greatest 
 amount of soil erosion. Conductivities of roads have been measured to be less than 1 mm/hr, and erosion can be in 
 excess of 100 mg ha<sup>-1</sup>. Harvesting activities reduce surface cover, and compact the soil, leading to 
 increased runoff and erosion. Erosion generally decreases productivity of forests by decreasing the available soil 
 water for forest growth and through loss of nutrients in eroded sediment. The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) 
 model is shown to be a useful tool in predicting the erosion impacts of different levels of vegetation removal at 
 harvest and different levels of compaction. WEPP predicted that the nutrients lost through the organic matter in 
 sediments are significant, but less than nutrient loss through tree removal. Work is ongoing to collect long-term site 
 productivity data from numerous sites to aid in the analysis of forest management on soil erosion and site productivity.

$abstract=Between 1950 and 1970, western white pine (<i>Pinus monticola</i>) resistant to the blister rust fungus
 (<i>Cronartium ribicola</i>) were bred for the northern Rocky Mountains of the western United States.
 F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> seedlings were selected using a program of full-sib crossing with intense artificial inoculation.
 Since selected resistance was hypothesized to be vertical, long-term exposure to racially stable rust was predicted
 to yield 33% canker-free trees for F<sub>1</sub> and 66% for F<sub>2</sub>.
 Epidemics observed in an experimental plantation established in 1970 were compared to test this hypothesis.
 Poor early survival, unevenly distributed thoughout the plantation, negated the original complete block design.
 Subsequently, data were stratified into two site-types, one characterized by a hot site-preparation burn (brush)
 and the other by a normal burn (forest).
 Rust incidence (proportion cankered) was measured on cohorts of about 100 trees at exposure times of 2, 4, 6, 12, and 26 years.
 The nonlinear monomolecular model of disease progress was used to analyze rust incidence and absolute infection rate.
 Rust incidence in epidemics of control stock and one resistant stock attained unity, indicating that K
 (incidence asymptote parameter) should equal one.
 Incidence data were bootstrapped 20x to generate confidence limits.
 Of six epidemics (two sites x three stocks), only F<sub>1</sub>&minus;forest and F<sub>2</sub>&minus;brush mean infection
 rates were <em>not</em> significantly different.
 The finding that brush to forest infection rates were nearly constant over stocks indicated that environmental factors
 other than sporidial density influenced the infection rate for all stocks.
 Finally, all combinations of resistant stock and site exceeded expected incidence thresholds after 26 years.
 Was racial variation of the rust responsible, or did selection focus on horizontal resistance?

$title=Impacts of soil compaction and tree stump removal on soil properties and outplanted seedlings in northern Idaho, USA
$year=1998
$authors=Page-Dumroese, Harvey, Jurgensen
$citationt=Page-Dumroese, D.S.; Harvey, A. E.; Jurgensen, M. F.; Amaranthus, M. P. 1998. <a><i>Impacts of soil compaction and tree stump removal on soil properties and outplanted seedlings in northern Idaho, USA,</i></a> <b>Can. J. Soil Sci.</b> 78: 29--34.
$abstract=Intensive timber harvesting and site preparation are becoming more common as demand for timber-based products 
 increases. On some harvested sites in the western United States of America and Canada, stump removal is used to 
 ameliorate root disease problems. Soil compaction and nutrient loss could become a problem on some sites after 
 harvesting, site preparation, or stump removal. In a non-replicated, randomized block experiment, two levels of soil 
 compaction (none and severe) and a stump extraction treatment were examined on an ash-cap soil in northern Idaho. These 
 treatments were planted with Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> var. <i>glauca</i> 
 [Beissn.] Franco) and western white pine (<i>Pinus monticola</i> Dougl. ex D. Don) seedlings. Soil 
 compaction increased post-harvest bulk density 15&#8211;20% to a depth of 30 cm. Stump removal decreased surface soil 
 bulk density, but it increased at the 30- to 45-cm depth to levels equal to the soil compaction treatment. One year 
 after outplanting, seedling top weights were similar among treatments, but root volume was significantly reduced in the 
 soil compaction treatment. Soil compaction and stump removal treatments also reduced the numbers and morphological 
 types of ectomycorrhizae and non-ectomycorrhizal short roots on Douglas-fir. Western white pine seedlings had reduced 
 numbers of non-ectomycorrhizal short roots in the same treatments. Three years after outplanting, stump removal 
 resulted in smaller root collar diameters and less total N content for both seedling species. Severe site disturbance, 
 with associated soil compaction and mixing, may decrease productivity of ash-cap sites by reducing pore space and root 
 and ectomycorrhizal activity. Managers must weigh short-term benefits of intensive site disturbance with possible 
 long-term loss of soil productivity.</p>

$abstract=Shoot multiplication using seedling materials was achieved by subculture on Murashige and Skoog salts with Gamborg's B5 vitamins (MSB5) medium containing a combination of 5 &mu;M 6-benzyladenine (BA), 5 &mu;M thidiazuron (TDZ), and 1 &mu;M indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) with three green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) clones, SD1009 (South Dakota origin), SD2002 (South Dakota origin), and KA2018 (Kansas origin). Shoots were rooted using in vitro and ex vitro methods. For in vitro rooting studies, elongated shoots were transferred to rooting plugs supplied with liquid MSB5 medium containing a 3.3 factorial arrangement of two different auxins, &alpha;-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and IBA, at three concentrations (0, 5, and 10 &mu;M). The most effective treatment for in vitro root number, root length, and shoot height was 5 &mu;M IBA. The three clones also were tested for ex vitro rooting using a quick dip in 1 mM NAA, 1 mM IBA, or control (no auxin). The maximal ex vitro rooting response occurred when shoot explants of the three clones were dipped in 1 mM IBA. Significant clonal differences were noted in response to in vitro and ex vitro rooting treatments. Rooted plantlets were acclimated to the greenhouse.

$abstract=<i>Juniperus</i> trees were examined in a plantation located in Horning State Farm, near Plattsmouth in eastern Nebraska, USA. Trees were grown from seeds collected from 131 open pollinated families within 39 seed-zones in eastern redcedar (<i>J. virginiana</i> L.) and 25 open-pollinated families within 14 seedzones in Rocky Mountain juniper (<i>J. scopulorum</i> SARG.) from their native ranges in the Great Plains of USA. The plantation was established in spring 1980 to examine genetic variation among genotypes for resistance to Cercospora blight caused by <i>Pseudocerospora juniperi</i> (ELLIS and EVERH.) SUTTON and HODGES, <i>comb. nov.</i> (formerly <i>Cercospora sequoiae</i> var. <i>juniperi</i>), a major disease that threatens juniper survival east of the Rocky Mountains. All plantation plots were inoculated with <i>P. juniperi</i> in 1982, 1984, 1985, and 1986. Infection was scored in 1987. Kabatina tip blight caused by <i>Kabatina juniperi</i> SCHNEIDER and V. ARX, which occurred naturally, was scored also. Between the two juniper species, we found significant differences in survival and resistance to both diseases (P<0.05). All traits differed among seed-zones and among families within seed-zones of eastern redcedar (P<0.01). With Rocky Mountain juniper, variation was significant among seed-zones for survival (P<0.01), and among families within seed-zones for Cercospora blight and survival in 1994 (P<0.05). Heritabilities and genetic correlations were high for both disease resistance traits in eastern redcedar. Geographic patterns of genetic variation were identified; seed sources from southeastern collection sites of lower elevations tended to exhibit higher resistance to both diseases than seed sources from northwestern collection sites of higher elevations. Disease resistance traits were not correlated with height growth ( r <0.20, P>0.05) for either species. The relationship between Cercospora blight resistance and survival in 1994 was significant (r = 0.59, P<0.05). Results indicate that Cercospora blight resistance in eastern redcedar can be improved by selecting resistant seed sources or families for direct reforestation programs or future breeding programs in eastern Nebraska. Additionally, Kabatina tip blight levels were lower on genotypes selected for resistance to Cercospora blight. Moreover, because resistance to Cercospora and Kabatina blights can be selected independently of height growth and survival, there is apparently no need to sacrifice growth and survival characteristics.

$abstract=A hybrid poplar clone, &quot;Ogy&quot; (<i>Populus</i> x <i>euramericana</i>), was transformed with the potato proteinase inhibitor II (PI II) gene (<i>pin2</i>) to test the importance of serine proteinases in host-pathogen and host-insect interactions. The gene product PI II is a specific inhibitor of trypsin and chymotrypsin. Transformants were obtained using an <i>Agrobacterium</i> binary vector system with a disarmed Ti plasmid (EHA 101) and plasmid pRT104 containing <i>pin2</i> regulated by a CaMV 35S promoter and a selectable gene-encoding neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPT II). Putative transformed shoots from co-cultured leaves were selected using three different kanamycin toxicity assays. Ten plantlets, selected from 431 shoots derived from co-culture, were selected for nucleic acid and protein analysis. DNA analysis (Southern blots and PCR) and protein gel blots (Western blots) confirmed <i>pin2</i> integration and expression in transformant number TR5.

$title=Impacts of Timber Harvesting on Soil Organic Matter, Nitrogen, Productivity, and Health of Inland Northwest Forests
$year=1997

 <b><a>Impacts of Timber Harvesting on Soil Organic Matter, Nitrogen, Productivity, and Health of Inland Northwest Forests.</a></b>
$abstract=Soil organic components are important factors in the health and productivity of Inland Northwest forests. 
 Timber harvesting and extensive site preparation (piling, windrowing, or scalping) reduces the amount of surface 
 organic material (woody residues and forest floor layers) over large areas. Some wildfires and severe prescribed burns 
 can have similar consequences. Such organic matter reductions can have important implications for soil chemical, 
 biological and physical properties. <br> A number of studies have linked substantial reduction in mycorrhizae 
 development and tree growth to high levels of soil disturbance, or removal of organic horizons. Timber harvesting also 
 removes a large percentage of coarse woody debris, which has unknown ramifications on soil productivity. Current woody 
 residue guidelines in this region recommend leaving &lt;10 to 125 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> on site to replace woody materials 
 lost during harvesting operations. Large amounts of soil nitrogen (&gt;500 kg ha.<sup>-1</sup>) can also be lost from 
 timber harvesting and site preparation, especially when using prescribed fire. The time required to replace this lost 
 nitrogen may range from &lt;10 to &gt;275 years, and depends on the severity of site treatments, presence or absence of 
 nitrogen-fixing plants, and amounts of atmospheric deposition. <br> Maintaining adequate amounts of organic matter on 
 some forest sites in the Inland Northwest may temporarily increase the risk of wildfire or favor the activity of 
 certain insects or disease fungi. However, carefully planned prescribed burns and mechanical site preparation can be 
 practiced on most sites with relatively low impacts on soil organic levels, while accomplishing the important forest 
 management objectives of fuel reduction, seedbed preparation, and reducing competing vegetation. Organic matter 
 management will be the most difficult on very dry sites, with their historically low soil organic and nitrogen content, 
 and high fire potential. The maintenance of adequate soil organic matter levels is critical for sustaining forest 
 health and productivity under the variable moisture and temperature conditions of this region. Thus, soil organic 
 components will become more important in the future as ecosystem management systems are developed for western forests.

 United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, Research Paper, PNW-RP-494.
$abstract=Three levels of organic matter removal (bole only; bole and crowns; and bole, crowns, and forest floor) and 
 three levels of mechanical soil compaction (no compaction, moderate compaction, and severe soil compaction) were 
 studied as they influence Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> var. <i>glauca</i> 
 (Beissn.) Franco) and western white pine (<i>Pinus monticola</i> Dougl. ex D. Don) seedlings following 
 outplanting. Moderate and severe soil compaction significantly reduced nonmycorrhizal root tip abundance on both 
 Douglas-fir and western white pine seedlings (p&le;0.05). Ectomycorrhizal root tip abundance was significantly reduced 
 on Douglas-fir seedlings in severely compacted areas with bole and crowns and bole, crowns, and forest floor removed. 
 Ectomycorrhizal diversity also was significantly reduced on Douglas-fir seedlings in all severely compacted areas.

 <b><a>Insect infestations and incidence of western gall rust among ponderosa pine sources grown in the central Great Plains</a>.</b>
 <b>Environmental Entomology</b> 25:611-617.
$abstract=Six seed sources in two 22-yr-old ponderosa pine, <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> variety <i>scopulorum</i> Engelmann, provenance plantings in Hastings, NE, and Alliance, NE, were evaluated for abundance of <i>Rhyacionia bushnelli</i>, <i>Retinia metallica</i>, <i>Dioryctria</i> spp., and <i>Peridermium harknessii</i>. The 6 sources were selected for this study based on superior growth and previous susceptibility or nonsusceptibility to the aforementioned insects and pathogen. Infestation levels per tree and per branch, and proportion of infested tips were used to evaluate the influence of source on pest abundance. Abundance of the pests varied with planting. In both plantings, <i>R. bushnelli</i> abundance was lower on the 3 taller sources (720, 721, 757) than on the 3 shorter sources (764, 833, 835) similar to what was observed previously. The abundance of current and old <i>R. metallica</i> was low in both plantings and did not vary with source. At the Alliance planting, taller sources had more total <i>Dioryctria</i> spp. than shorter sources. <i>P. harknessii</i> galls were present on every sampled tree in the Hastings planting and occurred only on a few trees sampled at Alliance, but no source differences were detected. Abundance of <i>R. bushnelli</i> was positively correlated with previous-year <i>R. metallica</i> at Alliance and current-year <i>R. metallica</i> at Alliance and negatively correlated with <i>P. harknessii</i> abundance at Hastings. Interactions among environmental, host, and insect factors probably account for these correlations.

$abstract=A <i>Pythium ultimum</i>-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb E5) recognized a 46-kDa protein band from <i>P. ultimum</i> in Western blots, but did not react with any protein from five other Pythium spp. Loss of MAb E5 reactivity to the antigen following treatment of the antigen with trifluoromethane sulfonic acid, periodate, or laminarinase indicated that the antigen was a glycoprotein with a carbohydrate epitope containing &beta;-1,3 linkages. The antigen was thermostable. MAb E5 reactivity to mycelia and specific structures was affected by fungal age. The E5 antigen content in <i>P. ultimum</i> mycelia cultured in Czapek-Dox broth increased during the first 3 days, but subsequently declined despite continuing fungal growth. The antigen was detected in all young <i>P. ultimum</i> structures by immunofluorescence, but fluorescence decreased or disappeared as the structures matured or became dormant. Fluorescence reappeared upon transferring aged structures to fresh nutrient solution. Reactivity of MAb E5 to the fungus also was influenced by culture nutrients. <i>P. ultimum</i> cultured in media containing different seed exudates or different sugars varied in E5 antigen content. <i>P. ultimum</i> could not be detected in infected sugar beet and common bean hypocotyls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The fungus was detected in infected sugar beet hypocotyls by Western blot, but not in infected bean tissue.

$abstract=Ectomycorrhizal colonization of conifer species associated with a cedar-hemlock (<i>Thuja plicata</i>
 Donn ex D. Don and <i>Tsuga heterophylla</i> [Raf.] Sarg.) forest in northern Idaho,
 is directly influenced by the quantity and type of soil organic matter.
 Soil organic horizons, particularly soil wood, represent the substrate for a majority of the ectomycorrhizal activity.
 The amount of large downed woody residue ranges from 38 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> to 202 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>.
 Residues play an important role in nutrient cycling and moisture storage capacity.
 Surface mineral horizons contain significant quantities of volcanic ash and organic matter,
 which also helps cycle nitrogen and maintain moisture.
 The critical nature of soil organics in this ecosystem represents hazards, and opportunities for forest managers.
 With careful management, these soils can be protected, or even improved.
 Recognition of the importance of organic and ash horizons also provides a basis for restoring damaged soils,
 soils that are impossible to restore, or for soils requiring long restoration periods.

 <b>Forest Ecology and Management</b> 138 (2000): 445-462
$abstract=Soil quality standards and guidelines of the USDA Forest Service were some of the first in the world to be 
 developed to evaluate changes in forest soil productivity and sustainability after harvesting and site preparation. 
 International and national development of criteria and indicators for maintenance of soil productivity make it 
 imperative to have adequate threshold variables within the USDA Forest Service. In the Pacific Northwest, soils range 
 from fine-textured Andisols to coarse-textured skeletal Inceptisols. Forest types encompass the highly productive 
 coastal rain forest to marginally productive, dry, cold sites in the interior mountains. Constant values to detect 
 detrimental disturbances within the soil quality guidelines are routinely applied across diverse soils and timber types 
 and include diagnostic criteria for evaluating management-caused changes to soil productivity. Research information 
 from short- or long-term research studies supporting the applicability of disturbance criteria is often lacking, or is 
 available from a limited number of sites which have relatively narrow climatic and soil ranges. In this paper we 
 calculated changes in soil carbon, nitrogen, erosion, and cation exchange capacity using threshold variables from the 
 Regional USDA Forest Service Soil Guidelines to assess their applicability across diverse landscapes. Soils were 
 selected from a climatic and elevational gradient in the Pacific Northwest. Application of selected USDA Forest Service 
 standards indicate that blanket threshold variables applied over disparate soils do not adequately account for nutrient 
 distribution within the profile or forest floor depth. These types of guidelines should be continually refined to 
 reflect pre-disturbance conditions and site-specific information.

$abstract=Timber harvesting and mechanical site preparation can reduce site productivity if they excessively disturb or 
 compact the soil. Volcanic ash-influenced soils with low undisturbed bulk densities and rock content are particularly 
 susceptible. This study evaluates the effects of harvesting and site preparation on changes in the bulk density of 
 ash-influenced forest soils in northern Idaho. Three different levels of surface organic matter were studied. Soil 
 samples were taken before and after harvesting to determine the extent and depth of compaction. Soil bulk densities 
 increased significantly after extensive compaction from site preparation, especially when little logging slash and 
 surface organic matter were left on the soil surface. As site preparation intensity increased, bulk density increased 
 significantly at greater depths in the soil profile. Although ash-influenced soils have naturally low bulk densities, 
 they can easily be compacted to levels that limit growth. This experimental site has been designated as part of the 
 Forest Service's national long-term site productivity study into the impacts of organic matter depletion and soil 
 compaction on stand development.

 proteinase inhibitor (<i>pin2</i>) &minus; chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) chimeric gene linked to a
 nopaline synthase (nos) &minus; neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPT II) selectable marker gene.
 The <i>Populusalba</i> <sup>&chi;</sup> <i>Populusgrandidentata</i> Hansen clone was transformed by means of
 leaf cocultivation with <i>Agrobacteriumtumefaciens</i> strain A281 containing a binary vector.
 Shoots were regenerated and rooted on selective medium containing kanamycin sulfate.
 Subsequently, plants were established in soil for greenhouse and field growth.
 NPT II activity from the nos &minus; NPT II selectable marker gene was observed in leaf extracts,
 thereby confirming expression of the transferred selectable marker gene in poplar.
 Southern hybridization confirmed the incorporation of a single copy of the <i>pin2</i>&minus;CAT construction into the
 genome of the transformed hybrid poplars.
 Northern analysis of transgenic poplar leaves demonstrated that the potato <i>pin2</i>&minus;CAT gene construction
 also was inducible in this woody dicotyledon.
 Thus, the wound-inducible promoter from an herbaceous dicot functions in a distinct family of woody dicots.

$abstract=Regeneration of Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> var. <i>glauca</i> [Beissn.] Franco) usually 
 depends on site manipulation and planting to achieve fully stocked stands. Seed that produces superior survival and 
 early growth is a key factor in supplying quality Douglas-fir wood to meet an increased demand for future timber-based 
 products. Planting success in the Intermountain West is hampered by low soil moisture and nutrient stress (Duryea and 
 Lavender 1982). On sites where large amounts of top-soil and organic matter have been removed during the harvest/site 
 preparation sequence, initial tree growth and survival is reduced and continues to be depressed throughout the rotation 
 (Glass 1976; Pehl and Bailey 1978). Douglas-fir can be considered an especially sensitive species in this regard 
 (Graham and others 1989). <br> Soil, wood, litter, duff, and humus govern the quality of many forest sites in the 
 Inland Northwest because they are an important source of moisture-holding capacity and nutrient storage, which are 
 essential for seedling survival (Harvey and others 1976). Organic matter also provides a favorable microsite for many 
 microbes in the rhizosphere. These microbes can be beneficial or deleterious to tree survival and growth (Harvey 1982).

$abstract=Significant amounts of soil nitrogen (N) are lost from the soil during timber harvesting and related 
 activities. Symbiotic N-fixing plants have the potential to replace much of these N losses on many sites in the Inland 
 Northwest, especially during early stand development. However, many of these plants are site specific and can cause 
 competition problems during stand establishment. Much more information is needed on the successional roles of N-fixing 
 plants in Inland Northwest forests. Nonsymbiotic N fixation in forest soils of this region is low, but is an important 
 source of N on sites where N-fixing plants are lacking or of low frequency. Appreciable amounts of N can be added to 
 the soil by nonsymbiotic N fixation over long stand rotation ages typical for this region. Silvicultural systems need 
 to be developed that minimize soil N losses and maintain the biological N fixation potential of the site.

$abstract=Forest management is at a critical juncture. Concepts and strategies for managing forests to produce goods 
 and services, yet maintain functioning visually pleasing forests, are being debated, developed, and implemented. A 
 well-designed and implemented silvicultural system is basic to good forest management. Means of protecting soil and all 
 factors affecting soil properties must be integrated into silvicultural systems. Inappropriate silvicultural techniques 
 can degrade forest productivity especially by compacting, displacing, or destroying soil surface layers rich in organic 
 matter. Because both short- and long-term productivity can be influenced by changes in these layers, we make several 
 recommendations on how to protect soil when developing prescriptions for any silvicultural system.

 Res. Note INT-371. Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Intermountain Research Station. 5&nbsp;p.
$abstract=Over all plots (disturbed and pristine), incidence of pathogenic <i>Armillaria</i> showed a strong tendency to
 decrease as habitat type productivity increased.
 This trend gave rise to a clear separation of plots by climax series.
 The relatively less productive subalpine fir and Douglas-fir series exhibited high incidence of root disease and the
 relatively more productive grand fir, western redcedar, and western hemlock series significantly less.
 Within these productivity groups, other patterns emerged.
 Disturbance appeared to be related to a dramatic increase in incidence of pathogenicity, but not occurrence,
 within the high-productivity grouping of communities.
 Also, the ability of disturbance to elicit pathogenicity seemed to decline as site productivity increased.
 Conversely, the pristine plots within the low-productivity series exhibited high incidence of the pathogen
 in a pathogenic state.
 This condition seemed to be related to a community structure characteristic of transition between cold-dry to
 cool-moist and warm-dry to warm-moist.
 Predicting risk of <i>Armillaria</i>-caused mortality, occurrence of pathogenic species and clones of <i>Armillaria</i>,
 a possible role for host stress in expression of pathogenicity by <i>Armillaria</i>, and risk rating of host species are
 discussed.

 <b><a>Occurrence of <i>Armillaria</i> spp. in forests of the northern Rocky Mountains</a>.</b>
 Res. Pap. INT-381. Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Intermountain Research Station. 7&nbsp;p.
$abstract=<p>The distribution of <i>Armillaria</i> spp. on National Forests of the Northern Rocky Mountains was investigated through random installation and inspection of 0.04&minus;ha plots. Woody plant species living and dead were searched for fans, rot, or rhizomorphs typical of <i>Armillaria</i> spp., which were then verified through laboratory cultures. Armillaria occurrence was found to be related to a root rot risk&minus;rating system based on the current system for classifying vegetational communities. <i>Armillaria</i> spp. were absent from the warm and dry juniper and pinegrass habitat types (h.t.&acute;s) of the Douglas-fir series, the cold and dry beargrass and grouse whortleberry h.t.&acute;s of the subalpine fire series, the cold and wet twisted stalk h.t.&acute;s of the subalpine fir series, and the frost&minus;pocket dwarf huckleberry h.t.&acute;s of both Douglas&minus;fir and subalpine fir series</p><p>Data linking <i>Armillaria</i> spp. to host and ecological function (epiphyte, saprophyte, or pathogen) were also recorded. These data will be reported in future papers after more reliable methods have been developed for assigning isolates to thier correct taxonomic positions. We expect to find that certain <i>Armillaria</i> spp. are pathogenic on conifers in general or maybe even on specific conifer species, and that their geographic distribution is related to habitat type.</p>
