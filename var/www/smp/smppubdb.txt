$abstract=The use of molecular genetics in forest pathology has greatly increased over the past 10 years. For the most part, molecular genetic tools were initially developed to focus on individual components (e.g., pathogen, host) of forest pathosystems. As part of broader forest ecosystem complexes, forest pathosystems involve dynamic interactions among living components (e.g., pathogens, hosts, antagonists, hyperparasites, endophytes, epiphytes, symbionts, etc.), as well as responses to their surrounding biophysical environments. These biotic and abiotic components shape and influence overall pathosystem functions through effects at the molecular level (e.g., genetic selection, gene expression, gene flow, etc.). By exploiting molecular tools and by broadening our studies of forest pathosystems to its various components, our understanding of forest pathosystems will be improved. These tools, including genetic markers, and more recently, genomics approaches, provide powerful approaches for molecular diagnosis, genetic mapping, DNA fingerprinting, and studies of phylogenetics, population genetics, and hybridization within forest pathosystems. Genetic studies of pathogens, hosts, and their interactions with biophysical environments are primary topics of forest pathosystem studies that employ diverse molecular genetic tools. This chapter provides a brief introduction of DNA-based genetic markers, examples of their application in forest pathosystems, and their potential integration into disease management. Because most recent molecular studies in forest pathology have focused solely on the pathogen, pathogen studies provide the predominant information for this chapter. However, the exciting potential to simultaneously examine the pathogen and host components is also discussed.

$abstract=The fungal community inhabiting large woody roots of healthy conifers has not been well
documented. To provide more information about such communities, a survey was conducted using
increment cores from the woody roots of symptomless Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) growing in dry forests on the eastern slope of the Cascade
Mountains in Washington state, USA. Fungal isolates were cultured on standard media, and then were
identified using a combination of molecular and morphological methods. Fungal genera and species
identified in this study will provide baseline data for future surveys of fungal endophytes. Examination
of internal transcribed spacer (ITS1 and ITS2) and 5.8S rDNA sequences and morphology of cultured
fungi identified 27 fungal genera. Two groups predominated: Byssochlamys nivea Westling (20.4% of
isolations) and Umbelopsis species (10.4% of isolations). This is the first report of B. nivea within large
woody roots of conifers. Both taxa have been previously identified as potential biological control
agents. Although some trends were noted, this study found no significant evidence of host species or
plant association effects on total recovery of fungal endophytes or recovery of specific fungal taxa.

 such as wood decay (nutrient recycling); root diseases and their biological control; and endophytic, epiphytic, and
 mycorrhizal symbioses.
 However, few studies have characterized the diversity and the spatial and temporal distribution of woody

$abstract=The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of rDNA and intervening 5.8S rRNA for Erysiphe (Sect. Microsphaera) pulchra and Phyllactinia guttata were amplified using standard PCR protocols and universal primer pairs, ITS1 and ITS4. PCR products for ITS were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel and sequenced. The size of the amplified ITS products (c. 650 bp) were not sufficiently different to allow reliable differentiation of E. pulchra and P. guttata; however, their sequences were distinct. Specific primers for E. pulchra and P. guttata were developed and evaluated for use as diagnostic tools. The diagnostic band size from E. pulchra specific primer pair was 568 bp while the P. guttata band was 597 bp; the two primer pairs were highly specific to E.  pulchra and P. guttata. Comparison of ITS sequences with information in the Genbank showed a very close similarity between sequences of E. pulchra isolates from Cornus florida in the USA and isolates collected on C. kousa in Japan. BLAST analysis of the sequence of the 650-bp band from P. guttata -revealed a close alignment with sequences of  P. moricola (92%), P. kakicola (94%), and P. fraxini (92%); however, species-specific primers can distinguish P. guttata from it’s closely related species. The sequence of P. guttata in C. florida had also a 98% identity with P. guttata in Calycanthus occidentalis and 94% identity with P. guttata in Corylus cornuta.

$abstract=White pine blister rust, <i>Cronartium ribicola,</i>
 has plagued the forests of North America for almost a century.
 Over past decades, eastern white pine (<i>Pinus strobus</i>)
 that appear to tolerate the disease have been selected and incorporated
 into breeding programs.
 Seeds from <i>P. strobus</i> with putative resistance were collected from
 Oconto River Seed Orchard, Nicolet National Forest, WI.
 Seedlings were grown for 5 months and artificially inoculated with
 basidiospores of <i>C. ribicola</i> in two replicated greenhouse experiments.
 Needles from infected seedlings were fixed, sectioned, and stained with a
 variety of histological reagents,and rate of mortality for the remaining
 seedlings was monitored.
 The most susceptible families suffered 50% mortality in approximately
 half the time of the more resistant families.
 Extensive inter- and intracellular hyphae were observed in needles from seedlings
 of susceptible familes, whereas hyphal proliferation was restricted in needles
 of resistant seedlings.
 Needles from resistant families had pronounced responses to infection.
 Phenolics, observed with phloroglucinol-HCl staining, were deposited around
 infection sites where dense mycelial masses were present.
 Abnormal host cell growth and rapid cell death in the immediate area of
 infection were also observed in some eastern white pine families.

$abstract=Maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in whitebark pine
 (<i>Pinus albicaulis</i> Engelm.) were used to examine the maternal genetic
 structure at three hierarchical spatial scales: fine scale, coarse scale, and
 inter-population.
 These data were used to draw inferences into Clark's nutcracker
 (<i>Nucifraga columbiana</i> Wilson) seed-caching flight distances.
 Statistical analyses of fine-scale and coarse-scale distribution of haplotypes
 showed no apparent signs of deviation from a random pattern.
 This suggests nutcrackers are effective in dispersal of seed within populations,
 which is consistent with data gathered on nutcracker seed-caching behavior.
 However, the lack of homogeneity in haplotype frequencies among populations
 indicates nutcrackers rarely disperse seeds across large gaps (&gt;20 km) in
 subalpine habitat.

  <b>Molecular Ecology</b> (2002) 11, 215-227.
$abstract=Uniparentally inherited mitochondrial (mt)DNA and chloroplast
 (cp)DNA microsatellites (cpSSRs) were used to examine population genetic
 structure and biogeographic patterns of bird-dispersed seed and
 wind-disseminated pollen of whitebark pine (<i>Pinus albicaulis</i> Engelm.).
 Sampling was conducted from 41 populations throughout the range of the species.
 Analyses provide evidence for an ancestral haplotype and two derived mtDNA
 haplotypes with distinct regional distributions. An abrupt contact zone
 between mtDNA haplotypes in the Cascade Range suggests postglacial
 biogeographic movements.
 Among three cpSSR loci, 42 haplotypes were detected within 28 cpSSR sample
 populations that were aggregated into six regions. Analysis of molecular
 variance (<font size=-1>AMOVA</font>) was used to determine the hierarchical
 genetic structure of cpSSRs.
 <font size=-1>AMOVA</font> and population pairwise comparisons
 (F<sub>ST</sub>) of cpSSR, and geographical distribution of mtDNA haplotypes
 provide insights into historical changes in biogeography.
 The genetic data suggest that whitebark pine has been intimately tied to
 climatic change and associated glaciation, which has led to range movements
 facilitated by seed dispersal by Clark's nutcracker (<i>Nucifraga columbiana</i>
 Wilson).
 The two hypotheses proposed to explain the genetic structure are:
   (i) a northward expansion into Canada and the northern Cascades in the
       early Holocene; and
  (ii) historical gene flow between Idaho and the Oregon Cascades when more
       continuous habitat existed in Central Oregon during the late
       Pleistocene.
 Genetic structure and insights gained from historical seed movements provide
 a basis on which to develop recovery plans for a species that is at risk from
 multiple threats.

 <a><i>Use of flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and PCR-based techniques to assess intraspecific and interspecific matings of Armillaria species,</i></a>
 <b>Mycological Research</b> 105(2): 153-163.
$abstract=For assessments of intraspecific mating using flow cytometry and
 fluorescence microscopy, two compatible basidiospore-derived isolates were
 selected from each of four parental basidiomata of North American Biological
 Species (NABS) X.
 The nuclear status in NABS X varied with basidiospore-derived isolates.
 Nuclei within basidiospore-derived isolates existed as haploids, diploids 
 (doubled haploids), or a mixture of haploids and diploids (doubled haploids).
 Depending on the nuclear status of the basidiospore-derived lines of NABS X,
 intraspecifically mated cultures can exist as diploids or tetraploids, and
 possibly triploids or aneuploids under <i>in vitro</i> conditions.
 Based on previous in vitro mating studies, seven basidiospore isolates were
 specifically selected to assess rare, interspecific mating among <i>Armillaria
 cepistipes, A. sinapina,</i> NABS X, and NABS XI.
 Cultures from basidiospore-derived isolates were paired to produce four
 interspecifically paired cultures, and matings were assessed using flow
 cytometry and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses.
 Based on flow cytometric analysis, the <i>A. cepistipes</i> isolate exhibited
 compatibility with a NABS X isolate, and the <i>A. sinapina</i> isolate
 exhibited compatibility with a NABS X isolate, and the <i>A. sinapina</i>
 isolates were individually compatible with isolates of NABS X and NABS XI.
 Mean fluorescence intensities of <i>A. cepistipes</i> X NABS X, 
 <i>A. sinapina</i> X NABS X, and <i>A. sinapina</i> X NABS XI mated cultures
 revealed a triploid or tetraploid nuclear status compared to the haploid or 
 diploid (doubled haploid) nuclear status of initial basidiospore-derived
 isolates.
 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and RFLP of the intergenic spacer
 (IGS) region generated banding patterns for basidiospore-derived isolates and
 mated cultures.
 Four species-specific RFLP banding patterns were observed in
 basidiospore-derived isolates of <i>A. cepistipes, A. sinapina,</i> NABS X,
 and NABS XI.
 PCR-RFLP analysis showed combined banding patterns from mated cultures.
 Flow cytometry and PCR-RFLP analysis are effective tools to assess matings of
 <i>Armillaria</i> species.

 <b>Mycologia</b> 92(5): 874-883.
$abstract=Twenty-six isolates representing nine North American Armillaria species were investigated with flow cytometry and RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) analyses to determine their genome size and RFLP profile. Three putatively diploid isolates of A. ostoyae, A. gemina, A. calvescens, A. sinapina, A. mellea, A. gallica, A. nabsnona, and North American Biological Species (NABS) X were analyzed, and two putative diploid isolates of NABS XI also were analyzed. Genome sizes of Armillaria species were 0.11--0.17 pg per nucleus (55--84 ? 106 bp/C), depending on species. Among the nine North American Armillaria species tested, A. ostoyae, A. gemina, and A. mellea possessed relatively small genome sizes (0.11--0.12 pg per nucleus), whereas A. gallica possessed a relatively large genome size (0.17 pg per nucleus). A. nabsnona has a slightly larger genome size (0.13 pg per nucleus) than A. ostoyae, A. gemina, and A. mellea. Other species (A. calvescens, A. sinapina, NABS X, and NABS XI) possessed moderate genome sizes (ca 0.15 pg per nucleus). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and RFLP of the intergenic spacer region-1 (IGS-1) generated banding patterns for nine Armillaria species. In addition to previously reported banding patterns, new banding patterns are presented for A. gemina, A. calvescens, A. mellea, and A. gallica.

   chapter 12 of <b>Soil Quality and Soil Erosion;</b>
   CRC Press, Soil and Water Conservation Society, Ankeny, Iowa
$abstract=In forest conditions, surface runoff and soil erosion are generally low because of the surface litter cover. Hydraulic conductivities are in excess of 15 mm/hr, and erosion rates are generally less than 0.1 mg ha<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. If the litter layer is disturbed, then runoff and erosion rates can increase by several magnitudes. Disturbances can be natural, such as wildfire, or human induced, such as harvesting or prescription burning for ecosystem management, where conductivities can drop to under 5 mm/hr and erosion rates can exceed 20 mg ha<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. Roads adversely impact forest soil productivity by directly reducing the productive area and by causing the greatest amount of soil erosion. Conductivities of roads have been measured to be less than 1 mm/hr, and erosion can be in excess of 100 mg ha<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. Harvesting activities reduce surface cover, and compact the soil, leading to increased runoff and erosion. Erosion generally decreases productivity of forests by decreasing the available soil water for forest growth and through loss of nutrients in eroded sediment. The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model is shown to be a useful tool in predicting the erosion impacts of different levels of vegetation removal at harvest and different levels of compaction. WEPP predicted that the nutrients lost through the organic matter in sediments are significant, but less than nutrient loss through tree removal. Work is ongoing to collect long-term site productivity data from numerous sites to aid in the analysis of forest management on soil erosion and site productivity.

$abstract=Intensive timber harvesting and site preparation are becoming more common as demand for timber-based products increases. On some harvested sites in the western United States of America and Canada, stump removal is used to ameliorate root disease problems. Soil compaction and nutrient loss could become a problem on some sites after harvesting, site preparation, or stump removal. In a non-replicated, randomized block experiment, two levels of soil compaction (none and severe) and a stump extraction treatment were examined on an ash-cap soil in northern Idaho. These treatments were planted with Douglas-fir (<em class="ital">Pseudotsuga menziesii</em> var. <em class="ital">glauca</em> [Beissn.] Franco) and western white pine (<em class="ital">Pinus monticola</em> Dougl. ex D. Don) seedlings. Soil compaction increased post-harvest bulk density 15&#8211;20% to a depth of 30 cm. Stump removal decreased surface soil bulk density, but it increased at the 30- to 45-cm depth to levels equal to the soil compaction treatment. One year after outplanting, seedling top weights were similar among treatments, but root volume was significantly reduced in the soil compaction treatment. Soil compaction and stump removal treatments also reduced the numbers and morphological types of ectomycorrhizae and non-ectomycorrhizal short roots on Douglas-fir. Western white pine seedlings had reduced numbers of non-ectomycorrhizal short roots in the same treatments. Three years after outplanting, stump removal resulted in smaller root collar diameters and less total N content for both seedling species. Severe site disturbance, with associated soil compaction and mixing, may decrease productivity of ash-cap sites by reducing pore space and root and ectomycomhizal activity. Managers must weigh short-term benefits of intensive site disturbance with possible long-term loss of soil productivity.</p>

$abstract=Ectomycorrhizal colonization of conifer species associated with a cedar-hemlock (<em class="ital">Thuja plicata</em> Donn ex D. Don and <em class="ital">Tsuga heterophylla</em> [Raf. ] Sarg. ) forest in northern Idaho, is directly influenced by the quantity and type of soil organic matter. Soil organic horizons, particularly soil wood, represent the substrate for a majority of the ectomycorrhizal activity. The amount of large downed woody residue ranges from 38 Mg ha<sup>&#8722;1</sup> to 202 Mg ha<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. Residues play an important role in nutrient cycling and moisture storage capacity. Surface mineral horizons contain significant quantities of volcanic ash and organic matter, which also helps cycle nitrogen and maintain moisture. The critical nature of soil organics in this ecosystem represents hazards, and opportunities for forest managers. With careful management, these soils can be protected, or even improved. Recognition of the importance of organic and ash horizons also provides a basis for restoring damaged soils, soils that are impossible to restore, or for soils requiring long restoration periods.

  <b>Forest Ecology and Management</b> 138 (2000): 445-462
$abstract=Soil quality standards and guidelines of the USDA Forest Service were some of the first in the world to be developed to evaluate changes in forest soil productivity and sustainability after harvesting and site preparation. International and national development of criteria and indicators for maintenance of soil productivity make it imperative to have adequate threshold variables within the USDA Forest Service. In the Pacific Northwest, soils range from fine-textured Andisols to coarse-textured skeletal Inceptisols. Forest types encompass the highly productive coastal rain forest to marginally productive, dry, cold sites in the interior mountains. Constant values to detect detrimental disturbances within the soil quality guidelines are routinely applied across diverse soils and timber types and include diagnostic criteria for evaluating management-caused changes to soil productivity. Research information from short- or long-term research studies supporting the applicability of disturbance criteria is often lacking, or is available from a limited number of sites which have relatively narrow climatic and soil ranges. In this paper we calculated changes in soil carbon, nitrogen, erosion, and cation exchange capacity using threshold variables from the Regional USDA Forest Service Soil Guidelines to assess their applicability across diverse landscapes. Soils were selected from a climatic and elevational gradient in the Pacific Northwest. Application of selected USDA Forest Service standards indicate that blanket threshold variables applied over disparate soils do not adequately account for nutrient distribution within the profile or forest floor depth. These types of guidelines should be continually refined to reflect pre-disturbance conditions and site-specific information.

$abstract=Timber harvesting and mechanical site preparation can reduce site productivity if they excessively disturb or compact the soil. Volcanic ash-influenced soils with low undisturbed bulk densities and rock content are particularly susceptible. This study evaluates the effects of harvesting and site preparation on changes in the bulk density of ash-influenced forest soils in northern Idaho. Three different levels of surface organic matter were studied. Soil samples were taken before and after harvesting to determine the extent and depth of compaction. Soil bulk densities increased significantly after extensive compaction from site preparation, especially when little logging slash and surface organic matter were left on the soil surface. As site preparation intensity increased, bulk density increased significantly at greater depths in the soil profile. Although ash-influenced soils have naturally low bulk densities, they can easily be compacted to levels that limit growth. This experimental site has been designated as part of the Forest Service's national long-term site productivity study into the impacts of organic matter depletion and soil compaction on stand development.
