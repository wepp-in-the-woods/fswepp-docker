			<h1 class="topheading">SOLO was conceived, designed and created by:</h1>

			<p><strong>Thomas M. Rice</strong>, Computer Specialist at the Rocky Mountain Research Station Forestry Sciences Lab, Moscow, ID,</p>

			<p>and <strong>Martin F. Jurgensen</strong>, Professor of Soil Science at Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI.</p>

			<p>The development of SOLO is a cooperative effort between Forest Service

personnel from Region One and its National Forests, and at the Rocky Mountain Research Station Forestry Sciences Lab in Moscow, Idaho. Much time and effort has been invested in building a product that Region One soil scientists and others will want to use to gain relief from the restrictions on management capabilities created by government downsizing and budgetary uncertainty.</p>

			<p>In that spirit, the end-users of the software are being included in its design stage. SOLO's success will involve cooperation and input from Forest Service soil scientists and ecologists from throughout the Region, including:
