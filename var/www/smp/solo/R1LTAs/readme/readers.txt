performs a complete uninstall. For this reason, it is important not to close the installer
application by clicking its close box in the upper right corner of the background window
after clicking the "Thank You" dialog box that appears at the end of the installation. If you
wait for a second or two, the installer will automatically close the background windows after
the installation is complete.
