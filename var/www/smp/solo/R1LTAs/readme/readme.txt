     The contents of this document were originally organized with the
     intention of publishing the information as a traditional General
     Technical Report. As the project evolved and the volume of
     information grew, a decision was made to distribute this document
     and the supporting map products in electronic format. This
     electronic format is intended to promote ease of distribution and
     reduce the expense of publishing costs- resulting in a savings to
     the taxpayers.

     It is important to note that the mapping displayed in this
     publication is the First Approximation of the Landtype
     Associations for the Northern Region. Users having local
     knowledge and mapping expertise are encouraged to submit any
     proposed corrections, changes, additions or deletions to this
     mapping to:

     Official updates or changes to the coverage will be coordinated
     by the Regional Soil Scientist.

     Any use of the LTA coverage that results in alterations or
     changes to the original version contained here are required to
     include a disclaimer clearly stating the derived product is not
     the officially supported version of the mapping. Interpretations
     or analysis made using modifications to this official version
     will not be supported by the Regional Soil Scientist. Persons
     using this product to create various interpretive maps (eg.  PNV
     maps) based on associating other coverages or data with the LTA
     coverage MUST INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT on any such map
     products:  This map is an interpretative map based on the R-1
     Landtype Association Mapping. It does not represent any of the
     levels in the National Hierarchical Framework of Ecological Units
     and the R-1 ECOMAP Group does not warrant its validity or
     accuracy. A copy of this disclaimer statement is included in the
     README directory.

     This electronic document format was designed to facilitate both
     hard copy and electronic use of the data.  The text and
     supporting graphics are Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF)
     files.  All files contained in the PDF format can be printed and
     will appear as shown on the computer screen. Also included are
     the Arc-Info map compositions for each 1:100,000 scale quadrange
     for which Landtype Associations were mapped, and the full size
     map compositions for all map displays shown in PDF format.

     U.S.  Forest Service users are presumed to have access to IBM
     workstations with the Adobe Acrobat Reader software installed,
     and the current version of Arc-Info. The Arc-Info map
     compositions can be viewed by using the DRAW command at the Arc
     prompt. The map compositions can be plotted as originally
     formatted using the Arc-Info plot routine. A copy of the Acrobat
     Reader for Windows is also included on the CD-ROM.

     To facilitate use of the information contained in this document,
     electronic links have been built which allow the reader to move
     from the Table of Contents or List of Figures (in Chapt1_2.pdf)
     to other chapters, appendices, figures or maps-and back to the
     starting place in the document easily. The organization of the
     information within each chapter is discussed in Chapter 2. The
     links will appear as colored boxes around portions of text. The
     link is activated by clicking on the text within the box. The
     Acrobat Reader software also includes basic functions for moving
     through the document, searching for topics by word, zooming in
     on images etc.

     Listed below are the directories contained on the CD-ROM with
     brief descriptions of the file contents in each. The upper-level
     directory structure is :  r1ltas/ecowest.  Beneath /ecowest are
     the following directories:

     /text This directory contains separate .PDF files for each
     chapter of the document (16 files). The introductory chapters
     (Chapt1__2) are included in one file. To start the document when
     in the Acrobat Reader move to the text directory and open this
     file. The appendices and bibliography are also included in this
     directory as a separate file.


     /graph This directory contains separate .PDF files for each of
     the summary bar charts which display the composition of landform
     and geologic material groups within each Section.  (38 files)

     /finphoto This directory contains an individual .PDF file for
     each landscape photograph linked to the document chapters.  (16
     files)


     /maps   This directory contains the .PDF files for each of
             the map displays linked to the document.  (43
	     files)

     /100kmaps  This directory contains the Arc/Info map compositions
     for each of the 1:100,000 scale quadrangles for which LTA mapping
     was produced (73 compositions).  Each composition includes a
     directory with separate files of each graphic element.

     /r1plots The files in this directory are the Arc/Info map
     compositions for each of the map displays included as .PDF files.
     (40 compositions)


     /export  This directory contains the compressed Arc/Info export
     file of the Region 1 Landtype Association mapping.

     /readme  This directory contains the README text file explaining
     the origin and use of the data and the CD. It also includes
     disc.txt-a text file of the disclaimer statement required to
     appear on any interpretive map products derived from the original
     LTA coverage. Also included in this directory is the metadata
     for the electronic map coverage in text and html formats. The
     Acrobat Reader installation programs for several platforms can be
     copied from this directory.  Acrobat Reader is required to read
     the .PDF files included on this CD. The metadata for the LTA
     coverage is also included in this directory.

     /solo This directory contains a .PDF which is an abbreviated
     description of the SOLO software that is being developed by
     Region 1 in cooperation with the Forestry Sciences Lab, Moscow
     ID.  This directory can be used to copy the SOLO program into
     when it becomes available.
