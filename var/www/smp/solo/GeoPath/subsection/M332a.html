<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Colluvium--Unconsolidated, unsorted earth material being transported
or</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Ecological Unit--A mapped landscape unit designed to meet management</P>

<P>objectives, comprised of one or more ecological types.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Floodplain--The nearly level plain that borders a stream and is subject
to</P>

<P>inundation under flood-stage conditions unless protected artificially.
It is usually a constructional landform built of sediment deposited during</P>

<P>overflow and lateral migration of streams.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Fluvial--Of or pertaining to rivers; produced by river action.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Intermontane Basin--A generic term for wide structural depressions between</P>

<P>mountain ranges that are partly filled with alluvium and called &quot;valleys&quot;
in the vernacular. Intermontane basins may be drained internally (bolsons)</P>

<P>or externally (semi-bolson).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

in</P>

<P>lakes.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Moraine--A mound, ridge, or other distinct accumulation of unsorted,</P>

<P>independent of control by the surface on which the drift lies.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Outwash--Stratified detritus (chiefly sand and gravel) removed or &quot;washed</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Potential Vegetation--The biotic community that would be established

<P>successional sequences of its ecosystem were completed without additional</P>

<P>human-caused disturbance under present environmental conditions.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Section--An ecological unit in the subregion planning and analysis scale
of the</P>

<P>National Hierarchical Framework corresponding to subdivisions of a Province
having broad areas of similar geomorphic process, stratigraphy, geologic
origin, drainage networks, topography, and regional climate. Such areas
are often inferred by relating geologic maps to potential natural vegetation
groupings as mapped by Kuchler (1964).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Soil Great Group--A category of soil classification where soils are placed</P>

<P>together based on close similarities in kind, arrangement, and degree
of</P>

<P>expression of horizons; close similarities in soil moisture and temperature</P>

<P>regimes; and similarities in base status.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Soil Moisture Regime--Classes of soil moisture that are based on the
assumption</P>

<P>that the soil supports whatever vegetation it is capable of supporting.</P>

<P>Moisture regimes are defined in terms of the ground-water level and in</P>

<P>terms of the presence or absence of water held at a tension of &lt;15
bars in</P>

<P>the moisture control section by periods of the year.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Soil Temperature Regime--The characteristic temperature regime of a soil
that</P>

<P>is described by the mean annual soil temperature, the average seasonal</P>

<P>fluctuations from that mean, and the mean warm or cold seasonal soil</P>

<P>temperature gradient within the main root zone, which is the zone from
a</P>

<P>depth of 5 to 100 centimeters.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Subsection--An ecological unit in the subregion planning and analysis
scale of</P>

<P>the National Hierarchical Framework corresponding to subdivisions of
a Section into areas with similar surficial geology, lithology, geomorphic
process, soil great groups, subregional climate, and potential vegetation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Till--Dominantly unsorted and unstratified drift, deposited by a glacier,
and</P>

<P>consisting of a heterogeneous mixture of clay, silt, sand, gravel, stones,</P>

<P>and boulders.</P>
