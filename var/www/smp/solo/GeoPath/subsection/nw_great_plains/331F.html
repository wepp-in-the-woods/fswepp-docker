<P>331F Northwest Great Plains --</P>

<P>These Sections all have cold continental climates with warm to hot, dry
summers</P>

<P>and cold, dry winters. These non-glaciated plains are typically gently
rolling</P>

<P>low relief grasslands. Bedrock is Cretaceous marine shale, Tertiary fluvial</P>

<P>sediments, and some large sandstone units. Clinker beds or &quot;scoria&quot;
from burnt</P>

<P>coal seams form colorful resistant beds in Tertiary outcrops. These Sections</P>

<P>cover 41,524,948 acres.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Dissected shale plains formed in calcareous

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 11 to 15 inches, about
