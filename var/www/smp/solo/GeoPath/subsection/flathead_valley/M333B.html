<P>M333B Flathead Valley --</P>

<P>These Sections have maritime influenced cool temperate climates with
warm, dry</P>

<P>summers and cool, moist winters. The landscape is dominated by rounded</P>

<P>landforms that resulted from continental glaciation. Till deposits, often
50</P>

<P>to 100 feet thick, cover the mountainsides and valley floors. A mantle
of</P>

<P>loess and volcanic ash occurs over most of the glacial deposits. Some</P>

<P>metasedimentary Belt rock landscapes remain. The Northern Rockies Section
is</P>

<P>dominantly metasedimentary mountains that have been characteristically
shaped</P>

<P>by alpine glaciation. These Sections cover 11,908,199 acres.</P>

<P>M333Ba Purcell/North Cabinet Mountains</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Glaciated mountains that formed primarily
in quartzite, siltite, and argillite. Granitic intrusions also occur. Fairly
thick volcanic ash layers occur on most soil surfaces. Elevations range
from 1800 to 7700 feet. Drainage density is moderate. Lakes are common</P>

<P>in this subsection.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 70 inches, about
70 percent falling as snow. The soil temperature and moisture regimes are
cryic and udic. Rain on snow events occur frequently.</P>

<P>Disturbance and Land Use: The primary natural disturbances are fire,
insects and disease, and mass wasting. Land use is predominantly intensive
timber harvest and livestock grazing.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Glaciated mountains that formed in argillite,
siltite, quartzite, and dolomite. Some volcanic ash layers remain, mostly
on</P>

<P>ridgetops. Elevations range from 2500 to 7600 feet. Drainage density
is low to moderate.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 50 inches, about
70 percent falling as snow. The soil temperature and moisture regimes are
cryic (frigid at lower elevations) and udic.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Intermontane basin that formed in alluvium,
glacial outwash, and lacustrine sediments underlain by argillite, siltite,
and</P>

<P>dolomite. Elevations range from 2300 to 4500 feet. Drainage density is
low to</P>

<P>moderate.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 25 inches, about
