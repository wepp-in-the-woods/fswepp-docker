<P>331D Northwest Glaciated Plains and 331E Northern Glaciated Plains --
These Sections have a cold continental climate with warm, dry summers and
cold, dry winters. Large expanses of prairie with scattered highlands characterize
these Sections. Glacial drift up to 100 feet thick covers the landscape
and glacial</P>

<P>knob and kettle topography is typical. Ice damming of major rivers also</P>

<P>created areas of lacustrine and delta sediments. These Sections cover</P>

<P>40,078,875 acres.</P>

<P>331Da Rocky Mountain Front Foothills</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Mountain front foothills, moraines, fans and
terraces that formed in calcareous shales overlain by till, outwash, alluvium,
and terrace deposits. The landscape has been modified by glaciation. Elevations
range from 3400 to 6000 feet. Drainage density is low to moderate.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 20 inches, about
half falling as snow. The soil temperature and moisture regimes are frigid
and typic ustic. Chinook winds are frequent.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Mountainsides, foothills, terraces, moraines,
and fans that formed in Tertiary volcanics and mixed sedimentary rocks.
Continental glaciation influenced these mountain ranges. Elevations range
from 2500 to 5500 feet. Drainage density is moderate.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 30 inches, about
70 percent falling as snow. The soil temperature and moisture regimes are
frigid (cryic at higher elevations) and typic ustic. Chinook winds are common.</P>
