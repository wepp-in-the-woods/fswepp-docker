<P>M331B Bighorn Mountains -- These Sections</P>

<P>all have cold continental climates with warm, dry summers and cold, dry</P>

<P>winters. The topography is dominantly uplifted and faulted mountains
and high</P>

<P>plateaus with a variety of bedrock. Higher elevations are typically shaped
by</P>

<P>mountain glaciation and exhibit typical cirqueland features. Steep dipslopes,</P>

<P>flatirons, and hogbacks are typical of the Rocky Mountain Front and parts
of</P>

<P>Bighorn Mountains. Large gravel filled valleys are typical in the Beaverhead</P>

<P>Mountains Section of southwest Montana. In central Montana, the mountains</P>

<P>occur as widely separated uplifts surrounded and isolated by prairie.
These</P>

<P>Sections cover 23,835,539 acres.re</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Mountainsides, foothills, fans, and terraces
that formed in limestone, sandstone, and shale. Some landslide deposits
also occur.</P>

<P>Elevations range from 5000 to 10500 feet. Drainage density is moderate.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 35 inches, about
40 percent falling as snow. The soil temperature and moisture regimes are
cryic and typic ustic.</P>
