<P>331G Powder River Basin --</P>

<P>These Sections all have cold continental climates with warm to hot, dry
summers</P>

<P>and cold, dry winters. These non-glaciated plains are typically gently
rolling</P>

<P>low relief grasslands. Bedrock is Cretaceous marine shale, Tertiary fluvial</P>

<P>sediments, and some large sandstone units. Clinker beds or &quot;scoria&quot;
from burnt</P>

<P>coal seams form colorful resistant beds in Tertiary outcrops. These Sections</P>

<P>cover 41,524,948 acres.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Dominantly plains and foothills with some
terraces and fans that formed in sandstone and shale. Elevations range from
2900 to 6000 feet. Drainage density is moderate.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 20 inches, about
35 percent falling as snow. The soil temperature and moisture regimes are
frigid and tyic ustic/aridic ustic. Chinook winds are frequent.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Potential Vegetation: Grama-needlegrass-wheatgrass and Foothills prairie.</P>

<P>Some Eastern ponderosa forest also occurs at higher elevations.</P>
