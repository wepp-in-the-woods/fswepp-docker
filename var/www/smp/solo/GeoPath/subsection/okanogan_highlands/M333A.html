<P>M333A Okanogan Highlands --</P>

<P>These Sections have maritime influenced cool temperate climates with
warm, dry</P>

<P>summers and cool, moist winters. The landscape is dominated by rounded</P>

<P>landforms that resulted from continental glaciation. Till deposits, often
50</P>

<P>to 100 feet thick, cover the mountainsides and valley floors. A mantle
of</P>

<P>loess and volcanic ash occurs over most of the glacial deposits. Some</P>

<P>metasedimentary Belt rock landscapes remain. The Northern Rockies Section
is</P>

<P>dominantly metasedimentary mountains that have been characteristically
shaped</P>

<P>by alpine glaciation. These Sections cover 11,908,199 acres.</P>

<P>M333Aa Pend Oreille/Selkirk Low Mountains and Valleys</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Low mountains, hills, and valleys that formed
in quartzite, siltite, argillite, and granitic rocks. Thick layers of volcanic</P>

<P>ash form the surface of most soils. Elevations range from 2100 to 6300
feet. Drainage density is low to moderate.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 50 inches, about
50 percent falling as snow. The soil temperature and moisture regimes are
mesic and typic xeric (cryic and udic at higher elevations). Rain on snow
events</P>

<P>occasionally occur during the winter months.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Potential Vegetation: Cedar-hemlock-pine forest/Western ponderosa forest</P>

<P>M333Ab Selkirk Mountains</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Glaciated mountains that formed in granitic,
gneiss, schist, quartzite, argillite, and phyllite rocks. Volcanic ash layers
occur on the soil surface over much of the area. Elevations range from 1800
to 7700 feet. Drainage density is moderate.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 70 inches, about
50 percent falling as snow. The soil temperature and moisture regimes are
cryic and udic (frigid and xeric at lower elevations). Rain on snow events
are</P>

<P>fairly common.</P>

<P>M333Ac Northern Idaho Valleys</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Wide valleys, outwash plains, and terraces
that formed in alluvium, glacial outwash, and lacustrine sediments. Elevations
range from 1400 to 4000 feet. Drainage density is low to moderate.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 40 inches, about
30 percent falling as snow. The soil temperature and moisture regimes are
frigid and typic xeric.</P>
