<P>M333C Northern Rockies --</P>

<P>These Sections have maritime influenced cool temperate climates with
warm, dry</P>

<P>summers and cool, moist winters. The landscape is dominated by rounded</P>

<P>landforms that resulted from continental glaciation. Till deposits, often
50</P>

<P>to 100 feet thick, cover the mountainsides and valley floors. A mantle
of</P>

<P>loess and volcanic ash occurs over most of the glacial deposits. Some</P>

<P>metasedimentary Belt rock landscapes remain. The Northern Rockies Section
is</P>

<P>dominantly metasedimentary mountains that have been characteristically
shaped</P>

<P>by alpine glaciation. These Sections cover 11,908,199 acres.</P>

<P>M333Ca Livingston Mountains</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Thrust faulted mountains formed from argillite,
siltite, and dolomite and strongly shaped by alpine glaciation. Glacial
till covers much of the landscape. Volcanic ash deposits also occur. Elevations
range from 3200 to 10100 feet. Drainage density is moderate.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 110 inches, about
80 percent falling as snow. The soil temperature and moisture regimes are
cryic and udic.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Potential Vegetation: Douglas-fir forest and Western spruce-fir forest</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Disturbance and Land Use: The primary natural disturbances are fire,
mass wasting, insects, and windthrow. This subsection is almost entirely
within Glacier National Park; therefore, human disturbances are very limited.</P>

<P>M333Cb Whitefish/Swan Mountains</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Block faulted mountains that formed from argillite,
siltite, and dolomite and strongly shaped by alpine glaciation. Glacial
till covers much of the landscape. Some volcanic ash deposits also occur.
Elevations range from 2900 to 8000 feet. Drainage density is moderate. Lakes
occur in glacial cirques and in glacial valleys.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>M333Cc Mission/Swan Valley and Mountains</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Large intermontane valley with adjacent block
faulted mountains that formed in valley fill, till, and metasedimentary
rock. Volcanic ash influences most soils. Alpine glaciation has strongly
shaped the landscape. Elevations range from 2900 to 9300 feet. Drainage
density is moderate. Wetlands and lakes occur frequently in this subsection.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 110inches, about
80 percent falling as snow in the mountains. The soil temperature and moisture
regimes are cryic and udic.</P>

<P>M333Ce Flathead Thrust Faulted Mountains</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Thrust faulted mountains that formed from
shale, sandstone, limestone, and conglomerate. These mountains have been
strongly</P>

<P>shaped by alpine glaciation. Elevations range from 3680 to 8500 feet.
Drainage density is moderate. A few lakes occur in glacial cirque basins.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 90 inches, about
80 percent falling as snow. The soil temperature and moisture regimes are
cryic and udic.</P>
