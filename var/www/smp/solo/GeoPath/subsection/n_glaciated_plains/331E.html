<P>331D Northwest Glaciated Plains and 331E Northern Glaciated Plains --
These Sections have a cold continental climate with warm, dry summers and
cold, dry winters. Large expanses of prairie with scattered highlands characterize
these Sections. Glacial drift up to 100 feet thick covers the landscape
and glacial</P>

<P>knob and kettle topography is typical. Ice damming of major rivers also</P>

<P>created areas of lacustrine and delta sediments. These Sections cover</P>

<P>40,078,875 acres.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Hummocky plains, outwash and stream terraces,
fans, and floodplains that formed in thin glacial till and river sediments
that lie over shale, siltstone, and sandstone. Moraines, kames, kettles,
and small lakes also occur. Elevations range from 1650 to 3050 feet. Drainage
density is moderate.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 17 inches, about
20 percent falling as snow. The soil temperature and moisture regimes are
frigid and udic.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Potential Vegetation: Wheatgrass-needlegrass with Northern floodplain
forest</P>

<P>along major rivers and streams.</P>

<P>Disturbance and Land Use: The primary natural disturbance is drought
and insects. Land use is predominantly wheat farming and range/pasture.
