<P>M332A Idaho Batholith -- This Section has a maritime influenced cool
temperate</P>

<P>climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The batholith
is a</P>

<P>large, contiguous uplifted area of granitics characterized by large,
rounded</P>

<P>mountain masses and basin areas. Soils formed in gruss, loess, and volcanic</P>

<P>ash. The landscape is deeply cut by the Idaho canyonlands. Mountain</P>

<P>glaciation occurred at higher elevations. This Section covers 3,883,095
acres.&nbsp;</P>

<P>M332Aa Lochsa/Salmon Breaklands</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Highly dissected stream breaklands formed
in gneiss, schist, and granitic rocks. Volcanic ash influenced loess covers
some</P>

<P>areas. Elevations range from 1400 to 7000 feet. Drainage density is high.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 60 inches, about
60 percent falling as snow. The soil temperature and moisture regimes are
frigid and typic xeric.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Disturbance and Land Use: The primary natural disturbances are fire,

mining, and</P>

<P>M332Ab Central Idaho Glaciated Mountains</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Glaciated mountain slopes, ridges, and cirquelands
that formed in quartz monzonite, gneiss, and granite. Many surface soils
are</P>

<P>influenced by volcanic ash. Elevations range from 3000 to 8500 feet.
Drainage density is moderate. Lakes occur in cirque basins and on glacial
valley</P>

<P>floors.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 70 inches, about
60 to 70 percent falling as snow. The soil temperature and moisture regimes
are cryic and udic.</P>

roadless or</P>

<P>designated wilderness, human disturbances are slight.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Uplands, broad basins, and breaklands that
formed gneiss, schist, and granitic rocks. Volcanic ash caps occur throughout
the</P>

<P>area. Elevations range from 1600 to 8200 feet. Drainage density is moderate</P>

<P>to high. Wetlands occur throughout the subsection associated with glacial</P>

<P>till. Lakes occur in high elevation cirques.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 80 inches, about
