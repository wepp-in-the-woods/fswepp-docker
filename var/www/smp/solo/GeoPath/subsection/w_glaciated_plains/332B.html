<P>332B Western Glaciated Plains -- These</P>

<P>Sections both have a cold continental climate with warm to hot, humid
summers</P>

<P>and cold, moist winters. The topography is a rolling, glaciated drift
prairie</P>

<P>with numerous potholes and moraines. Thick glacial drift covers most
of the</P>

<P>landscape though lacustrine sediments also occur as a result of glacial
ice</P>

<P>damming. These Sections cover 16,592,171 acres.in </P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Glacial lake plain formed in glacial lacustrine
sediments. Elevations range from 650 to 985 feet. Drainage density is low.</P>
