<P>M332C Rocky Mountain</P>

<P>Front -- These Sections</P>

<P>all have cold continental climates with warm, dry summers and cold, dry</P>

<P>winters. The topography is dominantly uplifted and faulted mountains
and high</P>

<P>plateaus with a variety of bedrock. Higher elevations are typically shaped
by</P>

<P>mountain glaciation and exhibit typical cirqueland features. Steep dipslopes,</P>

<P>flatirons, and hogbacks are typical of the Rocky Mountain Front and parts
of</P>

<P>Bighorn Mountains. Large gravel filled valleys are typical in the Beaverhead</P>

<P>Mountains Section of southwest Montana. In central Montana, the mountains</P>

<P>occur as widely separated uplifts surrounded and isolated by prairie.
These</P>

<P>Sections cover 23,835,539 acres.re</P>

<P>M332Ca North Rocky Mountain Front</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Thrust faulted mountains that formed from
argillite, siltite, and quartzite. Elevations range from 5000 to 10800 feet.
Drainage density is high. High mountain lakes are common and their are</P>

<P>existing glaciers. This subsection drains into Hudson Bay.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 27 to 90 inches, about
50 to 70 percent falling as snow. The soil temperature and moisture regimes
are cryic and udic (typic ustic at lower elevations). Chinook winds are
common</P>

<P>along the mountain front.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Potential Vegetation: Douglas-fir forest/Western spruce-fir forest</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Thrust faulted and folded mountains that formed
from mudstone, sandstone, and lesser amounts of limestone and dolomite.
Elevations range from 5000 to 9000 feet. Drainage density is high.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 60 inches, about
50 to 70 percent falling as snow. The soil temperature and moisture regimes
are cryic and typic ustic. Chinook winds are common along the mountain front.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Faulted mountains that formed from limestone,
dolomite, and quartzite. Argillite and diorite sills occur. Elevations range
from 5400 to 9000 feet. Drainage density is high.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 60 inches, about
