<p><strong>Ecological Units -- </strong>The National Hierarchical Framework of Ecological
Units was formulated at a meeting of representatives from all Forest Service Regions, two
Research Stations, the USDA Soil Conservation Service (now the Natural Resources
Conservation Service), and the Nature Conservancy, and was adopted by the Forest Service
in November, 1993.<br>
<strong>Subsections</strong> are a refinement of this ecological unit hierarchy, based on
physical and biological criteria. They allow integration of Forest- and Ranger
District-level activities (e.g., timber harvest, monitoring, watershed analysis) into the
broader scale analyses, assessments and management decision-making processes.</p>
