<P>M332G Blue Mountains -- This Section has a maritime influenced cool temperate
climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The landscape is</P>

<P>dominated by deeply entrenched major streams. Steep, high relief breaks
and</P>

<P>narrow valleys are characteristic. Columbia River Basalts and related
plateau</P>

<P>landscapes also occur in this Section. This Section covers 1,345,904
acres.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Steep, dissected mountains and stream breaks
that formed in basalt, limestone, slate, and minor amounts of granite. Most
of the</P>

<P>higher elevation lands were glaciated. Elevations range from 1000 to
9400 feet. Drainage density is low to moderate.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 45 inches, about
70 percent falling as snow in the higher elevations. The soil temperature
and moisture regimes are mesic and typic xeric (cryic and udic at higher</P>

<P>elevations).</P>

<P>Disturbance and Land Use: The primary natural disturbances are fire,
insects and disease, and mass wasting. Land use is predominantly livestock
grazing, timber harvest, and recreation.gC&uuml;&ntilde;D&Igrave;&pound;C
