<P>M333D Bitterroot Mountains -- These Sections have</P>

<P>maritime influenced cool temperate climates with warm, dry summers and
cool,</P>

<P>moist winters. Belt rocks (quartzite and argillite) are resistant to</P>

<P>weathering and form typical landscapes of steep slopes and incised V-shaped</P>

<P>valleys. Talus and rock outcrops are common. The Bitterroot Valley is
a large</P>

<P>intermontane valley formed in valley fill materials. The higher elevations
are</P>

<P>typically large U-shaped valleys with abundant rock outcrop, cirques,
horns,</P>

<P>and other glacial features. Till, outwash, and moraines fill the valley</P>

<P>floors. These Sections cover 9,136,505 acres</P>

<P>M333Da Coeur d'Alene Mountains</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Faulted, low relief mountains formed from
quartzite, argillite, and siltite. Some basalt occurs on the western edge
of the subsection and granitic rocks occur on the east and north sides of
Hayden Lake and on the south end of Lake Pend Oreille. Alpine glaciation
has shaped the upper one-quarter of most drainages. Volcanic ash influences
most surface soils. Elevations range from 2150 to 6500 feet. Drainage density
is moderate. Hayden, Fernan, Coeur d'Alene, and Pend Oreille lakes occur
in or directly adjacent to this subsection. Lakes also occur in a few of
the high elevation cirque basins.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 75 inches, about
70 percent falling as snow. The soil temperature and moisture regimes are
frigid (cryic at higher elevations) and udic.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Potential Vegetation: Cedar-hemlock-pine forest with some Douglas-fir
forest</P>

<P>at higher elevations.</P>
