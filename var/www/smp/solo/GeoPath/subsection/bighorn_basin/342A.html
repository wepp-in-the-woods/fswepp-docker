<P>342A Bighorn Basin --</P>

<P>These Sections all have cold continental climates with warm to hot, dry
summers</P>

<P>and cold, dry winters. These non-glaciated plains are typically gently
rolling</P>

<P>low relief grasslands. Bedrock is Cretaceous marine shale, Tertiary fluvial</P>

<P>sediments, and some large sandstone units. Clinker beds or &quot;scoria&quot;
from burnt</P>

<P>coal seams form colorful resistant beds in Tertiary outcrops. These Sections</P>

<P>cover 41,524,948 acres. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Landscape Characteristics: Dissected plains, hills, terraces, and fans
that formed in shale, siltstone, and sandstone overlain by some alluvium
and</P>

<P>lacustrine sediment. Elevations range from 3700 to 4700 feet. Drainage
density is moderate.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Climate: Mean annual precipitation ranges from 5 to 12 inches. The soil
temperature and moisture regimes are mesic and ustic aridic. Winters are
very dry.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Potential Vegetation: Sagebrush steppe with some Foothills prairie</P>
