<P>M332D Belt Mountains -- These Sections</P>

<P>all have cold continental climates with warm, dry summers and cold, dry</P>

<P>winters. The topography is dominantly uplifted and faulted mountains
and high</P>

<P>plateaus with a variety of bedrock. Higher elevations are typically shaped
by</P>

<P>mountain glaciation and exhibit typical cirqueland features. Steep dipslopes,</P>

<P>flatirons, and hogbacks are typical of the Rocky Mountain Front and parts
of</P>

<P>Bighorn Mountains. Large gravel filled valleys are typical in the Beaverhead</P>

<P>Mountains Section of southwest Montana. In central Montana, the mountains</P>

<P>occur as widely separated uplifts surrounded and isolated by prairie.
These</P>

<P>Sections cover 23,835,539 acres.re</P>
