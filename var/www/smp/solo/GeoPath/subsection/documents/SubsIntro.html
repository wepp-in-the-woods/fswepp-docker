<BR>
<B>Background</B><BR>
<BR>
This subsection report represents a first approximation of an effort to
develop units which integrate information from various disciplines, single-purpose
<BR>
maps, and existing regionalizations. The development of ecological units
and descriptive data is an iterative process that will continue as additional
information becomes available. Peer review and comments by users of this
information is an important part of this process. All ecological mapping
and <BR>
descriptions follow the Forest Service's National Framework for Ecological<BR>
Units (ECOMAP, 1993).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Development of the Map and Descriptions</B><BR>
<BR>
Subsections are smaller areas of Sections with similar surficial geology,
<BR>
lithology, geomorphic process, soil groups, subregional climate, and potential
<BR>
natural communities (ECOMAP, 1993). Each subsection has landscape components
that differentiate it from adjacent subsections. The differentia used to
place lines on the map include geologic materials, geomorphic features,
and climate.<BR>
There are other components that are used to describe each subsection, but
are not used to delineate the units. These are called accessory characteristics
and include soils and vegetation.<BR>
<BR>
Geologic materials affect ecosystem processes. The physical and chemical
properties of bedrock and surficial materials influence such processes as
weathering, soil formation, vegetation distribution, and stream chemistry.
Landscape features such as elevation, aspect, and slope influence the distribution
of solar radiation and precipitation. This affects vegetation patterns,
soil formation, hydrologic processes, and animal populations. <BR>
<BR>
The USGS 1:500,000 Albers Conic Equal-Area Maps for the states of Montana,
Idaho, and North Dakota were used for the base maps. Geologic materials
were determined from 1:500,000 state geology maps with some minor refinements
based on additional geologic maps and local knowledge. Geomorphic features
were determined using 1:500,000 state topographic and shaded relief maps,
and local knowledge. Broad climatic zones were inferred from potential natural
vegetation mapping using Kuchler (1964), regional vegetation information,
and isohyetal maps.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Uses of the Map and Descriptions</B><BR>
<BR>
Subsection maps and descriptions are used at the subregion scale for strategic,
multi-forest, statewide, and multi-agency analysis and assessment (ECOMAP,
1993). Use of this or any map should be consistent with the scale and methods
used to compile it. The subsection map was designed for broad scale ecosystem
analysis and should not be used for detailed work. The map was produced
at 1:500,000 and is intended to be used at that or a smaller scale. Plotting
and using the subsection map at scales larger than 1:500,000 (1:24,000 for
example) constitutes a misuse of the map and should not be done. Due to
the great <BR>
amount of variability within the subsections, interpretations for parameters
<BR>
such as erosion were not made. Interpretations at this level must necessarily
<BR>
be based on many assumptions, generalizations, and averages. Such ratings
or<BR>
interpretations generally lack any real value.<BR>

<BR>
The following overview is intended to give the reader a general understanding
<BR>
of the landscapes and climate of the Northern Region. The overview is arranged<BR>
by Section or groups of similar Sections.<BR>
<BR>
<B>331A Palouse Prairie </B>-- This Section has a maritime-influenced warm
temperate climate with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Columbia
River Basalts formed much of the landscape of low relief plateaus and rolling
hills dotted with steptoes. Major streams are deeply entrenched into the
uplifted highlands forming large canyons. This Section covers 3,243,257
acres.<BR>
<BR>
<B>331D Northwest Glaciated Plains and 331E Northern Glaciated Plains</B>
-- These<BR>
Sections have a cold continental climate with warm, dry summers and cold,
dry<BR>
winters. Large expanses of prairie with scattered highlands characterize
these<BR>
Sections. Glacial drift up to 100 feet thick covers the landscape and glacial<BR>
knob and kettle topography is typical. Ice damming of major rivers also
<BR>
created areas of lacustrine and delta sediments. These Sections cover <BR>
40,078,875 acres.<BR>
<BR>
<B>331F Northwest Great Plains, 331G Powder River Basin, and 342A Bighorn
Basin</B> --<BR>
These Sections all have cold continental climates with warm to hot, dry
summers<BR>
and cold, dry winters. These non-glaciated plains are typically gently rolling<BR>
low relief grasslands. Bedrock is Cretaceous marine shale, Tertiary fluvial<BR>
sediments, and some large sandstone units. Clinker beds or &quot;scoria&quot;
from burnt<BR>
coal seams form colorful resistant beds in Tertiary outcrops. These Sections
<BR>
cover 41,524,948 acres.<BR>
<BR>
<B>332A Northeastern Glaciated Plains and 332B Western Glaciated Plains</B>
-- These <BR>
Sections both have a cold continental climate with warm to hot, humid summers
<BR>
and cold, moist winters. The topography is a rolling, glaciated drift prairie<BR>
with numerous potholes and moraines. Thick glacial drift covers most of
the<BR>
landscape though lacustrine sediments also occur as a result of glacial
ice<BR>
damming. These Sections cover 16,592,171 acres.<BR>
<BR>
<B>M331A Yellowstone Highlands, M331B Bighorn Mountains, M332C Rocky Mountain<BR>
Front, M332D Belt Mountains, and M332E Beaverhead Mountains</B> -- These
Sections <BR>
all have cold continental climates with warm, dry summers and cold, dry
<BR>
winters. The topography is dominantly uplifted and faulted mountains and
high<BR>
plateaus with a variety of bedrock. Higher elevations are typically shaped
by<BR>
mountain glaciation and exhibit typical cirqueland features. Steep dipslopes,<BR>
flatirons, and hogbacks are typical of the Rocky Mountain Front and parts
of <BR>
Bighorn Mountains. Large gravel filled valleys are typical in the Beaverhead
<BR>
Mountains Section of southwest Montana. In central Montana, the mountains
<BR>
occur as widely separated uplifts surrounded and isolated by prairie. These<BR>
Sections cover 23,835,539 acres.<BR>
<BR>
<B>M332A Idaho Batholith</B> -- This Section has a maritime influenced cool
temperate <BR>
climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The batholith is
a<BR>
large, contiguous uplifted area of granitics characterized by large, rounded
<BR>
mountain masses and basin areas. Soils formed in gruss, loess, and volcanic<BR>
ash. The landscape is deeply cut by the Idaho canyonlands. Mountain <BR>
glaciation occurred at higher elevations. This Section covers 3,883,095
acres.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>M332B Bitterroot Valley and M333D Bitterroot Mountains</B> -- These Sections
have <BR>
maritime influenced cool temperate climates with warm, dry summers and cool,<BR>
moist winters. Belt rocks (quartzite and argillite) are resistant to <BR>
weathering and form typical landscapes of steep slopes and incised V-shaped<BR>
valleys. Talus and rock outcrops are common. The Bitterroot Valley is a
large<BR>
intermontane valley formed in valley fill materials. The higher elevations
are<BR>
typically large U-shaped valleys with abundant rock outcrop, cirques, horns,
<BR>
and other glacial features. Till, outwash, and moraines fill the valley
<BR>
floors. These Sections cover 9,136,505 acres.<BR>
<BR>
<B>M332G Blue Mountains</B> -- This Section has a maritime influenced cool
temperate climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The landscape
is<BR>
dominated by deeply entrenched major streams. Steep, high relief breaks
and<BR>
narrow valleys are characteristic. Columbia River Basalts and related plateau<BR>
landscapes also occur in this Section. This Section covers 1,345,904 acres.<BR>
<BR>
<B>M333A Okanogan Highlands, M333B Flathead Valley, and M333C Northern Rockies</B>
--<BR>
These Sections have maritime influenced cool temperate climates with warm,
dry<BR>
summers and cool, moist winters. The landscape is dominated by rounded <BR>
landforms that resulted from continental glaciation. Till deposits, often
50 <BR>
to 100 feet thick, cover the mountainsides and valley floors. A mantle of
<BR>
loess and volcanic ash occurs over most of the glacial deposits. Some <BR>
metasedimentary Belt rock landscapes remain. The Northern Rockies Section
is<BR>
dominantly metasedimentary mountains that have been characteristically shaped
<BR>
by alpine glaciation. These Sections cover 11,908,199 acres.</TT>
