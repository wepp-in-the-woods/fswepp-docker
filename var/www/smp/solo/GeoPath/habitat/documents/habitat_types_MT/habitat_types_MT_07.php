			<h3 class="section"><a name="set1"></a><span class="ital">ABIES GRANDIS</span> SERIES</h3>
			<p><strong>Soil</strong>&#8212;Most soils were derived from noncalcareous parent materials (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#d1">appendix D-1</a>). Intermittent shallow A2 horizons overlying a dominant B horizon suggest that loess and volcanic ash represent a major contribution to soil development. Surface soils are generally gravelly loams and silt loams with acidic reactions. Ground surfaces have virtually no rock or bare soil exposed; duff depths are moderate (3 to 6 cm).</p>
			<p><strong>Productivity/Management</strong>&#8212;Timber productivity in the series ranges from moderate to very high (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#e3">appendix E-3</a>). Browse production for elk and deer is high during early successional stages. Some lower elevation sites in the series are utilized as winter range. Forage potential and use for domestic livestock is generally limited to valley bottoms that have been cleared for farming and pastures.</p>
												
			<h4><a name="set1a"></a><span class="ital">Abies grandis/Clintonia uniflora</span> h.t.<br /> (ABGR/CLUN; grand fir/queencup beadlily)</h4>
			<p><strong>Soil</strong>&#8212;The ABGR/CLUN h.t. was sampled on a variety of noncalcareous substrates (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#d1">appendix D-1</a>). Surface soils were gravelly sandy loams to silts in the CLUN phase, gravelly loams in the XETE phase, and usually, nongravelly silt loams and silts in the ARNU phase. Reactions ranged from acidic to slightly acidic in all phases. Little surface rock or bare soil were exposed; duff depths were moderate (3 to 6 cm).</p>
			<p><strong>Productivity/Management</strong>&#8212;ABGR/CLUN has high to very high timber productivity (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#e3">appendix E-3</a>). Partial cutting practices will lead to dominance by <span class="ital">Abies grandis</span>, which is often greatly reduced in value by Indian paint fungus (<span class="ital">Echinodontium tinctorum</span>). Obtaining regeneration of the seral species is usually the best approach for timber management.</p>
			<p>Abundant forage for deer and elk is produced during earlier successional stages. Although many stands showed evidence of browsing, the low-elevation and south-exposure sites are usually the only portions of the habitat type offering winter-range potential. Domestic forage production is minimal in natural stands.</p>
			
			<h4><a name="set1b"></a><span class="ital">Abies grandis/Linnaea borealis</span> h.t.<br /> (ABGR/LIBO; grand fir/twinflower)</h4>
			<p><strong>Soil</strong>&#8212;Our two stands having soils data were on noncalcareous parent materials (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#d1">appendix D-1</a>). Surface soils were acidic, gravelly loams to silts. Ground surfaces had no rock or bare soil exposed; duff depths were 3 and 4 cm.</p>
			<p><strong>Productivity/Management</strong>&#8212;Timber productivity is high (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#e3">appendix E-3</a>) affording good opportunities for timber management. Productivity was highest in the LIBO phase. Forage production for deer and elk is moderately good in early successional stages, although sites are often not accessible for winter range. Forage production for domestic livestock offers little potential.</p>
			
			<h4><a name="set1c"></a><span class="ital">Abies grandis/Xerophyllum tenax</span> h.t.<br /> (ABGR/XETE; grand fir/beargrass)</h4>
			<p><strong>Soil</strong>&#8212;Field observations indicated that soils were similar to those in the ABGR/CLUN h.t. Ground surfaces had little bare soil and surface rock exposed; duff depth ranged from 1 to 3 cm.</p>
			<p><strong>Productivity/Management</strong>&#8212;Timber productivity is moderate to high (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#e3">appendix E-3</a>). Numerous valuable seral species and ease of regeneration are favorable for intensive timber management; however, the type only covers a small area. Forage production for deer and elk is good, although primarily for spring through fall use. According to Richard Ringleb (Lolo National Forest, Missoula) young stands originating after the 1910 burn in the St. Regis River Valley are used heavily by deer and elk, with major browsing on <span class="ital">Vaccinium globulare</span> and <span class="ital">Pachistima</span>. ABGR/XETE provides no potential for domestic livestock use.</p>
