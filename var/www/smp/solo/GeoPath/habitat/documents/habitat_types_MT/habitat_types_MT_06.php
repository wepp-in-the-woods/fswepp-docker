			<h3 class="section"><a name="set1"></a><span class="ital">PICEA</span> SERIES</h3>
			<p><strong>Soil</strong>&#8212;Soils are quite variable in the <span class="ital">Picea</span> series (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#d1">appendix D-1</a>). PICEA/SEST and PICEA/PHMA h.t.s occur primarily on calcareous substrates while PICEA/CLUN and PICEA/VACA h.t.s were found only on noncalcareous parent materials. Surface rock and bare soil exposure are minimal throughout the series. Duff depths are considerable (average greater than 6 cm) in all types except the PICEA/VACA h.t. and the VACA phase of PICEA/CLUN h.t. Gravel content of surface soils is generally lower and texture finer than in the <span class="ital">Pseudotsuga</span> series.</p>
			<p><strong>Productivity/Management</strong>&#8212;The <span class="ital">Picea</span> series contains some of the better timber producing lands in Montana. Productivity is moderate to high (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#e4">appendix E-4</a>) and the sites support several coniferous species. Sites are at moderate elevations, on gentle topography, and are usually accessible. Disadvantages to timber utilization may be that <span class="ital">Picea</span> series stands are often adjacent to visual corridors, and they provide streamside stability for many watersheds. They are often important habitat for deer, elk, and moose.</p>
												
			<h4><a name="set1a"></a><span class="ital">Picea/Equisetum arvense</span> h.t.<br /> (PICEA/EQAR; spruce/common horsetail)</h4>
			<p><strong>Soil</strong>&#8212;Soils are wet throughout the year, often with standing water. Some sites have a thick layer of organic &#8220;muck.&#8221; Other sites have a substrate composed of coarsetextured alluvium. Mineral soil samples were collected in only three stands (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#d1">appendix D-1</a>). Surface soil reactions were acidic to slightly basic, depending on parent material. Gravel content and texture were variable. Surface rock and mineral soil exposure were minimal; duff depth averaged 7.3 cm.</p>
			<p><strong>Productivity/Management</strong>&#8212;Timber productivity is moderate (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#e4">appendix E-4</a>), but conifers other than <span class="ital">Picea</span> are usually of minor importance. Overstory manipulation requires special constraints because of the wet soils and potential windthrow of residual trees. Road construction and site development present extreme problems related to high water tables, poor drainage, streamside locations, and organic soils.</p>
			<p>Use by big game and domestic stock is variable. In general it appears they avoid this habitat during periods of peak soil saturation but may make some use as soils dry out in late summer. Some stands show moderate winter use by deer, elk, and moose.</p>
			
			<h4><a name="set1b"></a><span class="ital">Picea/Clintonia uniflora</span> h.t.<br /> (PICEA/CLUN; spruce/queencup beadlily)</h4>
			<p><strong>Soil</strong>&#8212;Our stands were on various noncalcareous sedimentary and metamorphic parent materials (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#d1">appendix D-1</a>), occurring as alluvial or glacial deposits. Surface soils were acidic loams and silt loams with variable gravel content (average 15 percent). Ground surfaces had virtually no rock or bare soil exposed. Duff depth averaged 6.3 cm in the CLUN phase, but only 2.6 cm in the VACA phase.</p>
			<p><strong>Productivity/Management</strong>&#8212;Timber productivity is moderate to high (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#e3">appendix E-3</a>). Productivity was generally highest in the CLUN phase. Partial cutting tends to convert overstories to <span class="ital">Pseudotsuga</span> and eventually <span class="ital">Picea</span>. Clearcutting and seed-tree cutting will favor <span class="ital">Pinus contorta</span>, <span class="ital">Larix</span>, <span class="ital">Pseudotsuga</span>, or <span class="ital">Pinus ponderosa</span>. The vigorous growth, apparent ease of regeneration, and accessibility of the PICEA/CLUN h.t. offer opportunities for intensive timber management. However, much of the area of the habitat type has been cleared for grazing or farming. PICEA/CLUN often provides winter range for deer, and occasionally elk and moose. Use by domestic stock appears limited in natural stands.</p>
			
			<h4><a name="set1c"></a><span class="ital">Picea/Physocarpus malvaceus</span> h.t.<br /> (PICEA/PHMA; spruce/ninebark)</h4>
			<p><strong>Soil</strong>&#8212;Our stands were primarily on calcareous parent material (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#d1">appendix D-1</a>). Surface soils were acidic to neutral, gravelly (average 17 percent) loams to silts. Ground surfaces had virtually no rock or bare soil exposed; duff depth averaged 6.5 cm.</p>
			<p><strong>Productivity/Management</strong>&#8212;This is one of the better habitat types east of the Continental Divide (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#e1">appendix E-1</a>) for growth of <span class="ital">Pseudotsuga</span>. Timber productivity is moderate (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#e4">appendix E-4</a>). Potential for cattle grazing appears poor; however, sample stands showed evidence of considerable use by deer, elk, and moose, often with browsing of <span class="ital">Acer</span> and <span class="ital">Prunus</span>.</p>
			
			<h4><a name="set1d"></a><span class="ital">Picea/Galium triflorum</span> h.t.<br /> (PICEA/GATR; spruce/sweetscented bedstraw)</h4>
			<p><strong>Soil</strong>&#8212;PICEA/GATR was sampled on a variety of primarily noncalcareous parent materials (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#d1">appendix D-1</a>). Surface soils were loams to silts with reactions ranging from neutral to acidic. Ground surfaces had little rock or bare soil exposed; duff depth averaged 6.8 cm.</p>
			<p><strong>Productivity/Management</strong>&#8212;Timber productivity is moderate to high (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#e4">appendix E-4</a>); this is one of the most productive habitat types for <span class="ital">Picea</span> and <span class="ital">Pinus contorta</span> east of Divide in Montana. Silvicultural prescriptions leading to all-aged management of <span class="ital">Picea</span> should be considered as a possible management alternative.</p>
			<p>Pellet groups, trails and tracks, and browsing indicate that the habitat type is used by elk and deer as winter range. Some of the broad, flat mountain valleys associated with this type appear to be prime year-round moose habitat. Grazing by domestic stock was light in the sampled stands.</p>
			
			<h4><a name="set1e"></a><span class="ital">Picea/Vaccinium caespitosum</span> h.t.<br /> (PICEA/VACA; spruce/dwarf huckleberry)</h4>
			<p><strong>Soil</strong>&#8212;Our stands were on noncalcareous parent materials (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#d1">appendix D-1</a>). Surface soils were slightly acidic, gravelly (30 percent) loams and silt loams. Ground surfaces had virtually no rock or bare soil exposed; average duff depth was only 2.6 cm.</p>
			<p><strong>Productivity/Management</strong>&#8212;Timber productivity ranges from moderate to high (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#e3">appendix E-3</a>) with a good mixture of commercially valuable tree species. Well-drained soils and gentle topography offer opportunities for intensive timber management. The forage potential for domestic livestock is limited. However, PICEA/VACA is evidently used as winter range by elk and mule deer and may provide year-round habitat for moose and white-tail deer.</p>
			
			<h4><a name="set1f"></a><span class="ital">Picea/Senecio streptanthifolius</span> h.t.<br /> (PICEA/SEST; spruce/cleft-leaf groundsel)</h4>
			<p><strong>Soil</strong>&#8212;The PICEA/SEST h.t. was found exclusively on calcareous parent materials. Soil samples were not obtained, but field observations indicated soils were shallow and droughty.</p>
			<p><strong>Productivity/Management</strong>&#8212;Timber productivity is low, making this habitat type the least productive in the <span class="ital">Picea</span> series (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#e4">appendix E-4</a>). The sparse undergrowth provides little forage for domestic stock or big game. Some stands show evidence of light use by deer and elk.</p>

			<h4><a name="set1g"></a><span class="ital">Picea/Linnaea borealis</span> h.t.<br /> (PICEA/LIBO; spruce/twinflower)</h4>
			<p><strong>Soil</strong>&#8212;The PICEA/LIBO h.t. was sampled on a variety of primarily noncalcareous parent materials (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#d1">appendix D-1</a>). Surface soils were gravelly (24 percent) sandy loams to silts with reactions ranging from very acidic to slightly basic (mean pH 6.1). Ground surfaces had little rock or bare soil exposed; duff depth averaged 6.4 cm.</p>
			<p><strong>Productivity/Management</strong>&#8212;Timber productivity is moderate (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#e4">appendix E-4</a>). Also, the gentle topography associated with this type offers better opportunity for intensive timber management than many other east-side habitat types. Elk and deer use was conspicuous in most stands; several stands were also frequented by moose. Use by domestic stock was not observed in any of the sample stands.</p>
															
			<h4><a name="set1h"></a><span class="ital">Picea/Smilacina stellata</span> h.t.<br /> (PICEA/SMST; spruce/starry Solomon's seal)</h4>
			<p><strong>Soil</strong>&#8212;Our stands were on a variety of calcareous and noncalcareous parent materials (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#d1">appendix D-1</a>). Surface soils were mostly gravelly loams to silts. Reactions ranged from neutral to acidic (mean pH 5.9). Ground surfaces had virtually no rock or bare soil exposed; duff depth averaged 6.0 cm.</p>
			<p><strong>Productivity/Management</strong>&#8212;Timber productivity is moderate (<a href="habitat_types_MT_app.php#e4">appendix E-4</a>). Several stands showed light use by cattle, and moderate to heavy winter use by deer and elk.</p>
