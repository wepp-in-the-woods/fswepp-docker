			<h3 class="section"><a name="set2"></a><span class="ital">PINUS CONTORTA</span> (PICO) SERIES</h3>
			<p><strong>Productivity/Management</strong>&#8212;Timber potentials should be low to moderate in most of this series. From a practical standpoint, these sites can be managed as if <span class="ital">Pinus contorta</span> were climax even though <span class="ital">Pseudotsuga</span> or <span class="ital">Abies</span> may eventually invade the stand.</p>
			<p>Deer and elk may use these sites for cover and escape. These communities may have other values to wildlife or livestock, depending on the type of undergrowth that is present.</p>
			<p>Most of these sites have gentle terrain which provides easy access and development for recreation facilities. However, the recreationist may prefer areas that receive less frost and have a less monotonous appearance.</p>
			<p>The community types (c.t.'s) in this series represent situations in which <span class="ital">Pinus contorta</span> is the only conifer on the site. On some h.t.'s this situation occurs only in initial stages of secondary succession and indications of the climax community soon become evident. On other sites, climax indicators invade more slowly. Here, determining habitat type is more tenuous and often requires some interpretation following investigation of the site and adjacent sites. However, such conditions can also be handled within this classification.</p>
			<p>If the indicator species are present in the undergrowth, the stands can be assigned to the proper <span class="ital">Abies</span> or <span class="ital">Pseudotsuga</span> h.t. by using the key to <span class="ital">Pinus contorta</span> communities. Other sites where climax status for <span class="ital">P. contorta</span> is suspect can be treated as c.t.'s and managed as if <span class="ital">P. contorta</span> were climax. Although several conditions on gentle terrain are suspected to support <span class="ital">P. contorta</span> climax, only the PICO/FEID h.t. was found to consistently maintain <span class="ital">P. contorta</span> as the climax dominant.</p>

			<h4><a name="set2a"></a><span class="ital">Pinus contorta/Vaccinium caespitosum</span> h.t. <br />(PICO/VACA; lodgepole pine/dwarf huckleberry)</h4>
			<p><strong>Productivity/Management</strong>&#8212;For timber production, all stands of the PICO/VACA c.t. can be managed as the ABLA/VACA h.t. (see <a href="habitat_types_C-ID_07.php#set1h">ABLA/VACA</a>).</p>

			<h4><a name="set2b"></a><span class="ital">Pinus contorta/Vaccinium scoparium</span> h.t. <br />(PICO/VASC; lodgepole pine/grouse whortleberry)</h4>
			<p><strong>Productivity/Management</strong>&#8212;In all cases, <span class="ital">P. contorta</span> is the most suitable timber species and other management guidelines should follow those of the ABLA/VASC h.t. (see <a href="habitat_types_C-ID_07.php#set1o">ABLA/VASC</a>).
</p>

			<h4><a name="set2c"></a><span class="ital">Pinus contorta/Carex geyeri</span> h.t. <br />(PICO/CAGE; lodgepole pine/elk sedge)</h4>
			<p><strong>Productivity/Management</strong>&#8212;Timber potentials should be low to moderate. In all cases, <span class="ital">Pinus contorta</span> appears to be the most suitable timber species. Other management guidelines should follow those for the ABLA/CAGE h.t. (see <a href="habitat_types_C-ID_07.php#set1q">ABLA/CAGE</a>).</p>
			
			<h4><a name="set2d"></a><span class="ital">Pinus contorta/Festuca idahoensis</span> h.t. <br />(PICO/FEID; lodgepole pine/Idaho fescue)</h4>
			<p><strong>Soil</strong>&#8212;Soil parent materials are mostly quartz monzonite or granitics and occasionally andesite or quartzite. Textures vary from loam to sandy loam and are usually gravelly. The pH ranges from 5.0 to 5.9 and averages 5.4. Coverage of bare rock is usually less than 5 percent but areas of bare soil may reach 30 percent. Average litter depth on a site seldom exceeds 1 cm.</p>
			<p><strong>Productivity/Management</strong>&#8212;Timber potential is usually low to very low (<a href="habitat_types_C-ID_app.php">appendix E-2</a>). Trees regenerate consistently, but their growth is slow and their natural spacing is often quite wide.</p>
			<p>Forage production is usually low, but livestock use these sites for shelter and light grazing. In early spring when the soil is wet, cattle may uproot the small clumps of <span class="ital">Festuca</span> and thereby reduce forage yield and soil cover.</p>
			<p>Browse for big game is nil but where this h.t. borders meadows, it is used for cover by elk, mule deer, red fox, and coyotes. These sites may also have some value for elk calving and provide perches for raptors that hunt adjacent meadows.</p>
			<p>The gentle terrain of these sites provides easy access and development for recreation facilities, but recreationists may prefer more scenic diversity.</p>
