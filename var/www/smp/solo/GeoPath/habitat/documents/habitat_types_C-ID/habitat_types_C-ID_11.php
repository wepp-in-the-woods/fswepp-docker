			<h3 class="section"><a name="set1"></a>INDIVIDUAL ATTRIBUTES OF HABITAT TYPES</h3>
			<h4><a name="set1a"></a>Soils</h4>
			<p>Characteristics of the upper 10 cm of soil are summarized in <a href="habitat_types_C-ID_appD1.php">appendix D-1</a> and as a paragraph in each habitat type description. Soil samples and rock samples were first examined in the laboratory by a soil scientist (George Wendt, Richard Thompson, Norm Bare, or Laverne Nelson; USDA Forest Service) to determine the textural class and parent material. Air-dry samples were then weighed, sieved (2 mm) to separate the gravel, and reweighed to determine percent gravel content. The soil separate was tested for pH with a glass-electrode pH meter in a 12-hour water paste solution.</p>
			<p>Soil sampling and analyses were designed to obtain a simple characterization of surface soils for each habitat type, rather than detailed soil-vegetation relationships. Even our limited data (<a href="habitat_types_C-ID_appD1.php">appendix D-1</a>) make it evident that some habitat types are strongly controlled by edaphic or topoedaphic factors and have a narrow range of soil characteristics. The PIFL/FEID and PIEN/HYRE h.t.'s show a strong affinity for calcareous substrates. Several habitat types such as PIEN/CADI, ABLA/CACA, ABLA/CABI, and ABLA/STAM occur where water tables are close to the surface at least part of the year. Other habitat types such as PSME/CARU, ABLA/CARU, and ABLA/VASC occur on a broad range of soils. There is also a tendency for some of the wetsite habitat types to have the greatest litter accumulations and least exposed soil and rock. In contrast, the most severe habitat types have the least litter and greatest areas of exposed soil and rock.</p>
			<p>It is often theorized that vegetation or habitat types can be predicted from soil characteristics. But R. and J. Daubenmire (1968) have emphasized that correlation between habitat types and soil types (classified on the basis of standard soil profile characteristics) is too weak to allow prediction of habitat types from soil types, or vice versa. We support this viewpoint as a general rule for several reasons. First, the development of a soil profile reflects a long-term integration of soil forming factors, whereas vegetation development is much more sensitive to current climatic conditions. Second, soil classification systems are not designed to primarily reflect influences on vegetational development; therefore, predictive capabilities should not necessarily be expected. Third, vegetational development depends on many factors, of which soil characteristics is only one. According to the principle of factor interaction, plants are able to grow on a wide range of substrates when other factors provide compensatory effects.</p>
			<p>Land managers should be cautious about attempting to "shortcut" inventories of either vegetative potentials or soils through the process of "assumed correlations". Some useful correlations undoubtedly exist; but they must be developed objectively, tested adequately, and extrapolated with caution.</p>

			<h4><a name="set1a"></a>Vegetation: Timber Productivity</h4>
			<p>Timber productivity is one of the key management implications for which data were collected during this study. Site trees were selected to determine the potential height growth of relatively free-growing trees. One site tree of each species was selected for each stand wherever possible. Site trees showing marked suppression of diameter growth (diameter growth during a 30-year period less than growth during any subsequent 10-year period) were rejected during analysis of the increment cores. Diameter growth suppression of 10- and occasionally 20-year periods were not uncommon in the site trees remaining for productivity analyses. Old-growth and stagnated trees were not used for productivity estimation. Even though only a single site tree per species per stand was used, the data are reasonably consistent. Comparisons appear to be valid, and the large number of sample sites (541 stands) permits comparison of productivity among habitat types as well as variability within each habitat type.</p>
			<p>Determination of site index from height-age data requires specific procedures for each tree species. The number of years to reach breast height (4.5 feet [1.4 m]) must be measured or estimated for species having height-total age site curves. If a site curve is not available, a curve from another species must be substituted. Criteria used to determine total age, as well as sources of site index curves and yield capability data for this analysis, are summarized in <a href="#table3">table 3</a>.</p>

			<p>We used <span class="ital">Pinus ponderosa</span> curves for determining <span class="ital">Pseudotsuga</span> site index rather than Brickell's (1968) <span class="ital">Pseudotsuga</span> curves because the curve shapes for <span class="ital">Pinus ponderosa</span> are more realistic for our data (giving closer estimates for different-aged site trees in the same stand). Furthermore, because <span class="ital">Pinus ponderosa</span> yield tables are currently used to estimate <span class="ital">Pseudotsuga</span> yields in the Northern Rocky Mountains, it is more logical to use the <span class="ital">Pinus ponderosa</span> site index curves for <span class="ital">Pseudotsuga</span> height-age data.</p>
			<p>We used Alexander's (1967) <span class="ital">Picea engelmannii</span> curves rather than Brickell's (1966) because: (1) Alexander's are based on breast-height age (data available) rather than total age (estimate required); (2) the curve shapes are more realistic for our data (giving closer estimates for different-aged site trees in the same stand); and (3) yield data related to the curves are available (Alexander and others 1975). We also used Alexander's (1967) <span class="ital">Picea engelmannii</span> curves for <span class="ital">Abies lasiocarpa</span>, for which there are no site index curves available.</p>
			<p>The site index data (base age 50 years) have been summarized by species within habitat types (<a href="habitat_types_C-ID_app.php">appendix E-2</a>). The mean site index was calculated whenever three or more values were available. With five or more values, a 95-percent confidence interval for estimation of the true population mean was calculated. (The confidence interval narrows with both decreased variability and increased sample size.) The same procedure was used for summarizing basal areas of sample stands.</p>
			<p>Although site productivity can be compared by using site index alone, a more useful comparison can be made by using the estimated net yield capability of the site (cubic-volume production). Until managed-stand yield tables are completed, the best approach is to use natural-stand yield tables for assessing yield capability. As stated by Brickell (1970), "Yield capability, as used by Forest Survey, is defined as mean annual increment of growing stock attainable in fully stocked natural stands at the age of culmination of mean annual increment." (In other words, yield capability = maximum mean annual increment attainable in fully stocked natural stands.)</p>
			<p>The curves used to estimate yield capability from site index are presented in <a href="habitat_types_C-ID_fig37.php">figure 37</a>.</p>
			<p>Yield capability values are based on cubic feet of all trees (&gt;0.5 inch d.b.h.). The <span class="ital">Larix occidentalis</span> curve was derived from Schmidt and others (1976). (Brickell's [1970] curve for this species was only for trees greater than 5.0 inches in diameter.) The <span class="ital">Larix</span> curve was also used for <span class="ital">Pinus contorta</span> because Brickell's (1970) curves (trees &gt; 5.0 inches) are almost identical for the two species, and because natural-stand yield data have not been published for <span class="ital">Pinus contorta</span>.</p>
			<p>The <span class="ital">Picea</span> curve was derived from original data used in developing managed-stand yield tables (Alexander and others 1975). We calculated mean annual increment for all trees for 21 of Alexander's fully stocked natural stands near the age of culmination of mean annual increment (ages from 97 to 165 years). A linear regression of yield capability on Alexander's (1967) site index was conducted, converted to site index at base-age 50, and plotted in <a href="habitat_types_C-ID_fig37.php">figure 37</a>. (Yield capability = &#8722;26.0 + (1.84 x 50-year site index), R<sup>2</sup> = 0.66.) The other curves were developed by Brickell (1970) from natural-stand yield tables.</p>
			<p>The large spread in site index-yield capability curves (<a href="habitat_types_C-ID_fig37.php">fig. 37</a>) illustrates the importance of using species-specific curves for estimating productivity. We suspect that the <span class="ital">Abies grandis</span> curve (developed in northern Idaho) may be incorrectly estimating yield capabilities for central Idaho. However, we did not have central Idaho yield data to test the relationship.</p>
			<p>Our best current estimates of yield capability (in cubic feet/acre/year) for each habitat type are shown in <a href="habitat_types_C-ID_app.php">appendix E-2</a>. Procedures used to develop these estimates were:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Yield capability was estimated for each site tree from appropriate species curves according to the criteria in <a href="#table3">table 3</a>. These values were plotted by habitat type and phase for a visual display of distribution.</li>
				<li>Adjusted yield capability figures were developed for those habitat types where stockability appears to limit productivity. Basal area data for plots in these types were compared with Meyer's (1938) basal area data for fully stocked "normal" stands, following the approach of MacLean and Bolsinger (1973). This ratio was multiplied by yield capability for a given site index to determine the adjusted yield capability for each site tree.</li>
				<li>Mean yield capability (or adjusted yield capability) for all site trees in each habitat type was calculated and cutoff points were established to approximate 90 percent of the range of our data. Only those types with a minimum of five sample stands are shown in <a href="habitat_types_C-ID_app.php">appendix E-2</a>. A mean stockability factor is shown for those types where yield capabilities were adjusted.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These current best estimates (<a href="habitat_types_C-ID_app.php">appendix E-2</a>) portray both relative productivity of habitat types and the range of productivity within a habitat type. From these, it is possible to assign a ranking or qualitative rating of potential timber productivity of natural stands for use in planning.</p>
			<p>As Daubenmire (1976) emphasized, natural vegetation serves as a convenient indicator of productivity over large areas of land. However, productivity within habitat types (<a href="habitat_types_C-ID_app.php">appendix E</a>) often varies substantially. Reasons for this variability and suggestions for reducing it are as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Site-index curves were used to obtain productivity data from yield tables. Different height-growth patterns undoubtedly occur in different habitat types, but data to account for this variation are not available.</li>
				<li>Yield tables and site curves have not been developed for all species, making extrapolation necessary.</li>
				<li>Yields of mixed species stands can be estimated by several individual species' yield tables. We found that a range of 30 to 40 cubic feet/acre/year in yield capability was common in individual stands, depending upon the species used for estimation. The <span class="ital">Abies grandis</span> types show an unusually wide range in productivity because of relatively high site index values (<a href="habitat_types_C-ID_app.php">appendix E-1</a>) coupled with the high yield capability/site ratio (<a href="habitat_types_C-ID_fig37.php">fig. 37</a>).</li>
				<li>Some variability in productivity within a habitat type is to be expected within a natural classification system. The habitat type classification is based on abilities of species to reproduce and mature under competition, not on their rates of growth. The correlation between this and productivity is imperfect. (For instance, in some stands tree roots draw on underground water tables and achieve excellent growth rates, while surface drought limits establishment of tree seedlings and undergrowth.)</li>
				<li>Where a more accurate estimate of productivity is needed for local areas, we recommend taking additional site-index samples.</li>
				<li>It has been suggested that productivity estimates for habitat types could be improved by incorporating classifications of soils, topography, or climate. Differences in productivity within a habitat type due to topography or soils are apparent in some local areas. However, because of the limitations of existing site index curves and yield tables, further refinement of productivity estimates will likely require additional data and more accurate methods of estimating productivity. For instance, natural-stand yield capability could be estimated more precisely by direct measurements of volume growth, rather than by using site index to enter a yield table based on averages. This would require analysis of those existing timber inventory plots representing maximum growth potential and probably additional field measurements.</li>
				<li>Recent stand growth models (Stage 1973, 1975) utilize growth coefficients based on habitat types. These add a new dimension to yield prediction, provide the basis for developing managed-stand yield tables, and should improve our knowledge of productivity within and between habitat types.</li>
