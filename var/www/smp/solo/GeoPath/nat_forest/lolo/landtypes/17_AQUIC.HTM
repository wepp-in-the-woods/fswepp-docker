of SE1/4, section 20, T.16N, R.20W; map unit 38QA.  This soil is formed in 
<P>
glacial till deposits.  This soil is somewhat poorly drained.  The water table 
<P>
occurs at a depth of 4 to 5 feet.  The slope gradient is 10 percent on a 
<P>
northwest aspect at 5,000 feet of elevation.  The habitat type is subalpine 
<P>
fir/bluejoint. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
The A horizon has a silt loam to loam texture and 5 to 25 percent coarse 
<P>
fragments.  This horizon is less than 6 inches thick or can be absent in some 
<P>
soils. 
<P>
<P>
Some soils have Bo overlying Bw horizons.  The Bo horizons have silt loam 
<P>
textures, 8 to 10 percent clay content, and 5 to 15 percent coarse fragments. 
<P>
<P>
The Bw horizons have silty clay loam to sandy loam textures, up to 35 percent 
<P>
clay, with 15 to 85 percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has common medium 
<P>
distinct to many large prominant mottles.  This horizon has other moist colors 
<P>
such as 10YR 4/3 and 10YR 5/3.
