M.U. SETTING  The landform consists of steep, craggy breaks.  Rock outcrops
and talus are major components of the unit.  This map unit occurs along the 
<P>
Clark Fork River and several major order streams. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>M.U. COMPONENTS</U>  Soils are excessively drained, very shallow, and
rocky. Soils comprise less than 50% of the unit with the remaining portion
being comprised of bedrock outcrop and talus.  Bedrock is comprised of the
Belt Supergroup.  Native vegetation is sparse Douglas fir forest. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>ADJOINING M.U.</U>   Adjacent units are very steep, straight mountain
slopes that drain immediately into major streams and alluvial terraces at the
toeslope of this unit.

This map unit contains steep, very rocky mountain slopes.  Craggy breaks, rock
outcrop, and large deposits of talus occur in this unit.  Slopes vary with
orientation of bedrock sometimes forming shallow benches between outcrops. 
Large stringers of talus between outcrops are common.  Sediment delivery
effeciency potential is high due to steepness of slope and close proximity to
live streams, although, sources of fine sediment are few in this unit.

<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION </U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) OCCURRENCE</U>  The unit consists of sparse stands and
pockets 
<P>
of forest vegetation.  Habitat types include Douglas fir/ninebark (PSME/PHMA),
Douglas fir/snowberry (PSME/SYAL), Douglas fir/pinegrass (PSME/CARU), and
Douglas fir/Idaho fescue (PSME/FEID). 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE DISTRIBUTION</U>  PSME/PHMA AND PSME/SYAL occur as sparse
stands throughout the unit wherever bedrock does not restrict vegetation.
PSME/CARU and PSME/FEID occur on benches and pockets of deeper soils. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 5 percent dissimilar HTs. The dissimilar included HTs are 
PSME/AGSP on shallow soils and southerly inclusions. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Rocky, very shallow soils severely limit productivity in this unit.
Regeneration is very difficult.  Harvest suitability is poor in this map unit
due to sparseness of stands, low productivity, and very low success in
regeneration of stands. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>EXISTING VEGETATION</U> consists of sparse stands of Douglas fir forests
with occasional pockets of denser, more productive Douglas fir forests.  Seral
stands include Ponderosa pine and western larch.  The forest understory is
composed of dense stands of shrubs, dominated by ninebark or
snowberry.Understory vegetation also includes pinegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass,
spirea, pinegrass, serviceberry, and chokecherry. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Open stands of ninebark and snowberry occur without a conifer overstory in
rubble stringers.  Bluebunch wheatgrass and Idaho fescue occur on extremely
shallow soils at the interface of bedrock outcrops. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>OCCURRENCE</U> The unit is underlain by Belt supergroup metasedimentary
bedrock. The bedrock consists of thick to thin beds of argillites, siltites,
and quartzites.  Bedrock consistency varies by Belt Supergroup Formation. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Included with dissimilar properties are pockets of lacustrine or deltaic
deposits occuring in some draws or benches.  This material occupies less than
5% of the unit.  These deposits offer minor inclusions of deeper soils within
a map unit predominately of rock outcrop.  These inclusions can be identified
by change in stand density and productivity. 
<P>
<P>

<P>
<CENTER><U>SOILS </U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>GENERAL NATURE OF SOILS</U>  Soils are excessively drained, extremely
rocky, and very shallow. Soils are moderately coarse textured and contain
60-95% rock fragments. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>OCCURRENCE AND DISTRIBUTION</U>  The map unit is a complex of soils and
rock outcroppings.  Rock rubble, talus, and rock outcrop comprise &gt;50% of
the map unit.  Very shallow, rocky soils comprise 45% of the unit.  Soils
occur on benches and between rock outcrops. 
<P>
<P>
Small areas of dissimilar soils are included.  These soils are deeper and
occur on some benches and pockets of lacustrine or deltaic deposits. They
comprise 5% of the map unit. These soils have less rock fragments (35%-50%)
and are well drained.  They have medium textures and are somewhat more
productive. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</U> Surface layers have a brown to dark brown very
gravelly sandy loam about 3 inches thick.  The subsoil is an extremely cobbly
extremely stony brown sandy loam ranging from 10 to 17 inches thick. The
substratum is an extremely stony to fragmental sandy loam ranging from 0 to 3
inches thick. Depth to bedrock ranges 1-3 feet. Soil description ___ is
representative of the soils in this map unit. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>CLASSIFICATION REMARKS</U> The major soils are Lithic Ustochrepts, loamy
skeletal, mixed, frigid.  Included similar soils where bedrock is within 2
feet are Udic Ustochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid. 
<P>
<P>
The included dissimilar soils are Udic Ustochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed,
frigid where soils are 3 feet deep or deeper over bedrock.

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U> This map unit is poorly suited to timber management.  Potential
annual productivity is ______ cu.ft/acre/yr or very low. Slope steepness and
rock outcrop limit equipment operation.  Regeneration is limited by
droughtiness, talus, and bedrock outcrops. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U> This map unit is poorly suited to road construction.  Slope
steepness increases the quantity of material excavated.  Large amounts of
bedrock must be excavated, much of which is non-rippable.  Talus stringers and
extremely rocky soils make native road surfaces very rough and tire tread wear
is high. Rock fall from high cutbanks will be a maintenance problem. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U> This map unit is poorly suited to range management. Rock, rubble,
and steepness of slope limit access and mobility.  Minor inclusions may be
offer remote areas for grazing.  Forage consists of pinegrass, bluebunch
wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, serviceberry, and chokecherry. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U> This map unit offers potential bighorn sheep and
mountain goat habitat. Areas along the Clark Fork River between St. Regis and
Thompson Falls support bighorn sheep, presently.  Forage values are moderate
on most slopes and high on benches that have deeper soils. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U> The major watershed management concern is increased sediment
yield due to road construction. Sediment delivery efficiency is high but in
most cases, erodibility of soils is low due to high rock content. 
<P>
<P>
<U>VISUALS</U>  Units along the Clark Fork River and major order streams are
within retention.  Visual values are difficult to maintain because of steep
slopes which require extensive excavation during road construction and sparse
forest cover.
