<U>LOCATION AND SETTING</U>:  West-central Montana; Clark Fork River drainage;
SW1/4 
<P>
SW1/4, section 19, T.17N, R.26W; map unit 14XA.  This soil is formed in 
<P>
material derived from silty lacustrine deposits.  The slope gradient is 20 
<P>
percent on a SW aspect at 2900 feet of elevation.  The habitat type is Douglas 
<P>
fir/snowberry. 
<P>
<P>
These soils have very fine sandy loam to silt loam textures with 5 to 12 
<P>
percent clay. 
<P>
<P>
The A horizons are typically thin with silt loam textures. 
<P>
<P>
The Bw horizon is typically less that 5 inches thick. 
<P>
<P>
The C horizons are relatively shallow at 10 to 20 inches deep.  Depth to a 
<P>
weakly or strongly calcareous substratum is usually greater than 40 inches.
