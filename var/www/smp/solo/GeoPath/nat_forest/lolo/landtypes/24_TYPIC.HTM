<U>LOCATION AND SETTING</U>:  West-central Montana; Ninemile Divide; tributary
to 
<P>
Clark Fork River, Second Creek; NW1/4 NE1/4, section 7, T.16N, R.25W; map unit 
<P>
64QB.  This soil is formed in material derived from weakly weathered 
<P>
metasedimentary bedrock.  The slope gradient is 58 percent on a southwest 
<P>
aspect at 4,720 feet of elevation.  The habitat type is Douglas fir/ninebark- 
<P>
pinegrass. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
The E or 2E horizon has a silt loam to sandy loam texture, 8 to 14 percent 
<P>
clay, and 25 to 50 percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has other moist 
<P>
colors such as 10YR 6/3 and 7.5YR 4/2. 
<P>
<P>
Bw or 2Bw horizons formed in material derived from weakly weathered 
<P>
metasedimentary material have sandy loam textures and 10 to 14 percent clay. 
<P>
Bw or 2Bw horizons formed in material derived from moderately weathered 
<P>
metasedimentary material have silt loam to loam textures and 17 to 25 percent 
<P>
clay.  These horizons have 50 to 90 percent coarse fragments.  The upper end
of 
<P>
the range of coarse fragments represents soils that occur on steep slopes. 
The 
<P>
Bw horizon has other moist colors such as 2.5YR 5/4 and 10YR 5/4. 
<P>
<P>
The C or 2C horizon occurs at depths of 21 to 45 inches.  Some soils have B/C 
<P>
horizons.  Bedrock is 3 to 5 feet deep in these soils.
