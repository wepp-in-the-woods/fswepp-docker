<CENTER><U>SUMMARY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER>This map unit occurs on moderate relief mountain 
<P>
slopes.  Vegetation is dry, mixed coniferous 
<P>
forest.  Soils form in material weathered from 
<P>
moderately metasedimentary rocks.  Some soils have 
<P>
a surface layer formed in volcanic ash influenced

<CENTER><U>LANDFORM</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The landform consists of broad, gently sloping draws and convex sideslopes. 
Slopes are complex and are often influenced by the structure of the underlying
bedrock.  Most drainages are intermittent or ephemeral.  Drainage spacing
ranges from 1000 to 2500 feet and drainage patterns are trellis or parallel.

<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Existing </U> Vegetation is a mixed forest dominated by ponderosa pine,
western larch, and Douglas-fir.  Lodgepole pine occurs in some delineations in
the western portion of the survey area.  The understory in the Douglas fir HTs
is dominated by ninebark, twinflower in drainageways, serviceberry,
oceanspray, snowberry, oregon grape, kinnickinick, wood's rose, pinegrass. The
Douglas-fir/blue huckleberry-beargrass (PSME/VAGL-XETE) and grand
fir/beargrass (ABGR/XETE) HTs support blue huckleberry, beargrass, pine-
grass, rocky mountain maple, serviceberry, arnica, and pachystima and
twinflower in drainageways. 
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  Douglas-fir/ninebark-ninebark
(PSME/PHMA-PHMA) and grand fir/beargrass (ABGR/XETE) are the major HTs. 
Occurrence and distribution of these habitat types are associated with aspect
and elevation.  This map unit crosses a wide climatic transition boundary
within the survey area where PSME/PHMA-PHMA is more prevalent in the eastern
portion of the survey and ABGR/XETE is more prevalent in the west. 
<P>
<P>
East of Superior, PSME/PHMA-PHMA occurs below 4600 feet.
Douglas-fir/twinflower (PSME/LIBO) can occur in draws and on toeslopes.  These
habitat types occupy about60 
<P>
percent of the map unit.  Grand fir (ABGR/XETE) is on northerly aspects above
4600 feet and occupies less than 25 percent of the map unit.  ABGR/XETE is
rare in the Rock Creek drainage. 
<P>
<P>
West of Superior, grand fir/beargrass (ABGR/XETE) is on all aspects above 4600
feet. 
<P>
Grand fir/twinflower (ABGR/LIBO) can occur in draws and on toeslopes. This
habitat type occupies about 60 percent of the map unit.  PSME/PHMA-PHMA occurs
below 4600 feet  and occupies less than 25 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Douglas-fir/blue huckleberry (PSME/VAGL) occurs in the eastern edge of the
survey area above 4500 feet and is supported by a similar environment as grand
fir/beargrass (ABGR/XETE) in this map unit.   Douglas-fir/snowberry-snowberry
(PSME/SYAL-SYAL) is supported by some low elevation calcareous soils and is
supported by a similar environment as Douglas-fir/ninebark-ninebark
(PSME/PHMA-PHMA). 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent dissimilar HTs.  Grand fir/queencup beadlily
(ABGR/CLUN) can occur in moist drainageways and northerly toeslopes or
benches.  Timber productivity is higher in this HT.  Douglas
fir/ninebark-pinegrass (PSME/PHMA-CARU) or Douglas- fir/snowberry-pinegrass
(PSME/SYAL-CARU) occur on southerly inclusions.  Timber productivity is lower
and regeneration is limited by moisture and grass competition.

<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The unit is underlain by moderately weathered limestones, calcareous
argillite, 
<P>
non-calcareous argillite, and siltite of the Belt Supergroup.  Dominant
formations are Wallace, Helena, and Syeh.  Included as similar are Hasmark,
Libby, Empire, and St. Regis formations. 
<P>
<P>
The bedrock contains moderately weathered layers of metasedimentary rock that
produce soils with soft and moderately soft rock fragments and calcium
carbonate accumulations. Weathering of bedrock varies with hardness of bedrock
and local faulting.  Highly weathered bedrock layers can be present and are
generally associated with fault zones, saddles, drainages, and highly
dissected slopes.  Highly weathered zones of bedrock occupy 15 to 40 percent
of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent bedrock with dissimilar properties.  They are
weakly 
<P>
weathered metasedimentary bedrock of the Belt Supergroup.  Soils formed in
material from this bedrock are not calcareous, are less silty, have less
easily weathered rock fragments, and have a higher rock fragment content. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>SOIL 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Map Unit Summary</U>  Soils are well drained with medium or moderately fine
textures.  Soil properties vary with degree of weathering of the underlying
bedrock and aspect.  Some soils have surface layers formed in volcanic ash
influenced loess. Subsoil clay 
<P>
accumulations occur in soils formed from more highly weathered bedrock. 
Subsoils contain 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.  Rock fragment durability
can be quite low on highly weathered bedrock. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Composition</U>  Typic Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid form in
material from 
<P>
moderately weathered metasedimentary rock that is calcareous and are on
southerly 
<P>
aspects.  These soils are most common east of St. Regis.  Subsoils have
carbonate 
<P>
accumulations at a depth of 25 to 40 inches.  These soils occupy 35 to 55
percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Typic Eutroboralfs, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid form in material from
moderately to more highly weathered metasedimentary rock.  These soils have
subsoil clay accumulations with carbonate accumulations in the lower subsoil. 
They occupy 15 to 40 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid form in material
from moderately weathered metasedimentary rock that can be calcareous or
non-calcareous.  Calcareous soils have subsoil carbonate accumulations at a
depth greater than 40 inches.  Surface layers are formed in volcanic ash
influenced loess and are 8 to 13 inches thick.  These soils occupy about 25
percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent dissimilar soils and rock outcrop. Calcixerollic 
<P>
Xerochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid and Typic Xerochrepts, loamy
skeletal, mixed, frigid support Douglas-fir/ninebark-pinegrass
(PSME/PHMA-CARU) and Douglas-fir/snowberry (PSME/SYAL) on slopes that receive
high amounts of insulation.  Soils have an extended dry period during the
growing season and productivity is lower.  Rock outcrop occupies up to 5
percent of the unit.

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual productivity is moderate.  This map unit
contains some slopes suitable for tractor harvest.  Compaction of soil surface
layers can lower soil productivity.  Operating equipment only when soil is
dry, frozen, or snow-covered helps maintain soil productivity.  Shelterwood
and selection silvicultural systems improve regeneration on southerly aspects. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Roads should perform well with standard location, construction,
and maintenance practices on most of the unit.  Native rock fragments with low
durability break down over time under heavy traffic.  Unsurfaced roads rut
when wet in drainageways, on soils where bedrock is highly weathered, and
where soils contain few rock fragments.  Spot surfacing or seasonal haul
restrictions will help protect the road surface. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is poorly suited to range management.  The forest
understory produces little forage and slope steepness limits access. 
Southerly inclusion and clearcuts in the first years after harvest may offer
some forage. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  This unit can provide excellent deer and elk spring
and fall range when openings are present.  Where associated with southerly
slopes, this unit provides excellent deer and elk winter range thermal cover. 
Shrubs are a significant part of the 
<P>
stand structure and songbird populations tend to be high as a result. Timber
harvest can be beneficial in enhancing deer and elk forage or to increase the
overall age class diversity. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Skid trails and firelines have a moderate erosion hazard.
Roads have a 
<P>
moderately low erosion hazard.  Sediment delivery efficiency is low.
