<CENTER><U>LANDFORM</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The landform consists of high stream terraces, 15 to 40 feet above adjacent
streams. 
<P>
Terraces have nearly flat benches with gradients of less than 10 percent and
short steep descending slopes called risers along one side with gradients of
up to 45 percent.  Relief of risers is about 20 feet.  Included in map units
are streams traversing below these terraces with their associated floodplains
and low stream terraces.

<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION
<P>
</U></CENTER>
<P>
Existing  Vegetation is a mixed forest of Douglas-fir, western larch,
lodgepole pine, grand fir, and some western redcedar. The understory contains
dwarf huckleberry, oregon grape, serviceberry, pinegrass, twinflower, queencup
beadlily, rocky mountain maple, elderberry, and beargrass.  The more well
drained subalpine forest above 4700 feet are characterized by stands of
lodgepole pine with an understory of beargrass and blue huckleberry. 
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>   The map unit contains an association of
HT groups. Western redcedar/queencup beadlily (THPL/CLUN), grand fir/queencup
beadlily (ABGR/CLUN), and grand fir/twinflower (ABGR/LIBO) occur below 4600
feet.  This group occupies approximately 70 percent of the map unit.  These
sites have cool, moist climates. 
<P>
<P>
Subalpine fir/fool's huckleberry (ABLA/MEFE), subalpine fir/queencup beadlily
(ABLA/CLUN), subalpine fir/beargrass-blue huckleberry (ABLA/XETE-VAGL), and
subalpine fir/dwarf map unit. These HTs have cold, moist to very moist
climates and are located in narrow stream valleys which are subject to cold
air drainage.  ABLA/XETEVAGL and ABLA/VACA are confined to well drained
terraces high above groundwater influences. ABLA/MEFE and ABLA/CLUN occur on
lower terraces near streams edgeand at map unit bounds with steep mountain
slopes. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 5 percent dissimilar HTs.  Douglas fir/dwarf
huckleberry(PSME/VACA) occurs near map unit bounds at the lower elevations. 
Timber productivity is moderate and climates are drier.  Stream bottom
communities are icluded in those delineations that include stream channels and
floodplains.

<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY </U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The map unit is underlain by thick, very cobbly alluvial deposits. These
deposits 
<P>
comprise both stream and glacial outwash terraces.  Rock fragments are derived
from 
<P>
argillites, siltites, and quartzites of the Belt Supergroup. 
<P>
<P>

<CENTER><U>SOILS
<P>
</U></CENTER>
<P>
<U>Map Unit Summary</U>  Soils are well drained with moderately coarse
textures.  Soils have silty surface layers formed from volcanic ash influenced
loess.  Soils supporting subalpine fir forests have been found to remain cold
during the growing season while soil supporting mixed, moist coniferous
forests generally become warmer duringthe growing season.  Subsoils contain 55
to 80 percent rock fragments. 
<P>
<P>
Composition  Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid support
moist, mixed coniferous forests.  They have silty loess surface layers from 8
to 14 inches thick and a base saturation of more than 60 percent.  Similar
soils have base saturation less than 60 percent and support some western
redcedar stands.  These soils are Andic Dystrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed,
frigid.  Other similar soils have loess surface layers greater than 14 inches
thick and are Typic Vitrandepts, medial over loamy skeletal.  These soils
occupy about 60 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Andic Cryochrepts, loamy skeketal, mixed have silty loess surface layers from
8 to 12 inches thick and have moderately coarse textured subsoils.  Similar
soils have coarse textures in a portion of the subsoil or substrata.  They are
Andic Cryochrepts, sandy skeletal, mixed.  These soils occupy about 35 percent
of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 5 percent dissimilar soils and rock outcrop.  Andic Dystric 
<P>
Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed frigid supporting dry, mixed coniferous
forests.  They occur at lower elevation map unit bounds.  Climate is drier and
timber productivity is less.  Aquents occur along stream bottoms and support
riparian vegetation similar to Map Unit 10UC.

<U>Representative Profiles
<P>
</U>
<P>
These Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid have a soil
surface covered by a layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 4
inches thick.  Surface layers are dark brown gravelly silt loam about 14
inches thick.  Subsoils are yellowish brown extremely cobbly sandy loams about
25 inches thick.  Substrata are light yellowish brown extremely cobbly loamy
sands and sandy loams to a depth of 60 inches or more. 
<P>
<P>
These Andic Cryochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed have a surface covered by a
layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 2 inches thick.  Surface
layers are dark brown non-gravelly and very gravelly silt loams up to 14
inches thick.  Subsoils are brown extremely gravelly or cobbly sandy loams
about 35 inches thick.  Substrata are yellowish brown extremely gravelly
coarse sandy loams to a depth of 60 inches or more.

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual production is high.  Gentle bench surfaces are
well suited to tractor operation.  Cable systems may be used on terrace
risers.  The eastern portion of the survey area (Seeley and Missoula RD) has
thinner loess surface layers that are easily removed or displaced during
harvest and site preparation.  Removal or displacement of loess layer exposing
moderately coarse subsoil can reduce productivity and limit regeneration. 
Moisture stress and competition from graminoids limits regeneration on south
aspects.  Cold air drainage limits regeneration of some tree species. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Native road surfaces constructed in cobbly substratum materials
are rough and 
<P>
difficult to grade smoothly.  Many rock fragments are larger than 3 inches in
diameter. High cutslopes in this material tend to ravel because of the
uncohesive sandy substratum and rounded cobbles.  Care is required when
constructing roads in and near stream channels to keep sediment from entering
the channel system. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  Potential forage production is low.  Erosion can occur on trails
made on terrace escarpments that access stream bottoms. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  This map unit provides spring, summer, and fall
range for deer and elk, and in some circumstances, moose.  Cold air drainage
generally precludes winter use by deer and elk except in severe winters. 
Management that provides a variety of age classes and stand diversity with
minimal human disturbance will optimize wildlife values. Shrub forage is
greatly increased by vegetative manipulation. In occupied grizzly bear
habitat, berry-producing shrub communities provide late summer/fall forage. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Logging skid trails, firelines, and roads have a low erosion
hazard on benches. High sediment delivery efficiency on terrace escarpments or
risers contribute to high erosion hazards on these slopes.  The major
watershed management concern is protection of stream channels and banks
included in this unit.  Bridges and culverts should be carefully planned to
maintain channel stability.  Practices which disturb soils on or adjacent to
streambanks can increase stream sediment.
