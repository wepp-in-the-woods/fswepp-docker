Approximately 90 percent of the survey area is forested.  Currently, 60
percent  of the forest lands are classified as capable and available for
timber  management.  The principal commercial species are Douglas-fir, western
larch,  lodgepole pine, western white pine, Engelmann spruce, ponderosa pine,
grand  fir, western hemlock, and western redcedar.  The annual programmed sell
for the  Lolo National Forest as of 1989 is close to 102 million board feet.

<U>Habitat type(s)</U> are vegetative groupings based on the overstory climax
species  of the site.  The climax species is usually the most shade-tolerant
species,  which indicates that it is the species most adapted to that site. 
Where  identification of climax species stops at the overstory climax species
it is  referred to as the series--for example, Pseudotsuga menziesii
(Douglas-fir) or  abbreviated PSME series. The second component of the habitat
type is based on  the dominant or characteristic undergrowth species in the
climax plant  community.  Combining the overstory species with the understory
species  generates the habitat types--for example, Pseudotsuga
menziesii/Physocarpus  malvaceous (Douglas-fir/ninebark) or abbreviated
PSME/PHMA. Local use of  habitat types by forest managers has developed a
common network by which  managers can describe certain familar site conditions
and response to  management. Many interpretations can be generated using
habitat types.
<P>
 
<P>
<U>Common trees</U> are those tree species commonly occurring in the map unit.
Yield  (cubic feet/acre/year) is given for each tree species when information
is  available. Showing yields by tree species reflects the difference in 
productivity from one site to another between species. For example, ponderosa 
pine exists over a broad environmental range but is not uniformly as
productive  through that range. Douglas-fir may be more productive than
ponderosa pine in  one map unit and the reverse in another. This provides the
user with an  illustration of what species is the most productive for a
particular map unit.
<P>
 
<P>
<U>Yield</U> or yield capability is the amount of wood fiber that can be
produced from  managed forests. Technically, yield is  defined as the maximum
mean annual  increment attainable in a fully stocked natural stand and is
expressed in cubic  feet per acre per year. Yields were derived from a random
sampling across the  Lolo National Forest in 1978 to provide yield tables for
use in the Forest  Planning process. Approximately 2400 site trees were
measured by increment core  to determine site index and current (as of 1985)
yield curves were used to  determine yield capability. Habitat type transects
were also collected.  Soil  maps were later overlayed on these sample points
to identify the map units for  each sample point.  A yield table by tree
species is found in Appendix D.  Limited field verification of the 1978 site
index data in representative map  units reflects fairly good reliability. 
Because of sampling method used, these  yields may not reflect actual
potential yields under intensive management.  However, this data illustrates
relative productivity from one map unit to  another and stratifies
productivity by species within map units.
<P>
<P>
Standard yield capability classes have been defined by Pfister (1976). Yields 
from this data base show average yields in the survey area of less than 50 
cubic feet/acre/year. Standard yield classes place yields on the Lolo National
 Forest, on the average, to be moderate to very low. High and very high
classes  were not measured on the average. To provide better stratification of
 productivity for the survey, new classes were developed.  These classes
reflect  relative productivity within the survey area. These classes are
defined below.  When comparing productivity classes of this survey area with
another survey  area, one should convert these yields to Pfister's yield
classes.  Productivity  varies between ranger districts.  Missoula RD yields
are in the lower end of  these class ranges and Superior RD yields are on the
upper end of these ranges.

New Yield Capability Classes
<P>
 
<P>
     Very low - less than 20 cubic feet/acre/year
<P>
     Low      - 21 to 35 cubic feet/acre/year 
<P>
     Moderate - 36 to 45 cubic feet/acre/year
<P>
      High     - 46 to 60 cubic feet/acre/year
<P>
      Very high- 60+ cubic feet/acre/year
<P>
 
<P>
Note:  The percentage of the Lolo National Forest by Capability Class has been
 computed according to the original/standard classification.  These figures
are  listed in the Lolo National Forest Plan Appendix, section C-2-1.(These
standard  classes will not match up with the new classes developed here.)

<U>Natural Regeneration Suitability</U> ratings are based on moisture stress, 
competition, short growing season, frost heave, and shallow, rocky soils.
Every  tree species has a different ability to produce and distribute seed.
Seed  availability is a major factor in natural regeneration. Ponderosa pine
is known  to have long periods of low seed production and has a large seed
which is not  easily transported by wind for long distances.  Other tree
species have  characteristics that may inhibit natural regeneration, but they
are more site  specific or climatic and are not included in this
interpretation. Ponderosa  pine is included as a factor in the rating when it
is a dominant component of  the stand. (This assumes adequate site prep first
year post harvest.)
<P>
 
<P>
Note: Natural Regeneration is the ability for a site to renew standing crops
of  trees without artificial means. This rating does not include the length of
time  for establishment of a commercial valued stand. Some map units have a
high  suitability rating for natural regeneration but the length of time for
the  stand to reach commercial value size can be upwards to 250 years at high 
elevation.  Average time for stand rotation on the Lolo National Forest is 100
 to 130 years.  Re-establishment periods are rated in Table III-5, Timber and 
Silviculture Management.
<P>
 
<P>
These ratings were derived from standard forest tables rated by habitat type 
and have been modified to reflect soil property differences that affect  regeneration.
<P>
 
<P>
      A <U>Poor</U> rating indicates natural regeneration is unlikely. 
Moisture stress  limits regeneraton on southerly aspects and in open grown,
low elevation timber  stands.  Ponderosa pine is the major seral component.
This rating is also used  at high elevations where short growing season and
frost heave limits
<P>
 regeneration.  Brush and grass competition can also severely affect  regeneration.
<P>
 
<P>
     A <U>Fair</U> rating indicates that limitations can be overcome by the
use of  special harvest and site preparation practices or by planting. 
Moisture stress  on seedlings can be avoided by planting deep rooted stock to
ensure available  moisture to roots after the surface has dried. Providing
adequate shade by  leaving large fuels or shelterwood harvest will help
protect from moisture  stress on natural seedlings. In high elevation basins,
competition for light  will inhibit seedling germination and competition for
space will inhibit  seedling dispersal.  Frequently, only shade tolerant
seedlings and residuals  are regenerated in these basins unless special
practices are undertaken. Brush  removal and planting older stock soon after
harvest will increase chances of  establishing a fully stocked stand of
commercially desirable species.
<P>
 
<P>
     A <U>Good</U> rating indicates that the site is very suitable for natural
 regeneration, providing seed source is available.  Moisture and length of 
growing season are adequate.  Brush and grass competition is not a major 
problem on these sites.
<P>
 
<P>
Limitations to Natural Regeneration are noted where applicable.  &quot;No 
limitations&quot; is noted with a dashed line. </BODY>
