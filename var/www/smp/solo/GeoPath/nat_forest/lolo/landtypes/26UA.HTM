<CENTER><U>SUMMARY </U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER>The map unit consists of stream breaklands. 
<P>
Vegetation is dry Douglas fir. Rock outcrop and 
<P>
talus is a major component. Soils are formed from 
<P>
slightly weathered metasedimentary rocks.

<P>
</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
This map unit contains steep and very steep mountain slopes.  These slopes
usually have perennial streams at the toe of the slop.  Rock outcrop forms a
craggy appearance.  Slopes vary with orientation of bedrock sometimes forming
shallow benches between outcrops. Large stringers of talus between and below
rock outcrops are common. Drainages are rare and limited to intermittent or
ephemeral. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION
<P>
</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Existing</U>  Vegetation is a sparse forest of ponderosa pine and Douglas
fir intermixed between talus and rock outcrop.  The understory is dominated by
pinegrass, chokecherry, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, and snowberry. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>   Douglas fir/ninebark-pinegrass
(PSME/PHMA-CARU), SCREE, Douglas fir/bluebunch wheatgrass (PSME/AGSP), and
Douglas fir/snowberry (PSME/SYAL) are the major HTs.   PSME/PHMA and PSME/SYAL
occur as sparse stands where bedrock does not restrict vegetation.  These HTs
occupy about 65 percent of the vegetated portion of this map unit.  PSME/AGSP
and SCREE occur on southerly aspects where soil surfaces are extremely
gravelly.  These HTs occupy 25 percent of the vegetated portion of this map
unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 5 percent dissimilar HTs.  Douglas fir/twinflower
(PSME/LIBO) occurs in moist drainageways.  Grand fir/twinflower (ABGR/LIBO)
occurs along some moist toeslopes. Productivity is higher on these sites. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The unit is underlain by weakly weathered quartzite, siltite, and argillite of
the Belt supergroup.  The bedrock consists of weakly weathered layers of
metasedimentary rock that produce hard angular rock fragments.  Upper bedrock
layers are usually fractured and permeable to water.

Map Unit Summary  Rock outcrop and talus are major components of this map
unit.  Soils are excessivley drained with moderately coarse textures and
greater than 65 percent rock fragments in the subsoil.  Talus commonly has
loess influenced by volcanic ash filtered through the spaces beween rock
fragments. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Composition</U>  Rock outcrop and talus occur throughout and occupy greater
than 50 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Ochrepts occur along benches and between rock outcrops where soils have begun
to form. These soils have average depths ranging from 2 to 6 feet. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 5 percent dissimilar soils.  Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts,
loamy 
<P>
skeletal, mixed, frigid have a silty surface layer formed in volcanic ash
influenced loess and soil depth is greater than 6 feet.  They occur along
toeslopes, some upper more convex slopes, and some drainageways.  They support
PSME/LIBO and ABGR/LIBO. These soils are more productive. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Representative Profile</U> 
<P>
<P>
Ochrepts have a soil surface covered by a layer of partially decomposed forest
litter about 1 inch thick.  Surface layers range from brown to darkish brown
very gravelly loams to extremely gravelly sandy loams from 2 to 10 inches
thick.  Subsoil layers are typically brown extremely gravelly sandy loams from
7 to 30 inches thick.  Substrata is a pale brown extremely gravelly sandy loam
to a depth of 24 to 60 inches or more.

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual productivity is low.  Steep slopes and rock
can limit access to timber harvest.  Rock and moisture stress severely limit
regeneration. Natural regeneration recovery period is long. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Slope steepness increases the quantity of material excavated and
hard rock 
<P>
frequently limits excavation.  Lack of fine soil material and abundance of
large, angular rock fragments contribute to rough road surfaces.  Rocky
material exposed by road construction is difficult to revegetate and tends to
ravel on steep cutbanks.  Potential for landslides are high where deep soils
are encountered on steep slopes between rock outcrops. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is poorly suited to range management.  Slope
steepness limits access. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  This unit provides excellent yearlong bighorn sheep
and mule deer range.  Some delineations provide good elk winter range.  Forage
is limited to bunchgrass and sparse shrubs.  Increase in forage by
underburning has a moderate potential.  Rock outcrops provide excellent
nesting habitat for golden eagles and prairie falcons. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Firelines and roads have a low erosion hazard.  Slopes are
steep and sediment delivery efficiency is high.
