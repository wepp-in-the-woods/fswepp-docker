The E horizon has a silt loam to sandy loam texture, 6 to 19 percent clay, 
<P>
and 10 to 35 percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has other moist colors
such 
<P>
as 10YR 4/3 and 10YR 5/3.  Some E horizons are mixed with volcanic ash 
<P>
influenced loess.  These highly mixed horizons have a silt loam texture and 10 
<P>

<P>
Bw horizons formed in moderately weathered metasedimentary bedrock have silt 
<P>
