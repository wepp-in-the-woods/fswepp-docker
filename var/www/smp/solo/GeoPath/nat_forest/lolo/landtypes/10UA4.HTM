<P>
<P>
This map unit occurs in stream bottoms.  Soils are 
<P>
formed in a complex of well drained and poorly 
<P>
drained alluvial deposits. Native vegetation is a 
<P>
warm forested riparian community type.

<CENTER><U>LANDFORM </U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
This map unit consists of recent floodplains, perennial streams, and low
stream terraces 2- 10 feet above the existing stream channel.  Floodplains may
have braided stream channels that change course frequently.  Floodplains and
terraces have fluctuating water tables.  The lowest portions of these
floodplains flood annually. Other terraces may flood every 25 years or so. 
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION </U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>EXISTING VEGETATION</U> is ponderosa pine and Douglas fir on the well
drained stream terraces and cottonwood on the poorly draines soils and
floodplains. The forest understory is composed of  kinnikinnick, pinegrass,
snowberry, and Idaho fescue.  INCOMPLETE UNTIL FURTHER DOCUMENTATION. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>COMPOSITION</U>  The map unit contains a mosaic of habitat types and
vegetation 
<P>
communities that is determined by a complex pattern of well drained and poorly
drained soils.  Douglas fir series HTs and grassy meadow are on well drained
sites. The poorly drained and frequently flooded soils are occupied by wet
sedge meadows and stands of cottonwood.  A relatively warm climate and
moderate timber productivity is associated with this map unit.  Seasonal cool
air drainage may occur. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 5 percent dissimilar HTs.  Subalpine fir/queencup beadlily
(ABLA/CLUN), subalpine fir/common horsetail (ABLA/EQAR), and western
redcedar/queencup beadlily (THPL/CLUN) can occur in the upper elevation bounds
of this unit.  These HTs are colder and receive more precipitation.

<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY </U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The unit is underlain by alluvial deposits.  The alluvium consists of
stratified sands, rounded gravels, and silts.  These alluvial deposits can be
very thick, textures are usually stratified and are quite variable.  The
alluvial gravels are derived primarily by argillites, siltites, and quartzites
from the Belt supergroup.

<CENTER><U>SOILS </U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>COMPOSITION</U>  This map unit is a mosaic of well drained and poorly
drained soils depending on height of rise of water tables and proximity to
stream course. Soils have stratified subsoils and substrata that range from
non-gravelly silts to very gravelly sandy loams and some loamy sands. 
Frequent removal and/or deposit of surfacesoil by flooding modifies the surface.

<U>REPRESENTATIVE SOIL</U> 
<P>
Dummy profile for test.  The soil surface is covered by a layer of partially 
<P>
decomposed forest itter less than 1 inch thick.  The surface layer is brown 
<P>
silt loam about 16 inches thick.  The subsoil is dark yellowish brown 
<P>
gravelly silty clay loam about 14 inches thick.  The substratum, a greyish 
<P>
brown very cobbly sandy loam, overlies bedrock at depths as great than 20 
<P>
feet.  See the Typic Eutro discription. ....

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS </U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER </U> Timber productivity is moderate.  Productivity is dependent on
the finer alluvial soils because the coarser alluvial soils can be infertile. 
Slopes provide for tractor harvest.  Soil displacement will reduce site
productivity where a silty surface is removed and the coarse textured subsoil
is exposed. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Shallow ground water and seasonal flooding can limit
construction and increase maintenance.  Turnpiking can be used to overcome
problems with wet subgrades.  Flooding and stream channel changes can damage
bridges or culverts.  The small areas of deep silty alluvium have low bearing
strength and will rut.  Rocky subsoils and substrata produce rough road
surfaces. Surfacing improves the quality of the road. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is moderately suited to range management.
Potential forage 
<P>
production is high.  This map unit contains the highly sensitive riparian
areas.  Steep sideslopes in adjacent map units force cattle to stay in these
riparian bottoms which creates problems with overgrazing sensitive riparian
vegetation and compaction of wet soils. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  Protection from sediment production in streams is
critical for high quality fisheries. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO BE OBTAINED BY
BIOLOGISTS. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  The major watershed management concern is controlling
sediment produced when an activity causing soil disturbance occurs adjacent to
the stream. Proximity of streams to any disturbance in this map unit will be
less than 200 feet.  Stream channel changes can produce high amounts of
sediment.  Design of activities away from streamside and from altering natural
stream courses will promote streambank protection.
