<CENTER><U>LANDFORM</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The landform consists of recent floodplains, perennial streams, and low stream 
<P>
terraces 2 to 10 feet above the existing stream channel.  Braided stream 
<P>
channels that change course frequently are common.  Floodplains and terraces 
<P>
have fluctuating water tables and are subject to flooding. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Existing  Vegetation is a mixed forest of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir on
the well-drained stream terraces and a moist meadow community in mosaic with
spruce and cottonwood on the poorly- drained soils and floodplains.  Grand fir
and western larch are included in some stands west of Superior.  The forest
understory on well-drained sites is composed of  kinnikinnick, pinegrass,
snowberry, and Idaho fescue.  Poorly-drained sites can have bluejoint, sedges,
false hellebore, queencup beadlily, sweetscented bedstraw, willow, elderberry,
and rocky mountain maple. 
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION </U> The map unit contains a mosaic of
habitat types 
<P>
and vegetation communities that is determined by a complex pattern of 
<P>
well-drained and poorly-drained soils.  Douglas-fir series HTs and grassy 
<P>
meadows are on well drained sites.  They occupy about 60 percent of the map 
<P>
unit.  The poorly- drained and frequently flooded soils are occupied by wet 
<P>
sedge meadows, spruce/ queencup beadlily (PICEA/CLUN), and stands of 
<P>
cottonwood.  They occupy about 35 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 5 percent dissimilar HTs.  Subalpine fir/queencup beadlily 
<P>
(ABLA/CLUN), subalpine fir/common horsetail (ABLA/EQAR), and western redcedar/ 
<P>
queencup beadlily (THPL/CLUN) can occur in the upper elevation bounds of this 
<P>
unit.  These sites are colder and receive more precipitation. 
<P>
 
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The unit is underlain by alluvial deposits.  The alluvium consists of
stratified 
<P>
sands, rounded rocks, and silts.  These alluvial deposits can be very thick; 
<P>
textures are usually stratified and are quite variable.  The alluvial gravels 
<P>
and cobbles are primarily argillites, siltites, and quartzites from the Belt 
<P>
Supergroup. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>SOILS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Map Unit Summary</U>  Soils on terraces and away from streamside are well
drained 
<P>
with medium to moderately coarse textures.  Soils near streams and in low
swales 
<P>
are poorly drained.  Soils have 10 to 65 percent rounded rock fragments. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Habitat (HT) Composition</U>  Orthents are located near streams and on low
terraces, 
<P>
can have seasonal water tables, and are flooded periodically.  Spruce, cotton- 
<P>
wood, shrubs and scattered Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine are supported by
these 
<P>
soils.  Similar soils are Fluvents, Xerolls, and Ochrepts.  All soils have 
<P>
similar textures and seasonal water table fluctuation.  Fluvents are under 
<P>
graminoid or brush vegetation and have thinner surface layers and stratified 
<P>
textural layers due to frequent removal or deposition by flooding. Xerolls are 
<P>
under graminoids or scattered tree vegetation and have a darker surface layer. 
<P>
Ochrepts are under Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine forests and have a weakly 
<P>
expressed subsoil above the substrata.  Xerolls and Ochrepts are flooded 
<P>
infrequently.  These soils occupy about 65 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Aquepts occur at streamside and in bogs where water tables are high
year-round. 
<P>
These soils support bluejoint, willow, sweetscented bedstraw, sedge, spruce,
and 
<P>
cottonwood.  Similar soils are Aquents.  They have no subsoil development. 
<P>
These soils occupy about 35 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Representative Profiles</U> 
<P>
<P>
Orthents have dark yellowish brown sandy loam surface layers about 10 inches
thick.  Substrata are dark brown extremely cobbly sandy loams and loamy sands
to a depth of 60 inches or more. Strong brown mottles are often present below
15 inches. 
<P>
<P>
Aquepts have dark brown to grayish brown silt loam surface layers about 2
inches thick.  Subsoils are dark yellowish brown silt loams about 25 inches
thick.  Substrata are olive to dark gray silt loams to depths of 60 inches or
more.  Mottles are common to many and distinct throughout.

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual production is moderate.  Productivity is
dependent on 
<P>
the finer textured soil surface layers as the extremely cobbly moderately
coarse 
<P>
alluvial soils can be quite infertile.  Harvest activity should be directed
away 
<P>
from stream course to protect streambanks and to reduce risk of sedimentation. 
<P>
The terrain is well suited to tractor operation.  Tractor operation near 
<P>
streams, moist draws, and depressions can rut, compact, or puddle the soil and 
<P>
reduce soil productivity.  Designated skid trails that avoid wet areas or 
<P>
logging on deep snow will reduce potential for soil impacts.  Harvest activity 
<P>
should be directed away from stream course to protect streambanks and to
reduce 
<P>
risk of sedimentation. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Shallow ground water and seasonal flooding can limit
construction and 
<P>
increase maintenance.  Turnpiking can be used to overcome problems with wet 
<P>
subgrades.  Flooding and stream channel changes can damage bridges or
culverts. 
<P>
Areas with deep silty alluvium have low bearing strength and will rut. Rocky 
<P>
subsoils and substrata produce rough road surfaces.  Surfacing improves the 
<P>
quality of the road. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is moderately suited to range management.
Potential forage 
<P>
production is high.  Steep sideslopes in adjacent map units cause livestock to 
<P>
stay in these stream bottoms which creates problems with overgrazing sensitive 
<P>
riparian vegetation and compaction of wet soils.  Livestock traffic and
grazing 
<P>
along streambanks can decrease stability of streambanks which deliver sediment 
<P>
to the stream system.  Low stocking levels and fencing can reduce potential
for 
<P>
impacts. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  Young to mature stands of ponderosa pine and
Douglas-fir 
<P>
provide excellent yearlong whitetail deer range, particularly where associated 
<P>
with wet meadows and/or seral black cottonwood.  Forage is available from 
<P>
grasses and forbs in timbered understories, shrubs within poorly drained 
<P>
inclusions, and foliose lichens from timbered overstories.  Mature and old 
<P>
growth forests provide excellent habitat for a host of cavity-nesters and 
<P>
raptors.  Due to the dynamic nature of this unit caused by periodic flooding
and 
<P>
channel changes, habitat manipulation is often of little value and must be 
<P>
carefully weighed against needs for additional diversity to the habitat. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Skid trails, firelines, and roads have a moderate erosion
hazard. 
<P>
Sediment delivery efficiency is high because all soil disturbance is
relatively 
<P>
close to stream channels.  The major watershed management concern is
protection 
<P>
of stream channels and banks.  Bridges and culverts should be carefully
planned 
<P>
to maintain channel stability.  Practices which disturb soils on or adjacent
to 
<P>
streambanks can increase stream sediment.
