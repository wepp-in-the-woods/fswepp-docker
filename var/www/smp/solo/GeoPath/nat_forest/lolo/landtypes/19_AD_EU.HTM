O        6-0 ins. - Partially decomposed forest litter 
<P>
<P>
Bo  0-8 ins. - Dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky 
<P>
    structure; nonsticky and nonplastic; many medium, few fine and coarse 
<P>
    roots; 10 percent cobble; medium acid; clear wavy boundary. 
<P>
<P>
2E  8-14 ins. - Light gray (10YR 7/1) gravelly fine sandy loam; weak medium

<P>
    roots; 10 percent gravel, 5 percent cobble; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

2E/B     14-29 ins. - Light gray (10YR 7/1), very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very

<U>LOCATION AND SETTING</U>:  West-central Montana; Cabinet Mountains;
tributary to 
<P>
Thompson River, North Fork Murr Creek drainage; E1/2 of SE1/4, section 35,
T.26 
<P>
N, R.26W; map unit 30QD.  This soil is formed in a volcanic ash influenced 
<P>
loess overlying material derived from weakly weathered metasedimentary
bedrock. 
<P>
The slope gradient is 37 percent on a northwest aspect at 4,600 feet 
<P>
elevation.  The habitat type is grand fir/queen cup beadlily. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
The Bo horizon has a silt loam texture, 5 to 8 percent clay, and 5 to 20 
<P>
percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has other moist colors such as 7.5YR 
<P>
4/4 and 10YR 4/4. 
<P>
<P>
The 2E horizon has a sandy loam to silt loam texture, 4 to 17 percent clay, 
<P>
and 15 to 65 percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has other moist colors 
<P>
such as 7.5YR 4/4 and 10YR 4/4.  The wide range of characteristics of this 
<P>
horizon reflects influence by either loess or the underlying horizon. A few 
<P>
soils have 2E/B horizons underlying the 2E. 
<P>
<P>
2Bw horizons formed in moderately weathered metasedimentary bedrock have silt 
<P>
loam to loam textures, 14 to 20 percent clay, and 35 to 45 percent coarse 
<P>
fragments.  2Bw horizons formed in weakly weathered metasedimentary bedrock 
<P>
have sandy loam textures, 8 to 12 percent clay, and 45 to 95 percent coarse 
<P>
fragments.  These horizons have other moist colors such as 10YR 5/3, 10YR 6/4, 
<P>
and 2.5Y 5/4. 
<P>
<P>
2Bk horizons occur in soils formed in calcareous metasedimentary bedrock. 
<P>
Calcium carbonate accumulation can occur at depths greater than 60 inches in 
<P>
these soils. 
<P>
<P>
2BC and C horizons have been observed at depths greater than 40 inches. 
<P>
These horizons have moist colors such as 2.5Y 4/4 and 10YR 5/4.
