The map unit consists of dissected footslopes and

<P>
coniferous forest.  Soils are formed in volcanic 
<P>
ash loess overlying  highly weathered 
<P>
metasedimentary rocks. </CENTER>

<CENTER><U>TOPOGRAPHY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
This map unit contains complex, undulating footslopes and mountain slopes with
moderate relief.  The majority of the unit has slopes of less than 35% except
adjacent to drainageways.  Drainages are broad at the head and are
increasingly more entrenched downslope with sideslopes approaching 55% mid to
down stream. Most stream channels are ephemeral.  This map unit is most common
along major fault lines e.g. Osborn Fault where bedrock is highly weathered.

<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Existing</U>  Vegetation is a mixed forest of Douglas-fir, western white
pine, lodgepole, western redcedar, westen larch, and spruce. Subalpine fir is
often a component of this stand but not abundant enough to type into ABLA
HTs.The forest understory is dominated by twinflower, mountain maple, sitka
alder, queencup beadlily, and blue huckleberry. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  Grand fir/queencup beadlily (ABGR/CLUN),
grand 
<P>
fir/twinflower (ABGR/LIBO), and western redcedar/queencup beadlily (THPL/CLUN)
are major HTs.  ABGR/CLUN and THPL/CLUN occur throughout unit.  AGBR/LIBO
occurs on convex knolls on west and east aspects.  These HTs occupy 95 percent
of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 5 percent dissimilar HTs.  Grand fir/beargrass (ABGR/XETE)
occurs on upper slopes near edge of map unit. Productivity is lower on these
sites. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The map unit is underlain by highly weathered argillites and siltites of the
Belt 
<P>
supergroup.  This highly weathered bedrock occurs along major fault zones. 
This map unit is common along the Osborn Fault which trends east/west near
Superior through St. Regis along Mullan Gulch and north of Deborgia.  Soils
formed in this highly weathered bedrock are silty and substratum contains many
shaly rock fragments that have low durability. Many of these fragments crush
under slight pressure.

<P>
<CENTER><U>SOILS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Map Unit Summary  Soils are moderately well drained.  Surface soils form in
volcanic ash influenced loess and have a high silt content. Subsoils are
medium to moderately fine textured with 20 to 45 percent rock fragments.  Many
rock fragments are soft and can be crushed with slight to moderate pressure. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Composition</U>  Typic Eutroboralfs, fine loamy, mixed, frigid have slight
clay accumulation in the subsoils and occur throughout the map unit.  Similar
soils have less clay accumulation and are Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts, fine
loamy, mixed. These soils occupy 85% of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent dissimilar soils.  Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts,
loamy 
<P>
skeletal, mixed are formed from moderately weathered bedrock that have medium
textures and 35 to 55 percent rock fragment content.   These soils have rock
fragments of high durability.  Native road surfaces have higher bearing
strength than those constructed in the major soil. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Representative Profile</U> 
<P>
<P>
Typic Eutroboralfs, fine loamy, mixed, frigid have a soil surface covered by a
layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 1 inch thick.  Surface
layers are brown gravelly silt loams about 8 inches thick.  Subsurface layers
are brown gravelly silt loams about 11 inches thick.  Subsoils are pale brown
gravelly silty clay loams about 29 inches thick.  Some subsoils have calcium
carbonate accumulation below 35 inches in depth.  Substrata are yellowish
brown gravelly silt loams to a depth of 60 inches ore more.

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS </U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual productivity is hihg.   Broken dissected
slopes limit tractor operation.  Combinations of tractor and short line cable
systems should be considered. Compaction os soil surface layers can lower soil
productivity. Operation equipment only when soil is dry, frozen or snow
covered helps maintain soil productivity. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Native roads surfaces rut when wet because of low bearing
strength and are dusty when dry.  Surfacing helps control dust and prevents
rutting.  Material exposed by road construction tends to erode and slough. 
Revegetation is limited by surface crusts which form on substrata material
exposed by construction.  Seeding as soon as possible after construction helps
improve revegetation success. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is poorly suited to range management.  The forest
understory produces poor forage. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  This unit provideds excellent deer winter range and
fair deer summer range.  Forested stands provide thermal cover and forage from
foliose lichens and uncerstory shrubs.  Timber harvest can result in an
increase in shrub forage. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Skid trails, firelines and roads have a moderate erosion
hazard.   Sediment delivery efficiency is low.  Practices which disturb soil
on or near streams have a high potential for increasing sediment.
