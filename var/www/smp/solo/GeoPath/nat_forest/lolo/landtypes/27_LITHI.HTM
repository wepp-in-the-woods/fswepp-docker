<P>
Trout Creek; SE1/4 of NE1/4, section 14, T.16N, R.26W; map unit 22UA. This 
<P>
soil is formed in material derived from weakly weathered metasedimentary 
<P>
bedrock.  The slope gradient is 15 percent on a southeast aspect at 3,600 feet 
<P>
of elevation.  The habitat type is Douglas fir/bluebunch wheatgrass. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
The A horizon has a silt loam to sandy loam texture, 10 to 14 percent clay, 
<P>
and 30 to 85 percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has other moist colors 
<P>
such as 10YR 3/2 and 10YR 3/3.  The A horizon is less than 6 inches thick. 
<P>
<P>
The Bw horizon has a silt loam to sandy loam texture, 8 to 14 percent clay, 
<P>
and 55 to 90 percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has other moist colors 
<P>
such as 10YR 5/4 and 10YR 6/4.
<P>
 
<P>
The C horizon has a silt loam to sandy loam texture, less than 14 percent 
<P>
clay, and 60 to 95 percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has moist colors 
<P>
similar to the Bw horizon.  Depth to this horizon is from 9 to 14 inches. 
Some 
<P>
soils do not have C horizons.  Depth to bedrock is from 12 to 20 inches.
