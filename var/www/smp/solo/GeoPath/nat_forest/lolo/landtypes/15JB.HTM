<CENTER><U>TOPOGRAPHY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
This map unit consists of low relief footslopes, benches and fans positioned
at the base of moderate to high relief mountain slopes.  Drainageways are
broad and low gradient. Subsurface water is common in these drainageways. 
Ponds, seeps and perched water talbles occur along these drainageways and
occasionally in swales and depressions.

<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Existing</U>  Vegetation is a mixed forest with inclusions of non-forested
riparian.  The forest overstory is consists of western larch, lodgepole pine,
Douglas fir, grand fir, western white pine, and subalpine fir. Understory
vegetation has abundant shrubs which include serviceberry, mountain maple,
sitka alder, elderberry, and blue huckleberry.  Non-forested riparian consists
of sedge, bluejoint, aspen, and willow. 
<P>
<P>
<U>HHABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  This map unit contains grand
fir/twinflower (ABGR/LIBO), grand fir/queencup beadlily (ABGR/CLUN), and
western redcedar/queencup (THPL/CLUN). Similar included HTs are subalpine
fir/twinflower (ABLA/LIBO) and spruce/queencup beadlily (PICEA/CLUN). 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 20 percent dissimilar HTs.  Douglas fir/pinegrass
(PSME/CARU) and 
<P>
Douglas fir/blue huckleberry (PSME/VAGL) occur on moderately steep southerly
slopes and occupy less than 5 percent of the map unit.  Timber productivity is
lower in these HT. Non-forested riaprian forests occur on poorly drained areas
along broad, poorly defined drainageways.  High water tables pose limitation
to roads and timber.

<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY </U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
This map unit is underlain by valley fill material which has been deposited in
mountain valleys over a long period of time, most likely during Tertiary and
early Quaternary periods.  This valley fill material is highly variable.  Most
of the deposits exhibit a high degree of weathering in the subsoils with
higher than average clay contents for soils formed from Belt metasedmentary
rocks.  Rock fragment contents range from 0-45 percent, are poorly sorted, and
are mostly comprised of Belt metasedimentary rocks.  Stones occur at the
surface to a depth of 5 feet in some delineations.  Stony surfaces are most
common on fans formed below drainage channels flowing from adjacent mountain
slopes.  Glacial till deposits cap some of the valley fill benches.  Somewhat
poorly drained areas and ponds occur on pockets of fine and moderately fine
textured valley fill. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 5 percent parent materials derived slightly weathered
metasedimentary bedrock.  Rock fragment content is 45 to 75 percent and clay
content is less.

<U>Map Unit Summary</U>  Soils are moderately well drained with some poorly
drained inclusions. Subsoils are medium to moderately fine textured, have
subsoil clay accumulation and contain 0 to 45 percent rock fragments.  Surface
soils formed in volcanic ash influenced loess and have a high silt content. 
Some surfaces contain up to 40 percent large stones. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Composition</U>  Typic Eutroboralfs, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid support
moist, mixed 
<P>
coniferous forests and have 35 percent rock fragments in the subsoil. Similar
soils 
<P>
support subalpine forests and are Andeptic Cryoboralfs, loamy skeletal, mixed.
 They 
<P>
occupy about 50 percent of the map unit.

<P>
Typic Eutroboralfs, fine loamy ,mixed, frigid have less than 35 percent rock
fragments. These soils occupy about 35 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent dissimilar soils.  Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts,
loamy 
<P>
skeletal, mixed, frigid are on soil inclusions formed from Belt
metasedimentary bedrock. These soils have moderately coarse to medium textures
and have 55 to 75 percent rock fragments in the subsoil.  Quality of native
road surfaces is better on these soils. Aquepts and Aquolls are in poorly
drained areas supporting non-forested riparian.  These soils pose severe
limitations to roads and timber regeneration.

<U>Representative Profiles</U> 
<P>
<P>
These Typic Eutroboralfs, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid have a soil surface
covered by a layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 1 inch thick. 
Surface layers are dark brown silt loams about 13 inches thick. Subsurface
layers are yellowish brown cobbly silt loams about 19 inches thick.  Subsoil
layers are yellowish brown and brownish yellow very cobbly silt loams about 33
inches thick and have moderately thick clay skins. Substrata are below a depth
of 60 inches or more.

These Typic Eutroboralfs, fine loamy, mixed, frigid have a soil surface
covered by a layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 1 inch thick. 
Surface layers are dark brown silt loams about 10 inches thick. Subsurface
layers are yellowish brown gravelly sandy clay loams about 12 inches thick. 
Subsoil layers are yellowish brown gravelly heavy loams about 15 inches thick
and have moderately thick clay skins. Substrata are brownish yellow gravelly
silt loams to a depth of 60 inches or more.

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS </U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual productivity is high.  Tractor harvest or
equipment operation can compact or rut soils when they are moist.  Operating
tractors only when soils are dry, frozen, or snow covered helps maintain soil
productivity.  Designated skid trails that will avoid wet areas will reduce
potential for soil impacts. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Native roads surfaces rut when wet because of low bearing
strength and are very dusty when dry.  Surfacing helps control dust and
prevents rutting. Poorly sorted rock fragments over 3 inches in diameter
produce poor running surfaces. Seeps and poorly drained areas can be avoided
in most cases during road location. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is moderately suited to range management.  The
forest understory produces fair forage in recent harvest units.  Spring and
early summer grazing increases potential for soil compaction. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  This map unit provides spring, summer, and fall
range for deer and elk, and in some circumstances, moose.  Cold air drainage
generally precludes winter use by deer and elk except in severe winters. 
Management that provides a variety of age classes and stand diversity with
minimal human disturbance will optimize wildlife values. Shrub forage is
greatly increased by vegetative manipulation. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Skid trails, firelines, and roads have a high erosion
hazard.  Sediment 
<P>
delivery efficiency is low.  Only practices which disturb soil on or near
streams have a high potential for increasing sediment.
