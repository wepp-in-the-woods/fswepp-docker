<CENTER><U>TOPOGRAPHY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
This landform consists of low to moderate relief footslopes and terraces with
soured 
<P>
crests, undulating small benches, and broad, moderately sloping drainages. 
Some 
<P>
delineations have small areas of ponded water.

<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Existing</U>  Vegetation is a mixed forest of Douglas fir, grand fir, and
western larch.  The forest understory on southerly slopes is composed of
bluebunch wheatgrass, ninebark, snowberry, and pinegrass.  The forest
understory on northerly slopes is composed of twinflower, pinegrass, ninebark,
queencup beadlily, and beargrass. 
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  Douglas-fir/ninebark-ninebark
(PSME/PHMA-PHMA), 
<P>
Douglas-fir/pinegrass (PSME/CARU), and grand fir/twinflower (ABGR/LBIO) are
the major HTs.  PSME/PHMA-PHMA and ABGR/LIBO occur on northerly aspects. 
These HTs occupy about 40 percent of the map unit.  PSME/CARU occur on
southerly aspects and occupies about 35 percent of the map unit. 
Douglas-fir/bluebunch wheatgrass (PSME/AGSP) occurs on shallow soils on
southerly aspects and occupies about 15 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 10 percent dissimilar HTs.  Grand fir/queencup beadlily
(ABGR/CLUN) is on very moist northerly aspects and along northerly
drainageways. Soils have thick surface layers formed in volcanic ash
influenced loess.  These soils are more productive.

<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Surficial deposits are a complex of colluvial deposits from weakly weathered
Belt 
<P>
metasedimentary rocks, water scoured surfaces exposing bedrock, and extremely
gravelly coarse sandy alluvial lakeshore deposits on sideslopes and drainages.
Exposed bedrock and surficial geology is a result of submergence, scouring,
and wave action from Glacial Lake Missoula during glacial (quaternary) times. 
 Bedrock is composed of weakly weathered quartzite, siltite, and argillite of
the Belt supergroup. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 5 percent surficial deposits with dissimilar properties. 
These 
<P>
deposits contain sitly lakebed sediments and occur in low depressions and
along terraces. Some delineations have large boulders that occur along the
surface. Occurrence of these boulders is in association with narrow canyons
along the Clark Fork River where flood waters plucked rocks from adjacent
sideslopes.

<CENTER><U>SOILS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Map Unit Summary</U>  Soils are excessively drained and moderately coarse
to coarse textured. Subsoils contain 65 to 85 percent rock fragments.  Soil
texture and depth vary with topography.  Coarse textured soils occur on the
lower portion of the slopes and along sideslopes of drainageways.  Shallow
soils with depths less than 2 feet occur along crests of sideslopes and
benches.  Soils on north aspects have surface layers formed in volcanic ash
influence loess. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Composition</U>  Andic Udorthents, sandy skeletal, mixed, frigid are on
north aspects and support dry and moist, coniferous forests.  Surface layers
are formed in volcanic ash influence loess.  Subsoils are coarse textured. 
Similar soils are Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed frigid. 
They have moderately coarse textures and occur where there is less alluvial
influence in the parent material. These soils occupy about 40 percent of the
map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Udic Ustochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid are on east and west aspects. 
They have loamy surface layers and moderately coarse textured subsoils. 
Similar soils Typic Xerorthents, sandy skeletal, mixed, frigid.  They have
coarse textures and occur where there is more alluvial influence in the parent
material.  These soils occupy about 35 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Lithic Xerochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid are on southerly aspects. 
They support PSME/AGSP and PSME/CARU HTs.  Soil depth is less than 2 feet. 
Similar soils are Lithic Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid.  They
support PSME/LIBO and ABGR/LIBO HTs. These soils occupy about 15 percent of
the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 10 percent dissimilar soils and rock outcrop.  Typic
Eutroboralfs, fine silty, mixed, frigid are formed in silty lakebed sediments.
 These soils have moderately fine textures.  Native road surfaces rut when wet
and are very dusty when dry.  Timber productivity is higher on these soils.

<P>
<U>Representative Profiles</U> 
<P>
<P>
Andeptic Udorthents, sandy skeletal, mixed, frigid have a soil surface covered
by partially decomposed forest litter about 1 inch thick.  Surface layers are
light yellowish brown gravelly silt loams about 9 inches thick. Subsurface
layers are pale brown extremely gravelly coarse sandy loams about 9 inches
thick.  Substrata is a light yellowish brown extremely gravelly loamy coarse
sand to a depth of 60 inches or more. 
<P>
<P>
Udic Ustochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid have a soil surface covered by
partially decomposed forest litter about 1 inch thick.  Surface layers are
dark yellowish brown very gravelly loam about 7 inches thick.  Subsoils are
brown extremely gravelly sandy loams about 27 inches thick.  Substrata is a
brown extremely gravelly sandy loam to a depth of less than 40 inches. 
<P>
<P>
Lithic Xerochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid have very dark gray very
gravelly loam surface layers about 3 inches thick. Subsoils are brown
extremely gravelly sandy loams about 7 inches thick. Substrata is fragmental
with highly fractured quartzite rock to a depth of less than 20 inches.

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual productivity is moderately low on southerly
slopes, moderate on northerly slopes, and low on shallow soils.  This map unit
contains slopes suitable for tractor harvest.  Site productivity depends on
the relatively thin, finer textured soil surface layers.  Displacement of the
surface layers will decreaseproductivity.  Rotting wood is an
importantnitrogen source for southerly slopes.  Leaving large diameter logging
slash helps maintain fertility.  Shelterwood and selection silvicultural
systems improve regeneration on steeper south aspects with high insolation.
Regeneration is limited by moisture stress and effective rooting depth on
shallow soils. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Sandy material exposed in drainageways is subject to ravel on
steep cuts.  Hard rock frequently limits excavation.  Silty lakebed and
bouldery inclusions present localized limitations in some delineations. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>   This map unit is moderately suited to range management.
Potential forage 
<P>
production on southerly aspects is high and fair on northerly slopes. Dense
brush and steep short slopes may restrict access to portion of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  This unit provides excellent yearlong deer range
and good elk winter range.  Forage is available from small bunchgrass
openings, shrubfields, and lichen rich timber stands.   East, west, and
north0facing stands provice thermal cover.  Regeneration with underburning can
be beneficial by increasing shrub productivity on northerly aspects. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Skid trails, firelines, and roads have a low erosion hazard.
 Sediment delivery efficiency is low except at stream crossings.
