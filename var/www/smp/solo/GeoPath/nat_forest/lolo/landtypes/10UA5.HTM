<CENTER><U>MAP UNIT SUMMARY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
This map unit occurs in stream bottoms.  Soils are formed in a complex of well 
<P>
drained and poorly drained alluvial deposits.  Native vegetation is a warm 
<P>
forested riparian community type.

<CENTER><U>TOPOGRAPHY </U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
This map unit consists of recent floodplains, perennial streams, and low
stream 
<P>
terraces 2- 10 feet above the existing stream channel. Floodplains may have 
<P>
braided stream channels that change course frequently. Floodplains and
terraces 
<P>
have fluctuating water tables. The lowest portions of these floodplains flood 
<P>
annually. Other terraces may flood every 25 years or so. 
<P>

<CENTER><U>VEGETATION </U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>COMPOSITION</U> The map unit contains a mosaic of habitat types and
vegetation 
<P>
communities that is determined by a complex pattern of well drained and poorly 
<P>
drained soils. Douglas fir series HTs and grassy meadow are on well drained 
<P>
sites. The poorly drained and frequently flooded soils are occupied by wet
sedge 
<P>
meadows and stands of cottonwood. A relatively warm climate and moderate
timber 
<P>
productivity is associated with this map unit.  Seasonal cool air drainage may 
<P>
occur. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 5 percent dissimilar HTs. Subalpine fir/queencup beadlily 
<P>
(ABLA/CLUN), subalpine fir/common horsetail (ABLA/EQAR), and western 
<P>
redcedar/queencup beadlily (THPL/CLUN) can occur in the upper elevation bounds 
<P>
of this unit. These HTs are colder and receive more precipitation. 
<P>
<P>
<U>EXISTING VEGETATION</U> is ponderosa pine and Douglas fir on the well
drained stream 
<P>
terraces and cottonwood on the poorly draines soils and floodplains. The
forest 
<P>
understory is composed of  kinnikinnick, pinegrass, snowberry, and Idaho 
<P>
fescue.  INCOMPLETE UNTIL FURTHER DOCUMENTATION.

<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY </U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The unit is underlain by alluvial deposits. The alluvium consists of
stratified 
<P>
sands, rounded gravels, and silts. These alluvial deposits can be very thick, 
<P>
textures are usually stratified and are quite variable. The alluvial gravels
are 
<P>
derived primarily by argillites, siltites, and quartzites from the Belt 
<P>
supergroup. 
<P>
<P>

<CENTER><U>SOILS </U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>COMPOSITION</U> This map unit is a mosaic of well drained and poorly
drained soils 
<P>
depending on height of rise of water tables and proximity to stream course. 
<P>
Soils have stratified subsoils and substrata that range from non-gravelly
silts 
<P>
to very gravelly sandy loams and some loamy sands. Frequent removal and/or 
<P>
deposit of surface soil by flooding modifies the surface 
<P>

<U>CLASSIFICATION REMARKS</U> INCOMPLETE UNTIL FURTHER DOCUMENTATION.

<P>
<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS </U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U> Timber productivity is moderate. Productivity is dependent on
the finer 
<P>
alluvial soils because the coarser alluvial soils can be infertile. Slopes 
<P>
provide for tractor harvest. Soil displacement will reduce site productivity 
<P>
where a silty surface is removed and the coarse textured subsoil is exposed. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Shallow ground water and seasonal flooding can limit
construction and 
<P>
increase maintenance. Turnpiking can be used to overcome problems with wet 
<P>
subgrades. Flooding and stream channel changes can damage bridges or culverts. 
<P>
The small areas of deep silty alluvium have low bearing strength and will rut. 
<P>
Rocky subsoils and substrata produce rough road surfaces. Surfacing improves
the 
<P>
quality of the road. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is moderately suited to range management.
Potential forage 
<P>
production is high. This map unit contains the highly sensitive riparian
areas. 
<P>
Steep sideslopes in adjacent map units force cattle to stay in these riparian 
<P>
bottoms which creates problems with overgrazing sensitive riparian vegetation 
<P>
and compaction of wet soils. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  Protection from sediment production in streams is
critical 
<P>
for high quality fisheries. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO BE OBTAINED BY BIOLOGISTS. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U> The major watershed management concern is controlling
sediment 
<P>
produced when an activity causing soil disturbance occurs adjacent to the 
<P>
stream. Proximity of streams to any disturbance in this map unit will be less 
<P>
than 200 feet. Stream channel changes can produce high amounts of sediment. 
<P>
Design of activities away from streamside and from altering natural stream 
<P>
courses will promote streambank protection.
