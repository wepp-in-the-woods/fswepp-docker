<CENTER><U>LANDFORM</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The landform consists of broad, gently sloping draws, basins, and convex
sideslopes. 
<P>
Slopes are complex and are often influenced by the structure of the underlying
bedrock. Most drainages are intermittent or perennial, first and second order
streams.  Drainage spacing ranges from 800 to 1,500 feet and drainage patterns
are trellis or parallel. Subsurface drainage is common in zones of thin-bedded
bedrock. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Existing</U>  Vegetation is a mixed forest dominated by western larch,
Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, spruce, some subalpine fir, and mountain hemlock
(in TSME HTs).  Basins have more subalpine fir, spruce and mountain hemlock
than convex mountain slopes.  At upper elevation limits, western larch is a
less important component of the stand.  The understory consists of beargrass,
sitka alder, menziesia (in ABLA/MEFE HTs), rocky mountain maple, elderberry
(in ABLA/MEFE HTs), and blue huckleberry. 
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  Subalpine fir/menziesia (ABLA/MEFE) is
on northerly slopes, along drainageways, and in basins.  Subalpine
fir/beargrass (ABLA/XETE) is on convex upper mountain slopes and east and west
aspects.  Similar HTs, mountain hemlock/menziesia (TSME/MEFE) and mountain
hemlock/beargrass (TSME/XETE) occur west of Superior.  These HTS occupy at
least 75 percent of the map unit.  Subalpine fir/sitka alder (ABLA/ALSI) is
less frequent in occurrence than subalpine fir/menziesia (ABLA/MEFE) and
subalpine fir/beargrass (ABLA/XETE) and occurs on northerly convex slopes on
upper slopes near the ridge and as stringers within subalpine fir/beargrass
(ABLA/XETE) in swales.  Subalpine fir/sitka alder (ABLA/ALSI) occupies less
than 20 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 5 percent dissimilar HTs.  Grand fir/beargrass (ABGR/XETE)
and Douglas-fir/blue huckleberry (PSME/VAGL) can occur on southerly inclusions
at lower slope positions.  Timber productivity is lower on these sites. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The unit is underlain by moderately weathered limestones, calcareous
argillite, 
<P>
non-calcareous argillite and siltite of the Belt Supergroup.  Dominant
formations are Walace, Helena, and Syeh.  Included as similar are Hasmark,
Libby, Empire, and St. Regis formations. 
<P>
<P>
The bedrock contains moderately weathered layers of metasedimentary rock that
produce soft and moderately soft rock fragments.  Weathering of bedrock varies
with hardness of bedrock 
<P>
and local faulting.  Highly weathered bedrock layers can be present and are
generally associated with fault zones, saddles, drainages, and highly
dissected slopes.  Highly weathered zones of bedrock occupy 15 to 40 percent
of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent bedrock with dissimilar properties.  They are
weakly 
<P>
weathered metasedimentary bedrock of the Belt Supergroup.  Soils formed in
this material are less silty, have less easily weathered rock fragments,and
have a higher rock fragment content. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>SOILS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Map Unit Summary</U>  Soils are well drained with medium textures.  These
soils support 
<P>
subalpine forests.  They have a silty surface derived from volcanic ash
influenced loess. Subsoils have 35 to 55 percent rock fragments.  Rock
fragment durability can be quite low on highly weathered bedrock. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Composition</U>  Andic Cryochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed have loess
surface layers 8 to 14 inches thick.  Similar soils have slightly deeper loess
layers.  They occur along south and west of Superior on toeslopes and benches.
 They are Entic Cryandepts, medial over loamy skeletal, mixed.  These soils
occupy about 90 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 10 percent dissimilar soils and rock outcrop.  Andic
Dystric 
<P>
Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid occur on southerly aspects that
support cool, somewhat dry Douglas-fir forests dominated by ABGR/XETE or
PSME/VAGL. Soils are warmer during the growing season, growing seasons are
longer, and productivity is moderate.  Rock outcrop or rubble occupies up to 5
percent of the unit. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>Representative Profile</U> 
<P>
<P>
These Andic Cryochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed have a soil surface covered by
a layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 2 inches thick. Surface
layers are dark brown silt loams about 13 inches thick.  Subsoils are reddish
yellow very gravelly loams about 32 inches thick.  Substrata are strong brown
very gravelly loams to a depth of 60 inches or more.  Some rock fragments can
be crushed by moderate pressure by the hand. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual productivity is high on ABLA/MEFE and
ABLA/ALSI HTs.  Potential annual productivity is moderate on ABLA/XETE HTs. 
This map unit can contain some slopes which are suitable for tractor harvest. 
Compaction of soil surface layers can lower soil productivity.  Operating
equipment only when soil is dry, frozen, or snow covered helps maintain soil
productivity.  Regeneration competes for light and space with understory
vegetation in basins and northerly slopes supporting ABLA/MEFE and ABLA/ALSI
HTs. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Roads should perform well with standard location, construction,
and maintenance practices on most of the unit.  Care is required when
constructing roads in and near stream channels to keep sediment from entering
the channel system. Native rock fragments with low durability break down over
time under heavy traffic. Unsurfaced roads rut when wet in drainageways, on
soils where bedrock is highly weathered, and where soils contain few rock
fragments.  Spot surfacing or seasonal haul restrictions will help protect the
road surface. 
<P>
<P>
RANGE  This map unit is poorly suited to range management.  The forest
understory produces little forage and slope steepness limits access. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  This unit provides good deer and elk summer range.
The highest 
<P>
wildlife value is security cover from mature conifer communities when they are
available. Forage enhancement potential is low.  Menziesia provides forage
under fully stocked stands.  Consequently, security cover takes precedent over
forage enhancement for wildlife habitat needs.  Partial removal harvest can be
beneficial where age class diversity is severely limited. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Skid trails and firelines have moderate erosion hazard.
Roads have a 
<P>
moderately low erosion hazard.  Sediment delivery efficiency is moderate
because crossings of perennial streams are common.  This increases area for
sediment to enter the stream system.
