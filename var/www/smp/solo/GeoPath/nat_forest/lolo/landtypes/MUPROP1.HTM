<U>SUMMARY OF PROPERTIES THAT DIFFERENTIATE MAP UNITS
<P>
</U>
<P>
10.Ua    Recent well drained alluvial terraces that are within flood hazard.
<P>
         Soils are highly variable; silty, no coarse fragments to coarse with a
<P>
         high amount of rounded coarse fragments.
<P>
         VEGETATION: dry open stands of Douglas fir
<P>
<P>
10.Uc    Recent poorly drained alluvial terraces that are within flood hazard.
<P>
         Soils are highly variable; silty, no coarse fragments to coarse with a
<P>
         high amount of rounded coarse fragments.
<P>
         VEGETATION: wet shrub type; wet spruce and subalpine fir types
<P>
<P>
13.Ub    Remnant alluvial terraces and glacio-fluvial materials (coarse textured
<P>
         with high amounts of rounded coarse fragments) which are positioned
<P>
         high above the existing valley floor.  Soils in old alluvial materials
<P>
         may exhibit FeO3 weathering and clay illuviation.  These deposits are
<P>
         deep and are unstable when roadcuts are poorly positioned.
<P>
         VEGETATION: DF/VACA (Inclusions: DF/SYAL,PHMA,FEID)
<P>
<P>
13.Uc    Same as 13.Ub other than soils have an ash mantle. Soils in this unit
<P>
         are remain moist for longer periods than 13.Ub and therefore, risk of
<P>
         instability is greater.
<P>
         VEGETATION: GF/CLUN,LIBO
<P>
<P>
13.Jb    Same as 13.Ub other than soils have an relatively thick mantle of
<P>
         lacustrine silts. Some delineations may have a lacutrine silts and
<P>
         alluvium mixed.  Soil surface is moderately heavy textured,silty and
<P>
         subsurface is coarse and permeable.
<P>
         VEGETATION: DF/LIBO,VACA
<P>
<P>
13.Jc    Same as 13.Jb
<P>
         VEGETATION: GF/LIBO   C/CLUN
<P>
<P>
14.Ja    Low relief rolling foothills (remnant of L MSLA).  Soils are moderately
<P>
         heavy textured and silty (thick mantle of lacustrine)
<P>
         VEGETATION: DF/FEID,SYAL,PHMA
<P>
<P>
14.Jc    Same as 14.Ja.
<P>
         VEGETATION: GF/LIBO  (DF/VACA)
<P>
<P>
15.Jb    Moderately heavy textured soils derived from mixed alluvium
<P>
         (co-alluvium) and lacustrine. Also included are Tertiary deposits that
<P>
         are moderately heavy to heavy textured.
<P>
         VEGETATION: DF/LIBO;GF/LIBO
<P>
<P>
15.Ub    Medium textured to moderately coarse textured soils with 35%-50% coarse
<P>
         fragments. Slopes are 20-40%. (Co-alluvial and deep colluvial
<P>
         materials).</BODY>
