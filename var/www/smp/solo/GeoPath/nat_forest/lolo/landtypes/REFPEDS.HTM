<U>LOCATION AND SETTING</U>:  West-central Montana; Bitterroot Mountains; Elizabeth
<P>
Gulch; NW1/4 SW1/4 section 7, T. 15 N., R. 27 W., map unit 43.Sb.  This soil is
<P>
formed in a 14-inch deep volcanic ash mantle over moderately weathered Belt
<P>
argillite.  The slopes gradient is 10 percent on an east aspect at 5,400 feet
<P>
elevation.  The community type is a moist forest opening dominated by broken
<P>
fern, western coneflower, and sedges with scattered spruce and subalpine fir.
<P>
<P>
The ranges of selected characteristics for Andic Cryumbrepts are shown below.
<P>
These soils are formed in a 10- to 14-inch deep volcanic ash mantle over varied
<P>
substratum.  Subsurface textures range from silt loam in soft Belt sedimentary
<P>
bedrock to sandy loam in granitic bedrock.  Organic horizons have formed in the
<P>
ash mantle of these soils.  Rock fragments increase in volume and size from
<P>
surface to subsurface horizons.
<P>
<P>
Andic Cryumbrept, loamy-skeletal are like the reference pedon.  These soils
<P>
contain over 35 percent rock fragment throughout most of the profile with a
<P>
loamy fine material matrix.

* Joni - One soil was A/C hor. (shallow), the other bordered on frag, could have

been a C not a Bw as designated.  Also, parent materials were variable

here--from granite to Wallace which was changed to micaceous schist M to S).

<P>
Beartrap Fork of Fishtrap Creek drainage, SE1/4 NW1/4 section 16, T. 14 N.,
<P>
R. 28 W., map unit 74.Ba.  This soil is formed in glacial till derived from soft
<P>
sedimentary parent material with an ash influenced surface horizon to 11
<P>
<P>
                                     -4-
<P>
inches.  The slope gradient is 10 percent on a north aspect at 4,000 feet
<P>
elevation.  The habitat type is subalpine fir/queen cup beadlily - fool's
<P>
huckleberry.
<P>
<P>
The ranges of characteristics for Andeptic Cryoboralfs are shown below.  These
<P>
soils can be associated with several parent materials but are associated
<P>
primarily with glacial land forms.  Most soils are in fine-loamy or
<P>
loamy-skeletal families.  Eluvial surface horizons are developed in an 8- to
<P>
12-inch deep ash mantle.  Fine families have 0 to 15 percent gravel throughout
<P>
the profile.  Whereas, skeletal families contain 35 to 60+ percent gravel.  
<P>
<P>
Andeptic Cryoboralf, loamy-skeletal are like the reference pedon.  They have 8-
<P>
to 12-inch deep silt loam surface horizons composed of volcanic ash.  Subsoils
<P>
and substrata contain more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Clayey subsurface
<P>
textures are associated with soft sedimentary parent material.  Whereas, loamy
<P>
textures are formed from hard belt metasedimentary parent material. 
<P>
<P>
Andeptic Cryoboralf, fine-loamy differ from the parent material by having less
<P>
than 35 percent rock fragments throughout the profile.

LOCATION AND SETTING:  West-central Montana; Cabinet Mountains; Fishtrap

drainage; NW1/4 NW1/4 section 26, T. 25 N., R. 28 W., map unit 72.Ba.  This soil
<P>
<P>
                                     -6-
<P>
was formed in soft sedimentary glacial till with a 10-inch deep volcanic ash
<P>
mantle.  The slope gradient is 20 percent on a west aspect at 4,100 feet
<P>
elevation.  The habitat type is Douglas-fir/dwarf huckleberry.
<P>
<P>
The range of selected characteristics is shown below.  Typic Eutroboralfs can be
<P>
formed from several parent materials.  However, the primary parent material is
<P>
lacustrine valley fill derived from Lake Missoula silts.  The ash mantle varies
<P>
from nonexistent to 12-inch deep on these soils.  Surface horizons are extremely
<P>
variable.  Shallow organic, eluvial, or ash horizons are all present.  The major
<P>
family is loamy-skeletal with fine-loamy, clayey-skeletal, and fine-silty
<P>
representation.  The valley fill parent material produces primarily silty
<P>
clay-loam to sandy-clay-loam subsurface textures.
<P>
<P>
The soils formed in soft sedimentary continental till have silty or sandy clay
<P>
subsurface textures.
<P>
<P>
(Joni-by rough estimate frag families seem to occur on southerly slopes--the
<P>
fine families on northerly and westerly slopes.)
<P>
<P>
Typic Eutroboralfs, loamy-skeletal are similar to the reference pedon.  These
<P>
soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments throughout the profile.  They
<P>
are formed in undifferentiated, valley fill, and glacial till parent material.
<P>
<P>
Typic Eutroboralfs, fine-loamy are different from the reference pedon by having
<P>
less than 35 percent rock fragments throughout the profile.  These soils are
<P>
formed primarily in valley fill parent material but at a slightly higher
<P>
elevation than fine-silty soils.
<P>
<P>
Typic Eutroboralfs, clayey-skeletal are different from the reference pedon by
<P>
having clayey subsurface textures instead of loamy.  These soils are mostly
<P>
formed in soft sedimentary continental till.
<P>
<P>
Typic Eutroboralfs, fine-silty are different from the reference pedon by having
<P>
less than 35 percent rock fragments throughout the profile and silt instead of
<P>
loamy subsoil textures.  These soils are formed primarily in silty valley fill
<P>
parent material.

<P>
unit 30.Mb.  This soil is formed in highly weathered calcareous metasedimentary
<P>
substratum.  It occurs on a south aspect at 3,600 feet on a 50 percent slope
<P>
gradient.  The habitat type is Douglas-fir/ninebark-pinegrass.
<P>
<P>
The ranges of selected characteristics for Mollic Haploxeralfs are shown below.
<P>
Mollic Haploxeralfs are formed in moderately weathered (siltite and argillite)
<P>
metasedimentary substratum.  They occur on moderate mountain sideslopes.  Low
<P>
elevation soils have finer and more silty textures than the higher elevation and
<P>
<P>
                                     -9-
<P>
steeper slope soils.  This reflects an inclusion of soils formed in glacial lake
<P>
siltite?  Finer textures are also found near fault lines where they occur.  Most
<P>
soils are in the loamy-skeletal family.  (All occur on S to SE slopes.)
<P>
<P>
Mollic Haploxeralf, fine-silty occur at lower elevations and are more weathered
<P>
than the skeletal family.  They have a silty subsoil texture and less than 15
<P>
percent throughout the profile.
<P>
<P>
Mollic Haploxeralf, loamy-skeletal occur on steeper more eroded slopes at higher
<P>
elevations than the non-skeletal families.  Coarse fragments range from 45 to 55
<P>
percent through the profile.  Their subsurface texture is loamy.  The reference
<P>
pedon differs from the family as it contains 10 to 35 percent gravel and is
<P>
classified into the fine-loamy family.

Thompson River; Dearborn Creek drainage, NW1/4 section 26, T. 23 N., R. 28 W.,
<P>
map unit 41.Qa.  This soil is formed in a 16-inch deep volcanic ash mantle
<P>
overlying a very shallow subsurface soil of hard Belt metasedimentary parent

elevation.  The habitat type is subalpine fir/sitka alder.
<P>
<P>
The ranges of selected characteristics for lithic cryandepts are shown below.
<P>
These soils are associated with hard Belt metasedimentary parent material.  The
<P>
surface horizons are consistently deeper than subsurface horizons.  They are
<P>
formed in a 6 to 16 inch deep volcanic ash mantle.  In many cases, the ash
<P>
horizon composes the entire soil mantle overlying slightly weathered bedrock.

soil mantle is composed of volcanic ash 17 to 22 inches deep.  Some soils have
<P>
shallow eluvial surface horizons developed in the ash mantle.
<P>
<P>
Entic Cryandepts, medial over loamy-skeletal are like the reference pedon.  The
<P>
surface horizons have less than 35 percent rock fragments and the fine portion

LOCATION AND SETTING:  West-central Montana's tributary to Clark Fork River,
<P>
Sloway Gulch; S1/2 section 2, T. 17 N., R. 27 W., map unit 16.Ua.  This soil is
<P>
formed in deltaic alluvium originating from ancient Lake Missoula.  The parent
<P>
material is undifferentiated due to its mixed and varying origin.  This soil
<P>
occurs on a 30 percent gradient with a south aspect at 3,440 feet elevation.
<P>
<P>
Selected characteristics for Typic Xerorthents are shown below.  Surface
<P>
horizons on these soils are thin, organic, and have an average of 40 percent
<P>
less rock fragments than subsurface horizons.  Subsurface horizons average 75
<P>
percent rock fragments.  The sand content of these soils increases consistently
<P>
with depth.  The parent material for these soils is undifferentiated as it
<P>
consists of ancient Lake Missoula beach deposits which are of variable origin.

<P>
and at the most 10 percent clay.

32.Qd.  This soil is formed in a 12-inch, mixed volcanic ash mantle over hard
<P>
Belt metasedimentary substratum.  The slope gradient is 45 percent on a west

<P>
The ranges of selected characteristics for Typic Cryochrepts are shown below.  A

very mixed and 10- to 13-inch deep volcanic ash mantle occurs in these soils.
<P>
They are high in large rock fragments at a depth just beyond lithic
<P>
classification (14 to 20 inches).  They are generally shallow with sandy
<P>
textures throughout the profile.  This is due to their hard Belt sedimentary
<P>
origin.  A moderately deep organic horizon has formed in these soils.
<P>
<P>
Typic Cryochrepts, loamy-skeletal are like the reference pedon.  The fine

classification.  The profiles contain 35 or more percent rock fragments which

These soils are formed in an 11- to 13-inch deep volcanic ash mantle over
<P>
glacial till or calcareous metasedimentary substratum.  The soils that occur in
<P>
glacial till have sandy loam subsurface textures with 18 to 24 percent clay
<P>

below.  These soils are formed in Belt metasedimentary substratum and where it
<P>
occurs micaceous schist.  The reference pedon #1 displays a sandy subsurface
<P>
texture which occurs in the hard Belt and schistose substratum.  Whereas, soils
<P>
occurring on calcareous metasedimentary substratum as in reference pedon #2 have
<P>
silty subsurface textures.  These soils typically have eluvial surface horizons,
<P>
but volcanic ash or organically influenced surface horizons do occur.

<P>
<P>
The ranges of selected characteristics for Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts are shown
<P>
below.  These soils are formed in 7- to 20-inch deep ash mantles over soft
<P>
sedimentary to calcareous metasedimentary substratum.  Eluvial surface horizons
<P>
are typical and have finer textures and have fewer rock fragments due to the ash
<P>
influence.  Buried eluvial horizons, in the original substratum, are also
<P>
typical.  Some of these soils have carbonates in the profile.  However, these
<P>
horizons occur below a depth of 40 inches eliminating the Typic Eutrochrept
<P>
classification.
<P>
<P>
Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts, loamy-skeletal are like the reference pedon.  These
<P>
soils have &gt;35 percent rock fragments throughout the profile with loamy
<P>
textures.
