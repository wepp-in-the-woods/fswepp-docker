<U>REFERENCE PEDON</U>.  Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise indicated.
<P>
<P>
A   0-8 ins. - Dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very gravelly sandy loam, light
<P>
    yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure;
<P>
    nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium roots; 50 percent gravel;
<P>
    neutral; clear smooth boundary.
<P>
<P>
C1  8-15 ins. - Brown (10YR 4/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, pale brown
<P>
    (10YR 6/3) dry; massive to single grained structure; nonsticky and
<P>
    nonplastic; common medium, few coarse roots; 55 percent gravel, 8 percent
<P>
    cobbles; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. 
<P>
<P>
C2  15-21+ ins. - Brown (10YR 4/3) extremely cobbly loamy sand, pale brown
<P>
    (10YR 6/3) dry; single grained structure; nonsticky and nonplastic; 35
<P>
    percent gravel, 45 percent cobble, 5 percent stone; slightly acid

<U>LOCATION AND SETTING</U>:  West-central Montana; adjacent to Clark Fork
River; SW
<P>
1/4; section 3, T.18N, R.25W; map unit 10UA.  This soil is a Typic Xerorthent,
<P>
sandy-skeletal and is formed in alluvial deposits.  The slope gradient is 2
<P>
percent on a west aspect at 2,940 feet of elevation.  The habitat type is
<P>
Douglas fir/rough fescue.
<P>
<P>
<P>
These soils are formed in alluvial deposits predominantly of sand and gravel
<P>
and are excessively drained.  Some have volcanic ash influenced loess overlying
<P>
the alluvium.  They support open grown forests, dry Douglas fir, and dry, mixed
<P>
and moist coniferous forests.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Where A surface horizons are present,they have sandy loam textures, 6 to 10
<P>
percent clay, and 10 to 50 percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has other
<P>
moist colors such as 10YR 3/3 and 10YR 4/3.  Where Bo surface horizons are
<P>
present, they have silt loam textures, 6 to 8 percent clay, and 10 to 25
<P>
percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has other moist colors such as 10YR 3/6
<P>
and 7.5YR 3/4.  Some soils have a mixed A horizon which is similar to the
<P>
underlying Bo horizon.
<P>
<P>
The C horizons have sandy loam to sand textures, less than 10 percent clay,
<P>
and 15 to 70 percent coarse fragments.  These horizons have other moist colors
<P>
such as 10YR 4/3 and 10YR 6/3.  Colors become variable as textures change from
<P>
sandy loam to sand.  Depth to the C horizon is 4 to 11 inches.</BODY>
