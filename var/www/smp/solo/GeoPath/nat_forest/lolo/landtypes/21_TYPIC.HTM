<U>REFERENCE PEDON</U>.  Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise indicated. 
<P>
<P>
A   0-5 ins. - Dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, light brownish gray 
<P>
    (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly 
<P>
    and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium roots; less than 
<P>
    5 percent gravel; mildly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. 
<P>
<P>
Bw1 5-9 ins. - Brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 
<P>
    6/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky 
<P>
    and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; 25 
<P>
    percent gravel; mildly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. 
<P>
<P>
Bw2 9-19 ins. - Dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/3) gravelly silt loam, pale brown 
<P>
    (10YR 6/3) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable, 
<P>
    slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; 
<P>
    strongly effervescent; 25 percent gravel; mildly alkaline; gradual wavy 
<P>
    boundary. 
<P>
<P>
Bk  19-37 ins. - Grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) gravelly silt loam, light gray (2.5Y 
<P>
    7/2) dry; massive structure; firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 
<P>
    violently effervescent with disseminated lime; 30 percent gravel, 5
percent 
<P>
    cobble; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. 
<P>
<P>
Cr  37-47 ins. - Light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) very gravelly silt loam, light 
<P>
    gray (2.5Y 7/2) dry; massive structure; firm, slightly sticky and 
<P>
    nonplastic; violently effervescent; 25 percent gravel; 25 percent cobble; 
<P>
    moderately alkaline.

<U>LOCATION AND SETTING</U>:  West-central Montana; Ninemile Divide; Houle
Creek; 
<P>
SE1/4 NE1/4, section 8, T.15N, R.21W; map unit 30MC.  This soil is formed in 
<P>
material derived from moderately weathered metasedimentary bedrock. The slope 
<P>
gradient is 45 percent on a southwest aspect at 4,940 feet elevation. The 
<P>
habitat type is Douglas fir/ninebark-ninebark. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
The A horizon has either a moist value of 3 or 4, a moist chroma of 1 or 2, 
<P>
or a thickness less than 7 inches.  These horizons have a silt loam to loam 
<P>
texture and 12 to 14 percent clay.  Soils that include volcanic ash influenced 
<P>
loess have a Bo over an E horizon rather than an A horizon.  These Bo horizons 
<P>
are too impure or thin for andic classification.  The Bo horizon often has a 
<P>
moist color of 7.5YR 4/6 or 10YR 4/4.  The E horizon often has a moist color
of 
<P>
10YR 6/3 or 10YR 4/3. 
<P>
<P>
The Bw horizons have silt loam to loam textures, 13 to 18 percent clay, and 
<P>
25 to 60 percent coarse fragments.  These horizons have a neutral to
moderately 
<P>
alkaline reaction and other moist colors such as 10YR 5/3 and 10YR 6/3. 
<P>
<P>
The Bk horizon occurs at depths from 9 to 35 inches, has a moderately 
<P>
alkaline reaction, and is violently effervescent.  This horizon has a silt
loam 
<P>
to loam texture, 12 to 18 percent clay, and 35 to 60 percent coarse fragments. 
<P>
The Bk horizons have other moist colors such as 10YR 5/3 or 10YR 5/4. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
The Cr or C horizon occurs at depths from 32 to 40 inches.  Cr horizons are 
<P>
less common but occur on highly weathered calcareous argillite substrates. 
<P>
C horizons are underlain by hard, slightly weathered limestones or dolomites.</BODY>
