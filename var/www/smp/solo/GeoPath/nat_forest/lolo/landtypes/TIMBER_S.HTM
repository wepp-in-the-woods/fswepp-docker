 <U>Timber and silviculture</U> 
<P>
<P>
 <U>Plant competition</U> is the degree of competion from plants on the
standing crop  of trees intended for management. There are three categories of
competition  that can affect tree production; competition for moisture,
competition for  light, and competition for growing space. The ratings in the
table reflect the  degree of competion and whether it can be reduced or
controlled through  management.
<P>
 
<P>
     A <U>severe</U> rating indicates that plant competition is difficult to
overcome  even after scarification and temporary removal of plant materials
prior to  planting.  Production will be affected by this competition.  Sites
where  moisture is inherently limiting and trees are not as well adapted to
the site  competition from grasses for moisture and sometimes space severely
limits  stocking and survival.  Sod forming grasses are highly resilient and
grow back  readily after site preparation efforts.
<P>
 
<P>
     A <U>moderate</U> rating indicates that plant competition can be overcome
with  site preparation techniques such as scarification or prescribed burning.
High  elevation moist basins produce prolific shrub cover after harvest which 
produces competition for light and space for tree seedlings. These shrubs can 
be retarded by scarification long enough for tree seedlings to established. 
Competition is no longer a factor once the trees have grown over the shrub  layer.
<P>
 
<P>
     A <U>slight</U> rating indicates that plant competition rarely affects
production  of the standing crop.  Shrub cover after harvest rarely presents
competition  for light or space.  In addition, moisture is not a limiting
factor to growth. 
<P>
<P>
 <U>Stand Re-establishment Period </U>is the length of time for a standing
crop to  reach 18 inches high and/or the crop is free growing; unimpeded by
competition  or severe climate.  Rotation periods for regenerated stands vary
across the  forest from 80 to 200 years.  Stand establishment is often
included in  regeneration interpretations.  This rating is made exclusive of
regeneration to  highlight those map units in which <U>natural regeneration</U>
is high but the length  of time for the stand to become established is a very
long time.  The  re-establishment period often affects rotation periods.
Stands on high  elevation ridgetops and cirque basins supporting subalpine
fir/wood-rush and  other, near timberline habitat types may take as long as 50
years to become  established.
<P>
 
<P>
     A <U>poor</U> potential for stand establishment indicates that the stand
becomes  established after 25 years.  Short growing seasons, wind dessication,
high  insolation, moisture stress, frost damage, and heavy accumulations of
snow are  factors that can contribute to long periods for stand establishment.
<P>
 
<P>
     A <U>fair</U> potential for stand establishment indicates that the stand
becomes  established in 6 to 24 years.  Limitation factors listed above may be
present,  but timing of planting, harvest method, and/or tree species
selection can offer  solutions to these limitations.  
<P>
     A <U>good</U> potential for stand establishment indicates that the stand
becomes  established within a 5 year period.  Limiting factors are minor and
do not  affect the stand. 
<P>
<P>
 <U>Sensitivity to Displacement</U> rates the degree of sensitivity to
reduction of  soil productivity by removal or movement of the surface soil. 
When surface  soils are displaced, important organic matter and nutrient
sources are removed  and total productivity can be reduced.  Volcanic ash
influenced loess surface  soils common to the survey area have higher
nutrients levels, lower bulk  densities which enhance ease of root
penetrability, and higher water holding  capacities than those surface soils
derived from residual parent materials.  The majority of soils in the survey
area have relatively infertile subsoils  compared to the surface soil.  Depth
of surface soils, inherent productivity of  surface soils, and relative
infertility of subsoils are factors in rating soil  sensitivity to displacement.
<P>
 
<P>
     A <U>high</U> sensitivity rating indicates that productivity will be
adversely  affected by removal of 50 percent or more of the duff layer and
surface soils.  These landtypes have shallow volcanic ash influenced loess
surface soils of  less than 8 inches and/or alluvial or granitic subsoils.
<P>
 
<P>
     A <U>moderate</U> sensitivity rating indicates that adverse affects on 
productivity can be avoided or is not permanently affected by displacement. 
Volcanic ash influenced loess surface soils are greater than 18 inches or 
surface soils are derived from the same parent material as the subsoil or 
fertility of subsoils is relatively high. 
<P>
     A <U>low</U> rating indicates that soil productivity is not affected by a
50  percent removal or movement of topsoil. 
<P>
<P>
 <U>Equipment Use</U> rates the limitation to the use of crawler tractors,
rubber tired  skidders or mechanized harvesters.  Limiting factors are slope
steepness,  occurrence of rock outcrop, surface layers which rut and compact
when operated  on under normal moisture conditions, occurrence of wet sites,
and thin surface  layers that highly important to site productivity which may
be disturbed by  equipment operation.  Only the most restrictive limitations
are listed.
<P>
 
<P>
     A <U>severe</U> rating indicates that limitations are generally too
restrictive  for equipment use.  The limitation cannot be overcome by managing
the use of  equipment. The expected performance of this equipment is very
poor.  Aerial or  cable systems can overcome this limitation. 
<P>
<P>
     A <U>moderate</U> rating indicates that limitations do not prevent
equipment use.  Limitations can be overcome by controlling the time, location,
or intensity of  equipment operation.  The expected performance of equipment
is fair to good.
<P>
 
<P>
     A <U>slight</U> rating indicates that limitations do not restrict
equipment use.  The expected performance of equipment is good.
<P>
 
<P>
 <U>Windthrow Hazard</U> rates the potential for trees to blow over after a
harvest  entry in an old growth stand.  The rating can be used to determine
where  cutting unit design and the selection of silvicultural systems may have
to be
<P>
 modified to reduce windthrow mortality in the remaining stand.  The rating 
considers soil properties such as soils with high water tables, shallow 
soils,  coarse soil textures, or soils with layers that are restrictive to
tree roots  and affect how firmly roots are held.  Topographic position of the
stand  affects exposure of the stand to the wind.
<P>
 
<P>
     A <U>high</U> rating indicates soil properties that are favorable for
windthrow.  Mortality is probable even after careful cutting unit design has
been applied  to these areas. 
<P>
<P>
     A <U>moderate</U> rating indicates that some areas in the map unit are
susceptible  to windthrow.  Design of cutting units around the problem soil
areas can lower  windthrow problems.
<P>
 
<P>
     A <U>low</U> rating indicates that soil conditions do not make the trees 
susceptable to windthrow and special cutting unit design is not needed on
these  soils. </BODY>
