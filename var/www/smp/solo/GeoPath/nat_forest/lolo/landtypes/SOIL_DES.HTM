<P>
 
<P>
In this survey area, Boralfs are cool and cold soils with subsoil clay
accumulation.  The argiliic horizons contain approximately 20 to 50 percent
clay.  These soils are formed in material derived from a great variety of
parent materials which include soft sedimentary, moderately weathered
metasedimentary, and volcanic bedrock and lacustrine, valley fill, and glacial
till deposits.

<CENTER><U>Cryoboralfs</U></CENTER>
<P>
These are the cold Boralfs.  The assumption is made that the cryic temperature
regime is limited to landscapes dominated by subalpine fir or colder habitat
series.  They are formed in sedimentary and volcanic bedrock and in glacial
till.  They occur on moderate relief mountain slopes and gently rolling hills
in large glaciated valleys.  These soils occur under subalpinefir forests at
3,200 to 6,500 feet of elevation and receive from 20 to 40 inches of average
annual precipitation.

Andeptic Cryoboralfs, loamy skeletal, mixed-
<P>
These Cryoboralfs are formed in an 8 to 14 inch thick volcanic ash influenced
loess overlying material derived from soft sedimentary bedrock and glacial
till derived from metasedimentary bedrock.  The loess horizon is more fertile,
has a lower bulk density, and higher water holding capacity than its
substratum. (see Andepts for specific lab data).  These soils occur on
moderate relief mountain slopes, glacial morraine, and glacially scoured
mountain slopes.  They support subalpine fir forests.  These Cryoboralfs have
not been named as a major soil, but have been identified as similar to Typic
Eutroboralfs in four map units.

<P>
These are the cool Boralfs.  They support a variety of dry to moist coniferous
forests that vary in temperature regime up to cryic.  They are formed in all
of the parent materials described under Boralfs.  They occur on river
terraces, benches, moderate to steep relief mountain slopes, gently rolling
hills in glacial valleys, and glacially scoured mountainslopes.  They occur at
elevations from 2,800 to 5,800 feet and receive 15 to 55 inches of average
annual precipitation.

These are the Eutroboralfs with thick, dark surface horizons.  They are formed
in material derived from highly and moderately weathered metasedimentary
bedrock.  These soils support dry Douglas fir forests which are associated
with ustic moisture regimes.  They occur on moderate to steep relief mountain
slopes.  Mollic Eutroboralfs have been named as major soils in map units 30MB
and 64MB.  These soils occur in complex with Typic Ustochrepts in map unit
30MB and with Udic Ustochrepts in map unit 64MB.

These soils are formed in material derived from moderately weathered
metasedimentary bedrock, valley fill deposits, or glacial till deposits.  Some
soils have volcanic ash influenced loess overlying this material.  Horizon
characteristics vary due to differing parent materials.  They support dry
mixed and moist mixed coniferous forests; and cool, somewhat dry Douglas-fir
forests.  These soils have been named as major soils in map units 15JA, 15JB,

In this survey area, Orthents are cool, dry to moist soils with minimal
subsoil development. These soils are formed in undifferentiated alluvial and
some colluvial deposits.  Soils are somewhat excessively to excessively
drained except where proximity to streams creates a shallow water table. 
These soils occupy landforms such as stream bottoms, benches, rolling
foothills, and lakeshore scoured footslopes under coniferous forests. 
Elevation ranges from 2,800 to 4,500 feet with 20 to 35 inches of annual
precipitation.  They occur at elevations from 2,800 to 4,500 feet and receive

In this survey area, Psamments are cool, marginally moist/dry soils with
minimal subsoil development.  These soils are formed in sandy lacustrine
deposits.  They have less than 35 percent coarse fragments below 10 inches and
loamy fine and very fine sand textures.  These soils occur on rolling

<P>
In this survey area, Andepts are relatively fertile forest soils of cool and
cold climates.  These soils have thick volcanic ash rich loess surface layers
overlying rocky, coarse textured substratum materials derived from moderately
and weakly weathered metasedimentary bedrock.  The volcanic ash rich surface
contributes the major portion of fertility to soils by its higher cation
exchange, easier root penetration due to lower bulk density, and higher water
holding capacity than the coarser substratum.
<P>
 
<P>
Andepts have surface layers greater then 14 inches thick and have bulk
densities from 0.65-0.85 g/cm3.  In this survey area, cation exchange capacity
averages 20 meq/100 gms soil, available water holding capacity averages 35
percent at 1/3 bar for the surface layers.  In comparison, Belt
metasedimentary substratum cation exchange capacity ranges from 6 meq/100 gms
soil to 12 meq/100 gms soil and available water holding capacity ranges from 8
to 22 percent at 1/3 bar. Laboratory data indicates these loess layers contain
60 to 70 percent glass shards in the fine sand and silt particle-size
fractions.  Most of the shards seem to be from the 6,700 BP
<P>
eruption of Mt. Mazama (Crater Lake) in southwestern Oregon.  The loess is
silt loam in texture and is 60 to 80 percent silt.  It is not strongly
thixotropic but does have some properties suggestive of thixotropy.  X-ray
refraction data indicates large amounts of amorphous material in the clay
particle-size fraction.
<P>
 
<P>
Andepts can occur on gently sloping terraces to extremely steep mountain
slopes under coniferous forest.  Andepts are more common in the western
portion of the survey area and on north aspects and at higher elevations. 
They are common at elevations from 3600 to 6700 feet and receive 45 to 80
inches average annual precipitation.

Cryandepts are the cold Andepts.  These soils usually occur at elevations

under forest vegetation is limited to landscapes dominated by subalpine fir or
colder habitat series.  Most are in the 45 to 80 inch average annual
precipitaton zone.  Cold soil temperatures and shorter growing seasons are
expected to be most limiting to plant growth.

These soils are formed in glacial till deposits.  These soils are seasonally
saturated but lack the gray colors (gleying) indicative of wet conditions.  It
is thought that the typical reducing environment common in wet soils is not
present because of highly aerated water passing through these soils.  Red
mottles are present in the B and C horizons.  These soils support moist forest
openings and cool forested riparian community types.  These soils have been

These soils are formed in an organic matter rich volcanic ash influenced loess
overlying material derived from glacial till deposits or moderately or weakly
weathered metasedimentary bedrock.  Moderately coarse textures are most common
in soils from weakly weathered metasedimentary bedrock.  Organic matter ranges
from 8 to 15 percent in the umbric epipedon. These soils support moist forest
openings in a mosaic of subalpine fir forests.  They are named as major soils
in map units 38KA, 42QA, 43QB, and 43SA.  Andic Cryumbrepts occur in complex
with Andic Cryochrepts in map units 38KA and 42KA.

In this survey area, Xerolls are cool, dry soils.  They are formed in
moderately to weakly weathered metasedimentary and moderately weathered
granitic bedrock.  They have mollic surface horizons with 4 to 14 percent
organic matter content, and average CEC of 20 meq/gms of soil, and an average
water holding capacity of 29 percent at 1/3 bar.  In comparison, the subsoils
have a CEC rangeof 6 to 12 meq/100 gms of soil and a range of water holding
capacity from 8 to 22 percent at 1/3 bar.  These soils occur on moderate to
steep mountain slopes at elevations from 3,000 to 5,000 feet and receive 20 to
30 inches of annual precipitation.

These soils are formed in material derived from weakly and moderately
weathered metasedimentary bedrock.  They support open grown forests and
grasslands.  These soils are named as major soils in map units 30QA, 64MA, and
64QA.  Typic Haploxerolls occur in association with Calcixerollic Xerochrepts
in map units 30MA and 64MA and Typic Xerochrepts in map units 30QA and 64QA.
