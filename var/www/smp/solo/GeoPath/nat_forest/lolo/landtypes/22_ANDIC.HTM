<U>LOCATION AND SETTING</U>:  West-central Montana; Bitterroot Mountains;
tributary to 
<P>
the Clark Fork River, West Fork Fish Creek; SE1/4 of SE1/4, section 26, T.14N, 
<P>
R.25W; map unit 13UA.  This soil is formed in a volcanic ash influenced loess 
<P>
overlying alluvial deposits.  It occurs on a flat terrace at 3,280 feet of 
<P>
elevation.  The habitat type is Douglas fir/dwarf huckleberry-kinnikinnick. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Some soils have an A horizon with a silt loam texture, 6 to 8 percent clay, 
<P>
and 5 to 15 percent gravel.  This horizon has other moist colors such as 10YR 
<P>
3/4 and 7/5YR 3/2. 
<P>
<P>
The Bo horizon has a silt loam texture, 6 to 8 percent clay, and 15 to 40 
<P>
percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has other moist colors such as 10YR
4/3 
<P>
and 7.5YR 4/4. 
<P>
<P>
Soils formed in material derived from moderately or weakly weathered 
<P>
metasedimentary bedrock have 2E and 2Bw horizons. 
<P>
<P>
The 2C horizons formed in alluvial deposits have sandy loam textures, 3 to 10 
<P>
percent clay, and 45 to 75 percent gravel with 10 to 25 percent rounded 
<P>
cobble.  These horizons have other moist colors such as 10YR 5/4 and 10YR 5/6 
<P>
with variably colored sand grains.
