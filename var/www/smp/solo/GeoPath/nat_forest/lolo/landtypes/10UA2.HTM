<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>M.U. SETTING</U>  The landform consists of recent floodplains. Map units
are 
<P>
adjacent to perennial streams. 
<P>
<P>
<U>M.U. COMPONENTS</U>  Soils include both well and poorly drained types with
deep 
<P>
profiles developed in alluvial parent material. Soils have silty surfaces and 
<P>
very gravelly sandy loam subsoils. Native vegetation is Douglas fir forests
and 
<P>
fescue meadows. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ADJOINING M.U</U>.  Adjacent units are older, higher stream terraces in the
broader 
<P>
stream valleys. In narrow stream valleys, these map units are adjoined by very 
<P>
steep mountain slopes (streambreaks).

This map unit consists of recent floodplains and is adjacent to perennial 
<P>
streams and rivers. Streams on these floodplains commonly have braided
channels 
<P>
and change course frequently. These floodplains have fluctuating water tables 
<P>
and lowest portions of these floodplains flood annually.  Because this map
unit 
<P>
occurs adjacent to streams, any soil erosion is likely to become a source of 
<P>
stream sediment. 
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) OCCURRENCE</U>  The map unit contains a mosaic of Douglas
Series 
<P>
HTs and grassy meadows on well drained sites. The poorly drained and
frequently 
<P>
flooded soils are occupied by wet sedge meadows and stands of cottonwood. 
<P>
Dissimilar included HTs are Subalpine fir/queencup beadlily, common horsetail 
<P>
and western redcedar/queencup beadlily. 
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE DISTRIBUTION</U>  Douglas fir Series occur win a mosaic with
dry and 
<P>
wet meadows and cottonwood stands.  A relatively warm climate and moderate 
<P>
timber productivity is associated with this map unit.  Seasonal cool air 
<P>
drainage may occur. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to ____ percent dissimilar HTs. Dissimilar included HTs are 
<P>
ABLA/CLUN, EQAR AND THPL/CLUN. These HTs are colder and receive more 
<P>
precipitation. 
<P>
<P>
<U>EXISTING VEGETATION</U> is a Douglas fir forest.  Seral stands include
Ponderosa 
<P>
pine and Douglas fir.  The forest understory is composed of kinnikinnick, 
<P>
pinegrass, snowberry, and Idaho fescue.  INCOMPLETE UNTIL FURTHER
DOCUMENTATION.

<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>OCCURRENCE</U> The unit consists of recent alluvium. The alluvium consists
of 
<P>
stratified sands, gravels, and silts. These bottomlands deposits can be very 
<P>
thick and are variable in texture. The alluvial gravels are derived primarily
by 
<P>
argillites, siltites, and quartzites from the Belt supergroup. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>SOILS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>GENERAL NATURE OF SOILS</U>   This map unit is a mosaic of well drained and
poorly 
<P>
drained soils depending on height of rise of water tables and proximity to 
<P>
stream course. Soils have stratified subsoils and substrata that range from 
<P>
non-gravelly silts to very gravelly sandy loams and some loamy sands. Frequent 
<P>
removal and/or deposit of surface soil by flooding modifies the surface 
<P>
<P>
<U>COMPOSITION INCOMPLETE</U> UNTIL FURTHER DOCUMENTATION.

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U> This map unit is moderately suited to timber management. Timber 
<P>
productivity is moderate; ____ cu.ft/A/yr. Productivity is dependent on the 
<P>
finer alluvial soils because the coarser aluvial soils are infertile. Slopes 
<P>
provide for tractor harvest. Soil displacement will reduce site productivity 
<P>
where a silty surface is removed and the coarse textured subsoil is exposed. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  This map unit is moderately suited to road construction. Shallow
ground 
<P>
water and seasonal flooding can limit construction and increase maintenance. 
<P>
Flooding and stream channel changes can damage bridges or culverts. The small 
<P>
areas of deep silty alluvium have low bearing strength and will rut. Rocky 
<P>
subsoils and substrata produce rough road surfaces. Surfacing improves the 
<P>
quality of the road. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is moderately suited to range management.
Potential forage 
<P>
production is high. Because this map unit contains the highly sensitive
riparian 
<P>
areas, allotment plans should be designed with best practices for riparian 
<P>
management. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  Protection from sediment production in streams is
critical 
<P>
for high quality fisheries. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO BE OBTAINED BY BIOLOGISTS. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U> The major watershed management concern is controlling
sediment 
<P>
produced when an activity causing soil disturbance occurs adjacent to the 
<P>
stream. Stream channel changes can produce high amounts of sediment. Design of 
<P>
activities away from streamside will promote strambank protection.
