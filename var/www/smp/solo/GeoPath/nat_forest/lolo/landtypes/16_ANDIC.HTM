<U>LOCATION AND SETTING</U>:  West-central Montana; Cabinet Mountains;
Thompson Pass; 
<P>
NE1/4 of SW1/4, section 16, T.21N, R.32W, map unit 32QA.  This soil is formed 
<P>
in volcanic ash influenced loess overlying material derived from weakly 
<P>
weathered metasedimentary bedrock.  The slope gradient is 35 percent on a 
<P>
southwest  aspect at 5,760 feet of elevation.  The habitat type is mountain 
<P>
hemlock/beargrass. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
The Bo horizon has a silt loam texture, 5 to 8 percent clay, and 5 to 20 
<P>
percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has other moist colors such as 7.5YR 
<P>
4/4, 10YR 4/4, and 7.5YR 3/4. 
<P>
<P>
Bw/Bo horizons occur is some soils. They consist of loess mixed with the 
<P>
underlying material. 
<P>
<P>
The 2E horizon is similar in texture, clay percent, and coarse fragments to 
<P>
the 2Bw horizon.  This horizon has other moist colors such as 10YR 5/3 and
10YR 
<P>
6/3.  2E horizons derived from moderately weathered bedrock have moist colors 
<P>
such as 7.5YR 7/8 and 10YR 5/4. 
<P>
<P>
2Bw horizons formed in moderately weathered metasedimentary bedrock have silt 
<P>
loam to loam textures, l2 to 20 percent clay, and 35 to 50 percent coarse 
<P>
fragments.  These horizons have other moist colors such as 7.5YR 6/8, 2.5Y
5/4, 
<P>
and 10YR 5/6.  2Bw horizons derived from weakly weathered metasedimentary 
<P>
bedrock have loam to sandy loam textures, 8 to 12 percent clay, and 55 to 85 
<P>
percent gravel.  These horizons have other moist colors such as 10YR 5/4 and 
<P>
2.5Y 5/3. 
<P>
<P>
2Bt horizons occur in some glacial till soils, but lack sufficient clay 
<P>
increase for argillic classification. 
<P>
<P>
2C horizons formed in moderately weathered metasedimentary bedrock have 35 to 
<P>
50 percent coarse fragments. 2C horizons formed in weakly weathered 
<P>
metasedimentary bedrock have 60 to 90 percent coarse fragments.  Soils formed 
<P>
in glacial till have up to 50 percent stones in this horizon.  2C horizons
have 
<P>
other moist colors such as 10YR 5/6 and 10YR 6/4.
