<CENTER><U>TOPOGRAPHY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
This landform consists of low relief footslopes, benches and fans positioned
at the base of moderate to high relief mountain slopes.  Drainageways are
broad and low gradient. Subsurface water is common in these drainageways. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Existing</U>  Vegetation is a mixed forest dominated by western larch,
lodgepole pine, Douglas-fir, and western white pine.  Some drainages support
subalpine fir.  The understory is composed of blue huckleberry, twinflower,
pinegrass, and rocky mountain maple. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  Douglas-fir/twinflower (PSME/LIBO) and
grand fir/twinflower (ABGR/LIBO) are major HTs.  Subalpine fir/twinflower
(ABLA/LIBO) is a similar HT that occurs in some delineations above 4700 feet. 
These HTs occupy about 75 percent of the map unit.  Gramd fir/queencup
beadlily (ABGR/CLUN) occurs in swales and near drainageways and occupies less
than 15 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 10 percent dissimilar HTs.  Douglas-fir/dwarf huckleberry
(PSME/VACA) and Dougals-fir/blue huckleberry-beargrass (PSME/VAGL-XETE) can
occur on southerly inclusions.

<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY </U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
This map unit is underlain by valley fill material which was deposited in
mountain valleys over a long period of time, most likely during early
Quaternary periods.  This valley fill material is highly variable.  These deep
deposits have medium textures and clay contents with rock fragment contents of
35 to 60 percent.  Stones occur on the surface to a depth of 5 feet in some
delineations. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent parent materials derived from slightly weathered 
<P>
metasedimentary bedrock.  Rock fragment content is 45 to 75 percent and clay
contents are less. 
<P>
 
<P>
<CENTER><U>SOILS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>Map Unit Summary</U>  Soils are deep, well drained with medium textures.
Subsoils have 14 to 25 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Soil
properties vary with vegetation.  Surface layers silty surface layers formed
in volcanic ash influence loess. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Composition</U>  Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid
have silt loam surface layers about 7 to 14 inches thick formed in volcanic
ash influenced loess. Similar soils have loam surface layers with less loess
influence or thin loess layers less than 7 inches thick.  They are Dystric
Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid.  These soils occupy about 85
percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent dissimilar soils.  Typic Eutroboralfs, loamy
skeletal, 
<P>
mixed, frigid appear to be associated with swales and toeslopes.  They have
subsoil clay accumulation with high total clay content and less rock fragments
than the norm.  They have higher water holding capacity and higher clay
contents reduce bearing strength in native road surfaces. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Representative Profiles</U> 
<P>
<P>
Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid have a soil surface
covered by a layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 1 inch thick.
Surface layers are dark brown silt loams about 8 inches thick. Subsurface
layers are light gray loams about 14 inches thick.  Subsoils are very pale
brown very gravelly loams about 29 inches thick.  Substrata are light brown
very gravelly loams to a depth of 60 inches or more.

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual productivity is high.  The terrain is well
suited for tractor operation.  Tractor harvest or equipment operation can
compact or rut soils when they are moist.  Operating tractors only when soils
are dry, frozen, or snow covered helps maintain soil productivity. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Native roads surfaces rut when wet and near drainages. Surfacing
helps prevents rutting.   Subsurface drainages can be avoided in most cases
during road location. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is moderately suited to range management.  The
forest understory after harvest produces fair transitory range.    Spring and
early summer grazing increases potential for soil compaction. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U> This map unit provides good spring, summer, and fall
habitat.  Timber harvest or underburning can increase forage production. 
Foliose lichens are an important source of forage in the winter.  A diversity
of timbered and nontimbered areas can be provided for by timber harvest. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Skid trails, roads, and firelines have a moderate erosion
hazard.  Sediment delivery efficiency is low.  Only practices which disturb
soil on or near streams have a high potential for increasing sediment.
