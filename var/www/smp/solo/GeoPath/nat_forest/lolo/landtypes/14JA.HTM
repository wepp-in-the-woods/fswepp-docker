This map unit consists of low relief, dissected

<CENTER><U>TOPOGRAPHY
<P>
</U></CENTER>
<P>
The landform consists of rolling foothills to nearly flat benches in mountain
valleys along the Clark Fork River drainage.  Gentle undulating slopes have
broad ephemeral channels.  Benches near perennial streams and terraces from
ancestoral Clark Fork River channels have inclusions of steep escarpments. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Existing</U>  Native vegetation is a mixed forest with ponderosa pine and
Douglas-fir.  The understory is dominated by kinnikinnick, serviceberry,
chokecherry, snowberry, Idaho fescue, and rough fescue. Some delineations are
under cultivation or pasture. 
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  Douglas fir/ninebark-pinegrass
(PSME/PHMA-CARU), Douglas fir/twinflower (PSME/LIBO), and Douglas fir/elk
sedge (PSME/CAGE) are the major HTs. PSME/CAGE and PSME/PHMA-CARU are on
southerly aspects and occupy about 60 percent of the 30 percent of the map
unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 10 percent dissimilar HTs.  Douglas fir/Idaho fescue
(PSME/FEID) occurs on low elevation south aspects.  This HT is less
productive.  Grand fir/queencup beadlily (ABGR/CLUN) occurs on north aspects
in delineations near St. Regis near bounds of map unit.  This HT is more
productive. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The map unit is underlain by silty lake sediments originating from ancestral
Glacial Lake Missoula.  Many of these lacustrine sediments occurring on
benches have been reworked by the Clark Fork River creating areas predominated
by fine sands, silts, or clays.  The bedrock underlying these deep sediments
consist of argillites, siltites and quartzites of the Belt Supergroup. 
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>SOILS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Map Unit Summary</U>  Soils have moderately well drained with medium to
fine textures and have subsoil clay accumulation.  Silt content is very high
and rock fragments are rare. Calcium carbonate accumulation occurs in some
subsoils a depths below 5 feet. 
<P>
<P>
Composition  Typic Eutroboralfs, fine silty, mixed, frigid have light colored
surface layers and have 20 to 35 percent clay in the subsoils.  A similar soil
has dark colored surface layers.  These soils are Mollic Eutroboralfs, fine
silty, mixed, frigid.  Another similar soil has 35 to 50 percent clay content
in the subsoil.  These soils are Typic Eutroboralfs, fine, mixed, frigid. 
These soils occupy about 95 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 5 percent dissimilar soils.  Soils supporting ABGR/CLUN
occur near map unit delineation boundaries near St. Regis.  They are more
productive timber sites. These soils have a surface layer formed in volcanic
ash influence loess. They are Typic Eutroboralfs, fine-silty, mixed. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Representative Profile</U> 
<P>
<P>
Typic Eutroboralfs, fine silty, mixed, frigid have a soil surface covered by a
layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 1 inch thick.  Surface
layers are dark brown silt loams about 9 inches thick. Subsurface layers are
light brown and pinkish gray silt loams about 7 inches thick.  Subsoil layers
are dark brown silty clay loams about 16 inches thick with many thick clay
films.  Substrata is a brown silt loam with calcium carbonate pendants to a
depth of 60 inches or more.

<P>
<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual productivity is moderately low.  Tractor
harvest or equipment operation can compact or rut soils when they are moist. 
Operating tractors only when soils are dry, frozen, or snow covered helps
maintain soil productivity.  Moisture stress and competition from graminoids
limits regeneration.  Seedlings are subject to frost heaving. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Native roads surfaces constructed in silty subsoils rut when wet
because of low bearing strength and are dusty when dry.  Surfacing helps
control dust and prevents rutting.  Cutslopes are highly erosive, slough
easily, and are difficult to revegetate. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  Potential forage production is moderate to high.  Clearing
coniferous vegetation favors graminoid production over shrub production. 
Grazing when soils are wet can cause compaction.  Erosion can occur on
livestock trails. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  This map unit provides excellent whitetailed deer
winter range. 
<P>
Forage is available from foliose lichens and shrubs in forested stands.  Best
shrub 
<P>
response on these moderately fine textured soils has been observed after
thinning or 
<P>
shelterwoods rather than clearcuts. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Skid trails, firelines, and roads have a high erosion
hazard.  Sediment 
<P>
delivery efficiency is low.  Only practices which disturb soil on or near
streams have a high potential for increasing sediment.
