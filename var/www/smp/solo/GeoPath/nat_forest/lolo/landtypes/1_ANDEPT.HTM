    Mountains; Upper Fishtrap Area; NW1/4 of NE1/4; section 14, T.25N, R.28W; map unit 72OA.
    This soil is formed in volcanic ash influenced loess overlying material derived from
    glacial till deposits. The slope gradient is 5 percent on a north aspect at 4,000 feet of
    elevation. The habitat type is subalpine fir/dwarf huckleberry. </td>

  <tr>
    <td width="100%" valign="top">The Bo horizon has a silt loam texture, 6 to 12 percent
    clay, and 0 to 20 coarse fragments. This horizon has another moist color of 10YR 4/4. Some
    soils have a thin and often discontinuous E horizon. <p>The 2E horizon has a loam to silt
    loam texture, 12 to 20 percent clay, and 15 to 45 percent coarse fragments. This horizon
    has other moist colors such as 10YR 4/3 and 10YR 6/3. Some soils have 2Bw or 2E/B horizons
    underlying the 2E horizon. </p>
    <p>The 2E/Bt horizon has a loam to sandy loam texture, 16 to 23 percent clay, and 35 to 55
    percent coarse fragments. This horizon has few to common thin to moderately thick clay
    films lining pores and on ped faces. The 2E&amp;Bt horizon has other moist mixed color
    such as 7.5YR 5/6. </p>
    <p>The 2Bt horizon has a sandy clay loam to silty clay loam texture, 22 to 29 percent
    clay, and 35 to 45 percent coarse fragments. This horizon has few to many moderately thick
    to thick clay films lining pores and on ped faces. The Bt horizon is 7 to 40 inches thick
    and 20 to 30 inches deep. This horizon has other moist colors such as 7.5YR 4/4 and 10YR
    5/6. Some soils have 2BC horizons underlying the 2Bt horizon. </p>
    <p>The 2C or 3C horizon has a loam to coarse sandy loam texture in material derived from
    glacial till deposits or metasedimentary bedrock. This horizon has a silt loam texture in
    material derived from soft sedimentary bedrock. The 2C horizon has 12 to 30 percent clay.
    Soils formed from soft sedimentary bedrock occupy the higher end of the textural range.
    This horizon has 55 to 65 percent coarse fragments. This horizon has other moist colors
    such as 7.5YR 5/4 and 10YR 4/4. </td>
