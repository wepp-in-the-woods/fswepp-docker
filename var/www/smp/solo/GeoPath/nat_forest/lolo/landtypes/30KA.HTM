<P>
This map unit occurs on moderate relief mountain

slopes.  Vegetation is cool, somewhat dry Douglas-

<P>
moderately well weathered or grussic granitics. </CENTER>

<CENTER><U>LANDFORM</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The landform consists of broad, moderately sloping draws and convex
sideslopes.  Slopes are smooth and convex.  Most drainages are intermittent or
ephemeral. Drainage spacing ranges from 1,000 to 2,500 feet.  Drainage
patterns are dendritic.

<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Existing</U>  Vegetation is a mixed forest of lodgepole pine and
Douglas-fir with an occasional ponderosa pine, grand fir, and western larch. 
The understory is dominated by beargrass, pinegrass, and blue huckleberry. 
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  Douglas-fir/blue huckleberry (PSME/VAGL)
is the major HT. The most common HT phase is beargrass (XETE).   A similar HT
occurs grand fir/beargrass (ABGR/XETE) occurs in some delineations on
northerly slopes.  These HTs occupy about 70 percent of the map unit. 
Douglas-fir/pinegrass (PSME/CARU) occurs in openings and on windy ridges. 
This HT occupies about 15 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent dissimilar HTs.  Douglas-fir/ninebark
(PSME/PHMA) occurs at the lower elevation bounds of this unit on southerly
aspects.  These HTs do not support lodgepole pine and are slightly warmer. 
Grand fir/twinflower (ABGR/LIBO) and spruce/twinflower (PICEA/LIBO) occur on
northerly slopes below 5000 feet and in some moist drainageways.  These HTS
are more productive. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The unit is underlain by large grained granites and gruss of the Idaho
Batholith.  This material rapidly decomposes to coarse sandy and gravelly soil
material locally known as decomposed granites.

<P>
<P>
Map Unit Summary  Soils are somewhat excessively drained and coarse. Rock
fragment 
<P>
content ranges from 35 to 55 percent.  These soils are distinquished from
other soils formed from granitics because of soil properties that provide for
different management response. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Composition</U>  Dystric Eutrochrepts, sandy skeletal, mixed, frigid have
coarse sandy loam and loamy sand textures.  Similar soils are Dystric
Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed frigid.  They have sandy loam textures
with a low fine fraction content.  These soils occupy 90 percent of the map
unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 10 percent dissimilar soils.  Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts,
sandy 
<P>
skeletal, mixed, frigid.  These soils have volcanic ash influenced loess
surface layers and can be more productive. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>Representative Profiles 
<P>
</U>
<P>
Dystric Eutrochrepts, sandy skeletal, frigid, mixed have a soil surface
covered by a layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 2 inches thick.
 Surface layers are pale brown gravelly sandy loam about 8 inches thick.  The
subsurface layers are light gray gravelly sandy loam about 10 inches thick. 
The subsoil is a pale brown very gravelly coarse sandy loam about 33 inches
thick.  Substrata are brownish yellow very gravelly loamy coarse sand to a
depth of 40 inches or more.

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual production is moderate.  Slopes less than 35
percent are well suited for tractor harvest.  Site productivity depends on the
relatively thin topsoil. Tractor operation can reduce site productivity by
displacing the surface layer.  Rotting wood is an important nitrogen source
for this unit.  Leaving large diameter logging slash helps maintain fertility. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>   Erosion from rutting and tread wear on unsurfaced roads and
along ditches can be severe on grades above 6 percent.  Material exposed by
road construction is subject to ravel and difficult to revegetate.  Special
seed mixes, use of shrubs species, several fertilizer applications, and much
can enhance success rate in revegetating disturbed areas.  Care is required
when constructing roads in and near stream channels to keep sediment from
entering the channel system. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is poorly suited to range management.  The forest
understory produces little forage. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  This unit provides good spring and fall range for
deer and elk. 
<P>
Primary forage value is forbs and grasses available in early successional
communities and within timbered understories.  Shrub forage value is low on
this soil type. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Skid trails, firelines, and roads have a very high erosion
hazard.  Sediment delivery efficiency is moderate.  Controlling sediment can
be difficult on roads and adjacent to stream crossings under standard
practice.
