<CENTER>SUMMARY 
<P>
<P>
This map unit occurs in cool stream bottoms.                                  
     Vegetation is a cool forested riparian community                         
              type.  Soils form in a complex of moderately well-              
                         drained and poorly-drained alluvial deposits.</CENTER>

<CENTER><U>LANDFORM</U></CENTER>
<P>
 
<P>
The landform consists of recent floodplains, perennial streams, and low stream
terraces 2 to 10 feet above the existing stream channel.  Braided stream
channels that change course frequently are common.  Floodplains and terraces
have fluctuating water tables.  The lowest portions of these floodplains flood
annually.  Other terraces may flood at approxi- mately 25-year intervals.

<CENTER><U>VEGETATION 
<P>
</U></CENTER>
<P>
<U>Existing</U>  Vegetation is a mixed forest of spruce, western redcedar,
grand               fir, larch, lodgepole pine, and subalpine fir.  The
understory is dominated               by blue huckleberry, beargrass, queencup
beadlily, thimbleberry, mountain               alder, serviceberry, and
mountain maple.
<P>
 
<P>
<U>Habitat Type (HT) Composition</U>  Subalpine fir/queencup beadlily
(ABLA/CLUN), subalpine fir/ menziesia (ABLA/MEFE) are on moderately
well-drained soils.  Western redcedar/queencup beadlily (THPL/CLUN) occurs at
the lower elevation limits of this map unit on moderately well-drained soils
west of Missoula.  These HTs occupy about 60 percent of the map unit.
Subalpine fir/bluejoint (ABLA/CACA) and spruce/common horsetail (PICEA/EQAR)
are on poorly drained soils near streamsides and in depressions.  These HTs
occupy about 15 percent of the map unit.  Shrubfield openings occupy less than
10 percent of the map unit.
<P>
 
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent dissimilar HTs.  Subalpine fir/beargrass
(ABLA/XETE) is on more well-drained terraces.  This HT is a less productive
timber site.

<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY
<P>
</U></CENTER>
<P>
The unit is underlain by alluvial deposits.  The alluvium consists of
stratified sands, rounded rocks, and silts.  These alluvial deposits can be
very thick; textures are usually stratified and are quite variable.  The
alluvial gravels and cobbles are primarily argillites, siltites, and
quartzites from the Belt Supergroup.

<CENTER><U>SOILS
<P>
</U></CENTER>
<P>
<U>Map Unit Summary</U>  Soils on low terraces and away from streamside are
moderately well drained.  Soils near streams and in depressions are poorly
drained.  Soils have a silty surface derived from volcanic ash influenced
loess.  Subsoils are moderately coarse or coarse textured and have 30 to 65
percent rounded rock fragments.
<P>
 
<P>
<U>Composition</U>  Cryochrepts are cold, moderately well-drained soils. 
Silty loess surface layers less than 14 inches thick are common.  They are
located on low terraces and away from streamside, have seasonal water tables,
and can be flooded periodically.  Similar soils support THPL/CLUN.  They are
Eutrochrepts.  These soils occupy about 60 percent of the map unit.
<P>
 
<P>
Aquepts are near streamside and in bogs where water tables are high
year-round.  These soils are cold and support ABLA/CACA, PICEA/EQAR, and
shrubfields.  Similar soils are Aquents and Fluvents.  They have no subsoil
development.  These soils occupy about 25 percent of the map unit.
<P>
 
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent dissimilar soils.  Ochrepts on well-drained
terraces that are rarely flooded and have seasonal water tables are rare. 
They support subalpine forest and generally, ABLA/XETE HT.
<P>
 
<P>
<U>Representative Profiles</U>
<P>
 
<P>
Cryochrepts have dark yellowish brown very gravelly silt loam surface layers  
            about 9 inches thick.  Substrata are brown very gravelly sandy
loams and               very cobbly sandy loams to a depth of 60 inches or
more.  Strong brown               mottles are often present below 15 inches. 
<P>
<P>
These Aquepts have dark brown loam surface layers about 8 inches thick.       
       Subsoils are dark grayish brown silt loams about 14 inches thick. 
Substrata               are gray gravelly loamy sands to a depth of 60 inches
or more.  Mottles are               prominent below 9 inches.

<P>
<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
 
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual production is high.  Productivity is dependent
on the finer textured soil surface layers as the extremely cobbly soils can be
quite infertile. Harvest activity should be directed away from streamcourses
to protect streambanks and to reduce risk of sedimentation.  The terrain is
well suited to tractor operation.  Tractor operation near streams, moist
draws, and depressions can rut, compact or puddle the soil and reduce soil
productivity.  Designated skid trails that avoid wet areas or logging on deep
snow will reduce potential for soil impacts.  Summer frost can limit
regeneration of some species.
<P>
 
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>   Shallow ground water and seasonal flooding can limit
construction and increase maintenance.  Turnpiking can be used to overcome
problems with wet subgrades.  Flooding and stream channel changes can damage
bridges or culverts.  Silty surface layers have low bearing strength and will
rut.  Rocky subsoils and substrata produce rough road surfaces. Surfacing
improves the quality of the road.
<P>
 
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>   Forage is limited and generally, unpalatable to livestock. 
Steep sideslopes in adjacent map units cause livestock to stay in these stream
bottoms which creates problems with overgrazing sensitive riparian vegetation
and compaction of wet soils.  Livestock traffic and grazing along streambanks
can decrease stability of streambanks which deliver sediment to the stream
system.  Low stocking levels and fencing can reduce potential for impacts.
<P>
 
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>   This unit provides excellent spring, summer, and
fall habitat for deer and moose.  It also provides excellent winter range in
the St. Regis drainage and in the Seeley Lake area for whitetail deer.  Shrub
understories provide excellent deer and elk forage and can be enhanced by
regeneration timber harvest.  Within occupied grizzly bear habitat, understory
forbs and berry-producing shrubs provide very important bear foods.  Timber
stands provide important grizzly bear day bed sites and migration routes.
<P>
 
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Skid trails, firelines, and roads have a moderate erosion
hazard.  Sediment delivery efficiency is high because all soil disturbance is
relatively close to stream channels.  The major watershed management concern
is protection of stream channels and banks.  Bridges and culverts should be
carefully planned to maintain channel stability. Practices which disturb soils
on or adjacent to streambanks can increase stream sediment.
