10.Ua  Young to mature stands of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir provide superb
yearlong whitetailed deer range, particularly where associated with wet
meadows and/or seral black cottonwood communities.  Forage is available from
grass/forb understories, shrubs within poorly drained inclusions, and foliose
lichens from timbered overstories.  This unit provides excellent habitat for a
host of cavity-nesters and raptors in mature and old growth successions.  Due
to the dynamic nature of this unit caused by periodic flooding and channel
changes, habitat manipulation is often of little value and must be carefully
weighed against needs for additional diversity in the system.
<P>
 
<P>
10.Ub  Shrub communities provide excellent habitat for whitetailed deer and
moose.  Beaver populations thrive in this unit and are the primary natural
factor in influencing the physical characteristics of the floodplain. Songbird
populations are generally high in this unit particularly where associated with
beaver activity.  Vegetative manipulation is not generally desirable from the
wildlife standpoint. 
<P>
10.Uc  This unit provides excellent spring, summer, and fall habitat for deer
and moose, although in the St. Regis drainage and on the Seeley Lake District,
the unit may also provide whitetailed deer winter range.  Shrub understories
provide excellent big game forage and can be enhanced by regeneration timber
harvest.  Within occupied grizzly bear habitat, understory forbs and
berry-producing shrubs provide very important bear foods.  Timbered stands
provide important grizzly bear day bed sites and migration routes.
<P>
 
<P>
13.Ja  Rolling, gentle topography and numerous springs, seeps, meadows, and
extensive timber stands makes this unit a diverse and valuable habitat for
many species of wildlife.  It provides yearlong whitetailed deer range, elk
winter range, and habitat for numerous bird and small mammal species.  Young
to mature Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine communities provide excellent
whitetailed deer thermal cover.  Forage in such stands is provided by foliose
lichens.  Both shrub-producing and bunchgrass habitat types are present in
this unit. In the shrub-dominated types, regeneration timber harvest or
prescribed burning can dramatically increase shrub production.  Often, during
heavy snow years, shrub forage may be unavailable.  Consequently, timber
harvest planning should provide a mix of timbered and nontimbered stands over
time to provide for both lichen-foraging and shrub-foraging conditions.
<P>
 
<P>
13.Ua  This provides excellent whitetailed deer winter range.  Forage is
available from foliose lichens in timber stands, and from shrubs in shrub
communites.  Conversion of timber stands to shrub communities can result in a
moderate increase in winter forage production.  The unit lacks the inherent
diversity and wet areas of 13.Ja, hence it doesn't provide the yearlong deer
range, or nongame habitat that 13.Ja does.
<P>
 
<P>
13.Ub  This provides important spring, summer, and fall range for deer and
elk, and in some circumstances moose winter range.  Cold air drainage
generally precludes winter deer ang elk use, although during extended periods
of severe weather, deer may &quot;yard up&quot; in this unit.  All age classes
provide important needs for big game.  Shrub communites provide excellent
foraging opportunites. Young stands provide excellent hiding cover.  Mature
stands provide excellent late summer thermal cover.  Management that provides
a variety of age classes and stand diversity, with minimal human disturbance,
will optimize wildlife values.  In occupied grizzly bear habitat,
berry-producing shrub communities can provide excellent late summer/fall
feeding opportunities.
<P>
 
<P>
14.Ja  This provides excellent whitetailed deer winter range.  Forage is
available from foliose lichens in timber stands, and from shrubs in shrub
communities.  Conversion of timber stands to shrub communities can have a
slight to moderate increase in forage production.  Because of the fine soil
particles, regeneration types of timber harvest may favor grass over shrubs.
For this reason, the best shrub response may occur after thinning or light
shelterwood harvests. 
<P>
14.Jb  This low elevation unit is often associated with south-facing winter
ranges.  Where closely associated with winter range, it may have high winter
thermal cover values.  In such situations, deer and elk select mature and old
growth timber stands during severe winter weather.  The unit also provides
good spring and fall deer range.  The shrub response to timber harvest is
excellent. 
<P>
<P>
14.Xa  This unit is identical to 14.Ja although the sandy soils limits
understory vegetation to grasses.  Shrubs are not a component.  Timber harvest
is generally not beneficial unless used to maintain thermal cover.
<P>
 
<P>
15.Ja  Same as 13.Ja 
<P>
<P>
15.Jb  Same as 13.Ub 
<P>
<P>
16.Ua  This unit provides excellent whitetailed deer winter range.  It has a
number of timbered bunchgrass communities interspersed with bunchgrass
openings.  Winter forage is available from foliose lichens within timbered
communities and grass within openings.  Since there is no shrub potential,
timber harvest will not increase forage productivity.
<P>
 
<P>
22.Ma  This low elevation unit provides excellent yearlong deer range and good
elk winter range.  Most of this unit is a complex of south-facing aspects.
Forage is available from small bunchgrass openings, shrubfields, and
lichen-rich timber stands.  East, west, and north-facing stands provide
thermal cover.  Regeneration with underburning can be beneficial by increasing
shrub productivity although the results will be marginal on south-facing slopes.
<P>
 
<P>
22.Ua  same as 22.Ma, although the shrub response to timber harvest is
slightly poorer.
<P>
<P>
24.Ja  This unit provides excellent deer winter range and fair deer summer
range.  Winter use occurs in the timbered communities which provide thermal
cover and forage, available from foliose lichens and undertory shrubs, and in
shrubfields which provide shrubs and grasses.  Timber management can result in
an increase in shrub forage, however, the area's moderate snowfall mandates
that shrub enhancement be balanced with maintenance of thermal cover.  Summer
range use occurs at the higher extremes of the units on cooler aspects.
<P>
 
<P>
24.Jb  This unit is very similar to 24.Ja, although the shrub response is
significantly better.  Snowfall is even of more concern on the winter range
portion of this unit, and maintenance of thermal cover should be given top
priority.  The unit has numerous wet areas that provide excellent elk summer
range.  While timber harvesting can be beneficial on adjacent timber/shrub
types, the integrity of wet shrub/forb draws should be maintained.
<P>
 
<P>
26.Ua  This unit provides excellent yearlong bighorn sheep and mule deer
range, and good elk winter range.  Forage is limited to bunchgrass on the
grassy benches between the cliffs and talus, and shrubs within the talus. 
There are no opportunities for habitat enhancement.  Rock outcrops provide
excellent nesting habitat for golden eagles and prairie falcons.
<P>
 
<P>
30.Ba  This unit provides good big game summer range on both cool north-facing
slopes and warm south-facing slopes.  Big game forage response to timber
harvest is generally good on all apsects.  Therefore, timber harvest can be
beneficial if openings are scarse or if woody debris inhibits animal movement.
<P>
 
<P>
30.Ka  This units provides good big game spring and fall range.  The primary
forage value is forbs and grasses available in early successional communities
and within timbered understories.  Shrubs do not play a significant role from
the wildlife standpoint in this unit.  Due to the granitic soils, increases in
grass or forb production from timber harvest are fairly minor.
<P>
 
<P>
30.Kb  This unit provides good big game summer range.  Much of the forage is
from forb communities occuring under fully stocked conifer stands.  Due to the
granitic soils, increases in grass or forb production from timber harvest are
fairly minor.  Opportunities for habitat enhancement are limited to situations
where openings are very scarse or where woody debris inhibits aminal movement.
<P>
 
<P>
30.Ma  This unit provides excellent deer and elk winter range, and yearlong
bighorn sheep range where associated with 26.Ua.  Graminoids provide the
primary forage.  Shrubs are scarce to nonexistant.  Timber harvest is
generally not beneficial for winter range maintenance.  Underburning is the
best form of vegetative manipulation.  Invasion by and conversion to knapweed
is a severe risk in this unit, and can result in a severe loss in forage
productivity. 
<P>
30.Mb  This unit provides excellent deer and elk winter range below 5000', and
excellent spring range above 5000'.  Shrubs and grasses provide the primary
forage.  Timber harvest and prescribed burning can have moderate benefits by
increasing shrubs production.
<P>
 
<P>
30.Mc  This unit provides excellent big game winter range thermal cover where
mature conifer communities are associated with 30.Mb.  In addition, this unit
can provide excellent big game spring and fall range, if openings are present.
Shrubs are a significant part of the stand structure.  Songbird populations
tend to be high in this unit as a result.  Timber harvest can be very
beneficial if used to enhance big game forage or to increase the overall age
class diversity.
<P>
 
<P>
30.Md  This unit provides extremely productive songbird habitat in early seral
shrub communites.  Pole communites tend to become stagnated if overstocked and
become very sterile for wildlife.  Thinning in such situations can be very
beneficial.  Regeneration timber harvest can also be very beneficial if used
to improve age class diversity.  This unit often provides good big game winter
range thermal cover when in a mature or old growth succession.
<P>
 
<P>
30.Me  This unit provides good big game summer range.  Forage enhancement
potential is low, and the highest wildlife value for the unit is security
cover which is available from mature conifer communities.  In Mefe habitat
types, Mefe provides forage under fully stocked understories.  Consequently, 
timber harvest is generally not beneficial in this unit for wildlife.  One
exception may be where age class diversity is severely limited in which case
partial removal harvest options may be most beneficial.
<P>

30.Qg  This unit provides good big game spring range on the warm aspects and
good summer range on the cooler aspects.  Forage response to timber harvest is
good on the north aspects and marginal on the south aspects.  The unit is
otherwise similar to 30.Me.JONI AND MIKE REWRITE!!! 
<P>
<P>
30.Sa  This unit provides good big game spring range on the warm aspects and
good summer range on the cooler aspects.  Forage response to timber harvest is
generally good.
<P>
 
<P>
30.Sb  Moderate slopes, cool habitat types, and numerous wet depressions make
this generally excellent big game summer range.  Bluejoint meadows should be
treated as critical elk summer range.  Timbered communities produce a large
amount of forage under a fully-stocked canopy, hence timber harvest is seldom
of benefit to big game.  Exceptions occur in large expanses of timber devoid
of openings.
<P>
 
<P>
32.Ka  This unit is excellent big game summer range.  The primary values to
big game are movement corridors and bedding areas.  Vegetative condition is
not a significant factor in summer range management.  Consequently, timber
harvest is of no value for wildlife habitat enhancement.  Conversely, the
disturbance aspects of logging, particularly if combined with ridgetop roads,
can be very detrimental.  Exceptions exist where woody debris inhibits big
game movement.

<P>
32.Qc  This unit provides excellent big game summer range.  The primary values
to big game are movement corridors and bedding areas.  Unlike 32.Ka and 32.Ma,
this unit also provides important foraging areas.  Forage can be enhanced by
timber harvest although this benefit can be lost by ridgetop road systems if
left open.
<P>
 
<P>
32.Qd  This unit provides excellent late summer big game foraging
opportunities.  Forage is available from grasses and forbs.  There are no
opportunities for habitat enhancement.  Late-maturing wildflowers provide
important foraging areas for both insectivorous and seed-eating songbirds in
late summer.  Within occupied grizzly bear habitat, such units provide
important grizzly bear foraging areas for biscuit-root and other root crops.
<P>
 
<P>
33.Ua  This unit is generally considered rather sterile for wildlife.
Exceptions include where this unit occurs within occupied grizzly bear
habitat.  Seeds from whitebark pine can provide a critical grizzly bear spring
and fall food source.  Seed production is highest in young to mature whitebark
stands and declines significantly as the stands reach an old growth
succession.  Blister rust is a significant threat to seed production.  Large
expanses of this unit often provide excellent late summer mule deer range.
Prescribed burning provides the only opportunity for habitat enhancement in
this unit.
<P>
 
<P>
38.Ka  This unit provides excellent big game late summer range.  The high
inherent diversity (wet meadows, dry meadows, and subalpine fir/whitebark pine
stands) provide an optimal combination of forage and cover.  Wet meadows are
often selected for wallow sites.  The only opportunities for habitat
enhancement are prescribed burning in large expanses of conifers for increased
habitat diversity.
<P>
 
<P>
38.Qa  This unit provides excellent big game late summer range.  The high
inherent diversity (wet meadows, dry meadows, and subalpine fir/whitebark pine
stands) provide an optimal combination of forage and cover.  Wet meadows are
often selected for wallow sites.  Within occupied grizzly bear habitat, this
unit provides excellent bear habitat.  Grizzly bear forage is available from
all different vegetative types within this unit including huckleberries from
within subalpine stands, forbs from wet meadows and seeps, bulbs from dry
meadows, and pine nuts from whitebark pine communities.  Habitat enhancement
opportunities are limited to prescribed burning within large expanses of conifers.
<P>
 
<P>
40.Ka  This unit provides a number of wildlife habitats.  Where rock outcrops
dominate the unit, mountain goats are often present.  Talus toe slopes
invariably host pikas and hoary marmots.  These sites in turn provide feeding
opportunites for predators such as wolverines and fishers.  Deeper soils
provide habitat for Columbian and golden-mantle ground squirrels (key prey
species at this elevation).  There are no opportunities for habitat enhancement.

meadows provide critical denning habitat where the soil depths exceed 3'.
There are no opportunities for habitast enhancement.

41.Ka  This unit provides good big game late summer range due to its
association with adjacent cirque basins.  In situations where human
disturbance is high, this unit may be important for security cover.  There are
no opportunities for habitat enhancement.

42.Qa  This unit provides excellent big game late summer and fall range.
Forage is available from forbs and grasses occuring in a variety of vegetative
communities.  Within occupied grizzly bear habitat, this unit provides an
important late summer feeding area.  Grizzly bear foods includes forbs
available from riparian areas and wet meadows, and from huckleberries.  At the
lower elevational limits, there may be opportunities for habitat enhancement.
In some situations, a partial removal/underburn in the Abla/Clun habitat type
can be used to enhance huckleberry production.  Where natural openings are
limited, regeneration harvest may be used to enhance mountain ash, elderberry,
and twinberry production.  Treatment should be carefully evaluated against
natural food availability.

43.Qa  Same as 42.Qa but &quot;good&quot; not &quot;excellent&quot;

<P>
43.Qb  This unit provides excellent late summer and fall big game range.
Forage is available from a variety of forbs and grasses.  Rodents such as
Columbian ground squirrels are usually abundant, consequently such are favored
late summer feeding areas for predators such as prairie falcons, coyotes, and
wolverines.  Within occupied grizzly bear habitat, this unit provides an
excellent late summer food source.  Grizzly bear foods include forbs, grasses,
and rodents.  The steeper sites can provide critical denning habitat.  There
are no habitat enhancement opportunities in this unit.
<P>
 
<P>
43.Sa  This unit provides excellent late big game summer range.  Unlike other
weakly expressed cirque basins this unit supports aspen clones within the
wetter sites.  Many of these small clones occur as an early seral community
and are fire dependent.  Where spruce, lodgepole, or subalpine fir is
encroaching, regeneration timber harvest and broadcast burning is useful in
reestablishing these aspen communities.  Songbird use in these aspen clones is heavy.
<P>
<P>
45.Ua  This unit provides excellent wildlife habitat for a variety of wildlife
species.  Mule deer utilize the forb communities associated with the avalanche
chutes in summer and fall.  Grizzly bears utilize the gass/forb communities in
spring and early summer, and the forb communities in early to mid summer.
Berry-producing shrubs provide food for songirds, black bears, and grizzly
bears.  Associated talus provides yearlong habitat for pikas and hoary
marmots.  Goats are common on some of the associated cliffs and ledges in this
unit and will feed on the forbs and grass associated with the rubblelands.
There are no opportunites for habitat enhancement.
<P>
 
<P>
46.Ka  This unit provides good big game summer range.  Forage is available
from forbs under timber stands or from forb/grass/shrub communites in early
succesional stages.  Timber stands also provide important late summer thermal
and security cover.  Timber harvest can be quite beneficial in situations
where natural openings are scarce or nonexistant.  Due to the concave nature
of such drainages, viewing distances can be extreme in cutover situations.
Consequently combinations of high open road densities and intensive
regeneration harvesting should be avoided.

48.Ka  This unit is a composite of good to excellent big game summer range.
Openings and avalanche chutes within the upper slopes provide good early
summer foraging opportunities for graminoids.  Mature stands of conifers
within the lower glacial till zone provide good summer thermal cover.  Wet
depressions within this zone provide excellent foraging opportunities for
forbs.  Within occupied grizzly bear habitat, these wet depressions can
provide excellent grizzly bear foods if in an early successional community. 
Timber harvest can occasionally enhance habitat in such situations if natural
openings are lacking.

<P>
50.Ua  This unit, characterized by aspen clones, potholes, and stands of
conifers provides valuable wildlife habitat diversity.  Mature stands of aspen
provide valuable habitat for cavity-using wildlife species such as sapsuckers
and small owls.  Sapling stands of aspen provide valuable big game forage
praticularly for moose.  Many aspen communities will eventually convert to
conifers if undisturbed.  In such situations, clearcutting or intensive
underburning can revitalize aspen communities.  Where swales and open potholes
are present, such areas are extremely valuable for waterfowl and other
riparian dependent birds.  Where water availability is limited, tree removal
around such areas can increase water yield to the pothole.  Due to the
inherent diversity of this unit, management of conifer stands is not
particularly beneficial for wildlife.  In some of the more extensive stands of
conifers, regeneration units may be beneficial although such harvesting should
be carefully balanced against adjacent harvesting.
<P>
 
<P>
50.Ub  Same as 50.Ua 
<P>
<P>
60.Ka  This unit provides relatively poor wildlife habitat due to its
extremely steep slopes.  The lowest, most south-facing slopes may provide good
big game winter range.  In such situations, the steep slope actually enhances
the solar absorption characterisitcs of the area.  In such situations in
ninebark habitat types, regeneration and broadcast burning can be used to
create productive shru bfields.  In nonwinter range situations, wildife use is
usually low and options for habitat enhancement are limited.
<P>
 
<P>
60.Kb  This unit provides relatively poor wildlife habitat due to its
extremely steep slopes.  Unroaded, densely forested stands of conifers may
provide critical big game security cover during the hunting season.  There are
no opportunities for habitat enhancement.
<P>
 
<P>
60.Ma  This unit provides excellent deer, elk, and sheep winter range.  The
oversteepened slope and winter sun angle enhances snowmelt rates and
contributes to the winter range suitability.  The primary forage is
graminoids.  Shrubs are scarse to nonexistant, consequently timber harvest is
of little value for habitat enhancement.  The major risk to this area is weed
encroachment (primarily knapweed).
<P>
 
<P>
60.Mb  This unit provides excellent deer and elk winter range.  The unit is
similar to 60.Ma although the forage response to disturbance is much better
due to an increase in shrubs in the unit.  In shrub types (primarily
DF/Phma-caru), regeneration timber harvest and/or burning can be very
beneficial for forage enhancement.
<P>
 
<P>
60.Mc  This unit provides good deer and elk winter range on the east and
west-facing portions of the unit, particularly where associated with 60.Mb.
The primary winter range value in this unit is thermal cover, available within
mature to old stands of conifers.  Early seral communites produce lush
shrubfields, consequently regeneration timber harvest can be very beneficial.
Activities designed to enhance forage should be evaluated against the need for
additonal forage and the need to protect thermal cover.  Midslope roads should
be avoided due to the physical big game barriers that are created by
near-vertical cut slopes.  Where timber harvest is uneconomical, rotation
burns or underburns can significantly improve winter range forage conditions.
<P>
 
<P>
60.Md  This unit is rather unproductive wildlife habitat due to its extremely
steep slopes.  It may provide good big game security habitat if unroaded and
in young to mature timber age classes.  Where associated with south-facing
winter ranges, such units may provide critical thermal cover if in young to
mature age classes.  Generally such thermal cover is most valuable near the
top or bottom of the slope.  Timber harvest is seldom beneficial.  Even though
the forage response potential is very good, animals generally avoid such sites
unless pursued.

61.Mc  This unit provides excellent big game winter range at the lower
elevations and fair summer range at the higher elevations.  Where past
wildfire has created an open landscape, the unit provides excellent yearlong
bighorn sheep range.  The high level of dissection increases the amount of big
game bedding sites and other valuable microsites.  Shrubs provide the primary
winter forage.  Regeneration timber harvest and/or burning is extremely
beneficial on the winter range.  The steep slopes and extreme dissection makes
timber harvest undesirable on the summer range portion of the unit.  Midslope
roads tend to create barriers due to the steepness of the cutslopes.  Also,
due to the extreme slope dissection, roads that weave in and out of steep
draws provide multiple elevated viewing angles that makes hiding cover within
those draws ineffective.
<P>
 
<P>
61.Md  This unit provides fair big game summer range.  Although the unit
provides numerous big game foods, the oversteepened slopes preclude heavy big
game use.  The primary value to big game is security cover available within
young to mature timber stands.  The high level of dissection adds to the value
of this security habitat by decreasing viewing distances, although roading and
logging can quickly eradicate security cover values due to the elevated
viewing angles provided from midslope roads that weave in and out of steep draws.
<P>
 
<P>
61.Qc  This unit provides excellent big game winter range at the lower
elevations and fair summer range at the higher elevations.  The extreme slope
dissection provides important bedding sites and other valuable microtsites.
The unit includes both shrub and bunchgrass types.  Timber harvest and/or
burning can be beneficial on the shrub types.  Burning is beneficial on the
bunchgrass types only if tree encroachment is a problem.  On the summer range
portion of the unit, the primary value to big game is security cover available
within young to mature timber stands.  The high level of dissection adds to
the value of this security habitat by decreasing viewing distances, although
roading and logging can quickly eradicate security cover values due to the
elevated viewing angles provided from midslope roads that weave in and out of
steep draws.

64.Ka  This unit provides good big game winter range on the warm, low
elevation extremes and good spring and fall range elsewhere.  Forage is
available from shrubs and can be enhanced by timber harvest or burning.  The
unit is similar to 30.Mc although forage response is less pronounced due to
granitic soils.
<P>
 
<P>
64.Kb  This unit provides good big game summer range.  Forage is available
from forbs and grasses occuring beneath timber stands, and from shrubs in
early succesional stands.  Wet depressions within the unit provide excellent
elk late summer range.  Timber harvest can be beneficial if done to increase
age class diversity where extensive conifer age class monocultures exist.
<P>
 
<P>
64.Ma  Same as 60.Ma 
<P>
<P>
64.Mb  This unit is good big game winter range.  Young to mature stands, where
associated with 64.Ma, provide critical winter thermal cover.  Forage is
available in the unit from shrub stands.  Timber harvest can be beneficial for
winter range enhancement if confined to shrub types, and if adequate thermal
cover is retained in untreated stands.  Unburning of young to mature stands
can be used to achieve moderate increases in forage at low costs.
<P>
 
<P>
64.Mc  This unit is good big game winter range on the low elevation east and
west aspects, and good summer range elsewhere.  Forage is abundant on all
aspects and can be significantly enhanced on both summer and winter range with
timber harvest.  Big game use declines on the steeper slopes (65% plus)
particularly on the north aspects.  In addition, midslope roads built with
near-vertical cutslopes can create severe big game movement barriers virtually
eliminating animal use of the area.

72.Ba  This unit provides excellent habitat for many species.  Potholes
occuring in poorly drained, hummocky depressions provide habitat for many
aquatic vertebrates.  Moose frequent burned or logged areas where wet shrubs
dominate.  Dry sites within the unit provide excellent big game summer range.
On these drier sites, timber harvest or wildfires create lush shrubfields
which provide excellent songbird habitat, especially where associated with wet
depressions.  Mature stands provide hiding and thermal cover.  This unit has a
high level of inherent diversity.  Timber harvest can be beneficial to
wildlife only if it is designed to increase the overall age class diversity. 
Where aspen is present, regeneration timber harvest and burning can be useful
for removing encroaching conifers.  In occupied grizzly bear habitat, this
unit provides a number of spring-fall bear foods.

72.Oa  Like 72.Ba but slightly better drained and lacks the wet inclusions.
Hence, the productivity is lower for some wildlife species.  Response to
timber harvest is same as 72.Ba. Critical elk summer range.

73.Ub  This unit provides extremely valuable habitat for many species.  Old
lakes and potholes provide excellent waterfowl habitat.  Stands of willow and
alder support the high densities of songbirds.  Timbered stands provide cover
for whitetailed deer and moose as well as understory forbs for forage.  A
portion of the Forest where this unit occurs is critical winter range for elk
and deer.  In such situations, heavy snowfall forces animals to select dense
mature stands of spruce, which due to their snow interception characteristics,
provide relatively snow-free areas for foraging.  Forage is composed primarily
of foliose lichens and shrubs (primarily redosier dogwood, willow, cottonwood,
and maple).  Because of the high inherent diversity, timber harvest is of
questionable value for enhancing wildlife habitat.  Exceptions occur in
extensive stands of old growth spruce where blowdown threatens winter range
productivity.  In such situations, tiny patch regeneration cuts may provide a
means for stand rejuvenation.

74.Ba  and 74.Ua  These well-drained moderately steep units provide extremely
valuable wildlife habitat due to their association with 72.Ba and 72.Oa.  They
provide a critical element of diversity that makes the overal habitat richer.
This unit often provides excellent moose winter range due to the association
with 72.Ba and 72.Oa.  Raptors often prefer such units, particularly near the
topographic breaks where the unit adjoins other mapping units.  On the drier
extremes (Psme/Caru or Syal), small areas of bunchgrass provide excellent
foraging opportunities for big game.  On the wetter extremes (Abla/Clun),
forbs provide a critical foraging element.  Although these units are generally
heavily-timbered, timber harvest is of questionable value due to the inherent
diversity of adjacent mapping units.  When these units are large, however,
some timber harvest may provide a needed element of habitat diversity.
