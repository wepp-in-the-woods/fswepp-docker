<CENTER>SOIL DRAINAGE CLASSES:</CENTER>
<P>
         
<P>
The following definitions are for drainage classes shown in the Land Systems
Inventory ID Legend.  These classes are relatively standard nationwide.  They
are provided in the ID Legend to give insight to soil drainage properties that
need to be considered in road construction and timber regeneration.  More
specific information will be given in the LSI soil survey report which can be
expected shortly after the survey is completed.
<P>
         
<P>
<U>Poorly drained</U> -  Water is removed so slowly that the soil remains wet
for a large part of the time.  The water table is commonly at or near the
surface during a
<P>
considerable part of the year.  Poorly drained conditions are casued by a saturated
<P>
zone, a layer with low hydraulic conductivity, seepage, or a combination of these
<P>
conditions.
<P>
         
<P>
<U>Somewhat poorly drained</U> - Water is removed from the soil slowly enough
to keep it wet for significant periods but not all the time.  Somewhat poorly
drained soils commonly have a layer with low hydraulic conductivity, wet state
high in the profile, additions of water through seepage, or a combination of
these conditions.  Wet periods usually occur during spring and early summer.
<P>
         
<P>
<U>Moderately well drained</U> - Soil is wet for a small but significant part
of the time
<P>
(seasonally), usually because of a slowly permeable layer due to clayey or compacted
<P>
soils and/or a relatively high or intermittently high water table.  These
soils have
<P>
short periods of time where poor aeration will impede plant growth.  
<P>
         
<P>
<U>Well drained</U> - Soils of this class are freely drained and have
intermediate water
<P>
holding capacity.  They retain optimum amounts of moisture, but drain readily so
<P>
saturated conditions rarely occur except immediately after snowmelt or large
duration storm.
<P>
         
<P>
         
<P>
<U>Somewhat excessively drained</U> - Water is removed from these soils
rapidly. Soils may be very shallow or shallow, and high rock fragment content
makes these soils porous.  These soils are droughty.
<P>
         
<P>
<U>Excessively drained</U> - These soils are sandy and have high amounts of
rock fragments in the profile which gives the soil a very high hydraulic
conductivity and low water
<P>
holding capacity.  Water is removed very rapidly from the soil profile making soils
<P>
very droughty.  High elevation soils may be excessively drained due to high
amounts of rock fragments but storm events are frequent enough to support
alpine vegetation.

<CENTER><U>SOIL TEXTURE:</U></CENTER>
<P>
         
<P>
         
<P>
The Land Systems Inventory uses the USDA textural classification system.  We
find that this classification system allows us to make a greater range of
interpretations from soil texture for plant growth properties and engineering
soil properties.  Column three in the ID Legend Summmary denotes the USDA
textural classification for each map unit.
<P>
         
<P>
The Unified and AASHO classification systems are more familiar to engineers. 
Existing forest data will be used to classify soil textures to the Unified
system.  This
<P>
classification will be compiled for each soil type and be displayed in the
engineering interpretation section of the soil survey report.
<P>
         
<P>
Until such time as the Unified classification data has been compiled, the following
<P>
conversion tables and explanations of differences and similarities between
classification systems may be of assistance.  The following excerpts are taken
from USDA Soil Conservation Service - Guide For Interpreting Engineering Uses
Of Soils, 1971.</BODY>
