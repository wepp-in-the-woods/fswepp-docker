<P>
<P>
<P>
The majority of sediment introduced into the stream channel comes directly
from 
<P>
erosion of the bank.  Timber harvest and road building have the potential to 
<P>
increase water yield and therefore erosion of stream banks.  In addition, 
<P>
removal of the surface litter, surface soil, and compaction create the 
<P>
potential for surface runoff and erosion.  Sediment transport in stream
systems 
<P>
normally occurs during the period of spring and early summer snowmelt and 
<P>
during rainfall events.  Under natural conditions, it has been estimated that 
<P>
streams on the Lolo Forest produce from 3 up to 30 tons per mile of sediment 
<P>
annually. 
<P>
<P>
Certain characteristics of map units can be used to separate areas that are 
<P>
very susceptible to erosion and sedimentation from those that are less 
<P>
susceptable.  Soils formed in valley fill material, granite, and schist have 
<P>
the highest potential for erosion on the Lolo Forest.   Clayey (continental) 
<P>
glacial till/valley fill deposits, volcanics, alpine glacial till have a 
<P>
relatively moderate erosion potential.  Soils formed in weakly weathered and 
<P>
moderately weathered Belt metasedimentary rocks are the most stable. Volcanic 
<P>
ash influenced loess which occurs as a mantle on soils mostly west of
Missoula, 
<P>
on northerly and westerly slopes at higher elevations has a low bulk density 
<P>
and a relatively high rate of infiltration.  This loess layer has a low to 
<P>
moderate potential for erosion.  In addition, slope steepness, complexity, 
<P>
drainage spacing, and vegetation can be used to determine potential for
erosion 
<P>
and subsequent sediment introduction into streams. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Properties Affecting Sediment Yield 
<P>
<P>
Table III-6 rates the relative erosion hazard, sediment delivery efficiency
and 
<P>
landslide potential of map units.  These ratings can be used in computer
models 
<P>
that predict sediment yield or to identify areas which require on-site 
<P>
evaluation of needed soil and water conservation practices during project 
<P>
planning. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Erodibility is a rating of the relative susceptibility of exposed soil to 
<P>
erosion.  The ratings are based on observations of erosion in the survey area 
<P>
and its occurrence on varied soil and slope combinations.  Surface and 
<P>
substrata soil have been rated separately as they commonly have differing 
<P>
physical properties due to weathering or stratification of contrasting parent 
<P>
materials.  The ratings can be used to compare the relative probability of 
<P>
erosion occurring on alternative areas.  This probability should be considered 
<P>
when locating and designing projects so that areas that require on-site 
<P>
evaluation for erosion hazard can be identified. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Surface erodibility can be used to evaluate the erosion hazard for practices 
<P>
which result in baring the soil surface or exposure of soil layers within 24 
<P>
inches of the surface.  Logging skid trails, prescribed fire, and low standard 
<P>
roads are examples of this exposure. 
<P>
<P>
    Map units rated low have sufficient rock fragments to armor the surface of 
<P>
    bared soil and do not require erosion control treatment when exposed. 
Soil 
<P>
    parent materials are derived from alluvial or weakly and moderately 
<P>
    weathered metasedimentary bedrock. 
<P>
<P>
    Map units rated moderate have fine or medium soil textures and contain a 
<P>
    moderate volume of coarse fragments.  Some erosion control treatment is 
<P>
    normally required to control erosion of bared soil.  The erosion hazard of 
<P>
    these soils will vary with the nature of soil disturbance, the predicted 
<P>
    effectiveness of planned erosion control practices, and other site 
<P>
    conditions such as slope.  Soil parent materials are derived from all 
<P>
    bedrock or deposits not listed under the high rating, below. 
<P>
<P>
    Map units rated high have fine soil texture and very low coarse fragments. 
<P>
    They are formed in valley fill deposits, alluvium overlain by silt 
<P>
    deposits, volcanic, most micaceous schist bedrock, and some fine glacial 
<P>
    till depostits. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Substratum erodibility assumes conditions on unsurfaced roads and constructed 
<P>
skid trails.  Road construction normally exposes substratum material. This 
<P>
rating includes that excavation below 24 inches of the surface.  Road cut and 
<P>
fill slopes are an example of this excavation. Interception of shallow 
<P>
groundwater within the excavated depth affects substratum erodibility as well 
<P>
as properties of the material.  Intercepted groundwater enters the road 
<P>
drainage system and causes ditch erosion. 
<P>
<P>
    Map units rated low have substrata formed in materials resistant to 
<P>
    erosion.  These materials have high bearing strength and a high volume of 
<P>
    coarse fragments that are larger than gravel in size.  Soil parent 
<P>
    materials are derived from weakly and moderately weathered,
metasedimentary 
<P>
    bedrock, alluvial deposits, and coarse glacial till deposits. 
<P>
<P>
    Map units rated moderate have one of the following sets of properties: 
<P>
    1) Substrata contain both erosion resistant and susceptible components. 
<P>
    Mixing these components during road construction results in material with 
<P>
    an intermediate hazard.  2) Substratum material has low bearing strength 
<P>
    and tends to rut when used as native road surface.  Concentration of 
<P>
    drainage water in ruts causes erosion of the road surface.  Soil parent 
<P>
    materials are derived from moderately weathered metasedimentary, less deep 
<P>
    valley fill or lacustrine deposits, some weakly weathered granitics. 
<P>
<P>
    Map units rated high have substrata formed in materials susceptible to 
<P>
    erosion or where large amounts of groundwater are normally encountered 
<P>
    during excavation.  These erosive materials have low volume of coarse 
<P>
    fragments larger than gravel size and fine soil texture.  Soil parent 
<P>
    materials are derived from volcanic, micaceous schist, moderately
weathered 
<P>
    granitic, and soft sedimentary bedrocks and deep valley fill or lacustrine 
<P>
    deposits. 
<P>
<P>
    Map units rated very high have substrata formed in highly weathered 
<P>
    granitic bedrock or &quot;grus&quot;.  This material rapidly weathers to a
highly 
<P>
    erodible mixture of pea-sized gravel and coarse sand when exposed. Field 
<P>
    observations indicate this material is much more erodible than any other
in 
<P>
    the survey area. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Landform sediment delivery efficiency is a rating of the relative probability 
<P>
of eroded soil reaching a stream channel and becoming sediment.  When combined 
<P>
with erosion and landslides, it can be used in evaluating the hazard to water 
<P>
quality from erosion.  Overland transport of eroded soil is a complex process 
<P>
affected by many properties which must be evaluated onsite.  These ratings 
<P>
consider properties of landforms which affect sediment delivery.  Slope 
<P>
steepness, slope shape, and drainage density were the most important
properties 
<P>
used to make these ratings. 
<P>
<P>
    Map units rated low have relatively gentle slopes which average less than 
<P>
    35 percent and have wide drainage spacings.  Low relief restricts
transport 
<P>
    of sediment.  Consequently, most eroded soil is stabilized before it 
<P>
    reaches a stream channel.  Onsite evaluation of erosion and sediment
hazard 
<P>
    is generally not required unless soil disturbance in or adjacent to a 
<P>
    drainage is planned. 
<P>
<P>
    Map units rated moderate have average slopes between 35 and 60 percent
with 
<P>
    drainage spacings that are from 800 to 2,500 feet apart.  Slope steepness 
<P>
    is great enough to transport eroded soil, but these units are farther 
<P>
    removed from active stream channels or have features that slow velocity
and 
<P>
    allow settling out of sediment before it reaches active channels. Onsite 
<P>
    evaluation of erosion and sediment hazard should be considered. 
<P>
<P>
    Map units rated high have average slopes greater than 60 percent with 
<P>
    drainage spacings that are from 800 to 1,500 feet apart.  These steep 
<P>
    slopes are located directly above streams and have slopes that are
straight 
<P>
    or complex.  Valley bottom map units on and adjacent to active stream 
<P>
    channels are also rated high.  All soil disturbance within these map units 
<P>
    occurs near enough to channels to be a potential sediment hazard. On-site 
<P>
    evaluation of erosion and sediment hazards should be considered when 
<P>
    planning soil disturbing activities.  Some short-term increase in sediment 
<P>
    is probably unavoidable. 
<P>
<P>
    Map units rated very high have average slopes greater than 65 percent with 
<P>
    drainage spacings less than 800 feet and are adjacent to active stream 
<P>
    channels. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Potential for Landslides is a rating of the relative probability of downslope 
<P>
movement of masses of soil and rock material under natural or non-managed 
<P>
conditions.  The most common kinds of landslides which occur on the Lolo
Forest 
<P>
are debris slides, rotational slumps, and landflows.  Landslides occur 
<P>
infrequently on this forest.  They are usually associated with concentrations 
<P>
of groundwater above a soil layer with restricted permeability.  The ratings 
<P>
can be used to compare the relative probability of landslides occurring on 
<P>
alternative areas being considered in plans and for determining which areas 
<P>
should have on-site evaluation of slope stability when designing a project. 
<P>
The ratings are based on observations of landslides in the survey area and 
<P>
their association with combinations of observable properties of map units. 
<P>
Slope steepness, indicators of groundwater concentrations such as seeps and 
<P>
water loving vegetation, bedrock properties, and evidence of landslides 
<P>
occurring in the past such as cracks, leaning trees and hummocky topography 
<P>
were properties used to make these ratings. 
<P>
<P>
    Map units rated low have no properties associated with landslide activity 
<P>
    or 20 percent of the area can be easily avoided.  Landslide hazards will 
<P>
    not normally affect the location of design of projects. 
<P>
<P>
    Map units rated moderate exhibit several properties associated with 
<P>
    landslides.  Road location or design can be constructed effectively to 
<P>
    reduce risks without loosing feasibility. 
<P>
<P>
    Map units rated high exhibit all of the properties associated with 
<P>
    landslides. It is difficult to avoid locating roads near high risk areas. 
<P>
    Road designs which reduce risks are very costly. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Map units rated moderate or high may require that landslide hazards be 
<P>
evaluated onsite before locating roads or projects.
