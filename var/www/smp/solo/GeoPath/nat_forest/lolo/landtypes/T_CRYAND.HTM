 <U>LOCATION AND SETTING</U>:  West-central Montana; Bitteroot Mountains; Surveyor's
<P>
 Creek drainage; center of section 4, T12N, R25W; map unit 42QA.  This soil is
<P>
 formed in volcanic ash influenced loess overlying material derived from glacial
<P>
 till deposits.  The slope gradient is 15 percent on a north aspect at 5,440 feet
<P>
 of elevation.  The habitat type is subalpine fir/queencup beadlily.
<P>
 
<P>
 
<P>
 These soils are formed in a 14 to 23 inch thick volcanic ash influenced loess
<P>
 overlying moderately and weakly weathered metasedimentary bedrock and glacial
<P>
 till deposits.
<P>
<P>
 The A horizon has a silt loam texture, 6 to 8 percent clay, and 0 to 5 percent
<P>
 coarse fragments.  This horizon has other moist colors such as 7.5YR 3/3 and
<P>
 10YR 2/2.
<P>
 
<P>
 The Bo horizon has a silt loam texture, 6 to 8 percent clay, and 0 to 15
<P>
 percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has other moist colors such as 10YR 4/4
<P>
 and 7.5YR 3/3.
<P>
 
<P>
 2Bw horizons overlay the 2C horizons in some soils.  These horizons have silt
<P>
 loam textures, 10 to 20 percent clay, and 35 to 65 percent coarse fragments.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
 The 2Bw horizons are 8 to 17 inches thick.  Some soils have 2E&amp;2Bw or 2A&amp;2E
<P>
 horizons in place of a 2Bw horizon.
<P>
 
<P>
   The 2C horizon has a silt loam to sandy loam texture, 10 to 20 percent clay,
<P>
 and 50 to 90 percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has other moist colors such
<P>
 as 10YR 6/3 and 10YR 4/6.  Depth to the 2C horizon is 23 to 45 inches.</BODY>
