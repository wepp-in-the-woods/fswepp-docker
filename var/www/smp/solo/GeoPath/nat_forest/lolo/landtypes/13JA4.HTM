<CENTER><U>LANDFORM</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The landform consists of high stream terraces, 50 to 500 feet above adjacent
streams. Terraces have nearly flat benches with gradients of less than 10
percent and short steep descending slopes called risers along one side with
gradients of up to 45 percent.  Relief of risers can vary from 50 to 200 feet.
 Included in some map units are streams traversing below these terraces and
their associated floodplains and low stream terraces. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Existing  Vegetation is a mixed forest of Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and
western larch in southerly delineations.  The understory contains dwarf
huckleberry, kinnikinnick, serviceberry, pinegrass, snowberry, and Idaho
fescue.  Northerly delineations support grand fir, western larch, lodgepole
pine, and Douglas-fir.  Understories are dominated by twinflower, queencup
beadlily, elderberry, red osier dogwood, serviceberry, rocky mountain maple,
and western meadowrue. 
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  This map unit contains two dissimilar
habitat type groups. The dry Douglas-fir HT group occurs in delineations that
have southerly trending terraces and the moist, mixed coniferous HT group
occurs in delineations that have northerly trending terraces.  Delineations
rarely have both HT groups except in microsite inclusions.  In delineations
with southerly aspects, Douglas-fir/dwarf huckleberry (PSME/VACA) and
Douglas-fir/snowberry (PSME/SYAL) are the major HTs on the nearly flat
benches.  Douglas-fir/ninebark (PSME/PHMA) or PSME/SYAL are on terrace risers
where cobbly alluvium is at the surface.  In delineations with northerly
aspects, grand fir/twinflower (ABGR/LIBO) and grand fir/queencup beadlily
(ABGR/CLUN) are the major HTs throughout the unit.  Western redcedar/queencup
beadlily (THPL/CLUN) and subalpine fir/twinflower (ABLA/LIBO) are included as
similar. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 10 percent dissimilar HTs.  Douglas-fir/twinflower
(PSME/LIBO) occurs in moist microsites such as swales and at the base of
terrace risers in southerly delineations.  Timber productivity is higher on
these sites.

<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The map unit is underlain by silty lacustrine deposits 2 to 5 feet thick,
which overlie very cobbly alluvium.  The alluvium consists of stratified
sands, many rounded rocks, and silts.  These alluvial deposits are very thick
and can be slightly consolidated at depths below 50 feet.  The alluvial
gravels and cobbles are primarily argillites, siltites, and quartzites from
the Belt Supergroup. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 5 percent rock outcrop.  Belt Supergroup metasedimentary
bedrock can occur along stream channels or near steep mountain slopes.

<CENTER><U>SOILS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Map Unit Summary</U>  Soils are well drained with medium to moderately fine
textures.  Soil properties vary with vegetation.  Soils under dry Douglas-fir
forest become dry early in the growing season and volcanic ash influenced
loess is mixed with subsoils or is absent in the surface layer.  Soils under
moist, mixed coniferous forest are rarely dry in the growing season and have
volcanic ash influenced loess in the surface layer.  Soils supporting grand
fir have a silty surface layer derived from volcanic ash influenced loess. 
Subsoils have clay accumulations.  Substrata contains 55 to 85 percent rounded
rock fragments and is moderately coarse to coarse textured. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Composition</U>  Typic Haploxeralfs, fine silty, mixed, frigid become dry
early in the growing season, have light colored surface layers, and support
dry Douglas fir forests.  They occur in southerly delineations.  Similar soils
have dark surface layers.  They are Mollic Haploxeralfs, fine silty, mixed,
frigid. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Typic Eutroboralfs, fine silty, mixed, frigid remain moist during the growing
season and support moist, mixed coniferous forests.  They occur in northerly delineations.
<P>
 
<P>
Every delineation has at least one of these soils and can have all. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent dissimilar soils and rock outcrop.  Soils are
formed in very to extremely cobbly alluvium near delineation boundaries and on
steep terrace risers. These soils have a very gravelly loam surface layer
about 8 inches thick over extremely cobbly sandy loam or loamy sand subsoil
and substrata.  These soils are Typic Xerochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed on
southerly aspects and Dystric Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid on
northerly aspects.  Rock outcrop occupies up to 5 percent of the unit. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Representative Profiles</U> 
<P>
<P>
Typic Haploxeralfs, fine silty, mixed, frigid have very dark brown silt loam
surface layers about 7 inches thick.  Subsoils are dark brown to yellowish
brown silty clay loams about 27 inches thick and have thin continuous clay
skins.  Lower subsoils are brown sandy clay loams about 7 inches thick.
Substrata are brown very gravelly or very cobbly sandy loams to a depth of 60
inches or more. 
<P>
<P>
Typic Eutroboralfs, fine silty, mixed, frigid have dark grayish brown silt
loams surface layers about 9 inches thick.  Upper subsoils are brown to light
brown silt loams about 17 inches thick and have thin continuous clay skins. 
Lower subsoils are dark brown silty clay loams about 6 inches thick and have
thick continous clay skins coating ped faces. Substrata are brown very
gravelly or very cobbly sandy loams to a depth of 60 inches or more.

<U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS 
<P>
<P>
TIMBER</U>  Potential annual production is moderate on southerly aspects and
very high on northerly aspects.  Broken slopes limit tractor operation on
terrace risers.  Combinations of tractor and short line cable systems should
be considered.  Gentle bench surfaces are well suited to tractor operation. 
Tractor operation on moist soils can rut, compact or puddle the soil, and
reduce soil productivity.  Operating equipment only when soil is dry, frozen,
or snow covered helps maintain soil productivity.  Moisture stress and
competition from graminoids limits regeneration on south aspects.  Cold air
drainage limits regeneration of some tree species. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Native road surfaces constructed in silty subsoils rut when wet
and are dusty when dry.  Excavation below silty surface, surfacing or seasonal
closures help overcome bearing strength limitations.  High cutslopes in this
material tend to ravel because of the uncohesive sandy substratum and rounded
cobbles.  Care is required when constructing roads in and near stream channels
to keep sediment from entering the channel system. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  Potential forage production is moderate.  Soils are susceptible
to compaction in the spring.  Delaying grazing until the soil is dry will
reduce soil impacts.  Erosion can occur on trails made on terrace risers that
access stream bottoms. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  This map unit provides yearlong whitetail deer
range, elk winter 
<P>
range, and habitat for numerous bird and small mammal species.  Young to
mature Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine communities provide excellent whitetail
deer thermal cover.  Forage in such stands is provided by foliose lichens.  In
the moist, mixed coniferous forest, regeneration timber harvest or prescribed
burning can dramatically increase shrub production.  Often, during heavy snow
years, shrub forage may be unavailable in openings. A mix of timbered and
nontimbered stands managed over time will provide for diverse foraging
opportunities of lichens and shrubs. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Logging skid trails, firelines, and roads have a high
erosion hazard.  Sediment delivery efficiency is low on benches and high from
terrace risers adjacent to streams. The major watershed management concern is
protection of stream channels and banks included in this unit.  Bridges and
culverts should be carefully planned to maintain channel stability.  Practices
which disturb soils on or adjacent to streambanks can increase stream
sediment.
