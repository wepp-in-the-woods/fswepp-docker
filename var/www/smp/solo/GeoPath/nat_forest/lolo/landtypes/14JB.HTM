<P>
<CENTER><U>SUMMARY 
<P>
</U>
<P>
The map unit consists of low relief, dissected 
<P>
foothills and benches located along the Clark Fork 
<P>
River.  Native vegetation is moist, mixed 
<P>
coniferous forest.  Soils are formed in volcanic 
<P>
ash influenced loess overlying deep silty 
<P>
lacustrine deposits. </CENTER>

<CENTER><U>TOPOGRAPHY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
This landform consists of rolling foothills to nearly flat benches in mountain
valleys along the Clark Fork River drainage.  Gentle undulating slopes have
broad ephemeral channels.  Benches near perennial streams and terraces from
ancestoral Clark Fork River channels have inclusions of steep escarpments. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>EXISTING</U>  Vegetation is a mixed forest with western larch, Douglas-fir,
lodgepole pine, and western white pine.  The understory is dominated by rocky
mountain maple, serviceberry, twinflower, blue huckleberry, sitka alder, and
queencup beadlily. 
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  Grand fir/twinflower (ABGR/LIBO) and
grand fir/queencup beadlily (ABGR/CLUN) are the major HTs.  They occupy about
75 percent of the map unit. Western redcedar/queencup beadlily (THPL/CLUN)
occurs near drainages and occupies about 10 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent dissimilar HTs.  Douglas fir/twinflower
(PSME/LIBO) is on east and west aspect inclusions.  Timber productivity is
lower on these sites. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The map unit is underlain by silty glacial lake sediments originating from
ancestral 
<P>
Glacial Lake Missoula.  Many of these lacustrine sediments occurring on
benches have been reworked by the Clark Fork River creating areas predominated
by fine sands, silts or clays.  The bedrock underlying these deep sediments
consist of argillites siltites and quartzites of the Belt Supergroup.

<CENTER><U>SOILS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>Map Unit Summary</U>  Soils are moderately well drained with medium to fine
textures and have subsoil clay accumulation.  Silt content is very high and
rock fragments are rare. Surface layers are formed in volcanic ash influenced
loess. 
<P>
<P>
Composition  Typic Eutroboralfs, fine silty, mixed, frigid have 25 to 35
percent have subsoil clay accumulation.  A similar soil has 35 to 50 percent
clay in thesubsoil. These soils are Typic Eutroboralfs, fine, mixed, frigid. 
Another similar soil has little subsoil clay accumulcation an are Andic
Dystric Eutrochrepts, fine-silty, mixed,frigid. These soils occupy about 95
percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 5 percent dissimilar soils.  Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts,
loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid have greater than 35 percent rock fragments and
have moderately coarse to medium textures.  They occur along map unit bounds. 
Timber productivity is lower and native road surface quality is higher. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Representative Profile</U> 
<P>
<P>
Typic Eutroboralfs, fine silty, mixed, frigid have a soil surface covered by a
layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 2 inches thick.  Surface
layers are dark brown silt loams about 9 inches thick. Subsurface layers are
light brown and pinkish gray silt loams about 7 inches thick.  Subsoil layers
are dark brown silty clay loams about 16 inches thick with many thick clay
films.  Substrata is a brown silt loam to a depth of 60 inches or more.

<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual productivity is high.  Tractor harvest or
equipment operation can compact or rut soils when they are moist.  Operating
tractors only whensoils are dry, frozen, or snow covered helps maintain soil
productivity. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Native roads surfaces constructed in silty subsoils rut when wet
because of low bearing strength and are dusty when dry.  Surfacing helps
contorl dust and prevents rutting.  Cutslopes are highly erosive, slough
easily, and are difficult to revegetate. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is poorly suited for range management.  The forest
understory 
<P>
produces little forage. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  Where associated with adjacent south-facing winter
ranges, this map unit has high winter thermal cover values.  Deer and elk
select for mature and old growth timber stands during severe winter weather. 
This unit also provides good spring and fall deer range and shrub forage
response to vegetative manipulation such as harvest is excellent. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Skid trails and firelines have a moderate erosion hazard.
Roads have a high erosion hazard.  Sediment delivery efficiency is low.  Only
practices which disturb soil on or near streams have a high potential for
increasing sediment.
