<P>
 About 90 percent of the survey area is forested.  Currently, ___ percent of the
<P>
 forested lands are classified as capable and available for timber management.
<P>
 The principal commercial species are Douglas-fir, western larch, lodgepole
<P>
 pine, western white pine, Engelmann spruce, ponderosa pine, grand fir, western
<P>
 hemlock, and western redcedar.  The annual programmed sell for the Lolo
<P>
 National Forest as of 1985 is 60-80 million board feet.              
<P>
 
<P>
 Tables ___ and ___ can be used for timber sale planning and silvicultural
<P>
 activities. Table ___ covers potential climax vegetation, major tree species,
<P>
 potential productivity, and natural regeneration.  Table ___ covers management
<P>
 limitations.           
<P>
 
<P>
 Below is a detailed explanation of the components of Table ___.
<P>
 
<P>
 <U>Habitat type(s)</U> are vegetative groupings based on the overstory climax species
<P>
 of the site.  The climax species is usually the most shade-tolerant speices, 
 
<P>
 which indicates that it is the species most adapted the that site.  When
<P>
 identification of climax species stops at the overstory climax species it is
<P>
 referred to as the series--for example, Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir) or
<P>
 abbreviated PSME series. The second component of the habitat type is based on
<P>
 the dominant or characteristic undergrowth species in the climax plant
<P>
 community.  Combining the overstory species with the understory species
<P>
 generates the hahitat types--for example, Pseudotsuga menziesii/Physocarpus
<P>
 malvaceous (Douglas-fir/ninebark) or abbreviated PSME/PHMA. Local use of
<P>
 habitat types by forest managers has developed a common network by which
<P>
 managers can describe certain familar site conditions and response to
<P>
 management. Many interpretations can be generated using habitat
<P>
 types.                    
<P>
 
<P>
 <U>Common trees</U> are those tree species commonly occurring in the
landtype. Yield
<P>
 (cubic feet/acre/year) is given for each tree species when information is
<P>
 available. Showing yields be tree species reflects the difference in
<P>
 productivity from one site to another between species. For example, ponderosa
<P>
 pine exists over a broad environmental range but is not uniformly as productive
<P>
 through that range. Douglas-fir may be more productive than ponderosa pine in
<P>
 one landtype and the reverse in another. This provides the user an illustration
<P>
 of what species is the best producer for a particular landtype.
<P>
 
<P>
 <U>Yield</U> or yield capability is the amount of wood fiber that can be
produced from
<P>
 managed forests. Technically, yield is  defined as the maximum mean annual
<P>
 increment attainable in a fully stocked natural stand and is express in cubic
<P>
 feet per acre per year. Yields were derived from a random sampling across the
<P>
 Lolo National Forest in 1978 to provide yield tables to use in the Forest
<P>
 Planning process. Approximately 2400 site trees were measured by increment core
<P>
 to determine site index and current (as of 1985) yield curves were used to
<P>
 determine yield capability. Habitat type transects were also done. Soils maps
<P>
 were later overlayed on these sample points to identify landtypes of each
<P>
 sample point. More description on methods and yield tables by ranger district
<P>
 can be found in Appendix ___.  Limited field verification on representative
<P>
 landtypes of site index reflects fairly good reliability of this 1978 data.
<P>
 This data illustrates relative productivity from one landtype to another and
<P>
 stratifies productivity by species within landtypes. 
<P>
 
<P>
 Standard yield capability classes have been defined by Pfister (1976). Yields
<P>
 from this data base show average yields in the survey area of less than 50
<P>
 cubic feet/acre/year. Standard yield classes place yields on the Lolo National
<P>
 Forest, on the average, to be moderate to very low. High and very high classes
<P>
 were not measured on the average. To provide better stratification of
<P>
 producitivity for the survey, new classes were developed.  These classes
<P>
 reflect relative productivity within the survey area. These classes are defined
<P>
 below.  When comparing productivity classes of this survey area with another
<P>
 survey area, one should use the yields and Pfister's yield classes.
<P>
 
<P>
 New Yield Capability Classes                         Percentage of Forest
<P>
 
<P>
     Very low - less than 20 cubic feet/acre/year 
<P>
     Low      - 21 to 35 cubic feet/acre/year            To be completed - 1987
<P>
     Moderate - 36 to 45 cubic feet/acre/year 
<P>
     High     - 46 to 60 cubic feet/acre/year
<P>
     Very high- 60+ cubic feet/acre/year
<P>
 
<P>
 
<P>
 <U>Natural Regeneration Suitability</U> ratings are based on moisture stress,
<P>
 competition, short growing season, frost heave, and shallow, rocky soils. Every
<P>
 tree species has a different ability to produce and distribute seed. Seed
<P>
 availability is a major factor in natural regeneration. Ponderosa pine is known
<P>
 to have long periods of low seed production and has a large seed that does not
<P>
 transport by wind at long distance. Other tree species have characteristics
<P>
 that may inhibit natural regeneration but these are more site specific or
<P>
 climatic and cannot be included in this interpretation. Ponderosa pine is
<P>
 included in the rating as a factor when it is a dominant component of the
<P>
 stand.
<P>
 
<P>
 Note: Natural Regeneration is the ability for a site to renew a standing crops
<P>
 of trees without artificial means. This rating does not include the length of
<P>
 time for establishment of a commercial valued stand. Some landtypes have a high
<P>
 suitability rating for natural regeneration but the length of time for the
<P>
 stand to reach culmination of mean annual increment or in other words, a valued
<P>
 commercial stand can be upwards to 250 years. Average time for stand rotation
<P>
 on the Lolo National Forest is ___ (90) years.CHECK THIS!!Re-establishment
<P>
 periods are rated in Table __, Timber Management.
<P>
                
<P>
      A <U>Low</U> rating indicates the suitability for natural regeneration is
<P>
 unlikely.  On southerly aspects and in open grown, low elevation timber stands
<P>
 moisture stress limits regeneraton.  Ponderosa pine is the major seral
<P>
 component. This rating is also used at high elevations where short growing
<P>
 season and frost heave limit regeneration.  Brush and grass competition can
<P>
 also severely affect regeneration. 
<P>
 
<P>
     A <U>Moderate</U> rating indicates limitations can be overcome by the use of
<P>
 special harvest and site preparation practices or by planting.  Moisture stress
<P>
 on seedlings can be avoided by planting deep rooted stock to ensure available
<P>
 moisture to roots after the surface has dried. Providing adequate shade by
<P>
 leaving large fuels or shelterwood harvest will help protect from moisture
<P>
 stress on natural seedlings. In high elevation basins, competition for light
<P>
 will inhibit seedling germination and competition for space will inhibit
<P>
 seedling dispersal.  Often only shade tolerant seedlings and residuals are
<P>
 regenerated unless special practices are undertaken. Brush removal and planting
<P>
 older stock soon after harvest will increase chances of establishing a fully
<P>
 stocked stand of commercially desireable species.
<P>
 
<P>
     A <U>High</U> rating indicates that the site is very suitable for natural
<P>
 regeneration providing seed source is available.  Moisture and length of
<P>
 growing season are adequate.  Brush and grass competition is not a major
<P>
 problem on these sites.
<P>
 
<P>
 Limitations to Natural Regeneration will be noted when applicable. No
<P>
 limitations will be noted with a dashed line.</BODY>
