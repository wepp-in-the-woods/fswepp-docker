<U>Plant competition</U> is the degree of competion from plants on the
standing crop  of trees intended for management. There are three categories of
competition  that can affect tree production; competition for moisture,
competition for  light, and competition for growing space. The ratings in the
table reflect the  degree of competion and whether by management this
competition can be reduced  or controlled.
<P>
 
<P>
     A <U>severe</U> rating indicates that plant competition is difficult to
overcome  even after scarification and temporary removal of plant materials
prior to  planting. Production will be affected by this competition. Sites
were moisture  is inherently limiting and trees are not as well adapted to the
site as grasses  competition for moisture and sometimes space is too difficult
to control. Sod  forming grasses are highly resilient and grow back readily
after site  preparation efforts.
<P>
 
<P>
     A <U>moderate</U> rating indicates that plant competition can be overcome
with  site preparation techniques such as scarification or prescribed burning.
High  elevation moist basins produce prolific shrub cover after harvest which 
produces competition for light and space for tree seedlings. These shrubs can 
be retarded by scarification long enough to get tree seedlings established. 
Once trees grow above the shrub layer competition is no longer a factor.
<P>
 
<P>
     A <U>low</U> rating indicates that rarely does plant competition affect
production  of the standing crop. Shrub cover after harvest rarely offers
competition for  light or space and moisture is not a limiting factor to
growth. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Stand Re-establishment Period</U> is the length of time for a standing crop
to  reach 18 inches high and/or crop is free growing, unimpeded by competition
or  severe climate. Rotation periods for regenerated stands vary across the
forest  from 80 to 200 years. Stand establishment is often included in
regeneration  interpretations. This rating is made exclusive of regeneration
to highlight  those landtypes in which <U>natural regeneration</U> is high but
the length of time  for the stand to become established is a very long time.
The re-establishment  period often affects rotation periods. Stands on high
elevation ridgetops and  cirque basins supporting subalpine fir/wood-rush and
other near timberline  habitat types may take as long as 50 years to become established.
<P>
 
<P>
     A <U>severe </U>limitation to stand establishment indicates greater than
25 years  for the stand to become established. Short growing seasons, wind
dessication,  high insolation, moisture stress, frost damage, and heavy
accumulations of snow  are factors that can contribute to long periods for
stand establishment.
<P>
 
<P>
     A <U>moderate</U> limitation to stand establishment indicates 6-24 years
for the  stand to become established. Limitation factors listed above may be
present but  timing of planting, harvest method, and/or tree species selection
can offer  solutions to these limitations.  
<P>
     A slight limitation to stand establishment indicates that the stand
becomes  established within a 5 year period. Limiting factors are minor and do
not  affect the stand. 
<P>
<P>
 Sensitivity to Displacement rates the degree of sensitivity to reduction of 
soil productivity by removal or movement of the surface soil. When surface 
soils are displaced, important organic matter and nutrient sources are removed
 and total productivity can be reduced. Volcanic ash-influenced loess surface 
soils common to the survey area have higher nutrient, lower bulk densities
that  enhance ease of root penetrability, and higher water holding capacities
than  those surface soils derived from residual parent materials. The majority
of  soils in the survey area have relatively infertile subsoils compared to
the  surface soil. Depth of surface soils, inherent productivity of surface
soils,  and relative infertility of subsoils are factors in rating soil
sensitivity to  displacement. 
<P>
     A high sensitivity rating indicates that productivity will be adversely 
affected by removal of 50 percent or more of the duff layer and surface soils.
 These landtypes have shallow volcanic ash-influenced loess surface soils of 
less than 8 inches and/or alluvial or granitic subsoils. 
<P>
     A moderate sensitivity rating indicates that adverse affects on 
productivity can be avoided or is not permanently affected by displacement. 
Volcanic ash-influenced loess surface soils are greater than 18 inches or 
surface soils are derived from the same parent material as the subsoil or 
fertility of subsoils is relatively high. 
<P>
     A low rating indicates soil productivity is not affected by a 50 percent 
removal or movement of topsoil. 
<P>
 Equipment Use rates the limitation to the use of crawler tractors or rubber 
tired skidders or mechanized harvesters.  Factors considered limiting are
slope  steepness, occurrence of rock outcrop, surface layers which rut and
compact  when operated on under normal moisture conditions, occurrence of wet
sites, and  thin surface layers highly important to site productivity which
may be  disturbed by equipment operation.  Only the most restrictive
limitations are  listed. 
<P>
     A severe rating indicates that limitations are generally too restrictive 
for equipment use.  The limitation can ot be overcome by managing the use of 
equipment. The expected performance of this equipment is very poor.  Aerial or
 cable systems can overcome this limitation. 
<P>
     A moderate rating indicates that limitations do not prevent equipment
use.  Limitations can be overcome by controlling the time, location, or
intensity of  equipment operation.  The expected performance of equipment is
fair to good. 
<P>
     A slight rating indicates that limitations do not restrict equipment use.
 The expected performance of equipment is good. 
<P>
 Windthrow Hazard rates the potential for trees to blow over after a harvest 
entry in an old growth stand.  The rating can be used to determine where 
cutting unit design and the selection of silvicultural systems may have to be
<P>
 modified to reduce mortality because of windthrow in the remaining stand. 
The  rating considers soil properties such as soils with high water tables,
shallow  soils, coarse soil texture, or soils with layers that are restrictive
to tree  roots which affect how firmly roots are held. Topographic position of
the stand  affects exposure of the stand to the wind. 
<P>
     A high rating indicates soil properties that are favorable for windthrow.
 Mortality is probable even after careful cutting unit design has been applied
 to these areas. 
<P>
     A moderate rating indicates that some areas in the landtype are
susceptible  to windthrow.  Design of cutting units around the problem soil
areas can lower  windthrow problems. 
<P>
<P>
     A low rating indicates that soil conditions are not favorable for
windthrow  and special cutting unit design is not needed on these soils. </BODY>
