<U>LOCATION AND SETTING</U>:  West-central Montana; Ninemile Divide; Houle
Creek; 
<P>
NW1/4 of NE1/4, section 7, 15N, R.21W; map unit 60MA.  This soil is formed 
<P>
material derived from moderately weathered metasedimentary bedrock. The slope 
<P>
gradient is 75 percent on a west aspect at 4,400 feet elevation.  The habitat 
<P>
type is Douglas fir/Idaho fescue. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
The A horizon has a silt loam to loam texture, 12 to 16 percent clay, and 10 
<P>
to 45 percent coarse fragments  This horizon has other moist colors such as 
<P>
10YR 3/2 and 10YR 4/4.  These horizons are 4 to 9 inches thick when present, 
<P>
but do not meet mollic epipedon requirements. 
<P>
<P>
The Bw horizons have silt loam to loam textures, 14 to 24 percent clay, and 
<P>
30 to 60 percent gravel.  These horizons have other moist colors such as 10YR 
<P>
4/2 and 5YR 3/4.  The Bw horizons are mildly to strongly effervescent and may 
<P>
have carbonate accumulation on coarse fragments. 
<P>
<P>
The Bk horizons are violently effervescent with moderately alkaline 
<P>
reaction.  Depth to this horizon is typically 20 to 36 inches.  These horizons 
<P>
have silt loam to loam textures, 12 to 18 percent clay, and 40 to 65 percent 
<P>
gravel with up to 20 percent cobble.  The Bk horizons have other moist colors 
<P>
such as 10YR 4/3 and 10YR 5/2.
