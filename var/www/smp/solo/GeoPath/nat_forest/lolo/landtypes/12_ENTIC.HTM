<P>
Creek drainage; SE1/4 of NE1/4, section 33, T20N, R28W; map unit 43QA. This 
<P>
soil is formed in volcanic ash influenced loess overlying material derived
from 
<P>
metasedimentary bedrock.  The slope gradient is 15 percent on a west aspect at 
<P>
5,560 feet of elevation.  The habitat type is subalpine fir/beargrass-grouse 
<P>
whortleberry. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
The Bo horizons have silt loam textures, 6 to 10 percent clay, and 5 to 25 
<P>
percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has other moist colors such as 10YR
5/5 
<P>
and 10YR 4/4.  Some soils have a shallow E horizon. 
<P>
<P>
The 2E horizon has a loam to sandy loam texture, 8 to 14 percent clay, and 35 
<P>
to 75 percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has other moist colors such as 
<P>
10YR 5/4 and 10YR 6/3.  Some soils have 2E/B or 2B/E horizons underlying the
2E 
<P>
horizon.

The 2Bw horizons have silt loam to sandy loam textures, 8 to 22 percent clay, 
<P>
and 35 to 75 percent coarse fragments.  These horizons have other moist colors
