<P>
                                  VEGETATION 
<P>
<P>
The survey area is predominantly forested or potential forest. Ponderosa pine, 
<P>
Douglas-fir, grand fir, western larch, Engelman spruce, lodgepole pine, 
<P>
subalpine fir, mountain hemlock, western redcedar, and western white pine are 
<P>
all imporant coniferous species in the survey area. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Forest vegetation characteristics vary spatially and geographically in this 
<P>
survey area.  Vegetation patterns are created spatially by changes in aspect, 
<P>
slope percent, and elevation over short distances which is typical of 
<P>
mountainous country. Repetitive patterns are reflected by landforms identified 
<P>
in the Land Systems Inventory.  Gradual trends are observed geographically
from 
<P>
west to east which appear to be the result of the change from maritime to 
<P>
continental climate.  A broad boundary drawn north to south through Superior 
<P>
and Plains is a useful approximation of where this change begins to occur.
West 
<P>
of Superior/Plains vegetation indicates more effective moisture and warmer 
<P>
climates.  Species which occur on east, north, and west aspects west of 
<P>
Superior/Plains will occur only on north aspects east of Superior/Plains. 
<P>
Western hemlock, western white pine, mountain hemlock, and western redcedar
are 
<P>
more common in the western portion of the survey area and only occur on more 
<P>
moist microsites in the eastern portion of the survey area. Other areas 
<P>
demonstrate local climatic influences that cause vegetation patterns to stand 
<P>
out as different from the rest of the survey area.  The preponderance of 
<P>
Engelmann spruce in the Lolo Creek drainage on northerly aspects seems to 
<P>
reflect a cooler, more moist environment similar to high elevation continental 
<P>
climates.  Cold air drainage may be the factor responsible for the presence of 
<P>
subalpine fir on valley bottoms in the Seeley Lake area (Hackley, 1980).  This 
<P>
species is otherwise absent in the mixed coniferous forests on side slopes 
<P>
below approximately 5,400 feet. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Periodic wildfires have burned parts of the survey area.  Large fires occurred 
<P>
in 1910 and again in 1929 and 1934.  Fire frequencies average about 30-100 
<P>
years.  Evidence from fires scars on old growth trees on south aspects
indicate 
<P>
fires in some areas can be as frequent as every 8 to 13 years. Open-grown 
<P>
stands of Douglas fir and ponderosa pine have been maintained through frequent 
<P>
occurrence of fire in the understory. Large areas of fire related even aged 
<P>
lodgepole pine stands are on many upper slopes and ridgetops. Mid and lower 
<P>
slopes have mixed stands of Douglas fir and western larch. Stand age varies on 
<P>
these sites by fire occurrence and frequency. Brush fields with scattered
trees 
<P>
are on slopes that burned repeatedly and where re-establishment periods are 
<P>
long because of shallow, rocky soils. 
<P>
<P>
Small openings dominated by alder, bracken fern, coneflower, sedge meadows and 
<P>
sparse clumped stands of subalpine fir are at the high elevations in the far 
<P>
western portion of the survey area near the Idaho border.  These openings have 
<P>
deep, dark soils that are seasonally saturated by well aerated water from
upper 
<P>
slopes. At higher elevations generally on southerly aspects, grasses, forbs, 
<P>
and scattered Douglas fir are in openings on wind swept, well drained ridges. 
<P>
These openings occur in association with north slopes dominated by subalpine 
<P>
fir forests. Brush and forb vegetation is maintained in avalanche chutes in
the 
<P>
higher elevations. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Habitat Types 
<P>
<P>
Habitat types provide those in forest management a permanent and 
<P>
ecologically-based system of land stratification. Distribution of habitat
types 
<P>
over the land is used to evaluate potential land use.  Each habitat type is 
<P>
recognized by distinctive combinations of overstory and understory plant 
<P>
species at climax. They are named for the dominant or characteristic
vegetation 
<P>
of the climax community.  Habitat types are useful in soil surveys for 
<P>
assessing the combined effects of aspect, slope, elevation, and soil
properties 
<P>
on potential plant growth. Habitat types were used in this survey to evaluate 
<P>
potential timber productivity and limitations to forest regeneration. Other 
<P>
interpretations based on habitat types are fire and wildlife habitat
potential. 
<P>
Certain habitat types have been further subdivided into phases to provide 
<P>
additional definition for timber and wildlife interpretations.  Habitat types 
<P>
identified in this survey were defined by the habitat type system developed
for 
<P>
Montana by Pfister et.al. (1977). This system is well suited for this 
<P>
geographical area. 
<P>
<P>
Habitat Type Groups 
<P>
<P>
Individual habitat types often have similar implications for some kinds of 
<P>
interpretive uses. Habitat types with similar implications for soil survey 
<P>
objectives are grouped in this report.  Seral stages of succession or existing 
<P>
vegetation can be different than climax vegetation.  Habitat types are grouped 
<P>
into interpretative groups because of expected seral vegetation as well as the 
<P>
expected climax community.  The groups are named and described below. See the 
<P>
following table for a list of habitat types that occur in each group. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Open grown forest occupies steep south slopes and low elevation benches (below 
<P>
3500 feet).  Douglas fir/Idaho fescue, Douglas fir/pinegrass-bluebunch 
<P>
wheatgrass, Douglas fir/bluebunch wheatgrass, and Douglas fir/rough fescue are 
<P>
important habitat types in this zone.  Climatic conditions limit tree species 
<P>
to ponderosa pine and Douglas fir.  Existing vegetation is generally 
<P>
represented by low density stands with a grass understory and a few scattered 
<P>
shrubs.  Shrub species are chokecherry, serviceberry, snowberry, and ninebark. 
<P>
Regeneration is limited by low effective moisture and high solar insolation. 
<P>
Existing vegetation often provides important elk and deer winter range. 
<P>
Potential timber productivity is low. 
<P>
<P>
Dry Douglas fir forest occupies warm and somewhat dry aspects and is 
<P>
characterized by moderately stocked stands of Douglas fir and ponderosa pine 
<P>
with patchy dense young stands of Douglas fir.  The understory is composed of
a 
<P>
mosaic of shrubs and grasses.  This forest group occupies the climatic zone 
<P>
between the open grown forest and dry mixed coniferous forest.  Western larch 
<P>
is incidental in most stands but can occur in moist draws.  Douglas 
<P>
fir/ninebark-pinegrass phase, Douglas fir/pinegrass, and Douglas 
<P>
fir/snowberry-pinegrass phase are important habitat types.  Stands of timber 
<P>
are slow to regenerate after  &quot;regeneration&quot; harvests because of
competition 
<P>
for moisture by grasses and shrubs.  Important big game forage shrubs such as 
<P>
serviceberry and chokecherry are common.  Existing vegetation often provides 
<P>
important elk and deer winter thermal cover.  Potential timber productiviity
is 
<P>
moderately low and low. 
<P>
<P>
Dry, mixed coniferous forest occupies low elevation north aspects and 
<P>
mid-elevation east and west aspects Douglas fir/ninebark (moist phase) and 
<P>
grand fir/beargrass are two important habitat types in this group. Seral 
<P>
species include western larch, ponderosa pine, and some lodgepole pine.  Some 
<P>
stands are very dense Douglas fir and western larch with a dense ninebark 
<P>
understory.  Inclusions of moister habitat types from the &quot;moist mixed 
<P>
coniferous forest&quot; zone are in drainages and northerly midslopes. 
<P>
Regeneration is rarely limited by site conditions.  These stands are often 
<P>
important thermal cover for elk and deer.  Potential timber productivity is 
<P>
moderate. 
<P>
<P>
Moist, mixed coniferous forest occupies northerly aspects, moist toeslopes,
and 
<P>
moist benches, moist terraces, and on east and west aspects in the far western 
<P>
portion of the survey area.  This group characterizes a favorable climate for 
<P>
tree growth with above-average moisture conditions and moderate temperatures. 
<P>
Grand fir/queencup beadlily, grand fir/twinflower, and western 
<P>
redcedar/queencup beadlily are common habitat types.  Seral species include 
<P>
western larch, Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, western white pine, and ponderosa 
<P>
pine. Inclusions of subalpine fir can occur along some drainages. Regeneration 
<P>
is not limited by site condiitons.  Timber harvest can often increase big game 
<P>
forage.  Potential timber productivity is high. 
<P>
<P>
Cool, somewhat dry Douglas fir forest occupies the zone just below the 
<P>
subalpine forest zone.  This group occurs at elevations between 4800 to 5500 
<P>
feet, but can be higher on southerly aspects.  Important habitat types are 
<P>
Douglas fir/blue huckleberry often with Douglas fir/pinegrass (pinegrass
phase) 
<P>
inclusions.  Grand fir/beargrass replaces Douglas fir/blue huckleberry in 
<P>
similar landscape positions on the far western portion of the survey area. 
<P>
Seral communities are dominated by lodgepole pine, western larch, beargrass, 
<P>
blue huckleberry, and pinegrass.  Regeneration can be limited on southerly 
<P>
aspects by insolation and on ridgetops by wind dessication.  Shrubs decrease 
<P>
after harvest or severe fire.  Potential timber productivity is moderate. 
<P>
<P>
Subalpine forest occupies cold, moist sites above 5500 feet.  It can occupy 
<P>
northerly aspects as low as 4800 feet in the western portion of the survey 
<P>
area.  Important habitat types are subalpine fir/fool's huckleberry on 
<P>
northerly aspects and in moist basins and subalpine fir/beargrass on other 
<P>
aspects of well drained slopes.  Mountain hemlock/beargrass and mountain 
<P>
hemlock/fool's huckleberry are in similar locations west of St.Regis and 
<P>
Plains.  Seral species can include lodgepole pine, Douglas fir, western larch, 
<P>
grand fir and western white pine.  Potential timber productivity is moderately 
<P>
high and high. 
<P>
<P>
Upper elevation subalpine forest occupies upper ridgetops and cirque basins 
<P>
above 6000 feet and extends to 8000 feet.  Important habitat types are 
<P>
subalpine fir/wood-rush and subalpine fir/beargrass on ridgetops and subalpine 
<P>
fir/fool's huckleberry wood-rush-phase in cirque basins.  Mountain hemlock 
<P>
habitat type counterparts exist west of St. Regis and Plains. Whitebark pine 
<P>
and stunted lodgepole pine are characteristic forest components along with 
<P>
subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce.  Trees are more open grown and stunted
with 
<P>
increasing elevation.  Rubblefields are common and increase in area with 
<P>
increasing elevation.  Re-establishment periods for timber can take as long as 
<P>
50 years on these sites because of insolation, short growing period, heavy
snow 
<P>
accumulation, and stress due to frost and high winds.  Potential timber 
<P>
productivity is low and decreases to very low at the highest elevations. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Community Type Groups 
<P>
<P>
There is no habitat type classification system for forest openings. Also the 
<P>
habitat type classification system does not adequately describe the diversity 
<P>
of the riparian areas in the survey area.  The following groups of vegetative 
<P>
community types are used to describe vegetation in these areas. 
<P>
<P>
Moist forest openings occur at high elevation near the Idaho border within the 
<P>
subalpine forest group.  These sites have seasonal water tables and late 
<P>
snowmelt causing moist conditions to persist late into the growing season.  A 
<P>
wide variety of community types occur in these openings, frequently in complex 
<P>
patterns.  Communities dominated by alder, bracken fern, western cone flower
or 
<P>
sedges are common. 
<P>
<P>
Riparian areas are along stream channels.  Fluctuating water tables and 
<P>
changingcharacter of stream systems from reach to reach cause vegetation 
<P>
diversity within small areas.  The complex distribution and large variety of 
<P>
species create unique vegetation communities.  Riparian communities are 
<P>
separated into three subgroups in this soil survey.  Warm forested riparian 
<P>
communities occupy the lower elevation range (below 4800 feet) of major stream 
<P>
courses.  It includes Douglas fir, grand fir (in the western portion of the 
<P>
survey area), cottonwood, grasses, and many of the major local shrub species. 
<P>
Some habitat types observed in this subgroup are Douglas fir/twinflower, 
<P>
spruce/sweet scented bedstraw, spruce/horsetail, and grand fir/queencup 
<P>
beadlily.  Cool forested riparian communities occupy the mid to upper
elevation 
<P>
range (above 4800 feet) of major drainages.  Vegetation includes subalpine
fir, 
<P>
Engelmann spruce, beargrass, twinflower, sometimes queencup beadlily, and many 
<P>
of the major local moist shrub species.  Some habitat types observed in this 
<P>
subgroup are subalpine fir/bluejoint, subalpine fir/queencup beadlily, 
<P>
subalpine fir/sweet scented bedstraw, western redcedar/devil's club, and 
<P>
western redcedar/queencup beadlily.  Non-forested riparian communities occupy 
<P>
those portions of drainages where stream courses meander and soils are too 
<P>
poorly drained for conifers to exist.  Dominant vegetation include willows and 
<P>
sedges.  Riparian areas are important in the survey area although they are of 
<P>
small extent in comparison to other vegetation groups.  These sites are very 
<P>
productive and provide unique diversity important to wildlife.  They also
offer 
<P>
dynamic stability to the watershed. 
<P>
<P>
Grassy balds are on high elevation ridges exposed to strong winds and high 
<P>
insolation.  These communities are surrounded by a tension zone where climatic 
<P>
and soil conditions can support trees but tree establishment is difficult and 
<P>
long term.  Effective moisture is lower than surrounding areas because of 
<P>
redistribution of snow and soils are shallow.  Beargrass, Idaho fescue, 
<P>
bluebunch wheatgrass, sedges, and a wide variety of forbs dominate these 
<P>
communities.  Scattered &quot;wolfy&quot; Douglas fir occupy many of these
communities. 
<P>
<P>
Avalanche Paths are openings maintained by frequent avalanches.  Plant 
<P>
communities are variable.  Communities dominated by alder and other shrubs are 
<P>
common.
