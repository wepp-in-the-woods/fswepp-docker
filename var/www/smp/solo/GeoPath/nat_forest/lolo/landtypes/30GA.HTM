<CENTER>This map unit occurs on moderate relief mountain

<CENTER><U>LANDFORM</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The landform consists of broad, moderately sloping draws and convex
sideslopes.  Slopes are smooth and convex.  Most drainages are intermittent or
ephemeral. Drainage spacing ranges from 1,000 to 2,500 feet.  Drainage
patterns are dendritic.

<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Existing</U>  Vegetation is a mixed forest of lodgepole pine and
Douglas-fir with an occasional ponderosa pine, grand fir, and western larch. 
The understory is dominated by beargrass, pinegrass, and blue huckleberry. 
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  Douglas-fir/blue huckleberry (PSME/VAGL)
is the major HT. The most common HT phase is beargrass (XETE).   A similar HT
occurs grand fir/beargrass (ABGR/XETE) occurs in some delineations on
northerly slopes.  These HTs occupy about 70 percent of the map unit. 
Douglas-fir/pinegrass (PSME/CARU) occurs in openings and on windy ridges. 
This HT occupies about 15 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent dissimilar HTs.  Douglas-fir/ninebark
(PSME/PHMA) occurs at the lower elevation bounds of this unit on southerly
aspects.  These HTs do not support lodgepole pine and are slightly warmer. 
Grand fir/twinflower (ABGR/LIBO) and spruce/twinflower (PICEA/LIBO) occur on
northerly slopes below 5000 feet and in some moist drainageways.  These HTS
are more productive. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY </U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The unit is underlain by well weathered, fine-grained gneisses and granites. 
Rock 
<P>
fragments weather easily because of smaller mineral size and high mafic
mineral content. 
<P>
<P>
Included as similar are alluvium from well weathered granites that is
deposited at the base of these mountain slopes.

Map Unit Summary  Soils are well drained and moderately coarse.  Rock fragment
content ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  These soils are distinquished from
other soils formed from granitics because of soil properties that provide for
different management response. 
<P>
<P>
Composition  Dystric Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid have sandy
loam textures and 35 to 45 percent rock fragments.  Similar soils are Dystric
Eutrochrepts, fine loamy, a slight increase in clay content in the subsoil. 
These are Typic Eutroboralfs, fine loamy, mixed, frigid and occupies less than
5 percent of the map unit.  These soils occupy 90 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
Included are up to 10 percent dissimilar soils.  Dystric Eutrochrepts, sadny
skeletal, mixed, frigid.  These soils have coarse textured subsoils and are
more erosive and less productive. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>Representative Profiles</U> 
<P>
<P>
Dystric Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, frigid, mixed have a soil surface
covered by a layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 2 inches thick.
 Surface layers are pale brown gravelly sandy loam about 8 inches thick.  The
subsurface layers are light gray gravelly sandy loam about 10 inches thick. 
The subsoil is a pale brown very gravelly sandy loam about 33 inches thick. 
Substrata are pale brown very gravelly sandy loam to a depth of 60 inches or
more.

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual production is moderate.  Slopes less than 35
percent are well suited for tractor harvest.  Rotting wood is an important
nitrogen source for this unit. Leaving large diameter logging slash helps
maintain fertility. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Native road surfaces rut when wet.  Erosion from rutting and
tread wear on 
<P>
unsurfaced roads tends to remove fine material.  The remaining gravel and
cobble form a rough surface.  Care is required when constructing roads in and
near stream channels to keep sediment from entering the channel system. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is poorly suited to range management.  The forest
understory produces little forage. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  This unit provides good spring and fall range for
deer and elk. 
<P>
Primary forage value is forbs and grasses available in early successional
communities and within timbered understories.  Shrub forage value is low on
this soil type. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Skid trails, firelines, and roads have a high erosion
hazard.  Sediment 
<P>
delivery efficiency is moderate.  Controlling sediment from roads is
moderately difficult. Controlling sediment can be difficult adjacent to stream
crossings under standard practice.
