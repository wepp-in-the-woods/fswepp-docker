<U>LOCATION AND SETTING</U>:  West-central Montana; Ninemile Divide; Soldier
Creek 
<P>
drainage; SE1/4 of NW1/4, section 26, T.17N, R.23W; map unit 10UA. This soil 
<P>
is formed in alluvial deposits.  This soil is a Typic Haplaquept, fine loamy, 
<P>
mixed, frigid.  The slope gradient is 3 percent on a southwest aspect at 
3,900 
<P>
feet of elevation.  The community type is a wet meadow. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
The A horizon has a loam to silt loam texture and 12 to 23 percent clay. 
<P>
This horizon has other moist colors such as 10YR 3/2 and 10YR 3/1. Some soils 
<P>
have chromas greater than 2 within 20 inches of the surface.  These soils have 
<P>
been classified on the basis of an elevated water table.  The chromas can be 
<P>
higher on these wet mountain soils due to cold oxygenated water. 
<P>
<P>
The Bw horizons have silt loam to loam textures and 10 to 25 percent clay. 
<P>
These horizons have other moist colors such as 10YR 4/3 and 10YR 5/3. Some 
<P>
soils have a Bg horizon in place of or in addition to the Bw horizon. 
<P>
<P>
Cg horizons formed in material derived from glacial till or outwash have 
<P>
sandy loam to loamy sand textures.  Cg horizons formed in material derived
from 
<P>
fine alluvial deposits have silt loam to sandy clay textures.  These horizons 
<P>
have other moist colors such as 7.5YR 5/6 and 7.5YR 4/4.  The Cg horizons have 
<P>
few fine faint to many large prominent mottles.
