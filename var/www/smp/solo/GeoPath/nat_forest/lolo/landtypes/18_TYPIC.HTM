<U>LOCATION AND SETTING</U>:  West-central Montana; Bitteroot Mountains; Deer
Peak; 
<P>
NE1/4 of SE1/4, section 1, T.13N, R.24W; map unit 32QD.  This soil is formed
in 
<P>
material derived from weakly weathered metasedimentary bedrock.  The slope 
<P>
gradient is 50 percent on a south aspect at 6,400 feet of elevation. The 
<P>
habitat type is Douglas fir/blue huckleberry-beargrass. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Some soils have shallow A horizons. 
<P>
<P>
Bw horizons that are formed in moderately weathered metasedimentary material 
<P>
have loam to sandy loam textures.  Bw horizons that are formed in moderately 
<P>
weathered metasedimentary material have silt loam to loam textures. These 
<P>
horizons have 8 to 16 percent clay and 40 to 75 percent coarse fragments. 
Some 
<P>
of  these horizons are mixed with volcanic ash influenced loess.  These 
<P>
horizons have other moist colors such as 10YR 4/4 and 10YR 5/4. 
<P>
<P>
The C horizon has a loam to sandy loam texture, 8 to 14 percent clay, and 55 
<P>
to 85 percent coarse fragments.  These horizons have other moist colors such
as 
<P>
10YR 5/4 and 10YR 5/6.
