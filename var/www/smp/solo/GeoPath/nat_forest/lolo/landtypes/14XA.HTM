<P>
<CENTER><U> SUMMARY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER>The map unit consists of low relief, dissected 
<P>
foothills and benches. Vegetation is dry Douglas 
<P>
fir.  Soils are formed in deep fine sandy and silty 
<P>
lacustrine deposits. </CENTER>

<CENTER><U>TOPOGRAPHY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
This map unit contains rolling foothills to nearly flat benches. Foothills are
dissected by emphermeral stream channels.   Benches near perennial streams and
ancestoral Clark Fork River channels have inclusions of steep escarpments. 
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Existing</U>  Native vegetation is a mixed forest with ponderosa pine and
Douglas fir.  The understory is cominated by bittercherry, kinnikinnick,
snowberry, Idaho fescue, and rough fescue.  Some delineations are under
cultivation or pasture. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  Douglas-fir/snowberry (PSME/SYAL),
Douglasfir/twinflower (PSME/LIBO), and Douglas fir/Idaho fescue (PSME/FEID)
are the major HTs.  PSME/SYAL is on steeper southerly slopes and PSME/CARU is
usually on nearly flat benches.  These HTs occupy 60 percent of the map unit. 
PSME/LIBO is in swales, on notherly aspects, and on toeslope positions and
occupies about 30 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 10 percent dissimilar HTs.  Douglas fir/Idaho fescue
(PSME/FEID)occurs on low elevation south aspects and has a lower timber
productivity. Grand fir/queencup beadlily is on toeslopes of steep mountain
slopes. This HT has a higher productivity.

<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The map unit is underlain by fine sandy to silty lake sediements originating
from 
<P>
ancestral Glacial Lake Missoula and sand bars formed from the Clark Fork
River. Some of these deposits where possibly reworked by wind and appear to be
restricted to the 
<P>
Tarkio/Cyr Flats area.  The bedrock underlying these deep sediments consist
ofargillites, siltites and quartzites of the Belt supergroup.

<CENTER><U>SOILS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>Map Unit Summary</U>  Soils are well drained with coarse to moderately
coarse textures.  Soils are nearly rock free and some substrata have evidence
of calcium carbonate. Soils vary with the amount of sand in the parent
material. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>Composition</U>  Udic Ustochrepts, coarse silty, mixed are formed in very
fine sandyloams to silt loams with less than 12 percent clay. 
<P>
<P>
Alfic Ustipsamments, coarse loamy, mixed, frigid are formed in loamy fine and
veryfine sands.  These soils have thin clay lamellae in the subsoil. 
<P>
<P>
Every delineation has at least one of these soils and can have both. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 5 percent dissimilar soils.  Typic Eutroboralfs,
fine-silty, mixed, frigid have subsoil clay accumulation and silty clay loam
textures occur along map unit delineation boundaries and can be randomly
scattered through the map unit.  These sites have a higher water and nutrient
holding capacity and are more productive. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Representative Profiles</U> 
<P>
<P>
Udic Ustochrepts, coarse silty, mixed, frigid have a soil surface covered by a
layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 1 inch thick.  Surface
layers are very dark grayish brown and light yellowish brown silt loams about
8 inches thick.  Subsoils are brown silt loams about 4 inches thick. Upper
substratum is brown and yellowish brown silt loams about 33 inches thick. 
Lower substratum is yellowish brown silt loams with evidence of calcium
carbonate to a depth of 60 inches or more. 
<P>
<P>
Alfic Ustipsamments, coarse loamy, mixed, frigid have a soil surface covered
by of partially decomposed forest litter about 1 inch thick.  Surface layers
are dark brown loamy fine sands about 9 inches thick. Lower surface layers are
brown and pael brown loamy fine sands about 27 inches.  Subsoils have brown
fine sandy loam bands with light gray loamy fine sands about 30 inches thick.

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U> Potential annual productivity is low.  Tractor harvest or
equipment operation can compact or rut soils when they are moist.  Operating
tractors only when soils are dry, frozen, or snow covered helps maintain soil
productivity.  Moisture stressand competition from grass can limits
regeneration.  Seedlings are subject to frost heaving. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Native roads surfaces rut when wet because of low bearing
strength and are dusty when dry.  Surfacing helps control dust and prevents
rutting.  This materialpipes easily. Cutslopes are highly erosive, slough
easily, and are difficult to revegetate. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  Potential forage production is moderate to high.  Clearing
coniferous vegetation favors graminoid production over shrub production.  The
soil is susceptible to compaction when wet.  Erosion can occur on livestock
trails. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  This map unit provides excellent whitetailed deer
winter range. 
<P>
Forage is available from fliose lichends in forested stands and from scattered
shrubs. Graminoid response is greater than shrub response upon timber harvest.
Maintenance of thermal and security cover may be important on these sites. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Skid trails, firelines, and roads have a high erosion
hazard.  Sediment 
<P>
delivery efficiency is low.  Practices which disturb soil on or near stream
have a high potnetial for increasing sediment.
