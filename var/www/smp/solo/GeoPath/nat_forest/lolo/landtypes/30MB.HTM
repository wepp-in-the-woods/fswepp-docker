<CENTER><U>LANDFORM</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The landform consists of broad, gently sloping draws and convex sideslopes. 
Slopes are complex and are often influenced by the structure of the underlying
bedrock.  Most drainages are intermittent or ephemeral.  Drainage spacing
ranges from 1500 to 2500 feet and drainage patterns are trellis or parallel.

<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Existing  Vegetation is a mixed forest of Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine.
Western larch is a rare component in timber stands except in drainageways and
northerly inclusions.  The understory consists of ninebark, snowberry,
pinegrass, Idaho fescue, chokecherry, and serviceberry. Ceanothus is present
in some openings where seed source is present. 
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  Douglas-fir/ninebark-pinegrass
(PSME/PHMA-CARU) and Douglas-fir/snowberry (PSME/SYAL) are the major HTs. 
Douglas-fir/pinegrass (PSME/CARU) occurs in some delineations and  occupies
less than 20 percent.  These HTs occupy about 80 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 20 percent dissimilar HTs. Douglas-fir/ninebark-ninebark 
<P>
(PSME/PHMA-PHMA) and Douglas-fir/twinflower(PSME/LIBO) are in drainageways, on
toeslope positions, and on northerly aspects.  Timber productivity is higher
and there are less limitations to regeneration. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The unit is underlain by moderately weathered limestones, calcareous
argillite, 
<P>
non-calcareous argillite, and siltite of the Belt Supergroup.  Dominant
formations are Wallace, Helena, and Syeh.  Included as similar are Hasmark,
Libby, Empire, and St. Regis formations. 
<P>
<P>
The bedrock contains moderately weathered layers of metasedimentary rock that
produce soils with soft and moderately soft rock fragments and calcium
carbonate accumulations. Weathering of bedrock varies with hardness of bedrock
and local faulting.  Highly weathered bedrock layers can be present and are
generally associated with fault zones, saddles, drainages, and highly
dissected slopes.  Highly weathered zones of bedrock occupy 15 to 40 percent
of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent bedrock with dissimilar properties.  They are
weakly 
<P>
weathered metasedimentary bedrock of the Belt Supergroup.  Soils formed in
material from this bedrock are not calcareous, are less silty, less easily
weathered rock fragments, and have a higher rock fragment content. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>SOILS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Map Unit Summary</U>  Soils are well drained with medium or moderately fine
textures.  Soils become dry early in the growing season.  Soil properties vary
with degree of weathering of the underlying bedrock.  Subsoil clay
accumulations occur in soils formed from more highly weathered bedrock. 
Subsoils contain less than 50 percent rock fragments and typically have
calcium carbonate accumulations.  Rock fragment durability can be quite low. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Composition</U>  Calcixerollic Xerochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid
have carbonate 
<P>
accumulation in the subsoils.  Similar soils lack subsoil carbonate
accumulation but have similar physical properties.  They are Typic
Xerochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid. These soils occupy about 50
percent of the unit. 
<P>
<P>
Mollic Haploxeralfs, fine loamy, mixed, frigid are formed in material from
more highly weathered metasedimentary rock.  These soils have dark colored
surfaces, subsoil clay accumulations, and carbonate accumulations in the lower
subsoil.  Rock fragment content is less than 35 percent because of high
amounts of soft crushable rock. Similar soils have 35 to 45 percent rock
fragments or have a light surface color.  They are Mollic Haploxeralfs, loamy
skeletal, mixed, frigid or Typic Haploxeralfs, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid,
respectively.  These soils occupy about 35 percent of the unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent dissimilar soils and rock outcrop.  Typic
Xerochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid that are formed in slightly
weathered non-calcareous bedrock have hard angular rock fragments of greater
than 55 percent of the subsoils and substrata, textures are moderately coarse,
and subsoil clay accumulations are absent.  These soils have lower
productivity.  Rock outcrop occupies up to 5 percent of the unit. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>Representative Profiles</U> 
<P>
<P>
Calcixerollic Xerochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid have a soil surface
covered by a layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 1 inch thick. 
Surface layers are dark grayish brown and dark brown loams about 13 inches
thick.  Upper subsoils are dark yellowish brown and yellowish brown very
gravelly silt loams about 21 inches thick.  Lower subsoils are pale brown
gravelly loams about 9 inches thick.  Substrata are light olive brown very
gravelly silt loams and highly weathered calcareous argillite to a depth of 60
inches or more.  Many rock fragments can be crushed by moderate pressure by
the hand. 
<P>
<P>
Mollic Haploxeralfs, fine loamy, mixed, frigid have a soil surface covered by
a layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 1 inch thick. Surface
layers are dark brown very gravelly silt loams about 4 inches thick.  Upper
subsoils are strong brown gravelly loams about 10 inches thick.  Middle
subsoils are strong brown gravelly loams about 11 inches thick.  They have
common moderately thick clay skins along ped faces. Lower subsoils are dark
yellowish brown and light brown gravelly silt loams about 17 inches thick. 
Accumulations of calcium carbonate are throughout 
<P>
the lower subsoil.  Substrata are dark yellowish brown gravelly loams to a
depth of 60 inches or more.  Many rock fragments cna be crushed by moderate
pressure by the hand.

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual productivity is moderately low.  This map unit
contains some slopes suitable for tractor harvest.  Compaction and
displacement of soil surface layers can lower soil productivity.  Operating
equipment only when soil is dry, frozen or snow covered helps maintain soil
productivity.  Competition for moisture from understory vegetation and high
insulation limits forest regeneration.  Shelterwood and selection
silvicultural systems improve regeneration. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Roads should perform well with standard location, construction,
and maintenance practices on most of the unit.  Native rock fragments with low
durability break down over time under heavy traffic.  Unsurfaced roads rut
when wet in drainageways, on soils where bedrock is highly weathered, and
where soils contain few rock fragments.  Spot surfacing or seasonal haul
restrictions will help protect the road surface. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is moderately suited to range management.  The
forest understory produces fair forage but slope steepness can limit access. 
Clearcuts in the first years after harvest offer increased forage. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  This unit provides excellent deer and elk winter
range.  Shrubs and grasses provide the primary forage.  Timber harvest and
prescribed burning can provide moderate benefits by increasing shrub
production. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Skid trails, firelines, and roads have a moderate erosion
hazard.  Roads 
<P>
constructed on subsoils and substrata with more than 35 percent rock fragments
have 
<P>
slightly less erosion hazard.  Sediment delivery efficiency is low.
