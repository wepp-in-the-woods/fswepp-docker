O      1-0 ins. - Partially decomposed forest litter

<P>
A      0-5 ins. - Dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) very gravelly silt loam, yellowish 
<P>
       brown (10YR 5/4) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; 
<P>
       nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; 35 percent

<U>LOCATION AND SETTING</U>:  West-central Montana; Cabinet Mountains;
tributary to 
<P>
Thompson River, Dearborn Creek drainage; center of NW 1/4, section 26, T23N, 
<P>
R28W; map unit 41QA.  This soil is formed in volcanic ash influenced loess 
<P>
overlying material derived from weakly weathered metasedimentary bedrock.  The 
<P>
slope gradient is 75 percent on a east aspect at 5,200 feet of elevation.  The 
<P>
habitat type is subalpine fir/sitka alder. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
The A horizon has a silt loam texture, 6 to 8 percent clay, and 15 to 45 
<P>
percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has other moist colors such as 7.5YR
4/4 
<P>
and 10YR 4/3.  Some soils do not have an A horizon. 
<P>
<P>
The Bo horizon has a silt loam texture, 6 to 8 percent clay, and 45 to 80 
<P>
percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has other moist colors such as 10YR
4/4 
<P>
and 7.5YR 4/6.  A few soils have shallow Bw horizons underlying the Bo
horizon. 
<P>
<P>
The 2BC or 2C horizon has a sandy loam texture, 8 to 12 percent clay, and 55 
<P>
to 90 percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has another moist color such of 
<P>
10YR 5/6. 
<P>
<P>
Depth to bedrock is 10 to 23 inches.
