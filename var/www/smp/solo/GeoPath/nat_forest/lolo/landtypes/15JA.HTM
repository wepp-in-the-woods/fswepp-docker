<CENTER><U>TOPOGRAPHY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
This landform consists of low relief footslopes, benches and fans positioned
at the base of moderate to high relief mountain slopes.  Drainageways are
broad and low gradient. Subsurface water is common in these drainageways. 
Ponds, seeps and perched water tables occur along these drainageways and
occasionally in swales and depressions.

<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Existing</U>  Vegetation is a mixed forest with inclusions of non-forested
riparian.  Dry Douglas-fir forests are dominated by ponderosa pine and
Douglas-fir.  The understory is composed of kinnikinnick, pinegrass,
serviceberry, snowberry, ninebark, and Idaho fescue. Dry, mixed coniferous
forests occur in some delineations above 4000 feet and along moist
drainageways.  Western larch is included in these forests and several
delineations in the Little Thompson River drainage are dominated by lodgepole
pine.  Understories contain serviceberry, buffaloberry, dwarf huckleberry,
twinflower, wood's rose, grouse whortleberry, and pinegrass. on-forested
riparian consists of sedge, bluejoint, aspen, and willow. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  This map unit contains Douglas fir/dwarf
huckleberry 
<P>
(PSME/VACA), Douglas fir/snowberry (PSME/SYAL), Douglas fir/pinegrass
(PSME/CARU), and Douglas fir/ninebark (PSME/PHMA).  PSME/VACA occurs on nearly
flat landscapes and are supported by non-stony to stony surface soils.  This
habitat type is most prevalent in delineations above 4000 feet.  PSME/PHMA
occurs on very to extremely stony surface soils below 4000 feet.  PSME/SYAL
and PSME/CARU are in delineations east of Alberton below about 4000 feet. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 20 percent dissimilar HTs.  Grand fir/twinflower
(ABGR/LIBO) occurs in some moist drainageways.  Timber productivity is higher
in this HT. Non-forested riparian vegetation consisting of grasses and sedges
occur on poorly drained areas along broad, poorly defined drainageways.  High
water tables pose limitations to roads and timber regeneration.

<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
This map unit is underlain by valley fill material which was deposited in
mountain valleys over a long period of time, most likely during Tertiary and
early Quaternary periods. This valley fill material is highly variable.  Most
of the deposits exhibit a high degree of weathering in the subsoils with
higher than average clay contents for soils formed from Belt metasedimentary
rocks.  Rock fragment contents range from 0-45 percent, are poorly sorted, and
are mostly comprised of Belt metasedimentary rocks.  Stones occur on the
surface to a depth of 5 feet in some delineations. Stony surfaces are most
common on fans forned below drainage channels flowing from adjacent mountain
slopes. Glacial till deposits cap some of these Tertiary valley fill benches
at the higher elevations. Somewhat poorly drained areas aand ponds occur on
pockets of fine and moderately fine 
<P>
extured valley fill. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 5 percent parent materials derived from slightly weathered 
<P>
metasedimentary bedrock.  Rock fragment content is 45 to 75 percent and clay
contents are less.

<U>Map Unit Summary</U>  Soils are moderately well drained with some poorly
drained inclusions. Subsoils have medium to moderately fine textures, have
subsoil clay accumulation, and contain 0 to 45 percent rock fragments. 
Surface soils have a high silt content and can contain up to 40 percent large
stones in some delineations. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Composition </U> Typic Eutroboralfs, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid have
greater than 35 percent rock fragments and have 20 to 35 percent clay in the
subsoil.  These soils occupy about 50 percent of the map unit.

<P>
Typic Eutroboralfs, fine loamy, mixed, frigid  have less than 35 percent rock
fragments and have 25 to 35 percent clay in the subsoil.  Similar soils are
Typic Eutroboralfs, fine, mixed, frigid.  They have about 35 to 45 percent
clay content in the subsoil.  These soils occupy about 35 percent of the map
unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent dissimilar soils.  Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts,
loamy 
<P>
skeletal, mixed, frigid and Udic Ustochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed are on
inclusions of soils formed in Belt metasedimentary bedrock.  These soils have
45 to 75 percent rock fragments in the subsoil.  Quality of native road
surfaces is higher on these soils. Aquepts and Aquolls are in poorly drained
areas supporting non-forested riparian vegetation.  These soils pose severe
limitations to roads and timber regeneration.

<P>
<U>Representative Profile</U> 
<P>
<P>
Typic Eutroboralfs, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid have a soil surface covered
by a layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 1 inch thick. Surface
layers are dark brown gravelly silt loams about 8 inches thick. Subsurface
layers are brown very cobbly silty clay loams about 10 inchest thick.  Subsoil
layers are brown  very gravelly silty clay loams about 25 inches thick and
have moderately thick clay skins on ped faces.  Substrata are light brown very
cobbly silty clay loams to a depth of 60 inches or more.

Typic Eutroboralfs, fine loamy, mixed, frigid have a soil surface covered by a
layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 1 inch thick. Surface layers
are brown gravelly silt loams about 11 inches thick.  Subsurface layers are
brown and pale brown silt loams about 9 inches thick.  Susoils are pale brown
to brownish yellow gravelly and cobbly silty clay loams about 29 inches thick.
 Substrata are light brown cobbly silty clay loams or silt loams to a depth of
60 inches or more.

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U> Potential annual productivity is moderate.  Tractor harvest or
equipment operation can compact or rut soils when they are moist. Operating
tractors only when soils are dry, frozen, or snow covered helps maintain soil
productivity.  Designated skid trails that avoid wet areas will reduce
potential for soil impacts. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Native roads surfaces rut when wet because of low bearing
strength and are very dusty when dry.  Surfacing helps control dust and
prevents rutting. Poorly sorted material with a high content of rock fragments
over 10 inches (stones) produce poor running surfaces in some delineations. 
Seeps and poorly drained areas can be avoided in most cases during road
location. 
<P>
<P>
RANGE  This map unit is well suited to range management.  The forest
understory produces good transitory range.  Forage can be enhanced through
timber harvest or burning.  Spring and early summer grazing increases
potential for soil compaction. 
<P>
<P>
WILDLIFE-FISHERIES This map unit provides good spring, summer, and fall
habitat and 
<P>
critical winter range for deer and elk.  Timber harvest or underburning can
increase 
<P>
forage production.  Foliose lichens are an important source of forage in the
winter. 
<P>
A diversity of timbered and nontimbered areas can be provided for by timber
harvest. 
<P>
<P>
WATERSHED  Skid trails, roads, and firelines have a high erosion hazard. 
Sediment 
<P>
delivery efficiency is low.  Only practices which disturb soil on or near
streams have a high potential for increasing sediment.
