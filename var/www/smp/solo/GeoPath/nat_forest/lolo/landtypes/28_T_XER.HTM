<U>LOCATION AND SETTING</U>:  West-central Montana; Ninemile Divide; tributary
to 
<P>
Clark Fork River, Fourmile Creek; NW1/4 SW1/4, section 25, T.18N, R.27W; map 
<P>
unit 60QA.  This soil is formed in material derived from weakly weathered 
<P>
metasedimentary bedrock.  The slope gradient is 65 percent on a southwest 
<P>
aspect at 4,640 feet elevation.  The habitat type is Douglas fir/rough fescue. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
The A horizon has a silt loam to loam texture, 8 to 16 percent clay, and 20 
<P>
to 55 percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has other moist colors such as 
<P>
10YR 3/3 and 7.5YR 3/2. 
<P>
<P>
Some soils have an E horizon with clay percents and textures similar to the 
<P>
underlying horizon.  This horizon has 25 to 85 percent coarse fragments.  The 
<P>
upper end of this range represents soils that occur on steep slopes. This 
<P>
horizon has other moist colors such as 10YR 4/3 and 10YR 6/3. 
<P>
  
<P>
Bw horizons formed in material derived from weakly weathered metasedimentary 
<P>
material have sandy loam textures, 8 to 14 percent clay, and 45 to 60 percent 
<P>
gravel with 10 to 30 percent cobble.  The Bw horizons formed in material 
<P>
derived from moderately weathered metasedimentary material have silt loam to 
<P>
loam textures, 14 to 20 percent clay, and 45 to 65 percent gravel with up to
10 
<P>
percent cobble.  The upper end of the range of coarse fragments represents 
<P>
soils that occur on steep slopes.  The Bw horizon has other moist colors such 
<P>
as 10YR 6/4 and 10YR 5/4. 
<P>
<P>
The C horizon is similar in color and texture to the overlying horizon.  This 
<P>
horizon has 10 to 15 percent more cobble than the Bw horizon.  Depth to this 
<P>
horizon is from 24 to 57 inches.  Bedrock is 3 to 5 feet deep in these soils.
