<P>
<P>
<P>
M.U. SETTING  The landform consists of high stream terraces.  Map units are 
<P>
near the mouth of streams tributary to the Clark Fork River. 
<P>
<P>
<U>M.U. COMPONENTS</U>   Soils are formed in very cobbly alluvium with a thick
surface 
<P>
layer of silty lacustrine deposits.  Surface soil textures are moderately fine 
<P>
and subsoil textures are moderately coarse.  Native vegetation is Douglas fir 
<P>
and grand fir forests. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ADJOINING M.U</U>.  Adjacent units are recent floodplains and lower stream
terraces 
<P>
that support riparian vegetation or meadow and steep, rocky mountain slopes 
<P>
with dense Douglas-fir or grand fir forests.

<P>
<P>
This map unit consists of high alluvial terraces well above the stream 
<P>
floodplain.  These old stream terraces have been dissected by valley
downcutting 
<P>
leaving these terraces perched above younger stream-formed landforms. These 
<P>
terraces have gently sloping surfaces and steep escarpments on the downcut 
<P>
side.  Relief on the escarpments may vary from 30-200 feet. 
<P>
Sediment delivery efficiency is low from the nearly level surfaces of this 
<P>
landform but can be quite high from escarpments.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U> The map unit consists of Douglas
fir/dwarf 
<P>
huckleberry (PSME/VACA), Douglas fir/twinflower (PSME/LIBO), and Douglas 
<P>
fir/snowberry (PSME/SYAL) - 30 percent; grand fir/twinflower (ABGR/LIBO) and 
<P>
grand fir/queencup beadlily (ABGR/CLUN) - 60 percent. Included HT with 
<P>
dissimilar management implications is Douglas fir/Idaho fescue (PSME/FEID) -
10 
<P>
percent. 
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE DISTRIBUTION AND CHARACTERISTICS</U>  PSME/VACA, PSME/LIBO,
and 
<P>
PSME/SYAL occur in a mosaic on southerly aspects throughout the unit.
PSME/LIBO 
<P>
occurrence is of small extent. A relatively warm and dry climate, with
seasonal 
<P>
cool air drainage, and a moderate timber productivity is associated with these 
<P>
HTs. ABGR/LIBO and ABGR/CLUN occur on other than south aspects and indicate a 
<P>
cool and moist climate and high timber productivity. An included HT of small 
<P>
extent with similar management implications is subalpine fir/twinflower 
<P>
(ABLA/LIBO). 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 10 percent dissimilar HTs. PSME/FEID occurs on the lowest 
<P>
elevations of this map unit and has a lower productivity. 
<P>
<P>
<U>EXISTING VEGETATION</U> is a Douglas fir and grand fir forest.  Seral
stands include 
<P>
western larch, ponderosa pine and Douglas fir.  The forest understory is 
<P>
composed of dwarf huckleberry, kinnikinnick, pinegrass, snowberry, and Idaho 
<P>
fescue on southerly aspects. Other aspects support grand fir, western larch, 
<P>
Douglas fir, twinflower, queencup beadlily, red osier dogwood, serviceberry, 
<P>
rocky mountain maple, and western meadowrue. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>OCCURRENCE</U> The unit is underlain by deep alluvium with a thick deposit
of 
<P>
lacustrine sediments on or near the surface. These unconsolidated materials
were 
<P>
deposited during times of heavy glacier melt and subsequently have been 
<P>
partially eroded by valley downcutting.  As a result, these materials occur
high 
<P>
above the existing stream channels and terrace-like features may or may not be 
<P>
striking depending on subsequent downcutting. 
<P>
<P>
Included with dissimilar properties are Belt supergroup metasedimentary
bedrock 
<P>
that outcrops where valley downcutting has exposed it. Soils are very shallow 
<P>
and productivity is much lower.

<CENTER><U>SOILS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<P>
Typic Eutroboralfs, fine silty over loamy skeletal 
<P>
<P>
<U>GENERAL NATURE OF SOILS</U>   Soils are well drained and deep.  Moderately
fine 
<P>
textures derived from lacustrine silts extend to a depth of 2 feet and have a 
<P>
moderately slow permeability. Subsoils contain greater than 35 percent rock 
<P>
fragments and are moderately coarse textured. 
<P>
<P>
<U>COMPOSITION</U> The major soil has a silty clay loam surface layer, 2 feet
thick, 
<P>
formed in silty lacustrine deposits. The subsoil is a very cobbly sandy loam 
<P>
formed in alluvial deposits.  Included are similar soils with silty surface 
<P>
layers containing less clay.   These soils occupy 85 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent dissimilar soils. Soils that have moderately 
<P>
coarse textured surface layers instead of the moderately fine textured surface 
<P>
occur near the edge of map unit boundaries and are less productive timber
sites. 
<P>
These soils are Typic Xerochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed on south aspects and 
<P>
Dystric Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed on other aspects. 
<P>

<P>
<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U> This map unit is moderately suited to timber management.
Potential annual 
<P>
production is ____ cu.ft/A/yr or moderate on south aspects and high on other 
<P>
aspects.  Included terrace escarpments limit equipment operation due to slope 
<P>
steepness and sediment delivery risk. Stream bottoms included in some map
units 
<P>
will require special harvest methods. Equipment operation can compact or rut
the 
<P>
soil under certain moisture conditions on the nearly flat surfaces. Operating 
<P>
equipment only when the soil is dry or snow covered helps maintain soil 
<P>
productivity.  Seeding establishment is slowed by grass competition and
moisture 
<P>
stress on south aspects. Other aspects pose few regeneration problems.  
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  The very cobbly sandy loam subsoil usually is exposed by
construction and 
<P>
cause roadbeds to be rough and  irregular.  Steep cutslopes in this material 
<P>
tend to ravel. Unsurfaced  roads  built in the non-gravelly silty clay loam 
<P>
surface material become rutted when wet and dusty when dry.  Excavation below 
<P>
silty clay loam surface, surfacing or seasonal closures help overcome these 
<P>
limitations. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is well suited to range management.  Potential
forage 
<P>
production is low to moderate.  The soil is susceptible to compaction in the 
<P>
spring.  Grazing should be delayed until the soil is dry enough to support 
<P>
livestock. Erosion will occur on trails made on terrace escarpments that
access 
<P>
stream bottoms. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES 
<P>
<P>
WATERSHED</U> The major watershed management concern is controlling sediment 
<P>
produced when terrace escarpments are undercut by streams or escarpments have 
<P>
bee disturbed by management.  The very cobbly sandy loam subsoils ravel when 
<P>
exposed and are major sources of sediment.  The terrace surfaces which are 
<P>
nearly flat have low sediment delivery efficiency but consist of highly
erodible 
<P>
material which pose a potentially large sediment contribution if roads provide 
<P>
transport points to the nearby streams.
