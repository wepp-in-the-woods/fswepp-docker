<CENTER><U>SUMMARY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER>This map unit occurs on moderate relief mountain 
<P>
slopes.  Vegetation is moist, mixed coniferous 
<P>

<P>

<CENTER><U>LANDFORM</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The landform consists of broad, gently sloping draws and convex sideslopes. 
Slopes are complex and are often influenced by the structure of the underlying
bedrock.  Most drainages are intermittent or perennial, first and second order
streams.  Drainage spacing ranges from 800 to 1500 feet and drainage patterns
are trellis or parallel.  Subsurface drainage is common in zones of
thin-bedded bedrock.

<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Existing</U>  Vegetation is a mixed forest dominate by western larch, grand
fir, lodgepole pine, western red cedar (in THPL/CLUN), spruce, and Douglas-
fir.  The understory consists of twinflower, queenscup beadlily, service-
berry, rocky mountain maple, blue huckleberry, and beargrass. 
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  Western red cedar/queencup beadlily
(THPL/CLUN) and grand fir/queencup beadlily (ABGR/CLUN) are the major HTs. 
They are on northerly slopes, drainageways, benches and toeslopes.  They
occupy about 60 percent of the map unit.  Grand fir/twinflower (ABGR/LIBO) is
mostly on east and west aspects and occupies about 30 percent of the map unit.
 A similar habitat type, spruce/twinflower (PICEA/LIBO), occurs along with
grand fir/twinberry (ABGR/LIBO) in northerly delineations in the Lolo Creek
drainage. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 10 percent dissimilar HTs.  Grand fir/beargrass (ABGR/XETE)
and 
<P>
Douglas-fir/blue huckleberry (PSME/VAGL) can occur on upper slopes near the
ridge and on drier aspects.  Timber productivity is lower on these sites. 
Subalpine fir/menziesia (ABLA/MEFE) occurs in some cold drainageways.  Timber
productivity is similar but these sites present heavy brush competition to
regeneration.

<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The unit is underlain by moderately weathered limestones, calcareous
argillite, 
<P>
non-calcareous argillite, and siltite of the Belt Supergroup.  Dominant
formations are Wallace, Helena, and Syeh.  Included as similar are Hasmark,
Libby, Empire, and St. Regis formations. 
<P>
<P>
The bedrock contains moderately weathered layers of metasedimentary rock that
produce soft and moderately soft rock fragments.  Weathering of bedrock varies
with hardness of bedrock and local faulting.  Highly weathered bedrock layers
can be present and are geneally associated with fault zones, saddles,
drainages, and highly dissected slopes.  Highly weathered zones of bedrock
occupy 15 to 40 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent bedrock with dissimilar properties.  They are
weakly 
<P>
weathered metasedimentary bedrock of the Belt Supergroup.  Soils formed in
material from this bedrock are not calcareous, are less silty, have less
easily weathered rock fragments, and have a higher rock fragment content. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>SOILS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Map Unit Summary</U>  Soils are well drained with medium textures.  These
soils have a silty surface derived from volcanic ash influenced loess. 
Subsoils have 35 to 55 percent rock fragments.  Rock fragment durability can
be quite low on highly weathered bedrock. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Composition</U>  Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid
have loess surface layers 8 to 13 inches thick.  Subsoils and substrata
contain rock fragments of low durability.  Similar soils have loess layers 14
to 16 inches thick. They occur west of St. Regis and are Typic Vitrandepts,
medial over loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid.  These soils occupy about 90
percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 10 percent dissimilar soils and rock outcrop.  Typic
Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid occur on southerly aspects where
loess surface layers are mixed with the subsoils or absent.  Rock outcrop
occupies up to 5 percent of the unit. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>Representative Profile</U> 
<P>
<P>
These Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid have a soil
surface covered by a layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 3
inches thick.  Surface layers are dark brown to strong brown silt loams about
10 inches thick.  Upper subsoils are dark yellowish brown gravelly loams about
4 inches thick.  Lower subsoils are yellowish brown to olive brown very
gravelly loams about 27 inches thick. Substrata are yellowish brown very
gravelly loams to a depth of 60 inches or more.  Some rock fragments can be
crushed by moderate pressure by the hand. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Classification Remarks</U>  This map unit comprises a range of bedrock
weathering from 
<P>
moderate to high over short distances.  Some soils from highly weathered
bedrock have clay skins but rarely meet argillic classification criteria for
percent increase in clay. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual productivity is high.  This map unit can
contain slopes suitable for tractor harvest.  Compaction of soil surface
layers can lower soil productivity. Operating equipment only when soil is dry,
frozen or snow covered helps maintain soil productivity. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Roads should perform well with standard location, construction,
and maintenance practices on most of the unit.  Native rock fragments with low
durability break down over time under heavy traffic.  Unsurfaced roads rut
when wet in drainageways, on soils where bedrock is highly weathered, and
where soils contain few rock fragments.  Spot surfacing or seasonal haul
restrictions will help protect the road surface. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is poorly suited to range management.  The forest
understory produces little forage and slope steepness limits access. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  Early seral shrub communities provide very
productive songbird 
<P>
habitat.  Mature or old-growth forests provide good deer and elk winter range
and thermal cover.  Thinning overstocked pole communities and regeneration
timber harvest to improve age class diversity can improve wildlife habitat. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Skid trails and firelines have moderate erosion hazard.
Roads have a 
<P>
moderately low erosion hazard.  Sediment delivery efficiency is low except
near stream crossings where delivery efficiency is high.
