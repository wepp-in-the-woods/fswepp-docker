<U>Road Construction, Construction Materials, and Revegetation of Disturbed Areas
<P>
</U>
<P>
Table III-2 gives a limitation rating and the major contributing factor and
<P>
indicates the suitabilities for use of native soil materials on road surfaces,
<P>
for revegetation of soil exposed by construction, and for aggregate source.
<P>
Road construction is limited by the following properties: steep slopes,
<P>
drainage channel frequency, shallow ground water, rock outcrops or rubble,
<P>
broken slopes, shallow soils, and hard bedrock.  These properties increase the
<P>
time and expense required to construct roads. Drainage channel frequency and
<P>
shallow ground water affect the amount of cross drainage needed and can require
<P>
special design features to protect the road prism.  Steep slopes can require
<P>
full bench construction and the location of numerous fill sites.  Rock outcrop
<P>
and shallow soils require construction in bedrock and blasting.  A <U>good</U> or
<P>
slight rating means that soil properties are generally favorable for the rated
<P>
used.  A <U>fair</U> or moderate rating means that some map unit properties are
<P>
unfavorable, but they can be overcome by commonly used practices.  A <U>poor</U>
or
<P>
severe rating means that map unit properties are so unfavorable.  Major
<P>
additional costs or special practices are required to overcome or correct the
<P>
limitations.  For a more complete description of limitations consult the
<P>
management considerations section in the map unit descriptions.
<P>
<P>
<U>Excavation</U> is affected by slope steepness, depth to non-rippable
bedrock and
<P>
frequency of wet areas.  Map units with <U>slight</U> limitation have slopes
less than
<P>
55 percent, no wet areas and little or no non-rippable bedrock within the layer
<P>
excavated.  Map units with <U>moderate</U> limitation have common wet areas, steep
<P>
slopes or some non-rippable bedrock within the layer excavated. Average slope
<P>
steepness is 55 to 65 percent, but can be variable with slopes of 45 to 55
<P>
percent. Slope complexity is moderate which gives the opportunity to avoid long
<P>
haul distances and major excavation when locating roads.  Map units with <U>severe</U>
<P>
limitations have frequent non-rippable bedrock within the area excavated and
<P>
have slopes commonly greater than 65 percent or have continuous wet areas.  On
<P>
steep slopes, end hauling is often required and haul distances can be great.
<P>
<P>
Cut and fill maintenance is affected by shallow groundwater, flooding,
<P>
avalanches, sheet and rill erosion, brush encroachment, cutslope sloughing, and
<P>
cutslope raveling.  Shallow ground water is intercepted by road cuts and can
<P>
cause erosion and slumping.   Cutslope slumping and ravelling plugs ditches and
<P>
culverts which can result in erosion of road surface and fill slopes.  Roads
<P>
constructed on map units with slight limitations normally require only routine
<P>
maintenance.  Roads constructed on map units with moderate limitations
<P>
occasionally require special maintenance.  These practices can include removing
<P>
material blocking the drainage system or road surface as a result of cutbank
<P>
erosion, raveling, slumping or avalanches; or replacing culverts and fills
<P>
damaged by floods.  Roads constructed on map units with severe limitations
<P>
frequently require special maintenance practices.
<P>
<P>
<U>Native road surface</U> is a rating of the suitability of native soil material
<P>
exposed by road construction for use as a road surface. Suitability is limited
<P>
by soil material which ruts or becomes slippery when wet and/or  which contains
<P>
large stones or many rock fragments larger than 3 inches in diameter.   Map
<P>
units that contain soils with different suitability are rated by the least
<P>
suitable soil.  Substratum soil properties determine native road surface
<P>
performance on steep slopes.  On gentle slopes, contrasting soil properties
<P>
from the surface to substratum layers are considered. The average slope
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
gradient of a map unit is used to determine which soil layer will be exposed on
<P>
native road surfaces. Map units rated <U>good</U> contain moderately coarse grained
<P>
soils that have good binding properties and few rock fragments greater than 3
<P>
inches in diameter. Map units rated <U>fair</U> either contain soils with many rock
<P>
fragments over 3 inches in diameter, slighty plastic soils with low bearing
<P>
strength or sandy soils with poor binding properties. Soils with poor binding
<P>
properties and high in silt content can be dusty when dry. Map units rated <U>poor</U>
<P>
contain slighty plastic and plastic soils with less than 15 percent gravel and
<P>
soils containing mica. Native road surfaces rut severely when wet and are
<P>
erodible on steeper grades.
<P>
<P>
<U>Revegetation of disturbed sites</U> is a rating of the suitability of the material
<P>
exposed by road construction or similar construction activities for
<P>
establishment of erosion control seedings. It is assumed that road cuts/fills
<P>
have been constructed at a slope ratio stable enough to support vegetation.
<P>
These seedings are mixtures of climatically adapted grasses and legumes.  The
<P>
seed is broadcast as soon as possible after construction.  An application of
<P>
fertilizer suited for the site is included in the seeding. An application of
<P>
mulch applied to harsh sites can increase revegetation success.  Suitability is
<P>
affected by soil fertility, water holding capacity and climatic limitations.
<P>
Map units rated <U>good</U> contain loamy or clayey material and are within
the dry or
<P>
moist, mixed coniferous or subalpine forests. Map units rated <U>fair</U> contain
<P>
loamy or clayey material and are in the dry, Douglas-fir or cool, somewhat dry
<P>
Douglas-fir forests or include the grassy bald community type. Special
<P>
practices used to overcome limitations may include a mulch treatment and/or
<P>
reseeding areas to achieve successful, consistant ground cover establishment.
<P>
Map units rated <U>poor</U> may contain sandy material or are in the open grown
<P>
forest.  Special practices can include mulch treatment, extensive reseeding,
<P>
more close consideration of timinig of seeding to optimize use of seasonal
<P>
moisture,  a series of fertilizer applications, reduced cutslope ratios,
<P>
topsoiling, and hand planting shrubs/trees.
<P>
<P>
<U>Aggregate source</U> is the probability for an aggregate source occurrence
in a
<P>
map unit. This rating is based on the observed presence of gravel and material
<P>
and its ease of excavation, or the presence of rock suitable for quarry sites.
<P>
Map units rated <U>good</U> contain &quot;pit run&quot; deposits with large
volumes of less than
<P>
3 inch diameter rock and fine fraction that is limited to sand, or with only
<P>
small amounts of slighty plastic silts and clays. Lenses of other less
<P>
desirable material may occur, but can be easily avoided or sorted. Map units
<P>
rated <U>fair</U> contain deposits of suitable material included in less suitable
<P>
material. Sorting the suitable material can require specialized equipment. Also
<P>
included in this rating are map units with crushable bedrocks, e.g. depth of
<P>
overburden is less than 6 feet. Map units rated <U>poor</U> do not contain
deposits of
<P>
suitable material within 6 feet of the surface or overburden is greater than 6
<P>
feet deep.</BODY>
