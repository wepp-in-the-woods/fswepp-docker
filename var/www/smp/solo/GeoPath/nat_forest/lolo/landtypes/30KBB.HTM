<CENTER><U>LANDFORM</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The landform consists of broad, moderately sloping draws and convex
sideslopes.  Slopes are smooth and convex.  Large granitic outcrops called
tors are dispersed througout this unit creating complex relief. Most drainages
are perennial or ephemeral.  Drainage spacing ranges from 800 to 1,500 feet. 
Drainage patterns are dendritic.

<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Existing</U>  Vegetation is a mixed forest of lodgepole pine and western
larch with an occasional subalpine fir and Douglas fir.  The understory can be
dominated by beargrass, menziesia, twinflower, and blue huckleberry. 
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  Subalpine fir/beargrass,(ABLA/XETE) and
subalpine 
<P>
fir/menziesia (ABLA/MEFE) are the major HTs.  ABLA/XETE occurs on southerly
slopes and occupies about 50 percent of the map unit.  ABLA/MEFE occurs on
northerly slopes.  A similar HT, spruce/twinflower (PICEA/LIBO) occurs along
drainageways and some gentle northerly slopes.  These HTs occupy about 40
percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 10 percent dissimilar HTs.  Douglas-fir/blue
huckleberry-beargrass (PSME/VAGL-XETE) occur at the lower elevation bounds of
this map unit. This HTS are less productive. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY
<P>
</U></CENTER>
<P>
The unit is underlain by large grained granites and gruss of the Idaho
Batholith.  This material rapidly decomposes to coarse sandy and gravelly soil
material locally known as decomposed granites. Granitic tors composed of
harder granite are significant features of this landscape.

<P>
<CENTER><U>SOILS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Map Unit Summary</U>  Soils are somewhat excessively drained and coarse.
Rock fragment 
<P>
content ranges from 35 to 55 percent.  Surface soils are formed in volcanic
ash influenced loess.  Boulders and tors are a common feature. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Composition</U>  Andic Cryochrepts, sandy skeletal, mixed have coarse sandy
loam and 
<P>
loamy sand textures.  They have sandy loam textures with a low fine fraction
content. These soils occupy about 75 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 25 percent dissimilar soils and rock outcrop.  Andic
Dystric Eutrochrepts, sandy skeletal, mixed, frigid.  These soils support
cool, somewhat dry Douglas-fir forests where regeneration can be limited by
moisture stress.  Aquic Cryochrepts and Cryaquepts occur in some broad,
basin-like drainageways.  These soils are wet for significant periods and pose
limitations to harvest and regeneration. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>Representative Profiles</U> 
<P>
<P>
Andic Cryochrepts, sandy skeletal, mixed have a soil surface covered by a
layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 2 inches thick.  Surface
layers are light yellowish brown loam about 8 inches thick.  The subsurface
layers are light gray very gravelly coarse sandy loam about 10 inches thick. 
The subsoil is a very pale brown and yellowish brown very gravelly coarse
sandy loam about 24 inches thick.  Substrata are pale brown verygravelly loamy
coarse sand and coarse sandy loam to a depth of 40 inches or more.

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual production is moderate in ABLA/XETE HTS and
high in ABLA/MEFE HTs.  Slopes less than 35 percent are well suited for
tractor harvest. Granitic outcrops and boulders present limitations to skid
trail placement.  Site productivity depends on the relatively thin, fine
textured soil surface layer.   Tractor operation can reduce site productivity
by displacing or compacting the surface layer.  Rotting wood is an important
nitrogen source for this unit.  Leaving large diameter logging slash helps
maintain fertility. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>   Erosion from rutting and tread wear on unsurfaced roads and
along ditches can be severe on grades above 6 percent.  Hard granitic bedrock
occasionally limits excavation. Material exposed by road construction is
subject to ravel and difficult to revegetate. Special seed mixes, use of
shrubs species, several fertilizer applications, and much can enhance success
rate in revegetating disturbed areas.  Care is required when constructing
roads in and near stream channels to keep sediment from entering the channel
system. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is poorly suited to range management.  The forest
understory produces little forage. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  This unit provides good summer range for deer and
elk.  Primary forage value is forbs and grasses available in fully stocked
conifer stands. Forage response from treatment is minimal.  Opportunities for
habitat enhancement are limited. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Skid trails, firelines, and roads have a very high erosion
hazard.  Sediment delivery efficiency is moderate.  Controlling sediment can
be difficult on roads and adjacent to stream crossings under standard
practice.
