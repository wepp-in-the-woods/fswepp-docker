<P>
<P>
This landform consists of low to moderate relief footslopes and terraces with
soured 
<P>
crests, undulating small benches, and broad, moderately sloping drainages. 
Some 
<P>
delineations have small areas of ponded water.

<CENTER><U>VEGETATION
<P>
</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Existing</U>  Vegetation is a mixed forest of Douglas fir, grand fir, and
western larch.  The forest understory on southerly slopes is composed of
bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, snowberry, and pinegrass.  The forest
understory on northerly slopes is composed of twinflower, pinegrass, ninebark,
queencupbeadlily, and beargrass. 
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  Douglas-fir/ninebark-ninebark
(PSME/PHMA-PHMA), grand 
<P>
fir/queencup beadlily (ABGR/CLUN), and grand fir/twinflower (ABGR/LIBO) are
the major HTs.  PSME/PHMA-PHMA occur on east and west aspects and occupy about
35 percent of the map unit.  North aspects support ABGR/LIBO and ABGR/CLUN. 
These HTs occupy about 50 percent of the map unit.  Southerly aspects with
shallow soils support Douglas-fir/Idaho fescue (PSME/FEID) and occupy 15
percent of the map unit.

<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Surficial deposits are a complex of colluvial deposits from moderately
weathered Belt metasedimentary rocks, water scoured surfaces exposing bedrock,
and extremely gravelly coarse sandy alluvial lakeshore deposits on sideslopes
and drainages. Exposed bedrock and surficial geology is a result of
submergence, scouring, and wave action from Glacial Lake Missoula during
glacial (quaternary) times.   Bedrock is composed of moderately weathered
limestone, siltite, and argillite of the Belt supergroup. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 20 percent with dissimilar properties.  Surficial deposits
of silty lakebed sediments occur in depressions and along some terraces.
Hhighly weathered zones in the moderately weathered metasedimentary bedrock
occur along toeslopes and drainageways.

<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>SOILS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Map Unit Summary</U>  Soils are well drained.  Subsoils are moderately
coarse to coarse 
<P>
textured and contain 55 to 75 percent rock fragments.  Soil texture and depth
vary with topography and aspect.  Coarse textured soils occur on the lower
portion of the slopes and along sideslopes of drainageways.  Shallow soils
with depths less than 2 feet occur along crests of sideslopes and benches and
are most common on southerly aspects.  Soils on north aspects have surface
layers formed in volcanic ash influence loess. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Composition</U>   Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid
are on north 
<P>
aspects and support dry and moist, coniferous forests.  Surface layers are
formed in 
<P>
volcanic ash influence loess.  Subsoils are moderately coarse textured. 
Similar soils are Andic Udorthents, sandy skeletal, mixed, frigid.  They have
coarse textures and occur where there is more alluvial influence in the parent
material.  These soils occupy about 55 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Lithic Xerochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid are on southerly aspects. 
They support PSME/AGSP and PSME/CARU HTs.  Soil depth is less than 2 feet. 
Similar soils are Lithic Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid.  They
support ABGR/LIBO HTS.  Other similar soils are Typic Xerochrepts, loamy
skeletal, mixed, frigid that are 2 to 3 feet deep. These soils occupy about 25
percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 20 percent dissimilar soils.  Typic Eutroboralfs, fine
silty, mixed, frigid are formed in silty lakebed sediments.  Typic
Eutroboralfs, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid are formed from highly weathered
inclusions in moderately weathered metasedimentary rocks.  These soils have
moderately fine textures.  Native road surfaces rut when wet and are very
dusty when dry.  Timber productivity is higher on these soils. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Representative Profiles</U> 
<P>
<P>
These Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid have a soil
surface covered by a layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 3
inches thick. Surface layers are dark brown to strong brown silt loams about
10 inches thick.  Upper subsoils are dark yellowish brown gravelly sandy loams
about 4 inches thick.  Lower subsoils are yellowish brown to olive brown very
gravelly sandy loams about 27 inches thick. Substrata are yellowish brown very
gravelly loams to a depth of 40 inches or more. 
<P>
<P>
Lithic Xerochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid have very dark gray very
gravelly loam surface layers about 3 inches thick. Subsoils are brown
extremely gravelly sandy loams about 7 inches thick. Substrata is fragmental
with highly fractured quartzite rock to a depth of less than 20 inches.

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual productivity is moderately low on southerly
slopes, moderate on northerly slopes, and low on shallow soils.  This map unit
contains slopes suitable for tractor harvest.  Site productivity depends on
the relatively thin, finer textured soil surface layers.  Displacement of the
surface layers will decrease productivity.  Rotting wood is an important
nitrogen source for southerly slopes.  Leaving large diameter logging slash
helps maintain fertility.  Shelterwood and selection silvicultural systems
improve regeneration on steeper south aspects with high insolation.
Regeneration is limited by moisture stress and effective rooting depth on
shallow soils. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Sandy material exposed in drainageways is subject to ravel on
steep cuts.  Hard rock frequently limits excavation.  Silty lakebed and highly
weathered bedrock inclusions will cause rutting in native road surfaces. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is moderately suited to range management.
Potential forage 
<P>
production on southerly aspects is high and fair on northerly slopes. Dense
brush and steep short slopes may restrict access to portion of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  This unit provides excellent yearlong deer range
and good elk winter range.  Forage is available from small bunchgrass
openings, shrubfields, and lichen rich timber stands.   East, west, and
north0facing stands provice thermal cover.  Regeneration with underburning can
be beneficial by increasing shrub productivity on northerly aspects. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Skid trails, firelines, and roads have a moderate low
erosion hazard. Sediment delivery efficiency is low except at stream
crossings.
