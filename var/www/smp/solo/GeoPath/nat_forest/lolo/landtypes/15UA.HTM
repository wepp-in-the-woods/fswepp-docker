<CENTER><U>TOPOGRAPHY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
This landform consists of low relief footslopes, benches and fans positioned
at the base of moderate to high relief mountain slopes.  Drainageways are
broad and low gradient. Subsurface water is common in these drainageways. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Existing</U>  Vegetation is a mixed forest dominated by ponderosa pine and
Douglas-fir.  East/west aspects and drainageways support western larch.  The
understory is composed of dwarf huckleberry, twinflower, pinegrass,
serviceberry, snowberry, ninebark, and Idaho fescue. 
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  Douglas-fir/ninebark-pinegrass
(PSME/PHMA-CARU), 
<P>
Douglas-fir/pinegrass (PSME/CARU), and Douglas-fir/ninebark-ninebark
(PSME/PHMA-PHMA) are major HTs.  Douglas-fir/twinflower (PSME/LIBO) is in
moist draws and swales. This HT occupies about 15 percent of the map unit. 
PSME/PHMA-CARU and PSME/CARU are on southerly aspects.  Douglas-fir/snowberry
(PSME/SYAL) is a similar HT that occurs in some delineations below 4000 feet. 
A few delineations support Douglas-fir/dwarf huckleberry which is also similar
on these soils.  These HTs occupy about 60 percent of the map unit.
PSME/PHMA-PHMA generally occurs on east and west aspects.  This HT occupies
about 25 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 5 percent dissimilar HTs.  Douglas-fir/Idaho fescue
(PSME/FEID) occur on steeper south slopes.  Timber productivity is lower in
this HT.

<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
This map unit is underlain by valley fill material which was deposited in
mountain valleys over a long period of time, most likely during early
Quaternary periods.  This valley fill material is highly variable.  These deep
deposits have medium textures with rock fragment contents of 35 to 60 percent.
 Stones can occur on the surface to a depth of 5 feet. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent parent materials derived from slightly weathered 
<P>
metasedimentary bedrock.  Rock fragment content is 45 to 75 percent and clay
contents are less.

Map Unit Summary  Soils are deep, well drained with medium textures. Subsoils
have 14 to 25 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Soil
properties vary with vegetation.  Soils supporting dry, mixed coniferous
forest can have silty surface layers formed in volcanic ash influence loess. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Composition</U>  Udic Ustochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid support
dry Douglas-fir 
<P>
forests.  They have loam surface layers and have 14 to 25 percent clay in the
subsoil. These soils occupy about 60 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed frigid support dry, mixed
coniferous forests.  They have silt loam surface layers formed in volcanic ash
influenced loess. Similar soils have loam surface layers with less loess
influence.  They are Dystric Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid. 
These soils occupy about 40 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Representative Profiles</U> 
<P>
<P>
Udic Ustochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid have a soil surface covered by
a layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 1 inch thick. Surface
layers are dark yellowish brown gravelly loams about 6 inches thick.
Subsurface layers are dark brown very gravelly loams about 10 inches thick. 
Subsoil layers are brown very gravelly loams about 25 inches thick. Substrata
are light brown very gravelly loams and sandy loams to a depth of 60 inches or
more. 
<P>
<P>
Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid have a soil surface
covered by a layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 1 inch thick.
Surface layers are dark brown silt loams about 8 inches thick. Subsurface
layers are light gray loams about 14 inches thick.  Subsoils are very pale
brown very gravelly loams about 29 inches thick.  Substrata are light brown
very gravelly loams to a depth of 60 inches or more.

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual productivity is moderate.  The terrain is well
suited for tractor operation.  Tractor harvest or equipment operation can
compact or rut soils when they are moist.  Operating tractors only when soils
are dry, frozen, or snow covered helps maintain soil productivity. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Native roads surfaces rut when wet and near drainages. Surfacing
helps prevents rutting.  Poorly sorted material with a high content of rock
fragments over 10 inches (stones) produce poor running surfaces in some
delineations. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is well suited to range management.  The forest
understory produces good transitory range.  Forage can be enhanced through
timber harvest or burning.  Spring and early summer grazing increases
potential for soil compaction. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  This map unit provides good spring, summer, and
fall habitat and 
<P>
critical winter range for deer and elk.  Timber harvest or underburning can
increase 
<P>
forage production.  Foliose lichens are an important source of forage in the
winter. 
<P>
A diversity of timbered and nontimbered areas can be provided for by timber
harvest. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Skid trails, roads, and firelines have a moderate erosion
hazard.  Sediment delivery efficiency is low.  Only practices which disturb
soil on or near streams have a high potential for increasing sediment.
