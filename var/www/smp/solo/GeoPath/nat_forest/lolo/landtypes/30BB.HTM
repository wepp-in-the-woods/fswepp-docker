<P>
<P>
<CENTER>This map unit consists of moderate relief mountain

slopes.  Vegetation is cool, somewhat dry Douglas 
<P>
fir forests and moist, mixed coniferous forests in 
<P>
the Fishtrap Drainage.   Soils are formed in 
<P>
volcanic ash influenced loess overlying parent 
<P>
materials derived from Cambrian limestones and 
<P>
shales.  Delineations in the Harvey-Tyler Drainage 
<P>
support dry Douglas fir forests.  Soils lack the

<CENTER><U>TOPOGRAPHY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
This landform consists of broad, moderately sloping draws and convex
sideslopes. Slopes are complex and are often influcenced by the structure of
the underlying bedrock. Slightly weathered bedrock form slope gradients above
45 percent. Highly weathered bedrock form slopes and benches with slope
gradients below 30 percent. Most drainages are intermittent or ephemeral. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Existing</U>  Vegetation is a mixed forest of ponderosa pine and
Douglas-fir on southerly aspects and Douglas-fir, western larch, and lodgepole
pine on northerly aspects.  The Fishtrap drainage supports grand fir on
northerly slopes, also.   On southerly slopes, the forest understory is
dominated by pinegrass, Idaho fescue, and snowberry.  Elevation above 4800
feet support beargrass and blue huckleberry.  Northerly slopes support
twinflower, queencup beadlily, mountain maple, and sitka alder. 
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  In the Fishtrap Area,  grand
fir/twinflower (ABGR/LIBO) and grand fir/queencup beadlily (ABGR/CLUN) are
major HTs on northerly aspects.  A similar HTs,  subalpine fir/twinflower
(ABLA/LIBO) occur along drainageways and upper bounds of the unit.  These HTs
occupy about 35 percent of the map unit. Douglas-fir/blue
huckleberry-beargrass (PSME/VAGL-XETE) is the major HTs on southerly aspects. 
These HTs occupy about 40 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
In the Tyler-Harvey Area, Douglas-fir/snowberry (PSME/SYAL) and
Douglas-fir/ninebark 
<P>
(PSME/PHMA) are the major HTs on northerly aspects.  These HTs occupy about 55
percent of the map unit.  Southerly aspects support grassy openings with
Douglas-fir/pinegrass (PSME/CARU).  This HT occupies about 20 percent of the
map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 25 percent of dissimilar HTs.  Subalpine
fir/mensiezia(ABLA/MEFE) occurs on steeper inclusions generally above 4800
feet.  Soils are often formed in hard dolomite parent materials.  Shrub
competition for space/light can limit regeneration. Douglas-fir/pinegrass
(PSME/CARU) occurs on southerly convex slopes. Regeneration is limited by
moisture stress.  Somewhat poorly drained inclusions support 
<P>
subalpine/bluejoint (ABLA/CACA) and regeneration can be limited by water table
rise. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The unit is underlain by Cambrian aged bedrock of the Hasmark, Red Lion,
Silver Hill 
<P>
(Woolsey Shale) formations.  These formations consist of thin to thick-bedded,
light gray dolomite; thin-bedded dark gray limestone and red or gray green
fissile shales; and dark gray-green fissile shale, respectively. 
<P>
<P>
In the Fishtrap area, Woolsey shales are located in the lowermost portion of
the unit between 3600 feet and 4000 feet.  Rock fragments in soils formed in
Woolsey shale parent material are shaly and have low durability.  This shale
component occupies approximately 10-25 percent of this map unit.  Above 4000
feet, the Red Lion and Hasmark outcrop.  Red Lion exhibits slight to high
weathering.  Soils formed in Red Lion limestone parent material have more clay
and tend to be slightly plastic.   This limestone component occupies
approximately 25-60 percent of the map unit.  Soils formed in Hasmark dolomite
parent material have more than 45 percent hard rock fragments and are
non-plastic.  This dolomite component occupies approximately 15 to 45 percent
of this map unit.  Included as similar are glacial till deposits that occur in
some drainageways or on toeslopes of some delineations. 
<P>
<P>
Included as dissimilar properties are the Flathead Formation and bedrocks of
the Belt Supergroup.  They occupy less than 10 percent of the map unit.  Soil
materials have less clay and have higher rock fragment content and pose no
limitations to quality of native road surfaces.

<U>Map Unit Summary</U>   Soils properties vary with underlying bedrock. Soils
from highly 
<P>
weathered limestone and shales are moderately well drained with somewhat
poorly drained inclusions, have fine subsoil textures, are plastic, have 20 to
45 percent rock fragment content, and have subsoil clay accumulation.  Soils
formed from Woolsey shales are moderately well drained, have moderately fine
subsoil textures, are slightly plastic, have soft shaly rock fragments, and
soft bedrock within 3 feet of the surface.  Soils formed from Hasmark dolomite
and slightly weathered limestone are well drained, have medium textures, are
non-plastic, and have 35 to 50 percent rock fragment content. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Composition </U> Typic Eutroboralfs, clayey skeletal, mixed, frigid form
from highly weathered llimestones and shales.  They have surface layers formed
in a somewhat mixed volcanic ash influenced loess.  Similar soils are Typic
Eutroboralfs, fine, mixed, frigid.  They have less than 35 percent rock
fragments.  Typic Eutroboralfs, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid have moderately
fine textures.  Andeptic Cryoboralfs, fine, mixed support ABLA/LIBO. 
<P>
<P>
Typic Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid form from Woolsey shales. 
They lack a loess surface layer.  These soils occupy about 15 percent of the
map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid form from slightly
weathered limestones and dolomites.  They have surface layers formed in
volcanic ash influenced loess.  Similar soils are Andic Cryochrepts, loamy
skeletal, mixed. They support ABLA/MEFE.   (The Tyler-Harvey Area has less
pure loess surface layers.  Soils are Dystric Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal,
mixed, frigid.)  These soils occupy 40 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 25 percent dissimilar soils and rock outcrop.  Typic
Ustochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed occur on southerly aspects and support
Douglas-fir/pinegrass (PSME/CARU). Regeneration is limited by grass
competition for moisture.  Aquepts occur along somewhat poorly drained benches
associated with highly weathered limestones and red shales. Trafficability of
roads is severely limited.

<U>Representative Profiles 
<P>

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual production is moderate.  Some slopes are
suited for tractor 
<P>
operation.  Fine textured soils will rut when wet.  Designated skid trails
that avoid wet areas will reduce potnetial for soil impacts on fine textured
soils. Compaction on all soil surface layers can lower soil productivity. 
Moderately fine and fine textured soils favor graminoids therefore competition
for moisture from pinegrass can limit forest regneration, especially in
PSME/CARU and PSME/VAGL HTs. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Interpretations for roads vary widely because of the complex of
soil types occuring in this map unit.  Landform, vegetation, and position
within the map unit will help identify which soil type will be encountered. 
Roads constructed in medium textured soils formed from slightly weathered
limestones and dolomites should perform well with standard location,
construction, and maintenance practices.  Roads constructed in moderately fine
textured soils formed from Woolsey shales will rut and are slippery when wet. 
Surfacing on northerly aspects and in drainageways will improve quality.
Material exposed by road construction is difficult to revegetate because of
mateial tends to ravel.  Roads constructed in fine textured soils formed from
highly weathered limestones and shales are limited by severe rutting which
restricts travel.  Drainage of the road prism is difficult to maintain. 
Filter cloth and rock subgrade will improve quality of road.  These rock types
have a moderate potential for rotational slumping. . 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is moderately suited to range management on
southerly aspects only. Slope steepnes limits access. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  The diversity of the map unit provides good elk and
deer summer range and winter range.  Timber harvest where openings are scarse
can provide increased forage. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Skid trails and firelines have a moderate erosion hazard.
Roads have a high erosion hazard on all soils but those extremely gravelly
medium textured soils.  Slopes are moderately steep and sediment delivery is
moderate.
