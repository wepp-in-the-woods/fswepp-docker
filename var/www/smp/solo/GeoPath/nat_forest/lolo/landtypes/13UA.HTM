<CENTER><U>SUMMARY</U></CENTER>
<P>

<CENTER><U>LANDFORM</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The landform consists of high stream terraces, 50 to 500 feet above adjacent
streams. Terraces have nearly flat benches with gradients of less than 10
percent and short steep descending slopes called risers along one side with
gradients of up to 45 percent.  Relief of risers can vary from 50 to 200 feet.
 Included in some map units are streams traversing below these terraces and
their associated floodplains and low stream terraces. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Existing  Vegetation is a mixed forest of Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and 
<P>
western larch in southerly delineations.  The understory contains dwarf
huckleberry, kinnikinnick, serviceberry, pinegrass, snowberry, and Idaho
fescue.  Northerly delineations support grand fir, western larch, lodgepole
pine, and Douglas-fir.  Understories are dominated by twinflower, queencup
beadlily, elderberry, red osier dogwood, serviceberry, rocky mountain maple,
and western meadowrue. 
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  Douglas-fir/ninebark (PSME/PHMA),
Dougals-fir/twinflower(PSME/LIBO), and Douglas-fir/dwarf huckleberry
(PSME/VACA) are the major HTs on the nearly flat benches. 
Douglas-fir/snowberry (PSME/PHMA) or(PSME/SYAL) are on terrace risers and
where cobbly alluvium is at the surface.  PSME/VACA tends to favor soils with
silty surfaces. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent dissimilar HTs.  Grand fir/twinflower
(ABGR/LIBO) on 
<P>
northerly aspects and at elevations greater than 4500 feet.  Moderately high
timber 
<P>
productivity is associated with this HT.  Stream bottom communities are
included in those delineations that include stream channels.  Refer to Map
Unit description 10UA for detailed description.  Dry HTs such as Douglas
fir/Idaho fescue (PSME/FEID) and Douglas fir/rough fescue (PSME/FESC) can
occur at the lower elevation limits (&lt;3200 feet). 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The map unit is underlain by thick, very cobbly alluvial deposits.  The
alluvium consists of stratified sands, many rounded rocks, and silts.  These
alluvial deposits are very thick and can be slightly consolidated at depths
below 50 feet.  The alluvial gravels and cobbles are primarily argillites,
siltites, and quartzites from the Belt Supergroup. Included are up to 5
percent rock outcrop.  Belt Supergroup metasedimentary bedrock can occur along
stream channels or near steep mountain slopes.

<P>
<CENTER><U>SOILS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>MAP UNIT SUMMARY</U>  Soils are well drained to excessively drained with
moderately coarse  to coarse textures. Subsoils have 55 to 80 percent rock
fragments. Delineations along the Clark Fork River and east of Missoula have
mixed loess surface layers or lack loess surface layers.  Soils on terrace
treads in delineations west of Missoula have a silty surfaces formed from
volcanic ash influenced loess. 
<P>
<P>
Composition  Andic Xerochrepts, sandy skeletal, mixed, frigid have silty loess
surface layers about 10 inches thick.  Similar soils have silty loess surface
layers about 18 inches thick.  They are Typic Vitrandepts, medial over loamy
skeletal, mixed, frigid. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
Typic Xerochrepts, sandy skeletal, mixed, frigid have mixed loess surface
layers or they are absent and have subsoils with moderately coarse textures. 
Similar soils have coarse textures in a portion of the subsoil.  They are
Typic Xerochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid. 
<P>
<P>
Every delineation has at least one of these soils and can have both. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent dissimilar soils and rock outcrop.  Andic
Dystric 
<P>
Eutrochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed frigid support moist mixed coniferous
forest where grand fir or western redcedar is a major component.  These soils
can occur above 4500 feet and along northerly trending drainages.  Timber
productivity is higher on these soils. Rock outcrop occupies up to 5 percent
of the unit. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Representative Profiles</U> 
<P>
<P>
Andic Xerochrepts, sandy skeletal, mixed, frigid have dark brown and dark
yellowish brown gravelly silt loam surface layers about 8 inches thick.
Subsoils are brown very gravelly sandy loams about 6 inches thick. Substrata
are grayish brown extremely gravelly coarse sandy loams to a depth of 60
inches or more. 
<P>
<P>
These Typic Xerochrepts, sandy skeletal, mixed, frigid have grayish brown
gravelly sandy loams surface layers about 5 inches thick.  Subbsoils are pale
brown extremely gravelly sandy loams about 14 inches thick.  Substrata are
pale brown very cobbly sandy loams to a depth of 60 inches or more.

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual production is moderate.  Broken slopes limit
tractor operation on terrace risers.  Combinations of tractor and short line
cable systems should be considered.  Gentle bench surfaces are well suited to
tractor operation.  Moisture stress and competition from graminoids limits
regeneration on south aspects. Cold air drainage limits regeneration of some
tree species on PSME/VACA HTs. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Native road surfaces constructed in cobbly substratum materials
are rough and 
<P>
difficult to grade smoothly.  Many rock fragments are larger than 3 inches in
diameter. High cutslopes in this material tend to ravel because of the
uncohesive sandy substratum and rounded cobbles.  Care is required when
constructing roads in and near stream channels to keep sediment from entering
the channel system. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  Potential forage production is moderate.  Erosion can occur on
trails made on 
<P>
terrace escarpments that access stream bottoms. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  This map unit provides excellent whitetail deer
winter range.  Forage is availabe from foliose lichens and shrubs.  Large
delineations can lack habitat diversity.  Moderate shrub forage increases
occur with vegetation manipulation. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Logging skid trails, firelines, and roads have a low erosion
hazard on benches. High sediment delivery efficiency on terrace escarpments or
riser contribute to high erosion hazards on these slopes.  The major watershed
management concern is protection of stream channels and banks included in this
unit.  Bridges and culverts should be carefully planned to maintain channel
stability.  Practices which disturb soils on or adjacent to streambanks can
increase stream sediment.
