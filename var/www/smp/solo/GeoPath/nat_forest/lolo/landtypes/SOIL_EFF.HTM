I.  <U>FOREST PLAN REQUIREMENTS
<P>
</U>
<P>
The soil resource is the key ingredient for maintaining the productive
<P>
potential of an area.  Maintenance of soil quality is dependent on the
<P>
protection of the surface soils from erosion, displacement, and compaction and
<P>
the continued input of organic matter to the soil.  
<P>
<P>
The Forest Plan requires that project plans, for activities requiring use of
<P>
ground-based equipment, establish standards for the area allocated to skid
<P>
trails, landings, temporary roads or similar areas of concentrated use.  Best
<P>
Management Practices constitute the state-of-the-art in prudent practices to
<P>
protect soil productivity and water quality.  The standard used should minimize
<P>
the area of impact to the extent practical.  The Forest Plan also requires that
<P>
practices such as dozer piling or mechanical site preparation not be planned
<P>
without considering the feasibility of limiting soil conditions under which
<P>
equipment operates or alternative practices which do not require ground-based
<P>
equipment. 
<P>
<P>
Since the Kootenai National Forest Plan became final, the Forest Service has
<P>
established policy relative to management effects on soil productivity (FSH
<P>
2509.18).  This policy establishes a guideline that soil productivity be
<P>
reduced by no more than fifteen (15) percent.  It also requires Regional
<P>
Foresters to establish standards for detrimental changes in soil properties
<P>
that will comply with this guideline.  A Region 1 supplement to FSH 2509.18
<P>
proposes standards based on monitoring results and professional judgement.
<P>
This standard requires that no more than fifteen (15) percent of an activity
<P>
area have significantly impaired productivity due to displacement of soil
<P>
surface layers.  The total area affected by displacement, compaction and
<P>
puddling cannot exceed 30 percent of the area treated. 
<P>
<P>
The National Forest Management Act requires that soil productivity be
<P>
maintained or enhanced.

II.  <U>GENERAL DESCRIPTION
<P>
</U>
<P>
Glacial activity had the last major effect on shaping the landscape.  Prior to
<P>
glaciation water erosion was the major land forming feature.
<P>
<P>
All eight of the areas within the land exchange have been glaciated.  The areas
<P>
further north were closer to the source of ice and were more strongly affected
<P>
by glacial activity.  Portions of the Jumbo and Blacktail Peak areas have some
<P>
land that was minimally affected.  Some of the area around Allen Peak was
<P>
affected by an ice cap.  The glacial activity did a lot of scraping and
<P>
scouring and filling creating a more subdued landscape than would have existed
<P>
prior to glaciation.  Generally major ridge divides and smaller ridgetops were
<P>
scoured leaving exposed scraped rock.  The scoured soil material was pushed
<P>
around and tended to fill in topographic lows (drainage bottoms, etc.).  The
<P>
scouring of the ridgetops and filling of drainage bottoms gave a rounded
<P>
appearance.
<P>
<P>
Glacial ice generally retreated from the area 12,000 to 15,000 years ago.  The
<P>
soil material left was composed of silts and sands (glacial flour) and rounded
<P>
gravels and boulders.  As the ice melted more landforms were created.  Most of
<P>
these landforms were in and/or adjacent to the drainage bottoms.  The landforms
<P>
consist of outwash terraces, eskers, kames, and lacustrine terraces.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
Approximately 6800 years ago a volcanic eruption in the Cascades deposited a
<P>
layer of volcanic ash-influenced loess over northwestern Montana on top of the
<P>
existing landscape.  This layer now exists on all northerly and easterly
<P>
aspects and on the southerly and westerly aspects at the higher elevations
<P>
(generally above 4500 feet).  This layer is light and fluffy and has a brownish
<P>
color.  
<P>
<P>
The eight areas within the exchange have had a soil survey (Appendix A)
<P>
completed for them.  The survey is referred to as the Kootenai National Forest
<P>
Area Land System Inventory (1984).  The map units are referred to landtypes.
<P>
Each landtype contains specific landform, soil, vegetative, and geologic
<P>
components.  There are five major groupings of landtypes--water-influenced
<P>
topography (100s), breaklands (200s), continentally glaciated lands (300s),
<P>
alpine glaciated landforms (400s), and erosional lands (500s).  These are
<P>
described in Appendix B.
<P>
<P>
All parts of the landscape--stream bottoms, mountain slopes and ridgetops--are
<P>
represented within the exchange.  These are represented by the range of
<P>
landtypes, the descriptions of which are given in Appendix C.  The
<P>
interpretations of each landtype are given in Appendix D.  
<P>
<P>
III.  <U>COMMON EFFECTS</U> 
<P>
<P>
Timber harvest can affect soil productivity in the following ways:
<P>
<P>
    <U>Soil Compaction</U>
<P>
    Soil surface layers are compacted by operation of ground-based equipment
<P>
    used for logging and brush piling (Steinbrenner 1955).  Compaction
<P>
    significantly lowers soil productivity by reducing root penetration and
<P>
    permeability.  Compaction is most severe when ground-based equipment
<P>
    operates on moist soil or makes repeated trips over the same area.  The
<P>
    soils on the Kootenai National Forest are particularly sensitive to
<P>
    compaction because most have surface layers formed in volcanic
<P>
    ash-influenced loess.  The loess has relatively low natural bulk densities
<P>
    of 0.65 to 0.9 grams per cubic centimeter and, therefore, low strength.  
<P>
<P>
    A moist soil is more susceptible to compaction than a dry soil.  As a soil
<P>
    becomes wetter, though, it can even lose its bearing capacity.  When this
<P>
    occurs and machinery operates on the soil, the soil can no longer support
<P>
    heavy weight that is placed on it and the soil loses its structure.  The
<P>
    loose, granular structure that is good for growing plants is destroyed.
<P>
    This &quot;puddled&quot; soil does not support very good tree growth.
<P>
<P>
    Many of the soils on the Kootenai Forest are susceptible to soil
<P>
    compaction.  Included are all the soils with a volcanic ash surface layer,
<P>
    those forming in glacial till and those forming in lacustrine materials.
<P>
    The amount of soil compacted as a result of timber harvest operations is
<P>
    directly related to the amount of ground skidding.  The problem is further
<P>
    enhanced on those lands where machinery is used for treatment of fuels.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
    Natural processes restore compacted layers to normal density slowly and the
<P>
    compactive effects can last for as long (or longer) as it takes to grow
<P>
    another crop of trees.  Longevity has not been determined because those
<P>
    studies that have dealt with the compaction issue have not seen the effects
<P>
    completely ameliorated.  Extensive freezing and thawing and to a lesser
<P>
    extent wetting and drying are the main factors that overcome compaction.  A
<P>
    lot of the precipitation that falls on the Kootenai Forest comes in the
<P>
    form of snow.  Snow is a good insulator and generally prevents freezing
<P>
    (Ford 1986).  Following logging, many of the sites in the Decision Area do
<P>
    not dry out.  In this case, the main factors for naturally reducing
<P>
    compaction have been negated.
<P>
<P>
    <U>Soil Erosion
<P>
</U>
<P>
    Soil erosion occurs when the energy from flowing water is greater than the
<P>
    ability of the soil to resist deformation.  As the water concentrates and
<P>
    increases its speed, enough energy is generated to detach soil particles,
<P>
    beginning the erosion process.  The places most susceptible are skid
<P>
    trails, landings, firelines, and roads.  Sometimes sufficient flow is
<P>
    generated during storm events or below culverts that erosion (occasionally
<P>
    debris flows) occurs without removal of the organic mat.  Erosion of the
<P>
    soil surface removes the most important part of the soil.  Since the soils
<P>
    are young (not highly developed), most of the nutrients are stored in the
<P>
    organic matter and the top several inches of soil.  Loss of organics and/or
<P>
    soil mass through erosion can have a strong affect on site quality.
<P>
<P>
    <U>Soil Displacement
<P>
</U>
<P>
    Soil surface layers are displaced during dozer piling and on logging skid
<P>
    trails, landings, firelines, and temporary roads.  Surface layers contain
<P>
    most of the soil fertility.  Productivity is significantly impaired when
<P>
    the surface layer is removed.  
<P>
<P>
    <U>Nitrogen Depletion
<P>
</U>
<P>
    Nitrogen, a very important soil nutrient, is lost by removal of organic
<P>
    matter from the site.  Logs are removed taking some nitrogen from the
<P>
    site.  Slash burning volatilizes nitrogen and returns it to the
<P>
    atmosphere.  In addition, removal of the forest canopy exposes the soil to
<P>
    direct sunlight and warms it (Harvey 1981a).  Mineralization (decomposition
<P>
    of the organic matter into its component parts, such as nitrogen) of
<P>
    remaining nitrogen is accelerated by warmer soil temperatures (Jurgensen et
<P>
    al. 1979).  
<P>
<P>
    Highly mobile, mineralized nitrogen can be lost through leaching.  Loss of
<P>
    nitrogen through normal fire and timber harvesting, though, is not expected
<P>
    to measurably affect long-term soil productivity.  In a natural
<P>
    environment, annual mineralization is much greater than annual losses.  In
<P>
    a disturbed forest, mineralization rates are artificially increased beyond
<P>
    the need of plant uptake.  This excess N, in the form of ammonium created
<P>
    in the mineralization process, can be quickly converted to nitrates and
<P>
    lost by leaching from the system (Dominski 1971; Powers 1982; Vitousek and
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
    Mellilo 1979).  Complete removal of soil organic matter in the form of
<P>
    debris, litter, humus and surface soil can rob the site of mineralizable N
<P>
    reserves.  Minimal amounts of organic reserves left on a site may be
<P>
    quickly depleted due to increased mineralization and nitrification
<P>
    (Nielsen-Gerhardt 1986).
<P>
<P>
    The breakdown of organic matter is the source of future nutrients.
<P>
    Maintaining a fairly uniform level of organic matter in all stages of decay
<P>
    is very desirable for sustaining site quality.  At least fifteen to
<P>
    twenty-five (15-25) tons of larger than four (4&quot;) inches woody debris
<P>
    should be kept on site to maintain site quality (Harvey 1982).  All action
<P>
    alternatives would accomplish this.
<P>
<P>
    <U>Overland Flow
<P>
</U>
<P>
    In those areas where there are high amounts of precipitation and soil
<P>
    disturbance, overland flow is likely to occur.  The results could be a
<P>
    significant reduction in water quality.  Research has indicated that
<P>
    increased soil-water content in harvested areas may cause early fall or
<P>
    initial snowmelt to produce more runoff than under forested conditions
<P>
    (Chamberlin 1982).  These increases in soil-water content and ground-water
<P>
    levels following harvest have been demonstrated to be an important factor
<P>
    in increasing the rate of slope mass movements after harvesting (Chamberlin
<P>
    1982).  Because the soil in forested openings is wetter (closer to its
<P>
    storage capacity), not only is more water available to become streamflow
<P>
    but it becomes available earlier causing higher peak flows (USDA Forest
<P>
    Service 1982; Rice 1980; Rainville 1987).
<P>
<P>
IV.  <U>ASSUMPTIONS
<P>
</U>
<P>
Monitoring on the Kootenai National Forest and adjacent Flathead and Kaniksu
<P>
National Forests indicates the following assumptions can be reasonably made
<P>
when predicting the extent of detrimental effects from timber harvest on soil
<P>
productivity in the Decision Area.  
<P>
<P>
    1)  In road construction, four (4) acres per mile are disturbed and will be
<P>
    lost for crop production.  
<P>
<P>
    2)  Logging with cable equipment will moderately affect ten (10) percent of
<P>
    a logging unit.
<P>
<P>
    3)  Logging with ground-based equipment will affect soil productivity:
<P>
         a) past logging activity affected soil productivity on thirty (30)
<P>
         percent of a logging unit--fifteen (15) percent severely and fifteen
<P>
         (15) percent moderately; and
<P>
         b) current logging activity affects soil productivity on twenty two
<P>
         and one-half (22.5) percent of a logging unit--seven and one-half
<P>
         (7.5) percent severely and fifteen (15) percent moderately.
<P>
<P>
    4)  In addition, hazard abatement with dozers will severely affect seven
<P>
    and one half (7.5) percent of the ground through displacement and
<P>
    compaction and twenty (20) percent will be moderately impacted.  In
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
    contrast, the use of an excavator with grapples will reduce the amount of
<P>
    area moderately impacted by five (5) percent and totally eliminate the
<P>
    amount severely effected. 
<P>
<P>
    5)  Those areas taken out of production--system roads, temporary
<P>
    roads--will be lost to future production. Those areas severely impacted by
<P>
    compaction, surface disturbance, overland flow, loss of organic matter, and
<P>
    erosion are estimated to have a twenty-five to seventy-five (25-75) percent
<P>
    (generally closer to the higher level) loss in growth potential over the
<P>
    next rotation.  The areas that will be moderately impacted are estimated to
<P>
    have a zero to twenty-five (0-25) percent loss in growth potential.  
<P>
<P>

<P>

<P>
Flathead and Idaho Panhandle National Forests, respectively), and relevant

1.  Units cable logged and broadcast burned will easily meet the proposed
<P>
standards for maintenance of soil productivity.
<P>
<P>
2.  Units logged with ground-based equipment and broadcast burned will barely
<P>
meet the standards for maintenance of soil productivity.  If dedicated trails
<P>
are used, the soil compaction/soil displacement is reduced.  They are predicted
<P>
to have seven and one half (7.5) percent of the area allocated to skid trails,
<P>
landings, and temporary roads which are likely to have significantly impaired
<P>
productivity due to topsoil displacement and compaction. 
<P>
<P>
3.  Units that are logged with ground-based equipment and hazard abated with
<P>
dozers/rubber-tired skidders will not meet standards.
<P>
<P>
If Soil and Water practices (Soil and Water Conservation Practices Handbook) are
<P>
incorporated in all land use and project planning and are carried out in all
<P>
activities, the alternatives are consistent with the Forest Plan.

<P>
Roads are the routes along which weeds move into areas.  Noxious weeds become
<P>
especially prolific along roads.  The heavier the traffic the quicker the weeds
<P>
will move into an area.  Other types of disturbance will also create disturbed
<P>
areas susceptible to weed invasion.  Tractor logging and tractor piling will
<P>
provide many areas that will establish on.</BODY>
