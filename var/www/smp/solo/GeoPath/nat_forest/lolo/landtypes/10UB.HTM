<CENTER><U>MAP UNIT SUMMARY </U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>M.U. SETTING</U>  The landform consists of recent floodplains. Map units
contain or are adjacent to perennial streams.  Beaver ponds are common.
<P>
 
<P>
<U>M.U. COMPONENTS</U>  Soils are poorly drained with deep profiles developed
in alluvial parent material. Soils have deep silty surfaces. Native vegetation
is willow and wet sedge bottoms. Low gradient streams cause this map unit to
be continually wet.
<P>
 
<P>
<U>ADJOINING M.U.</U>  Adjacent units are older, higher stream terraces in the
broader stream valleys. In narrow stream valleys, these map units are adjoined
by very steep mountain slopes (streambreaks).

This map unit consists of recent floodplains and is adjacent to perennial 
<P>
streams and rivers. Streams on these floodplains commonly have braided
channels 
<P>
and change course frequently. Low gradient meandering streams  contribute to 
<P>
continually wet soils.    Because this map unit occurs adjacent to streams,
any 
<P>
soil erosion is likely to become a source of stream sediment.

<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) OCCURRENCE</U>  Due to the very wet nature of this map
unit, 
<P>
riparian vegetation occupies these sites.  A riparian habitat type 
<P>
classification system has not been developed as yet.
<P>
 
<P>
Dissimilar included HTs are Subalpine fir/queencup beadlily and Douglas fir 
<P>
Series HTs.

<U>HABITAT TYPE DISTRIBUTION</U> 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to ____ percent dissimilar HTs. Dissimilar included HTs are 
<P>
ABLA/CLUN AND Douglas fir HTs. These HTs occupy more well drained soils. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>EXISTING VEGETATION</U> is characterized by a willow or wet sedge meadow
bottom. 
<P>
Spruce and subalpine fir forests occupy the perimeter of the mapunit.

<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>OCCURRENCE</U> The unit consists of recent alluvium. The alluvium consists
of 
<P>
stratified sands, gravels, and silts. These bottomlands deposits can be very 
<P>
thick and are siltier than most alluvial deposits due to low gradient stream 
<P>
deposition.

<CENTER><U>SOILS
<P>
</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<P>
G<U>ENERAL NATURE OF SOILS</U>   This map unit has poorly drained soils due to 
<P>
continual flooding, channel changes, and high water tables. Surface layers are 
<P>
contiually changing but generally are silt loams with few gravels.

<P>
<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U> This map unit is poorly suited to timber management. Soils are
too wet to 
<P>
support timber.  Perimeters are occupied by spruce and subalpine fir on highly 
<P>
productive sites. Perimeters, if harvested, are highly susceptable to soil 
<P>
compaction, rutting, and soil displacement. High water tables will severely 
<P>
limit access to these sites. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  This map unit is poorly suited to road construction. Shallow
ground water 
<P>
and flooding severely limit construction. Constant stream channel changes and 
<P>
flooding will increase maintenance on roadbases, bridges, and culverts. Wet 
<P>
silty alluvium has low bearing strength and will rut. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is poorly suited to range management.
<P>
 
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  Protection from sediment production in streams is
critical 
<P>
for high quality fisheries. Moose habitat.ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO BE OBTAINED
BY 
<P>
BIOLOGISTS. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U> The major watershed management concern is controlling
sediment 
<P>
produced when an activity causing soil disturbance occurs adjacent to the 
<P>
stream. Stream channel changes can produce high amounts of sediment. Design of 
<P>
activities away from streamside will promote streambank protection.
