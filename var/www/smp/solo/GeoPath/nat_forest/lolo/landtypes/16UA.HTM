<P>
<P>
This map unit contains rounded, rolling low hills and moderately sloped
benches perched on steep mountain slopes at the mouths of tributary streams to
the Clark Fork River.  These moderately sloped benches can have steep
escarpments with perennial stream channels below.  Live streams on the rolling
low hills portion of the map unit are rare. 
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Existing</U>  Vegetation varies with aspect.  Forests on southerly aspects
have an overstory of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir.  The understory is
dominated by Idaho fescue, rough fescue, and pinegrass.  Forests on northerly
aspects have an overstory of western larch, grand fir, Douglas-fir, and
ponderosa pine.  The understory is dominated by twinflower, ninebark, rocky
mountain maple, and in the moistest portions, queencup beadlily. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  Douglas-fir/rough fescue (PSME/FESC),
Douglas fir/pinegrass (PSME/CARU), and Douglas fir/Idaho fescue (PSME/FEID)
are the major HTs on southerly aspects.  Douglas-fir/snowberry-pinegrass
(PSME/SYAL-CARU) occurs occasionally as a similar HT.  Douglas-fir/bluebunch
wheatgrass can occur on steeper south slopes.  These HTs occupy about 60
percent of the map unit.  Grand fir/twinflower (ABGR/LIBO) and grand
fir/queencup beadlily (ABGR/CLUN) are the major HTs on north aspects. They
occupy about 40 percent of the map unit.

<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The map unit is underlain by deep extremely gravelly coarse textured alluvium.
 These deposits are generally stratified with lenses of loamy sands, extremely
gravelly coarse sandy loams, and silts.  Rock fragments are typically
pea-sized. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 5 percent silty lacustrine sediments with medium to
moderately fine textures.

Map Unit Summary  Soils are excessively drained with coarse textured subsoils.
 Soils vary with vegetation and surface layer textures.  Soils on southerly
aspects support open grown forests and have moderately coarse textured surface
layers.  Soils on north aspects support moist, mixed coniferous forests and
have medium textured surface layers. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Composition</U>  Typic Xerothents, sandy skeletal, mixed, frigid are on
southerly aspects. They have a moderately coarse surface layer less than 10
inches thick. Similar soils have a moderately coarse surface layer and upper
subsoil layer about 20 inches thick.  They are Typic Xerochrepts, sandy
skeletal, mixed, frigid.  These soils occupy about 60 percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Andeptic Udorthents, sandy skeletal, mixed, frigid are on northerly aspects. 
They have a medium textured surface layer less than 10 inches thick.  Similar
soils have a medium textured surface layer about 15 inches thick or a subsoil
layer with moderately coarse textures.  They are Andic Dystric Eutrochrepts,
sandy skeletal, mixed, frigid.  These soils occupy about 40 percent of the map
unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 5 percent of dissimilar soils.  Typic Eutroboralfs,
fine-silty, mixed, frigid have medium to moderately fine subsoil textures and
have a high silt or clay content.  These soils can be scattered at random
through the map unit but have been observed on nearly level benches within the
map unit.   These soils are moderately well drained, have higher water holding
capacity, and are more productive. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Representative Profiles</U> 
<P>
<P>
Typic Xerothents, sandy skeletal, mixed, frigid have light gray gravelly sandy
loam upper surface layers about 5 inches thick. Lower surface layers are a
very pale brown gravelly coarse sandy loam about 4 inches thick. Substrata is
a light yellowish brown extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand to a depth of 60
inches or more. 
<P>
<P>
Andeptic Udorthents, sandy skeletal, mixed, frigid have a soil surface covered
by of partially decomposed forest litter about 1 inch thick. Surface layers
are light yellowish brown gravelly silt loams about 9 inches thick. 
Subsurface layers are pale brown extremely gravelly coarse sandy loams about 9
inches thick.  Substrata is a light yellowish brown extremely gravelly loamy
coarse sand to a depth of 60 inches or more.

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual production is low on south apsects and
moderately high on north aspects.  Broken dissected slopes limit tractor
operation. Combinations of tractor and short line cable systems should be
considered.  Site productivity depends on the relarively thin, finer textured
soil surface layers.  Displacement of the surface layers will decrease
productivity.  Rotting wood is an important nitrogen source for southerly
slopes in this unit.  Leaving large diameter logging slash helps maintain
fertility. Shelterwood and selection silvicultural systems improve
regeneration on steeper south aspects with high insolation factor. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Material exposed by road construction is subject to ravel on
steep cuts and fills. Delineations perched on steep mountain sideslopes above
perennial streams pose slope stability hazards.  Position of these map units
on deeply incised by major streams leaves these uncohesive soils perched high
on the slope.  These alluvial deposits are good pit run sources for surfacing
material.  Native road surfaces will erode on road grades above 10 percent. 
Small inclusions of silts will rut when wet. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is moderately suited to range management.
Potential forage 
<P>
production on southerly aspects is high.  Steep short slopes may inhibit
access to 
<P>
portions of the map unit to grazing. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  This map unit provides excellent whitetailed deer
winter range.  The southerly aspect provide bunchgrass communities for
foraging and northerly aspects provide shrub and foliose lichen forage as well
as thermal cover. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Skid trails, firelines and roads have a moderate erosion
hazard.  Sediment delivery efficiency is high on bench escarpments perched
along steep mountain slopes. Sediment delivery efficiency is low on rolling
footslopes. Establishing vegetative cover is difficult and sediment from road
cut and fill slope erosion is difficult to control adjacent to perennial
streams.
