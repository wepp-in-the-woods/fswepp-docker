<CENTER><U>LANDFORM</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The landform consists of broad, moderately sloping draws and convex
sideslopes.  Slopes are smooth and convex.  Most drainages are perennial or
ephemeral. Drainage spacing ranges from 800 to 1,500 feet.  Drainage patterns
are dendritic.

<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Existing</U>  Vegetation is a mixed forest of lodgepole pine and western
larch with an occasional subalpine fir and Douglas fir.  The understory can be
dominated by beargrass, menziesia, twinflower, queencup beadlily, and blue
huckleberry. 
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  Subalpine fir/beargrass,(ABLA/XETE),
subalpine 
<P>
fir/menziesia (ABLA/MEFE), and subalpine fir/queencup beadlily (ABLA/CLUN) are
the major HTs.  ABLA/XETE occurs on southerly slopes and occupies about 40
percent of the map unit. ABLA/MEFE occurs on northerly slopes and occupies
about 30 percent of the map unit. ABLA/CLUN occur near drainages and on moist
benches.  A similar HT is spruce/twinflower (PICEA/LIBO).  These HTs occupy 20
percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 10 percent dissimilar HTs.  Douglas-fir/blue
huckleberry-beargrass (PSME/VAGL-XETE) occur at the lower elevation bounds of
this map unit. These HTS are less productive. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The unit is underlain by well weathered, fine-grained gneisses and granites. 
Rock 
<P>
fragments weather easily because of smaller mineral size and high mafic
mineral content. Included as similar are alluvium from well weathered granites
that is deposited at the base of these mountain slopes. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>SOILS </U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Map Unit Summary</U>  Soils are well drained and moderately coarse.  Rock
fragment content ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  Surface soils formed in
volcanic ash influenced loess. These soils are distinquished from other soils
formed from granitics because of soil properties that provide for different
management response. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Composition</U>  Andic Cryochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid have
silty loess surface layers, sandy loam subsoil textures and 35 to 45 percent
rock fragments.  Similar soils are Andic Cryochrepts, fine loamy, mixed
frigid.  They have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.  These soils occupy 85
percent of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent dissimilar soils. Dystric Eutrochrepts, loamy
skeletal, mixed, frigid.  These soils support cool, somewhat dry Douglas-fir
forests where regeneration can be limited by moisture stress.  Andic
Cryochrepts, sandy skeletal, mixed, frigid have coarse textured subsoils and
are more erosive and less productive.  Auic Cryochrepts and Cryaquepts occur
in some broad, basin-like drainageways.  These soils are wet for significant
periods and pose limitations to harvest and regeneration. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<U>Representative Profiles</U> 
<P>
<P>
Andic Cryochrepts, loamy skeletal, frigid, mixed have a soil surface covered
by a layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 2 inches thick. Surface
layers are light yellowish brown gravelly loam about 12 inches thick.  The
subsoil layers are very pale brown and yellowish brown very gravelly sandy
loam about 24 inches thick.  Substrata are pale brown very gravelly sandy loam
to a depth of 60 inches or more. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual production is moderate in ABLA/XETE HTs and
high in ABLA/CLUN and ABLA/MEFE HTs.  Slopes less than 35 percent are suited
for tractor harvest. Tractor operation can reduce site productivity by
compacting or displacing the surface layer. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Native road surfaces rut when wet.  Erosion from rutting and
tread wear on 
<P>
unsurfaced roads tends to remove fine material.  The remaining gravel and
cobble form a rough surface.  Care is required when constructing roads in and
near stream channels to keep sediment from entering the channel system. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is poorly suited to range management.  The forest
understory produces little forage. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  This unit provides good summer range for deer and
elk.  Primary forage value is forbs and grasses available in fully stocked
conifer stands. Forage response from treatment is minimal.  Opportunities for
habitat enhancement are limited. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Skid trails, firelines, and roads have a high erosion
hazard.  Sediment 
<P>
delivery efficiency is moderate.  Controlling sediment from roads is
moderately difficult. Controlling sediment can be difficult adjacent to stream
crossings under standard practice.
