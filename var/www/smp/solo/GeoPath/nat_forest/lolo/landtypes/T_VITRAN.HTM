<U>LOCATION AND SETTING</U>:  West-central Montana; Bitterroot Mountains;
trubutary to
<P>
Clark Fork River, Trout Creek drainage; SE1/4 of NW1/4, section 15, T.15N,
<P>
R.26W; map unit 60QD.  This soil is formed in a volcanic ash influenced loess
<P>
overlying moderately weathered metasedimentary bedrock.  The slope gradient is
<P>
75 percent on a northeast aspect at 4,560 feet of elevation.  The habitat type
<P>
is grand fir/kinnikinnick.
<P>
<P>
<P>
These soils are formed in 14 to 25 inch thick volcanic ash influenced loess
<P>
overlying material derived from moderately and weakly weathered metasedimentary
<P>
bedrock.  These soils support moist, mixed coniferous forests.
<P>
<P>
The Bo horizon has a silt loam texture, 6 to 8 percent clay, and 5 to 20
<P>
percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has other moist colors such as 10YR 4/3
<P>
and 7.5YR 4/4.  Some soils have a shallow A horizon.
<P>
<P>
The 2Bw horizon has a silt loam to sandy loam texture, 5 to 12 percent clay,
<P>
and 60 to 80 percent coarse fragments.  2Bw horizons formed in moderately
<P>
weathered metasedimentary bedrock are represented by the upper range of clay
<P>
percent.  This horizon has other moist colors such as 10YR 4/4 and 10YR 6/6.
<P>
Some soils have 2E horizons above the 2Bw.
