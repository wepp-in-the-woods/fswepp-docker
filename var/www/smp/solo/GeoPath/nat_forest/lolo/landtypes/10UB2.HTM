<CENTER>SUMMARY </CENTER>
<P>
<P>
This map unit occurs in stream bottoms.  Beaver                               
        ponds are common. Vegetation is a non-forested                        
               riparian community type.  Soils form in poorly                 
                      drained silty alluvial deposits.

<CENTER><U>LANDFORM
<P>
</U></CENTER>
<P>
The landform consists of recent floodplains, perennial streams, and ponded
water.  Braided stream channels are common and stream courses change
frequently. Beaver activity creates an elevated water table. 
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION
<P>
</U></CENTER>
<P>
<U>Existing</U>  Vegetation is mostly a shrub community of willow, sedges,    
          elderberry, and graminoids along pond and stream perimeters.  Low
terraces               adjacent to streamside support subalpine fir, spruce,
and lodgepole pine.               The forest understory has bluejoint,
queencup beadlily, elderberry, common               horsetail, and starry
Solomon's seal.
<P>
 
<P>
<U>Habitat Type (HT) Composition</U>  The map unit consists of brushfields
dominated by willow with openings of sedges and graminoids.  Brushfields and
water occupy about 70 percent of the map unit.  Perimeters where water tables
are less elevated support subalpine fir/ bluejoint (ABLA/CACA) and
spruce/common horsetail (PICEA/EQAR).  Forested areas occupy about 20 percent
of the map unit.
<P>
 
<P>
Included are up to 10 percent dissimilar HTs.  Subalpine fir/queencup beadlily
(ABLA/CLUN) can occur on more well-drained rises.  This inclusion is
moderately well drained and there are less limitations to timber harvest and
regeneration. 
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY
<P>
</U></CENTER>
<P>
The unit is underlain by silty alluvial deposits that can overlie gravelly
alluvial deposits.  The alluvium consists of sands, some gravels, and silts. 
These alluvial deposits can be very thick; textures are usually stratified and
are quite variable. 
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>SOILS
<P>
</U></CENTER>
<P>
<U>Map Unit Summary</U>  Soils are poorly drained and subsoils are continually
saturated.  Soils have 10 to 45 percent rounded rock fragments. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Composition</U>  Aquepts have light colored surface layers and a weakly
expressed subsoil. They support both brushfield and forested vegetation. 
Similar soils are Aquolls and Aquents.  Aquolls have dark surface layers and
support graminoids and sedges.  Aquents have no subsoil development and
support mostly brushfield vegetation.  These soils occupy about 90 percent of
the map unit.
<P>
 
<P>
Included are up to 10 percent dissimilar soils.  Ochrepts are on moderately
well drained terraces.  These are more productive timber sites and present
fewer limitations to timber harvest and regeneration.
<P>
 
<P>
<U>Representative Profile
<P>
</U>
<P>
Aquepts have dark brown to grayish brown silt loam surface layers about 2     
         inches thick.  Subsoils are dark yellowish brown silt loams about 25
inches               thick.  Substrata are olive to pinkish gray silt loams to
depths of 60               inches or more.  Mottles are common to many and
distinct throughout.

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS
<P>
</U></CENTER>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  This map unit contains only scattered trees among ponds and
braided stream channels and is poorly suited to timber management.  Inclusions
of forested areas along perimeters have a high potential annual production and
are suited to timber management. On inclusions, removal of trees will elevate
water tables and will increase re-establish- ment time.  Soils are highly
susceptible to compaction, rutting, and soil displacement. High water tables
severely limit access.
<P>
 
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  High water tables and flooding severely limit construction. 
Beaver activity, constant stream channel changes, and flooding increase
maintenance costs.  Wet silty alluvium has low bearing strength and will rut. 
Protection of stream system from sediment produced during and after
construction is difficult.
<P>
 
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  Wet soils, flooding, and low forage value limit grazing in this
map unit
<P>
. 
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  Shrub communities provide excellent habitat for
whitetail deer and moose.  Beaver populations thrive in this unit and are the
primary natural factor in influencing the physical characteristics of the
floodplain.  Songbird populations are generally high particularly where
associated with beaver activity.  Vegetative manipulation is not generally
desirable for wildlife.
<P>
 
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Erosion hazards and sediment delivery efficiency is high. 
The major watershed management concern is the difficulty in controlling
sediment delivered to streams from roads and recreation because of close
proximity to water courses throughout this unit. Stream channel changes can
produce large amounts of sediment.  Beaver dams can serve as sediment traps.  </BODY>
