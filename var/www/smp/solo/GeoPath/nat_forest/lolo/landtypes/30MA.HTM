<CENTER><U>LANDFORM</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The landform consists of broad, gently sloping draws and convex sideslopes. 
Slopes are complex and are often influenced by the structure of the underlying
bedrock.  Most drainages are intermittent or ephemeral.  Drainage spacing
ranges from 1500 to 2500 feet and drainage patterns are trellis or parallel.

<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>VEGETATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Existing</U>  Vegetation is a mixed forest of low to moderate stocking
dominated by Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine with some grassy openings. 
Although stand structure varies by previous fire and harvest history, many
delineations have old-growth ponderosa pine with a second canopy of
Douglas-fir.  The understory consists of bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue,
arrowleaf balsamroot, and some delineations have rough fescue. Important
shrubs scattered through the unit are wood's rose, snowberry, serviceberry,
and chokecherry. 
<P>
<P>
<U>HABITAT TYPE (HT) COMPOSITION</U>  Douglas-fir/bluebunch wheatgrass
(PSME/AGSP), Douglas 
<P>
fir/rough fescue (PSME/FESC), and Douglas-fir/Idaho fescue (PSME/FEID) are the
major HTs. PSME/AGSP occurs on the shallower and rockier sites.  PSME/FESC
occurs on deeper soils and less rocky soils.  A similar included habitat type
is Douglas fir/pinegrass-bluebunch, wheatgrass (PSME/CARU-AGSP) which occurs
in areas where the annual precipitation is slightly higher than the average
(greater than 20 to 25 inches).  These habitat types occupy 90 percent of the
map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 10 percent dissimilar HTs. Douglas-fir/ninebark-pinegrass 
<P>
(PSME/PHMA-CARU) and Douglas-fir/snowberry (PSME/SYAL) occur in some
drainages.  Douglas-fir/ninebark-ninebark (PSME/PHMA-PHMA) occurs on
inclusions of east and west aspects. Timber productivity is higher and there
are less limitations to regeneration. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>GEOLOGY</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The unit is underlain by moderately weathered limestones, calcareous
argillite, 
<P>
non-calcareous argillite, and siltite of the Belt Supergroup.  Dominant
formations are Wallace, Helena, and Syeh.  Included as similar are Hasmark,
Libby, Empire, and St. Regis formations. 
<P>
<P>
The bedrock contains moderately weathered layers of metasedimentary rock that
produce soils with soft and moderately soft rock fragments and calcium
carbonate accumulations. Weathering of bedrock varies with hardness of bedrock
and local faulting.  Highly weathered bedrock layers can be present and are
generally associated with fault zones, saddles, drainages, and highly
dissected slopes.  Highly weathered zones of bedrock occupy 15 to 40 percent
of the map unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 15 percent bedrock with dissimilar properties.  They are
weakly 
<P>
weathered metasedimentary bedrock of the Belt Supergroup.  Soils formed in
material from this bedrock are not calcareous, are less silty, less easily
weathered rock fragments, and have a higher rock fragment content. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><U>SOILS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>Map Unit Summary</U>  Soils are well drained with medium or moderately fine
textures.  Soil properties vary with degree of weathering of the underlying
bedrock. They have dark colored surface horizons and subsoil clay
accumulations occur in soils formed from more highly weathered bedrock. 
Subsoils contain 35 to 50 percent rock fragments and typically have calcium
carbonate accumulations.  Rock fragment durability can be quite low on highly
weathered bedrock.  Soils become dry early in the growing season. 
<P>
<P>
<U>Composition</U>  Calcixerollic Xerochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid
have dark colored surface layers about 2 to 5 inches thick and carbonate
accumulation in the subsoils. Similar soils lack subsoil carbonate
accumulation but have similar physical properties. They are Typic Xerochrepts,
loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid.  Other similar soils form on highly weathered
bedrock inclusions and have subsoil clay accumulation.  They are Mollic
Haploxeralfs, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid.  These soils occupy about 45
percent of the unit. 
<P>
<P>
Typic Haploxerolls, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid have dark colored surface
layersabout 7 to 11 inches thick and often have carbonate accumulation in the
subsoils.  These soils occupy about 35 percent of the unit. 
<P>
<P>
Included are up to 20 percent dissimilar soils and rock outcrop.  Typic
Xerochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid are formed in weakly weathered
non-calcareous bedrock have hard angular rock fragments of greater than 55
percent of the subsoils and substrata, textures are moderately coarse, and
subsoil clay accumulations are absent. These soils have higher bearing
strength on native road surfaces.  Lithic Xerochrepts, loamy skeletal, frigid,
mixed are shallow with bedrock within 2 feet of the surface.  They can occur
along ridgenose positions and below 4000 feet along the Clark Fork River.
These soils have lower productivity.  Typic Xerochrepts, loamy skeletal,
mixed, frigid are under dry Douglas-fir forest.  They lack the dark colored
surface layer and have higher productivity.  Rock outcrop occupies up to 5
percent of the unit.

<P>
<P>
<U>Representative Profiles</U> 
<P>
<P>
Calcixerollic Xerochrepts, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid have a soil surface
covered by a layer of partially decomposed forest litter about 1 inch thick. 
Surface layers are dark grayish brown and dark brown loams about 13 inches
thick.  Upper subsoils are dark yellowish brown and yellowish brown very
gravelly silt loams about 21 inches thick.  Lower subsoils are pale brown
gravelly loams about 9 inches thick.  Substrata are light olive brown very
gravelly silt loams and highly weathered calcareous argillite to a depth of 60
inches or more.  Many rock fragments can be crushed by moderate pressure by
the hand. 
<P>
<P>
These Typic Haploxerolls, loamy skeletal, mixed, frigid have surface layers
very dark brown gravelly silt loams about 13 inches thick.  Subsoils are
yellowish brown very gravelly loams about 27 inches thick.  Substrata are
brown extremely cobbly loams to a depth of 60 inches or more.  Many
rockfragments can be crushed by moderate pressure by the hand.

<CENTER><U>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</U></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<U>TIMBER</U>  Potential annual productivity is low.  This map unit contains
some slopes suitable for tractor harvest.  Competition for moisture from
understory vegetation  and high insulation severely limits forest
regeneration.  Shelterwood and selection silvicultural systems can help
improve regeneration.  Rotting wood is an important nitrogen source for this
unit.  Leaving large diameter logging slash helps maintain fertility as well
as offers shade for seedlings. 
<P>
<P>
<U>ROADS</U>  Roads should perform well with standard location, construction,
and maintenance practices on most of the unit.  Native rock fragments with low
durability break down over time under heavy traffic.  Unsurfaced roads rut
when wet in drainageways, on soils where bedrock is highly weathered, and
where soils contain few rock fragments.  Spot surfacing or seasonal haul
restrictions will help protect the road surface. 
<P>
<P>
<U>RANGE</U>  This map unit is moderately suited to range management.  The
forest understory produces excellent forage, but slope steepness can limit
access.  These areas are highly suscetpible to weed invasion. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WILDLIFE-FISHERIES</U>  This unit provides excellent deer and elk winter
range, and yearlong bighorn sheep range were associated with Map Unit 26UA. 
Graminoids provide the primary forage.  Shrubs are scarce to nonexistent. 
Timber harvest is generally not beneficial to winter range maintenance. 
Underburning is the best form of vegetative manipulation. Invasion by and
conversion to knapweed can result in loss in forage and is a severe risk in
this unit. 
<P>
<P>
<U>WATERSHED</U>  Skid trails, firelines, and roads have a moderately low
erosion hazard. 
<P>
Sediment delivery efficiency is low.
