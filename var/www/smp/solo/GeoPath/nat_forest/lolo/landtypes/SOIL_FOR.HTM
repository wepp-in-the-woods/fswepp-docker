<CENTER><U>SOIL FORMATION</U></CENTER>
<P>
 
<P>
 
<P>
 There are five principal factors of soil formation:  parent material,
<P>
 topography, biological activity, climate, and time. The soil-forming factors
<P>
 are interdependent, each modifying the effects of the others.
<P>
 
<P>
 Soil is the result of the combined effects of these five factors, and soil
<P>
 differences are due principally to the relative importance or strength of the
<P>
 various factors.  In mountainous areas such as the Lolo National Forest,
<P>
 changes in one or more soil-forming factors occur within relatively short
<P>
 distances.  The many micro-climates that result from change in elevation, air
<P>
 drainage, topography, slope gradient and aspect strongly influence soil
<P>
 formation.  Complexity of parent material, topography, and time also influence
<P>
 the kinds of soil in the area.  The relative effects of each soil-forming
<P>
 factor in determining soil characteristics at any particular site are difficult
<P>
 to evaluate.
<P>
 
<P>
 There are some obvious relationships between soil properties and parent
<P>
 material within the survey area. Most soils have a surface layer of volcanic
<P>
 ash influenced loess.  Most of the volcanic ash came from the 6700 B.P. (Before
<P>
 Present) eruption of Mt. Mazama (now Crater Lake, Oregon). Volcanic ash from
<P>
 other sources, such as Glacier Peak and several eruptions of Mt. St. Helens,
<P>
 has been identified in the area.  The volume of material deposited from these
<P>
 other sources seems to have been much less because the identifiable material is
<P>
 usually found in relatively thin layers or as localized deposts. 
<P>
 
<P>
 The depth and character of loess surface layers is partially correlated with
<P>
 landscape position.  Loess surface layers tend to be thicker on northerly
<P>
 aspects and vary to undetectable on southerly aspects. The loess surface is
<P>
 often diluted by mixing with subsoil materials on high ridges and lower
<P>
 elevation steep slopes and can form a thicker surface layer in some concave
<P>
 slope positions and upper elevation steep slopes. The loess has weathered to a
<P>
 dark brown to reddish brown in color in freely drained slope positions but can
<P>
 be very dark brown to black in concave slope positions which are peridocally
<P>
 saturated with water.  The darker color is often associated with forest
<P>
 openings dominated by alder and fern, aspen or spruce communities.
<P>
 
<P>
 Most parent materials are weathered from local bedrocks or surficial deposits
<P>
 derived from local bedrocks. Some parent materials produce unique soil
<P>
 characteristics. Soils weathered from granite are moderately coarse to coarse
<P>
 textured and are highly erosive due to their uncohesive nature. Metasedimentary
<P>
 Belt argillites, siltites, and quartzites produce subsoils that are moderately
<P>
 coarse textured and have many rock fragments. Soils weathered from calcareous
<P>
 metasedimentary Belt argillites and siltites are moderately coarse to medium
<P>
 textured, have a subsoil accumulation of calcium carbonate, and have varying
<P>
 amounts of rock fragments. Highly weathered zones of this parent material
<P>
 produce soils with few rock fragments. Soils weathered from lacustrine
<P>
 sediments originating from Glacial Lake Missoula are moderately fine textured
<P>
 and have no rock fragments. Soils weathered from valley fill materials are
<P>
 moderately fine textured and a poorly sorted distribution of cobbles. 
<P>
 
<P>
 Properties of soils formed in glacial till vary depending on the extent of
<P>
 local glaciation. Soils formed in till or drift from alpine glaciation of
<P>
 valley trains and troughwalls are moderately coarse and contain more than 40
<P>
 percent rock fragments. Soils formed in parent materials resulting from alpine
<P>
 glaciation confined to ice caps on low relief ridetops and basins have subsoils
<P>
 that are dense which produce perched and elevated water tables. These soils are
<P>
 of local extent occurring high in the Lolo Creek Divide, the Rattlesnake
<P>
 headwaters, and the Reservation Divide north of Plains.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
 
<P>
 Subsoils formed in alluvium are quite variable.  Past stream position and flow
<P>
 rate have caused intense spatial variability of parent materials.  Soils on
<P>
 flood plains and terraces are often coarse textured because of the frequent
<P>
 occurrence of stream deposited sand and gravel in these positions. Alluvial
<P>
 terraces high above the Clark Fork River are older than terraces only 20 to 80
<P>
 feet above; soils on these high terraces exhibit partial consolidation and
<P>
 iron/manganese accumulation deep in the substratium. These older soils have
<P>
 been buried by more recent alluvium and soil taxonomy does not reflect their
<P>
 existence in this survey. They are of interest only as remnants of a past
<P>
 warmer climate. Soils in upland meadow and willow bottom positions adjacent to
<P>
 meandering streams are often medium textured because of the relatively slow
<P>
 flow rate of the stream during deposition.  These soils transmit groundwater
<P>
 more slowly and are often poorly drained.  Some alluvial materials occur in
<P>
 complex patterns with till and outwash materials in glacial trough bottoms. 
<P>
 
<P>
 Increasing elevation and apparent exposure to either past or present colder
<P>
 climates results in an increase in angularity and size of rock fragments in the
<P>
 subsoil. At one extreme, high elevation ridgetops have rock fragments that are
<P>
 frost churned to the surface and subsoils are nearly fragmental with angular
<P>
 rock fragments dominating the soil profile. This suggests more physical and
<P>
 less chemical weathering influence on soil formation.  
<P>
 
<P>
 Relationships between soil properties and topography are apparent in the survey
<P>
 area. Soils on very steep slopes adjacent to perennial streams are very rocky
<P>
 and shallow. Soils on moderately steep mountain slopes are deep and may be very
<P>
 rocky or moderately rocky depending on parent material.
<P>
 
<P>
 
<P>
<CENTER><U>CLASSIFICATION OF THE SOILS</U></CENTER>
<P>
 
<P>
 
<P>
 The soils of the survey area are classified according to the National
<P>
 Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) classification system. This system is
<P>
 hierarchial in nature similar to the botanical key. The NCSS system of soil
<P>
 classification has six categories (Soil Survey Staff, 1975).   
<P>
 
<P>
 <U>Order</U>. Ten soil orders are recognized. The differences among orders
reflect the
<P>
 dominant soil-forming processes and the degree of soil formation.  Each order
<P>
 is identified by a word ending in &quot;sol&quot;.  Four soil orders occur in
the survey
<P>
 area: Inceptisol, Entisol, Mollisol, and Alfisol.
<P>
 
<P>
 <U>Suborder</U>. Each order is divided into suborders primarily on the basis of
<P>
 properties that influence soil genesis and are important to plant growth or
<P>
 properties that reflect the most important variables within the orders. The
<P>
 last syllable in the name of a suborder indicates the order. An example is
<P>
 Ochrept &quot;ochr&quot;, meaning a surface horizon that is either light in
color or low
<P>
 in organic matter, or both, plus &quot;ept&quot;, from the order of Inceptisol.
<P>
 
<P>
 <U>Great Group</U>. Each suborder is divided into great groups on the basis
of close
<P>
 similarities in kind, arrangement, and degree of development of pedogenic
<P>
 horizons; soil moisture and temperature regimes; and base status. Each great
<P>
 group is identified by the name of a suborder and by a prefix that indicates a
<P>
 property of the soil. An example is Cryochrept &quot;cry&quot; meaning cold
annual and
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
 summer soil temperatures, plus &quot;ochrept&quot; the suborder of the
Inceptisols that
<P>
 have light-colored, low in organic matter surfaces.
<P>
 
<P>
 <U>Subgroup</U>. Each great group has a typic subgroup. Other subgroups are
<P>
 intergrades or extragrades.  The typic is the central concept of the great
<P>
 group; it is not necessarily the most extensive.  Intergrades are transitions
<P>
 to other orders, suborders, or great groups.  Extragrades have some properties
<P>
 that are not representative of the great group, but do not indicate transitions
<P>
 to any other known kind of soil. Each subgroup is identified by one or more
<P>
 adjectives preceding the name of the great group.  The adjective &quot;Typic&quot;
<P>
 identifies the subgroup that typifies the great group. An example is Typic
<P>
 Cryochrept. An example of an extragrade is Andic Cryochrept, meaning those
<P>
 Cryochrepts that differ from &quot;Typic&quot; by having a surface that has a composition
<P>
 influenced by fine pyroclastic materials or volcanic ash.
<P>
 
<P>
 <U>Family</U>. Families are established within a subgroup on the basis of
physical and
<P>
 chemical properties that affect management.  The properties are mostly those of
<P>
 horizons where there is much biological activity below plow depth. Among the
<P>
 properties considered are particle-size class, mineral content, temperature
<P>
 regime, depth of the root zone, consistence, moisture equivalent, slopes, and
<P>
 presence of permanent cracks.  A family name consists of the name of a subgroup
<P>
 and a series of adjectives.  The adjectives are the class names for the
<P>
 properties used as family differentia.  An example is Andic Cryochrepts, loamy
<P>
 skeletal, mixed. &quot;Loamy skeletal&quot; refers to those soils that have loamy
<P>
 textures with less than 35 percent clay and that have greater than 35 percent
<P>
 rock fragments by volume. &quot;Mixed&quot; refers to a mixed mineralogy.
<P>
 
<P>
 <U>Series</U>. The series level of soil classification was not used in this survey
<P>
 because survey objectives did not require this amount of detail.
<P>
 
<P>
 In the section, <U>Major Soils of the Lolo National Forest</U>, general properties
<P>
 common for major soils identified in the survey are discussed for taxonomic
<P>
 classes beginning with the great group level through the subgroup level of
<P>
 classification. Specific relationships occurring within the survey area are
<P>
 highlighted.  Soil family discussions follow each subgroup description. 
<P>
 
<P>
 Soil profile descriptions are included for your reference. Profile descriptions
<P>
 are detailed descriptions of physical and chemical properties of one soil
<P>
 pedon. Soils occur in nature as a continuum. Soils with the same taxonomic
<P>
 classification vary from site to site due to small or large differences in soil
<P>
 forming processes. In mountainous terrain soil forming processes can change
<P>
 over a small area.  These reference pedon descriptions offer representation of
<P>
 the central concept of the major soils of the survey area. Range of
<P>
 characteristics are included to illustrate deviations that have been described
<P>
 in similar reference soils. Where deviations are great enough to reflect a
<P>
 difference in management of the soil, another soil profile description for that
<P>
 soil family is included. Use these descriptions with the knowledge that soils
<P>
 occur as a continuim over the landscape.
<P>
 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
 
<P>
 <U>Classification Remarks</U>
<P>
 
<P>
 Several assumptions are made in classifying the soils in this survey area.
<P>
 This is done because criteria for classification often require laboratory data
<P>
 or observations not available when classification decisions are made.  This is
<P>
 particularly true of classes dependent on temperature, moisture, and chemical
<P>
 data.
<P>
 
<P>
 Soils in the survey area are in either cryic or frigid temperature regimes and
<P>
 both are present.  The boundary between these two classes is considered to be
<P>
 the lower subalpine fir climax forest boundary or an equivalent elevation-
<P>
 aspect combination. Little data is available for specific local definition but
<P>
 the data for much of the Northern Rocky Mountains suggest this is a close,
<P>
 though imperfect, approximation. Exception does occur where subalpine fir
<P>
 climax forests exists below 4400 feet. Data from the Swan Valley suggests that
<P>
 these lower valley subalpine fir types where they occur as inclusions among
<P>
 grand fir or Douglas fir forests have frigid soil regimes and are subjected to
<P>
 cold air drainage (Hackley, 1982). Lower subalpine climax forests occur below
<P>
 4400 feet in the Fishtrap and Seeley area and are considered to be on the
<P>
 boundary of cryic/frigid. Northerly inclusions within these valleys may be
<P>
 cryic due to aspect orientation. Soils supporting these lower elevation
<P>
 subalpine fir forests in the Fishtrap and Seeley valleys have been classified
<P>
 as frigid but cryic soils are recognized as a possible mosaic in the area.
<P>
 These soils have been identified as similar soils for management.
<P>
 
<P>
 Soils in the survey area are expected to be either udic, ustic, or xeric
<P>
 moisture regimes. The survey area occurs in a transition zone between the more
<P>
 maritime climate of Idaho and the continental climate of eastern Montana. The
<P>
 ustic moisture regime is recognized to the east of the survey area and may
<P>
 occur within the survey area in localized effect. Two years of data taken in
<P>
 the survey area suggests that steep south facing slopes and dry end Douglas fir
<P>
 habitat series are correlated with soils in the xeric regime. These sites will
<P>
 continue to be monitored for several years after the survey is completed.
<P>
 Adjacent surveys in northern Idaho and northern Montana have also recognized
<P>
 xeric regimes under similar conditions. Other soils are considered to be in the
<P>
 udic moisture regime. Although, transitions must be noted. The Douglas
<P>
 fir/ninebark (Pseudotsuga menziesii/Physocarpus malvaceous) habitat type;
<P>
 possibly some drier grand fir/beargrass (Abies grandis/Xerophyllum tenax) and
<P>
 Douglas fir/blue huckleberry (Pseudotsuga menziesii/Vaccinium globulare)
<P>
 habitat types are recognized as being on the dry end of udic. Management
<P>
 implications show these types as being less productive and having drier
<P>
 conditions for regeneration than the central concept for udic e.g. grand
<P>
 fir/queencup beadlily (Abies grandis/Clintonia).
<P>
 
<P>
 An assumption concerning subsoil base saturation is required to classify many
<P>
 Inceptisols in the survey area (Dystrochrepts versus Eutrochrepts).
<P>
 Dystrochrepts must be less than 60 percent base saturated between the depths of
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
 10-30 inches to be classified correctly.  Laboratory data from the area soils
<P>
 below 5000 feet have subsoils that are 60 to 80 percent base saturated. Soils
<P>
 formed in parent materials derived from the Wallace Formation (calcareous
<P>
 argillites and siltites) are 100 percent base saturated except at elevations
<P>
 above 5500 feet where carbonates have been leached from the profile and base
<P>
 saturation is below 60 percent. Soils above 5000 feet have subsoil base
<P>
 saturation percents ranging from 7 to 50 percent.  
<P>
 
<P>
 Most soils in the survey area have volcanic ash influenced loess surface
<P>
 layers. Soil samples taken from western Montana and northern Idaho vary in
<P>
 composition from 25-80 percent volcanic glass shards in the silt and very fine
<P>
 sand particle size fraction.  The mean is near 60 percent and the mode seems to
<P>
 be near 70 percent.  The -15 bar water retention of these materials is near 15
<P>
 percent by weight.  It is slightly thixotropic but this property is not
<P>
 strongly expressed, possibly because textures are consistently silt loam with
<P>
 little clay. Clay percentages range from 4 to 8 percent. Soils in the frigid
<P>
 temperature regime that have ash influenced surface layers greater than 14
<P>
 inches thick are called Vitrandepts because they are expected to hold less than
<P>
 20 percent water at -15 bars of soil moisture tension.  They are called medial
<P>
 at the family taxonomic level in spite of having more than 60 percent glass
<P>
 shards.  This is done because the material feels loamy, not sandy, after
<P>
 prolonged rubbing.
