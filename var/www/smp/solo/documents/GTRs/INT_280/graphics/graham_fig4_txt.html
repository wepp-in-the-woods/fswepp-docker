			<dt>Long Description of Figure 4:</dt>
			<dd>Graph that compares the predicted height of Douglas-fir seedlings with their actual measured height at age 5 (8 seedlings were taller than predicted, 3 were at the height predicted, and 12 were shorter than predicted; all heights are approximate) -- 
Seedling 1: predicted height = 23 inches, measured height = 22 inches; 
Seedling 2: predicted height = 25 inches, measured height = 27 inches; 
Seedling 3: predicted height = 26 inches, measured height = 22 inches; 
Seedling 4: predicted height = 29 inches, measured height = 20 inches; 
Seedling 5: predicted height = 29 inches, measured height = 36 inches; 
Seedling 6: predicted height = 29 inches, measured height = 39 inches; 
Seedling 7: predicted height = 32 inches, measured height = 23 inches; 
Seedling 8: predicted height = 32 inches, measured height = 25 inches; 
Seedling 9: predicted height = 35 inches, measured height = 27 inches; 
Seedling 10: predicted height = 35 inches, measured height = 30 inches; 
Seedling 11: predicted height = 37 inches, measured height = 37 inches; 
Seedling 12: predicted height = 37 inches, measured height = 39 inches; 
Seedling 13: predicted height = 39 inches, measured height = 42 inches; 
Seedling 14: predicted height = 41 inches, measured height = 35 inches; 
Seedling 15: predicted height = 42 inches, measured height = 39 inches; 
Seedling 16: predicted height = 44 inches, measured height = 44 inches; 
Seedling 17: predicted height = 47 inches, measured height = 39 inches; 
Seedling 18: predicted height = 48 inches, measured height = 47 inches; 
Seedling 19: predicted height = 51 inches, measured height = 71 inches; 
Seedling 20: predicted height = 55 inches, measured height = 55 inches; 
Seedling 21: predicted height = 58 inches, measured height = 60 inches; 
Seedling 22: predicted height = 65 inches, measured height = 58 inches; 
Seedling 23: predicted height = 74 inches, measured height = 78 inches.</dd>
