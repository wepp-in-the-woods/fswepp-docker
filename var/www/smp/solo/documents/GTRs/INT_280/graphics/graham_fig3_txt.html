			<dt>Long Description of Figure 3:</dt>
			<dd>Graph that compares the predicted height of Douglas-fir seedlings with their actual measured height at age 5 (3 seedlings were taller than predicted, one was at the height predicted, and 30 were shorter than predicted; all heights are approximate) --
