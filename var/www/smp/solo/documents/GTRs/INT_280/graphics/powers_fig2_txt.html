			<dt>Long Description of Figure 2:</dt>
			<dd>Complex flow chart illustrating the roles of soil porosity and site organic matter in regulating the processes controlling site productivity - Top box of chart shows: Net Primary Productivity (Biomass Accumulation) at the top, Respiration to the side of Net Primary Productivity with arrow pointing out, Senescence Consumption to the side of Net Primary Productivity, Growth and Defense in sections below Net Primary Productivity, and Metabolism and Assimilation (Gross Primary Productivity) in the bottom section of that box, arrows are pointing out and to box below (Site Organic Matter); Small box to the left of Top box has an arrow pointing to the Top box and lists atmospheric with gases and particulates in a bulleted list underneath that and then heat and light; Box on middle right is labeled, Site Organic Matter: Left side header - Below ground with Energy source and Nutrient reservoir listed underneath; Right side header - Above Ground, has two columns underneath - Column 1 has Chemical as a header, then Energy source and Nutrient reservoir listed underneath; Column 2 has Physical as a header, then Erosion, Evaporation, and Heat flux listed underneath; Faunal Activity is at the bottom of that right center box; there are arrows going from the Site Organic Matter box to boxes entitled Microbial Decomposition and Soil Structure; There are arrows going from the Microbial Decomposition box to the Soil Structure box and a box entitled Uptake; There are arrows going from the Soil Structure box to the Microbial Decomposition box and a box entitled Root Development; the Uptake box has an arrow going from it to the Top box (Net Primary Productivity); There is a box entitled Soil Porosity that has two sections; the upper section has the header Surface, then lists Infiltration and Erosion - the lower section has the header Depth, then lists water storage, water release, gas exchange, and soil structure; there are arrows going from the Soil Porosity box to the Root Development box, the Microbial Decomposition box, the Soil Structure box, the Uptake box (this particular arrow is labeled Diffusion), and there is an arrow pointing out.</dd>
