			<dt>Long Description of Figure 4:</dt>
			<dd>Upper diagram is a square plot, 65 meters by 65 meters; Outer Buffer is outside of the square. The square is divided in half with the upper section labeled Measurement Subplot 1 and the lower section labeled Measurement Subplot 2. The square is filled with circles indicating where trees are planted. The entire square has a buffer strip around it: the top section has it labeled Buffer Strip Subplot 1 and at the bottom of the square it is labeled Buffer Strip Subplot 2. The buffer strip is three trees deep. The buffer between the two subplots is four trees deep with two of the trees being on either side of Subplot 1 or 2. Measurement Subplot 1 is labeled Trees Only, while Measurement Subplot 2 is labeled Total Vegetation. The section of trees to be studied for both subplots is 20 trees wide by 8 trees high. The lower diagram shows two wide rectangles within a wide rectangle. The small rectangle to the left is labeled Measurement Subplot 1 and the one to the right is labeled Measurement Subplot 2. There are two traffic lanes indicated: one below and one above the two subplots.</dd>
