			<dd>Graph showing relationship of fire cycles and fuel loading for various habitat types (all following values are approximate) -- 
PIAL (whitebark pine/Pinus albicaulis)/PIPO (ponderosa pine/Pinus ponderosa): 
fuel loading increases at a steady rate from 0 to 3.5 tons per acre as fire cycles also increase at a steady rate from 0 to 1 per 1,000 years, fuel loading then increases at a steady rate from 3.5 to 7 tons per acre as fire cycles increase exponentially from 1 to 390 per 1,000 years; 
PSME (Douglas-fir/Pseudotsuga menziesii var glauca): 
fuel loading increases at a steady rate from 7 to 13 tons per acre as fire cycles decrease exponentially (slow to fast and then slightly slower around 12.5 tons per acre) from 390 to 110 per 1,000 years; 
ABLA (subalpine fir/Abies lasiocarpa): 
fuel loading increases at a steady rate from 13 to 15 tons per acre as fire cycles decrease at a steady rate from 110 to 25 per 1,000 years, fuel loading increases at a steady rate from 15 to 20 tons per acre as fire cycles decrease at a decreasing rate from 25 to 0 per 1,000 years, fuel loading increases at a steady rate from 20 to 24 tons per acre as fire cycles remain at 0 per 1,000 years; 
ABGR (grand fir/Abies grandis)/THPL (western red cedar/Thuja plicata): 
fuel loading increases at a steady rate from 24 to 33 tons per acre as fire cycles remains at 0 per 1,000 years.</dd>
