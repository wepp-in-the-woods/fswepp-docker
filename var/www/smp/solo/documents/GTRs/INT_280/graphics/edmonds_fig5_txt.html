			<dd>Graph showing percent of original nitrogen mass in three samples of logs and one sample of roots -- 
Western hemlock logs (OR): 
Nitrogen content remains the same during the first 5 years, 
Nitrogen content rises from 100% to 123% over next 5 years, 
Nitrogen content rises from 123% to 130% over next 7 years, 
Nitrogen content rises from 130% to 150% over 8 years, 
Nitrogen content drops from 150% to 140% over 8 years, 
Nitrogen content drops from 140% to 138% over 5 years; 
Lodgepole pine roots 1 (WY): 
Nitrogen content drops from 100% to 90% over the first 5 years, 
Nitrogen content drops from 90% to 40% over next 3 years, 
Nitrogen content rises from 40% to 75% over next 5 years, 
Nitrogen content rises from 75% to 160% over 32 years, 
Nitrogen content rises from 160% to 210% over 35 years;
Lodgepole pine roots 2 (WY): 
Nitrogen content rises from 100% to 121% over the first 2 years, 
Nitrogen content drops from 121% to 20% over next 3 years, 
Nitrogen content rises from 20% to 75% over next 7 years, 
Nitrogen content rises from 75% to 120% over 100 years; 
Douglas-fir logs (WA and OR): 
Nitrogen content drops from 100% to 90% over first 10 years, 
Nitrogen content drops from 90% to 62% over next 40 years, 
Nitrogen content rises from 62% to 98% over next 38 years, 
Nitrogen content rises from 98% to 125% over 34 years, 
Nitrogen content rises from 125% to 180% over 20 years,
