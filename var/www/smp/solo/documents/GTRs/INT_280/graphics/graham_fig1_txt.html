			<dt>Long Description of Figure 1:</dt>
			<dd>Diagram indicates that beginning with the sand soil texture, shelterwood or selection regeneration method would be most appropriate; moving through the various soil textures towards the clay soil (order is sand, sandy-loam, loam, silt-loam, clay-loam, clay), shelterwood and selection regeneration methods become less appropriate and the clearcut method becomes more appropriate; Percentages of field capacity and wilting point increase moving from sand through the various soil textures to clay as follows (percentage values are approximate) -- 
Sand: wilting point = 0-2.5%, field capacity = 2.5-6%; 
Sandy-loam: wilting point = 0-7%, field capacity = 7-22%; 
Loam: wilting point = 0-11%, field capacity = 11-31%; 
Silt-loam: wilting point = 0-13%, field capacity = 13-39%; 
Clay-loam: wilting point = 0-14%, field capacity = 14-43%; 
Clay: wilting point = 0-16%, field capacity = 16-44%</dd>
