			<dt>Long Description of Figure 2:</dt>
			<dd>Map of Lewis and Clark Forest Reserve - Montana 1899: The map shows the Lewis and Clark Forest Reserve with areas darkened which were burned. The total area burned is about 20-25% of the area on the map. Though interspersed, there are somewhat higher concentrations along the top of the map, all along the right side and then at the bottom left corner of the map. The map shows the Middle Fork of the Flathead River at the top edge, the right edge is about 12 miles to the right of Rocky Peak and 8 miles left of the town of Augusta, the Blackfoot River is at the bottom edge (the town of Clearwater is near the bottom left corner and the town of Lincoln is at the bottom right corner), and Flathead Lake and the Mission Range border the left edge.</dd>
