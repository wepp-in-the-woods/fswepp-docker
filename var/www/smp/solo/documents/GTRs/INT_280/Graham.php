Concepts and strategies for managing forests to produce goods and services, yet maintain functioning visually pleasing forests, are being debated, developed, and implemented. A well-designed and implemented silvicultural system is basic to good forest management. Means of protecting soil and all factors affecting soil properties must be integrated into silvicultural systems. Inappropriate silvicultural techniques can degrade forest productivity especially by compacting, displacing, or destroying soil surface layers rich in organic matter. Because both short- and long-term productivity can be influenced by changes in these layers, we make several recommendations on how to protect soil when developing prescriptions for any silvicultural system.</p>	<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>	<p>Forest management is at a critical juncture. Not since the late 1960's and early 1970's has the management of forests been more scrutinized. The management controversies of the Bitterroot and Monongahela National Forests contributed to passing of the National Forest Management Act of 1976. In response to the Act, forest practices were modified, but the primary focus of forest management continued to be on the production of timber-based commodities. Silvicultural systems were designed to efficiently produce lumber and fiber-based products from a variety of lands. Much of society was content with this form of management until more and more virgin forests were converted to young, fast-growing, high-yield, commodity-producing tree farms.</p>	<p>The demands of society are changing as the 21st century approaches. No longer is commodity production the only desirable forest attribute. Diversity, sustainability, old-growth, scenic values, wildlife (both game and non game), and water quality are becoming increasingly important. To provide and maintain these attributes requires some basic changes in forest management; new initiatives and concepts are now being developed.</p>	<p>&quot;New Forestry&quot; is one of these. It is a concept defined as &quot;the management of ecosystems and not just the regeneration of trees&quot; (Franklin 1989). In addition, a broad philosophy of forest management by the Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, entitled &quot;New Perspectives,&quot; is also in the process of being defined and implemented. Both of these strive to make forest management more broadly based ecologically and responsive to society's demands.</p>	<p>New perspectives and new forestry both use the ecosystem as the basic unit of land management. The management of forest ecosystems to meet objectives is the practice of silviculture (Smith 1962). The silvicultural methods and manipulation techniques available to manage forests need to be assembled into complete silvicultural systems, planned programs of treatments to be applied throughout the life of the forest. This will be more important than ever, if new forestry and new perspectives are going to succeed and if ecologically sound silvicultural systems are to be implemented. Soil is often not fully integrated into our silvicultural systems, yet as outlined here, it is critical to the regeneration, productivity, nutrient value, and moisture-retention abilities of all forested sites. After discussing the role of surface soil layers in the forest, we outline silvicultural methods and their effects on soils, and recommend soil protection guidelines for silvicultural prescriptions.</p>	<h2>FOREST SOILS</h2>	<p>Litter, humus, soil wood, and certain key properties of the surface mineral layers of forest soils are usually most critical when developing silvicultural systems. These are the soil layers most easily and commonly disturbed by silvicultural activities, yet they are crucial to forest productivity.</p>	<h3>Woody Residues</h3>	<p>Although they are not a soil component, the quantity, quality, and disposition of woody residues can also influence forest soils greatly. The quantity of downed material can vary dramatically, depending on site, forest conditions, and forest treatments (<a href="#table1">table 1</a>).</p>		<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" border="1" width="560" class="figuretbl">			<caption><strong>TABLE 1</strong><a name="table1">&nbsp;</a><br />Average downed woody loadings, duff depths, and percentages rotten from the Forest Inventory by cover type for east and westside National Forests of the Northern Rocky Mountains (Brown and See 1981)			</caption>			<thead>				<tr>					        <th rowspan="2" scope="col" id="t1-c1">Cover type<a href="#table1foot1"><sup>1</sup></a></th>					<th colspan="3">Westside forests</th>					<th colspan="3">Eastside forests</th>				</tr>				<tr>					<th scope="col" id="t1-c2">Total<br /><span class="value">(Tons/acre)</span></th>					<th scope="col" id="t1-c3">Duff depth<br /><span class="value">(Inches)</span></th>					<th scope="col" id="t1-c4">Rotten large<br /><span class="value">(Percent)</span></th>					<th scope="col" id="t1-c5">Total<br /><span class="value">(Tons/acre)</span></th>					<th scope="col" id="t1-c6">Duff depth<br /><span class="value">(Inches)</span></th>					<th scope="col" id="t1-c7">Rotten large<br /><span class="value">(Percent)</span></th>				</tr>			</thead>			<tfoot>				<tr>					<td colspan="7"><p><sup><a name="table1foot1"></a>1</sup>PP             = Ponderosa pine, <em class="ital">Pinus ponderosa</em><br />  DF = Douglas-fir, <em class="ital">Pseudotsuga menziesii</em><br />  LP = Lodgepole pine, <em class="ital">Pinus contorta</em><br />  L = Larch-grand fir, <em class="ital">Larix occidentalis</em>-<em class="ital">Abies grandis</em><br />  S-F = Spruce-subalpine fir, <em class="ital">Picea engelmannii</em>-<em class="ital">Abies lasiocarpa</em><br />  C-H = Cedar-hemlock, <em class="ital">Thuja plicata</em>-<em class="ital">Tsuga heterophylla</em>.</p></td>				</tr>			</tfoot>			<tbody>				<tr>					<td headers="t1-c1">PP</td>					<td headers="t1-c2" class="data">12.9</td>					<td headers="t1-c3" class="data">0.6</td>					<td headers="t1-c4" class="data">61</td>					<td headers="t1-c5" class="data">5.0</td>					<td headers="t1-c6" class="data">0.6</td>					<td headers="t1-c7" class="data">70</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td headers="t1-c1">DF</td>					<td headers="t1-c2" class="data">15.7</td>					<td headers="t1-c3" class="data">.9</td>					<td headers="t1-c4" class="data">63</td>					<td headers="t1-c5" class="data">12.0</td>					<td headers="t1-c6" class="data">1.0</td>					<td headers="t1-c7" class="data">63</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td headers="t1-c1">LP</td>					<td headers="t1-c2" class="data">17.5</td>					<td headers="t1-c3" class="data">1.1</td>					<td headers="t1-c4" class="data">59</td>					<td headers="t1-c5" class="data">16.1</td>					<td headers="t1-c6" class="data">1.1</td>					<td headers="t1-c7" class="data">55</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td headers="t1-c1">L</td>					<td headers="t1-c2" class="data">21.4</td>					<td headers="t1-c3" class="data">1.2</td>					<td headers="t1-c4" class="data">58</td>					<td headers="t1-c5" class="data">&#8212;</td>					<td headers="t1-c6" class="data">&#8212;</td>					<td headers="t1-c7" class="data">&#8212;</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td headers="t1-c1">S-F</td>					<td headers="t1-c2" class="data">26.7</td>					<td headers="t1-c3" class="data">1.4</td>					<td headers="t1-c4" class="data">52</td>					<td headers="t1-c5" class="data">22.7</td>					<td headers="t1-c6" class="data">1.3</td>					<td headers="t1-c7" class="data">52</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td headers="t1-c1">C-H</td>					<td headers="t1-c2" class="data">33.4</td>					<td headers="t1-c3" class="data">1.4</td>					<td headers="t1-c4" class="data">57</td>					<td headers="t1-c5" class="data">&#8212;</td>					<td headers="t1-c6" class="data">&#8212;</td>					<td headers="t1-c7" class="data">&#8212;</td>				</tr>			</tbody>		</table>	<p>Physically, woody residues protect soil from erosion, displacement, and compaction. In addition, they can protect regenerating forests from both abiotic and biotic elements (Edgren and Stein 1974). Residues provide shade and protection from wind and snow, and can be critical factors in protecting newly established seedlings from livestock (Graham and others, in press). Regeneration can be damaged by falling or rolling logs, and fuel loadings can threaten forests by becoming a fire hazard. As logs and other woody debris decay they can become incorporated into the litter, humus, and mineral soil horizons.</p>	<p>Chemically, woody residues are an important forest component. Decaying logs, especially those with the incipient and advanced forms of decay, are excellent substrata for nonsymbiotic nitrogen (N) fixation (<a href="#table2">table 2</a>). If sites do not have nitrogen-fixing plants present, such as ceanothus (<em class="ital">Ceanothus</em> spp.), shepherdia (<em class="ital">Shepherdia canadensis</em>), or leguminous forbs, these nonsymbiotic forms of nitrogen fixation are crucial. Also, woody residues release nutrients during decay that are critical for forest growth (Harvey and others 1987). Therefore, the quantity and kind of forest residues on a site can be critically important for maintaining site productivity.</p>		<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" border="1" width="560" class="figuretbl">			<caption><strong>TABLE 2</strong><a name="table2">&nbsp;</a><br />    Woody residue weights<a href="#table2foot1"><sup>1</sup></a> and associated     <span title="nitrogen">N</span> additions<a href="#table2foot2"><sup>2</sup></a>     from nonsymbiotic <span title="nitrogen">N</span> fixation on four old-growth     forest sites in western Montana and northern Idaho (Jurgensen and others 1987)     </caption>			<thead>				<tr>					<th scope="col" id="t2-c1">Decay class</th>					<th scope="col" id="t2-c2">Douglass-fir<br />(Montana)<br /><span class="value">(Tons/acre)</span></th>					<th scope="col" id="t2-c3">Douglass-fir<br />(Montana)<br /><span class="value">(Lb/acre)</span></th>					<th scope="col" id="t2-c4">Cedar-hemlock<br />(Montana)<br /><span class="value">(Tons/acre)</span></th>					<th scope="col" id="t2-c5">Cedar-hemlock<br />(Montana)<br /><span class="value">(Lb/acre)</span></th>					<th scope="col" id="t2-c6">Subalpine fir<br />(Montana)<br /><span class="value">(Tons/acre)</span></th>					<th scope="col" id="t2-c7">Subalpine fir<br />(Montana)<br /><span class="value">(Lb/acre)</span></th>					<th scope="col" id="t2-c8">Cedar-hemlock<br />(Idaho)<br /><span class="value">(Tons/acre)</span></th>					<th scope="col" id="t2-c9">Cedar-hemlock<br />(Idaho)<br /><span class="value">(Lb/acre)</span></th>				</tr>			</thead>			<tfoot>				<tr>					        <td colspan="9"><sup><a name="table2foot1"></a>1</sup>Dry weights of woody           residues &gt;3 inches in diameter.<br />          <sup><a name="table2foot2"></a>2</sup>Total <span title="nitrogen">N</span>           fixed over a 180-day period.</td>				</tr>			</tfoot>			<tbody>				<tr>					<td headers="t2-c1">Incipient</td>					<td headers="t2-c2" class="data">5.0&nbsp;</td>					<td headers="t2-c3" class="data">0.03</td>					<td headers="t2-c4" class="data">10.7&nbsp;</td>					<td headers="t2-c5" class="data">0.07</td>					<td headers="t2-c6" class="data">27.4&nbsp;</td>					<td headers="t2-c7" class="data">0.17</td>					<td headers="t2-c8" class="data">3.1&nbsp;</td>					<td headers="t2-c9" class="data">0.04</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td headers="t2-c1">Intermediate</td>					<td headers="t2-c2" class="data">7.1&nbsp;</td>					<td headers="t2-c3" class="data">.12</td>					<td headers="t2-c4" class="data">15.5&nbsp;</td>					<td headers="t2-c5" class="data">.18</td>					<td headers="t2-c6" class="data">15.7&nbsp;</td>					<td headers="t2-c7" class="data">.26</td>					<td headers="t2-c8" class="data">21.3&nbsp;</td>					<td headers="t2-c9" class="data">.40</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td headers="t2-c1">Advanced</td>					<td headers="t2-c2" class="data">8.0&nbsp;</td>					<td headers="t2-c3" class="data">.20</td>					<td headers="t2-c4" class="data">10.9&nbsp;</td>					<td headers="t2-c5" class="data">.25</td>					<td headers="t2-c6" class="data">21.8&nbsp;</td>					<td headers="t2-c7" class="data">0.70</td>					<td headers="t2-c8" class="data">44.4&nbsp;</td>					<td headers="t2-c9" class="data">2.71</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td headers="t2-c1" class="thsubrow">Total</td>					<td headers="t2-c2" class="datatotal1">20.1&nbsp;</td>					<td headers="t2-c3" class="datatotal1">.35</td>					<td headers="t2-c4" class="datatotal1">37.1&nbsp;</td>					<td headers="t2-c5" class="datatotal1">.51</td>					<td headers="t2-c6" class="datatotal1">65.0&nbsp;</td>					<td headers="t2-c7" class="datatotal1">1.14</td>					<td headers="t2-c8" class="datatotal1">68.8&nbsp;</td>					<td headers="t2-c9" class="datatotal1">3.15</td>				</tr>			</tbody>		</table>	<h3>Litter</h3>	<p>The surfaces of forest soils are usually covered with a layer of litter.

Soils protected by litter are less prone to erosion (Rothacher and Lopushinsky 1974). Likewise, litter layers protect soils from compaction (Lull 1959). Litter is not usually an important site for ectomycorrhizal activity, but if moisture is maintained in these layers ectomycorrhizae are present (Harvey and others 1987).</p>	<p>Litter can be an impediment to both natural and artificial regeneration of trees. If the litter layer is thick, which often occurs in ponderosa pine (<em class="ital">Pinus ponderosa</em>) forests where decomposition is slow, tree seeds falling on this layer germinate, but because litter dries rapidly they may die (Pearson 1949). On the other hand, if litter remains moist during germination and early seedling growth (a situation that can be found in many hemlock [<em class="ital">Tsuga</em>] and cedar [<em class="ital">Thuja</em>] sites) successful establishment of tree seedlings is quite common (Minore 1972). Often the forest being generated on these organic seed beds does not produce the desired mix of species or stand structure to meet some forest management objectives.</p>	<h3>Humus</h3>	<p>Humus is made up of highly decomposed organic material with no recognizable plant parts. Humus layers are usually relatively shallow, depending on the site, decomposition rates, and vegetation (<a href="#table2">table 2</a>). Humus is a dynamic part of the soil horizon. It is a major substrate for both high nitrogen fixation and nitrogen storage, and it is rich in other essential elements (calcium, potassium, magnesium) (Harvey and others 1987). Humus contains many roots and maintains soil moisture, making it important for ectomycorrhizal activity. This layer often represents the transition between organic layers and the mineral soil. Very often this layer when burned over can provide numerous microsites for natural regeneration (Haig and others 1941).</p>	<h3>Soil Wood</h3>	<p>Soil wood as a component of forest soils is often overlooked. Soil wood is highly decomposed wood, incorporated into soil horizons usually in the form of brown cubicle rot. It can also occur in a fine powdery form, usually much older. As with the other organic components, quantity and type can be quite variable (<a href="#table2">table 2</a>). Soil wood is a dynamic part of the soil system. Soil wood is not a continuous layer, but occurs in deep pockets created by buried logs and decaying stumps (Reinhardt and others, in press). Soil wood should not be confused with rotten wood or residue that is on the surface of the soil.</p>	<p>Soil wood protects soils from compaction and provides OM to the mineral soil. It is also an important source of <span title="nitrogen">N</span> fixation and <span title="nitrogen">N</span> storage (Harvey and others 1989). Soil wood is an excellent substrate for ectomycorrhizae. In addition, because of its water retention ability and physical characteristics, soil wood often contains root systems of conifers that grow rapidly and concentrate in these buried logs and stumps.</p>	<h3>Surface Mineral Soil</h3>	<p>The surface 5 to 10 cm of mineral soil is derived from the parent materials of the site, but is also highly influenced by vegetation and surface organic layers. The <span title="organic matter">OM</span> incorporated into shallow mineral horizons carries important properties into the mineral soil base. Mineral soil with good OM levels has better nutrition, water-holding capacity, and structure than soils with small amounts of <span title="organic matter">OM</span>. In addition, <span title="organic matter">OM</span>-rich mineral soils are excellent sites for nitrogen fixation and ectomycorrhizae (Harvey and others 1987). Surface layers are highly susceptible to compaction and displacement. Mineral soils with high volcanic ash content are particularly sensitive to forest operations. (See <a href="Hironaka.php">Hironaka and others</a>, <a href="PageDumroese.php">Page-Dumroese and others</a>, these proceedings).</p>	<h2>THE SILVICULTURAL SYSTEM</h2>	<p>A silvicultural system is a planned program of treatments applied throughout the life of a stand (Smith 1962). The silvicultural system should integrate all planned site treatments and methods that will be used to implement the system (Graham 1990). Numerous factors should be considered during its development. Foremost among these are the site and stand conditions that determine the timing of treatments and what treatments are required to meet management objectives.</p>	<h3>Regeneration Methods</h3>	<p>The choice of regeneration method is, in many ways, the most critical decision regarding the entire system. It should be selected carefully and consider all abiotic and biotic elements that might influence forest regeneration and development, but soil properties are especially important. Physical properties of the mineral soil, especially water-holding capacity, can be used to help determine which regeneration method would be the most appropriate (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>). For example, stands located on soils with high amounts of available water would be most suited to the clearcut method and stands on droughty soils with little available water would be more appropriate for selection or heavy shelterwood methods.</p>	<p class="figure">		<em class="bld"><a name="fig1"></a>Figure 1</em>&#8212;Regeneration methods in relation to soil moisture and texture. <a href="graphics/graham_fig1_lg.gif">[view larger image - 56K]</a> <a href="graphics/graham_fig1_txt.html">[Text description of this figure]</a>		<br />		<br />		 <a href="graphics/graham_fig1_lg.gif"><img src="graphics/graham_fig1.gif" alt="Diagram indicates most appropriate regeneration methods in relation to soil moisture and texture." width="500" height="327" border="0" /></a>	</p>	<p>To implement the regeneration method, timber harvesting and harvesting machinery are usually used. Forest managers, for the most part, understand the importance of protecting forest soils from erosion and compaction through the application of careful harvesting techniques dependent on soil type and slope of the harvest unit. Even with this awareness, however, the importance of minimizing total soil disturbance is not always recognized.</p>	<p>In general, cable yarding systems compact and displace less soil than tractor yarding systems. Also, by using cable yarding over snowpacks during the winter, for example, on extremely shallow and sensitive soils, even less soil disturbance occurs (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>). Ground-lead yarding in the summer can cause considerable soil disturbance. This can be very destructive to the critical surface layers of organic matter and shallow mineral soil.</p>	<p class="figure">		<em class="bld"><a name="fig2"></a>Figure 2</em>&#8212;Soil disturbance by depth class (light 0-2 inches, deep 2-10 inches, very deep &gt;10 inches) for ground (GRND) yarding during the summer (SUM), ground yarding during the winter (WIN), cable (CAB) yarding during the summer, and cable yarding during the winter for harvesting operations in British Columbia (Krag and others 1986). <a href="graphics/graham_fig2_lg.gif">[view larger image - 64K]</a> <a href="graphics/graham_fig2_txt.html">[Text description of this figure]</a>		<br />		<br />		 <a href="graphics/graham_fig2_lg.gif"><img src="graphics/graham_fig2.gif" alt="Graph showing the percentage of disturbance produced at various soil depths for different methods of yarding in different seasons." width="500" height="404" border="0" /></a>	</p>	<p>Tractor yarding not only disturbs more soil than cable yarding, it also can compact soil. Compaction occurs not only in the surface layers, but at greater soil depths (Froelich and others 1985). Soil compaction in deep soil layers can be greater and more long-lasting than at the surface because of deep-layer isolation from organic matter and surface litter. Because yarding techniques can displace and compact forest soils, techniques specified in the silvicultural system need to be appropriate for the soils on which they are to be used. Care should always be taken to minimize soil displacement and compaction during any harvesting operation.</p>	<p>As harvesting equipment and processing plants become more efficient, and wood utilization becomes more intensive, greater amounts of fiber are removed from the forest. By removing this material less organic material may be available for incorporation into the soil. Therefore, it will become more critical that sufficient organic material remains after intensive harvesting to provide organic parent material to maintain both short- and long-term productivity.</p>	<h3>Postharvest Treatments</h3>	<p>After the choice of regeneration and harvest methods, fire hazard reduction and site preparation become the most important elements of the silvicultural system. Both natural and artificial regeneration require creating the proper conditions for establishment and growth, usually a compromise. Objectives of site preparation include: exposing mineral soil, creating access for planters, reducing competing vegetation, reducing the incidence of disease, reducing wildfire hazard, minimizing seedling damage, and encouraging early growth. Often when meeting these objectives the factors critical for tree growth (moisture, temperature, light, and nutrition) are not optimized (Graham and others 1989a).</p>	<p>Specific soil characteristics need to be included in system planning. How much or how little soil disturbance is necessary to establish and grow specific forest vegetation? Depending on the forest floor depth and condition of residue, litter, humus, and soil wood, highly variable disturbances may be required for artificial regeneration. Trees can be planted successfully near and through surface organic materials as long as good root-to-soil contact is made and the medium is moist. Likewise, depending on the desired vegetation, very little disturbance may be needed for natural conifer regeneration.</p>	<p>There are three methods of preparing sites for regeneration: mechanical, chemical, and fire. Chemical methods of site preparation are infrequently used in the Inland and Pacific Northwest. When they are used, a good understanding of how they interact with the soil is extremely important. Depending on site and soil characteristics, chemicals can be volatilized, absorbed, leached, or degraded. Therefore, chemical site preparation should be carefully applied and fully integrated into the silvicultural system when it is used (Baumgartner and others 1986).</p>	<p>Tractor piling of logging debris and machine site preparation is used widely throughout the West. Similar to tractor yarding, tractor piling can both compact and disturb soil surface layers (Minore and Weatherly 1988, 1990). The more the disturbance, the greater the loss of surface organic layers. Because tractor piling does impact the soil layers through displacement and compaction, tractor piling of logging debris can adversely affect tree growth (Bosworth 1989). For example, of several young stands measured in western Oregon the majority were growing below their potential after the sites were tractor piled (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>). Likewise, when organic horizons are maintained or enhanced, seedling growth can be improved and long-term site productivity increased (Graham and others 1989b, in press).</p>	<p class="figure">		<em class="bld"><a name="fig3"></a>Figure 3</em>&#8212;A comparison of measured Douglas-fir seedling heights on plantations where slash was broadcast burned.

If burning conditions are optimum when the humus and soil wood are moist and fires do not destroy these materials, nutrients, especially N, can condense in underlying mineral layers when released from the burning litter and other surface materials (Harvey and others 1989). Broadcast burning, if properly applied, can allow stands to grow closer to their potential than tractor-piled stands (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>).</p>	<p class="figure">		<em class="bld"><a name="fig4"></a>Figure 4</em>&#8212;A comparison of measured Douglas-fir seedling heights on plantations where slash was piled and burned.

As mentioned earlier, residue has several properties important for maintaining forest productivity. We recommend leaving a minimum 10 to 15 tons per acre of large woody material (&gt;3 inches in diameter) after timber harvesting and other site treatments (Harvey and others 1987). We are presently refining these recommendations to make them more site specific based on habitat type.</p>	<h3>Intermediate Stand Treatments</h3>	<p>Cleanings, weedings, and thinnings are common intermediate stand treatments used in silvicultural systems. If these operations are mechanized, there is potential to compact and displace soil. Consequently, the same concerns described for harvesting and site preparation treatments, in relation to soil properties, should be evaluated when applying intermediate treatments. Another concern with intermediate treatments is the removal of material that normally would be added to the organic component of soil. Removal of wood material during intermediate treatments and final harvest should be limited and always allow for sufficient woody debris to remain on site to comply with the recommended amount needed to maintain long-term productivity.</p>	<h2>RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>	<p>We have several specific recommendations on how to protect and manage soil when developing prescriptions for any silvicultural system.</p>	<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">  	<li>Consider soil properties such as texture, nutrition, depth, structure, and organic matter content, in all phases of silvicultural system development.<br /><br /></li>  	<li>Be vigilant in protecting the surface OM and mineral layers.			<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">				<li>Use cable systems for yarding when possible and time these operations to minimize soil disturbance.</li>  			<li>Design tractor yarding systems to minimize number of trails and disturbance and do not operate under high moisture conditions.</li>  			<li>Use tractor piling of logging debris judiciously. Grapple piling of debris is preferred.</li>  			<li>Use prescribed fire when possible for fuel reduction and site preparation where necessary. Maintain high moisture content in humus and soil wood when burning.<br /><br /></li>			</ol>		</li>		<li>Prescribe site preparation to meet specific biological objectives for the development of forests and not to meet administrative objectives.<br /><br /></li>  	<li>Make sure that minimum woody residues are maintained on site (10 to 15 tons/acre until more site-specific recommendations can be developed). This is critical as wood utilization intensity is increased.<br /><br /></li>  	<li>Minimize the destruction of either incipient or advance decay forms of residues.<br /><br /></li>  	<li>Do not allow excess fuel accumulations, but protect ecosystems from late-summer  wildfires.</li>	</ol>	<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>	<p>Soil is literally the foundation of ecosystems. It must be protected if forests are going to be sustained and is even more critical when the threats of global climate change and increased acid deposition are contemplated. As soil is the foundation of the ecosystem, the silvicultural system is the foundation of forest management. Therefore, means of protecting soil and all of its properties must be integrated into the silvicultural system if the concepts of new forestry and new perspectives are going to succeed.</p>	<h2>REFERENCES</h2>	<p class="ref">		<strong>Baumgartner, D.
