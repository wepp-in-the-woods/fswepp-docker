	<p><em>&#8220;Not every soil can bear all things&#8221; (Virgil)</em></p>

<p>How we define soil quality is influenced by many factors
including our relationship to the land, what we use it for and how much
of it is available. thus, assessing soil quality is context sensitive, a
fact appreciated early be scientists like Hilgard (1914), who remarked,
&quot;The observers field of vision should be broad enough to embrace concurrently
the several points of view...that must be conjointly considered in forming
one's judgment of the land.&quot; Recently, soil quality has been defined
as the &quot;capability of soil to produce sage and nutritious foods and
crops in a sustainable manner over the king term, and to enhance human and
animal health without adversely impairing the natural resource base or adversely
affecting the environment.&quot; (Parr et al. 1992). this broad view of
the important functional characteristics of soil has helped heighten the
current wave of interest in soil quality until it has emerged as a major
scientific and political topic.</p>
	<p>An important issue is how to evaluate soil quality. A soil quality
index must be more than just an academic exercise because it will be used
to classify land capability, assess of the impact of management practices;
quantify the value of land as a base for taxation or land credit, establish
regulatory compliance, and provide data for monitoring or modeling environmental
change (Parr et al. 1992). Therefore, much effort has been directed toward
identifying which soil properties relate to soil quality (Smith et al. 1993).
Because soil ecosystems are complex, scientists generally agree that evaluating
soil quality will, in some manner, require integration of several kinds
of soil data including physical, chemical and biological properties and
human factors (Parr et al. 1994). However, little effort has been directed
towards understanding how spatial and temporal variability of these indicators
influence a soil quality index.</p>
	<p>The objective of this paper is to emphasize some of the issues of the scale
that relate to soil quality. By issues of scale we mean the interrelationships
between soil quality data and subsequent interpretations that are affected
by spatial and temporal variability. Appreciation of variability is required
in order to define the basic spatial and temporal units for sampling soil
quality indicators and for utilizing indices of soil quality. In the past,
soil scientists have usually needed to consider only a few soil variables
at a single scale. However, estimates of soil quality will integrate many
kinds of data and may be used for different purposes over a broad range
of spatial and temporal scales. Soil quality data must thus be collected
from sampling units that are of a size, shape, orientation and at times
that result in an efficient tradeoff between the gain of useful information
and cost of sampling. Further, these data must be collected so that the
resultant soil quality index is useful and valid at the temporal and spatial
scales of real world applications.</p>

	<h2>The Spatial and Temporal Variability of Soil Quality</h2>

	<p>The patterns of soil quality indicators result from the operation and interaction
of soil forming processes over a continuum of spatial and temporal scales
(Trangmar et al. 1985). Soil variables may appear to vary spatially in well
defined trends or patterns, fluctuate erratically or appear constant depending
on the scale of our measurements (Warrick et al. 1986; Parkin 1993). Spatial
patterns in the soil may be related to varying ecosystems receiving spatially
constant inputs (Odum 1983). [Patterns and processes associated with soil
quality are sometimes divided into those that predominate at the microscale;
(within soil aggregates) the mesoscale, (on the order of meters, also termed
plot scale); and the macroscale, (landscape units at the regional or continent
wide spatial scale (Coleman et al. 1992; Parkin 1993).]</p>
	<p>The temporal patterns of soil variables may appear as well defined long-term
trends, exhibit patterned (cyclic) behavior, fluctuate erratically or appear
constant depending on the temporal scale of measurement. Temporal variation
of soil quality indicators can often be related to cycles of energy and
mass transfer in the environment. In general, there is an inverse relationship
between the amount of temporal variability and the fluctuation frequency
of the environmental cycle. For example, a soil variable, affected by temperature,
is likely to vary less during a daily temperature cycle (high frequency
event) than during a yearly cycle (low frequency event). The variations
in yield from year to year are likely to be less than the variations recorded
during a decade. The apparent temporal variability of a soil quality indicator
may be influenced by its spatial variability (Hammer et al. 1987) and relate
to the spatial scale of the investigation.</p>
	<p>Many soil quality indicators vary significantly over the course of a growing
season including soil physical, chemical and biological properties. The
patterns for different variables may not be correlated with each other or
synchronized with cycles of temperature and precipitation. Temporal patterns
may also be affected by sample depth or soils type. Temporal patterns for
soil quality indicators may persist for only a few hours, weeks, or throughout
an entire growing season if correlated with a deterministic factor such
as soil texture. Very high temporal variability of <em>in situ </em>measurements
suggests that samples need to be collected often or that standardized laboratory
measurements of potential responses will be more appropriate for large-scale,
long-term sampling of soil variables.</p>
	<p>Table 1 lists some relative time scales for soil variables associated with
soil quality. Some of these variables change or operate over a broad range
of time scales. In general, soil variables that can change most dynamically
such as soil moisture, soluble nutrients and soil microbial activity are
correlated with relatively high spatial variability. Soil variables that
change slowly such as soil depth and texture are usually less variable spatially.</p>

	<p>Of great importance to measurements of soil quality is characterization of the time stability of spatial patterns of soil quality indicators. Time stability means that the values of a soil quality indicator remain constant over time or that there is a correlation between the measurements taken at t1 and t2 so that spatial patterns remain the same (Kachanoski and DeJong 1988). A low degree of time stability may be characteristic of soil variables that are strongly influenced by many external factors. The important consequences of soil quality indicators with low time stability is that it makes the task of developing a soil quality index that can be used to monitor long-term changes in soil quality virtually impossible. However, soil variables with low time stability may be the only ones responsive enough to be used to manage crop productivity. Further, low time stability observed at the field scale may appear insignificant if soil quality is measured on large spatial scales.</p>
	<h2>Scale Influences Sampling</h2>
	<p>The variability of soil properties affects the way we sample and the number of samples required to estimate summary statistics such as the mean with a known degree of precision and certainty. Sometimes, the number of samples required can be minimized if it is possible to account for the spatial pattern of the samples (McBatney and Webster 1983). However, without any prior information, about the spatial dependence of each soil variable, random sampling or regular interval sampling will likely be necessary to evaluate soil quality. Soil variables controlled by intrinsic variations in soil characteristics such as texture or mineralogy may exhibit strong spatial dependence when compared to those variables controlled by extrinsic factors such as fertilizer application and tillage. The latter may exhibit spatial dependence at scales smaller than the scale of the study and therefore be undetectable (Cambardella et al. 1994).</p>
	<p>Accurate assessment of soil quality requires a sampling strategy that captures the characteristics of many different soil variables at appropriate spatial and temporal scales. The scale of sampling is important because patterns of soil quality that we are able to detect may change as we move from fine scale to broad scale perspectives. Table 2 contrasts some of the attributes of fine scale sampling of soil quality with those for broader scales. Fine scale is distinguished from broad scale by a relatively large number of samples per unit land area or per unit time.</p>

	<p>Fine scale sampling is most useful for detecting local
details of soil quality with a relatively high amount of resolution. In
contrast, broad-scale sampling is most useful for detecting landscape level
patterns of soil quality with less resolution. Frequent sampling of soil
quality indicator variables allows rapid changes in soil quality to be detected
and is thus useful for monitoring short-term variations in soil quality.
In contrast, long-term trends in soil quality can be monitored with less
frequent samplings. In general, the larger the size of the land area on
which we are interested in measuring soil quality, the longer we will need
to monitor it in order to observe the dynamics of soil quality change (Weins
1989).</p>
	<h2>Scale Influences Data Interpretation and Decision Making</h2>
	<p>Scale influences the way we can use our data to manage land
and formulate policy by affecting the generalizations we are able to make.
If we extrapolate estimates of soil quality beyond the spatial or temporal
boundaries of our sampling we are assuming &quot;a scale-independent uniformitarianism
of patterns and processes (which we know to be false)&quot; (Weins 1989).
This means that samples collected at a fine spatial or temporal scale may
not accurately predict general patterns discernible at broader scales.</p>
	<p>The problem of extrapolating soil quality data to large spatial scales or
time periods may be particularly troublesome because management programs
or remediation actions will likely be applied to much larger areas of land
than the area sampled for soil quality. That is, we tend to sample at much
smaller spatial and temporal scales than we can manage for. If large-scale
management or remediation operations are based on soil quality information
derived from small-sized samples, we may be misled about the statistical
characteristics of soil quality at the scale of the management or remediation
unit, especially for variables with strong skewed distributions (Isaaks
and Srivastava 1989). However, if we rely upon composite samples, we combine
many small samples collected from locations of high and low concentration,
decreasing our ability to detect variability and the proportion and quantity
of samples the will be above (or below) some critical threshold (Weins).
Evaluation of soil quality will also be influenced by patterns of sample
collection especially if soil quality indicators are distributed over the
sampling area in a systematic gradient or a deterministic pattern related
to a factor such as slope or water movement.</p>
	<p>The spatial and temporal scale of soil quality data must also be considered
when contrasting soil quality between sites. Because comparisons between
a small field plot and a large watershed; or between hourly measurements
and annual values would not be particularly useful, comparisons of soil
quality should be made between land units of similar spatial and temporal
scales. Further, direct comparisons of soil quality between sites should
recognize possible inherent differences related to the spatial and temporal
history of each ecosystem. for example, when we compare an agricultural
site to a natural or undisturbed site we compare soils with contrasting
histories, representing conceptually different spatial and temporal scales.
The natural soil is often more representative of near-equilibrium conditions
and landscape level processes (long-term, broad-spatial scale). Conversely,
agriculturally managed soils are typically representative of non-equilibrium,
small-scale conditions because they are actively managed by humans for relatively
short-term productivity. Thus, commonly used concepts like efficiency, may
not mean the same thing in an agricultural system as in natural systems
and direct comparisons of actively managed agricultural soil to unmanaged,
natural soil may not be straight-forward (Granatstein and Bezdicek 1992).</p>
	<p>The spatial and temporal scale of soil quality measurements must thus be
coordinated with needs of decision makers to avoid confusion caused by measuring
soil quality at one scale, and managing it at another. Some of the soil
quality indicator variables now proposed may not prove useful for evaluating
soil quality at the scales of management and policy formation because they
reflect the perspectives and expertise of specialized soil scientists and
methodologies developed for short-term, small-scale research. This bias
is reflected by the observation that many proposed soil quality indicators
can change significantly in 1-3 years and exhibit a relatively high degree
of spatial variability (Doran and Parkin 1994, table 1, table 3). To date,
policy makers and regulatory agencies have had only limited inputs in the
selection of soil quality indicators and design of a sampling strategy even
though they will be the ones to formulate and implement policy.</p>

	<h2>Other Scale Related Problems</h2>
	<p>A suite of variables has been identified to evaluate soil
quality. However, many important questions remain about how to interpret
the relationships between two or more individual variables in a fashion
that accounts for the productivity, environmental and health attributes
of soil quality. Many of the remaining problems relate to spatial and temporal
scales of our measurements or to our interpretations of soil quality.</p>
	<p>A basic issue is determining which soil indicators are most important at
different spatial and temporal scales. We know that some soil quality indicators,
such as mineralizable-N, will be more important for assessing one aspect
of soil quality such as productivity, than environmental quality or human
and animal health. Similarly, the relationship between soil variables and
soil quality may not be the same at all scales of study. Some soil quality
indicators will be better suited for assessing it at the regional scale.
But which ones? Field-scale patterns of soil quality may be most related
to short-term management history or small-scale soil characteristics and
local topography. Conversely, landscape-scale patterns of soil quality may
be most related to long term patterns of climate, parent material, landform
and vegetation.</p>
	<p>Another issue is exactly where and when soil quality should be measured.
We must take care that samples are spatially and temporally related to the
functional attribute of soil quality that they are meant to represent. In
other words, those soil quality measurements related to productivity must
be collected from locations that actually influence the crop at times related
to plant development and management. Soil quality measurements concentrated
at the soil surface might not reflect the conditions in the rooting zone.
Further, soil quality might be judged as good for most of the growing season
but be unacceptable during critical stages of crop development. On the other
hand, evaluating soil quality for environmental attributes might require
measurements collected from the soil surface in order to estimate potential
erosion or runoff of materials into surface water. Soil characteristics
or depths below the rooting zone might be most important for determining
the ability of soil to filter out pollution or serve as a water purifier.</p>
	<p>A third problem is how to account for complex interactions between several
soil quality indicators operating at different spatial and temporal scales.
For example, the potential for trace metal contamination of crops or water
is related not only to the amount of these materials present in the soil,
but also highly dependent on the nature of the soil and on the soil solution
pH. Besides pH, buffering capacity might be important when evaluating the
impacts of heavy metal concentrations in the soil. thus, evaluating soil
quality with respect to metal contamination would require the measurement
of several variables and assessment of their interactions.</p>
	<p>Another set of issues relates to how we view change of soil quality. Our
basic need is to determine whether significant change has occurred and the
rate of change. However, to detect change of soil quality requires that
we view soil ecosystems from an appropriate spatial and temporal scale.
Some soil quality indicators such as pH, mineralizable-N or soil microbial
biomass can change rapidly; making them useful for determining fine-scale
variations in soil quality during the course of a growing season but less
useful for monitoring large-scale trends. Other soil quality indicators
such as soil texture or organic matter change much more slowly making them
unsuitable for assessing changes in seasonal crop productivity but appropriate
for monitoring long-term trends in yield potential or for assessing changes
in environmental or health attributes. One important implication of selecting
soil quality indicators that change rapidly is that they will need to be
measured often in order to distinguish between trends and very small scale
variability.</p>
	<p>We also need to understand how changes in individual soil quality indicators
relate to changes in overall soil quality. Will an increase or decrease
in a particular soil quality indicator be associated with a corresponding
linear change in soil quality? Will a change in soil quality observed at
a fine scale, be a good predictor of change in soil quality at a larger
scale? Also important are the cumulative impacts of improvements or degradations
in soil quality. Small changes in soil quality may prove significant if
viewed on a large enough spatial scale or over a long enough period of time.
Finally, how should we evaluate soil quality when significant changes of
several soil quality indicators are detected, but in opposite directions?
In reality, soil quality is the net result of ongoing aggradation and degradation
processes that combine to influence plant productivity, environmental quality,
food safety and quality and the environment. The simultaneous interaction
of soil quality indicator variables will challenge our view of the structure
and function of the soil and deter us from defining soil quality based on
one or two narrow aspects of soils. For example, in the Pacific Northwest
wheat growing region, controlling soil erosion has been a main focus of
soils research and extension for the last 60 years. Little attention has
been given to the declining soil pH due to the use of ammonium based fertilizers
or soil compaction from use of heavy equipment. thus, soil quality in this
region may be viewed as improving from the perspective of erosion control
but declining with respect to pH and compaction. Under the new view of soil
quality, all processes and interactions that affect soil quality would be
considered in producing a net assessment.</p>

	<h2>Concluding Remarks</h2>
	<p>As a holistic or emergent property of the soil ecosystem, soil quality will
exhibit characteristics or behavior not predictable as a simple function
of the individual components (Odum 1983). thus the spatial and temporal
patterns of an integrative estimate of soil quality need not be correlated
to those of any individual soil variable. Some ecologists suggest that natural
phenomena possess inherent scales (Morris 1987; Carlile et al. 1989; Wiens
1989). However, sampling on &#8220;natural&#8221; scales to estimate soil
quality will be of little value if the resulting information does not fit
into a spatial and temporal framework useful to humans.</p>
	<p>Evaluating soil quality for specialized land uses like hazardous waste storage
will require detailed, small-scale, site specific information as well as
some measure of the reliability of the soil quality estimate. Such small-scale
estimates must also be evaluated within the context of the other relatively
large-scale phenomena like drainage or precipitation patterns. For a farmer,
concerned mainly with crop productivity, soil quality must be assessed on
the spatial scale less than or equal to the size of a single field during
a time period less than or equal to a single growing cycle. Farm management
decisions will require less than or equal to the entire farm unit within
the temporal context of annual yield cycles or rotation schedules. Environmental
monitoring will require that soil quality be assessed over large enough
land areas and for long enough periods of time to be able to identify trends
at the scale of a management unit. Integrative national environmental policy
may require soil quality estimates at scales comparable to those for air
and water quality. Such estimates may exceed local jurisdictional and natural
boundaries but might also be constrained to scales influenced by political
and economic cycles.</p>
	<p>A functional soil quality index can only be developed if we recognize that
quality is a relative term, dependent upon the intended function of the
soil and the spatial and temporal scale of reference.</p>
