Soil compaction and flattening can result in decreased water infiltration. Disturbance of cryptobiotic soil crusts can lead to increased albedo with possible decreased precipitation, accelerated soil loss through wind and water erosion, and decreased diversity and abundance of soil biota. In addition, nutrient cycles can be altered through lowered nitrogen and carbon inputs and slowed decomposition of soil organic matter, resulting in lower nutrient levels in associated vascular plants. Ecosystems within the Monument are especially vulnerable due to the paucity of surface rooting vascular plants for soil stabilization, lower numbers of nitrogen-fixing higher plants, and lower soil temperatures which slow nutrient cycles. Recovery of desert soils from surface disturbance can be slow, leaving systems vulnerable to degradation. Recovery from compaction and decreased soil stability is estimated to take several hundred years. Reestablishment rates for soil bacterial and fungal populations are not known. Recovery rates of soil's nitrogen fixation capability is at least 50 years. Recovery of crusts can be hampered by large amounts of moving sediment, and reestablishment can be extremely difficult in some areas. Given the sensitivity of these resources and slow recovery times, soil and nutrient cycles in the Monument's ecosystems are at high risk from many user groups.</p>	<p class="subsection">Most arid and semiarid lands of the United States have been heavily impacted by human use since the late 1800's. Historically, most of this impact has been from livestock grazing near areas with forage and water. More recently, substantial increases in off-road vehicle and hiking activity have greatly expanded direct and indirect human impacts, both spatially and temporally. The combination of recreational use and livestock grazing is resulting in unprecedented levels of local and regional disturbances.</p>	<p>Many resources in arid ecosystems are sensitive to compressional and shear forces associated with current uses. Soils in arid regions are often highly erodible, and soil formation is extremely slow, taking 5,000 to 10,000 years or more (Dregne, 1983a). Low levels of organic matter, large particle size ranges, and shallow soil freezing depths generally found in these soils result in compactible soils with slow dilation rates. Compaction of soils results in less water infiltration and less locally available water (Webb, 1983; Wilshire, 1983) which in turn influence soil biota activity, nitrogen (N) cycle dynamics (Torbert and Wood, 1992), vascular plant vigor and reproduction (Crawford, 1979; Skujins, 1984) and decomposition rates of soil organic matter (West, 1981). Soil aggregates and pore space, which are important for soil stability, for infiltration, and as microenvironments for soil biota, are reduced by compaction (Dregne, 1983a; Stolzy and Norman, 1961). Surface cyanobacterial-lichen soil crusts are also impacted by soil surface disturbance. In the western United States, these crusts are important for increased soil stability, water infiltration, and fertility of soils Belnap and Gardner, 1993; Belnap and Gillette, in press a, b; Harper and Marble, 1988; Johansen, 1993; Metting, 1991). Absence of these crusts can lead to increased erosion, resulting in loss of organic matter, fine soil particles, nutrients, and microbial populations in soils (Harper and Marble, 1988; Schimel et al., 1985).</p>	<p>Normal nutrient cycles in these semiarid regions can also be disrupted by soil surface disturbance. Nitrogen is often limiting in desert systems (Zak and Whitford, 1988). Cyanobacterial-lichen soil crusts have been shown to be the dominant source of nitrogen in a cold-desert pinyon-juniper and a grassland ecosystem in southern Utah (Evans and Ehleringer, 1993; Evans and Belnap, in press). Experiments have demonstrated that all types of surface disturbance tested dramatically decreased nitrogenase activity in these crusts (Belnap et al., 1994). Plants growing on undisturbed sites consistently show higher N content when compared to adjacent disturbed sites (Belnap and Harper, 1995; Harper and Pendleton, 1993).</p>	<p>Cyanobacterial-lichen soil crusts are also an important source of fixed carbon for these sparsely vegetated areas (Beymer and Klopatek, 1991). In addition, soil disturbance can alter soil food webs and thereby affect nutrient availability in these systems (Ingham et al., 1989). Disruptions of soil food webs can reverberate throughout the ecosystem, affecting macrofloral and faunal components (Hendrix et al., 1992; Coleman et al., 1992). Plant community composition and architecture can also be affected by soil surface disturbance. Changes in these critical habitat components have been shown to affect invertebrate and vertebrate populations (MacMahon, 1987).</p>	<h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>	<h3>Study Sites</h3>	<ul>		<li>Arches National Park: Arches is located approximately 16 km north of Moab, Utah at 1370 m elevation. Rainfall is approximately 200 mm annually. A heavily trampled area was compared with an adjacent, relatively undisturbed area. Both sites are on Arches loamy fine sand with similar depth, slope, inclination, and exposure. The dominant vegetation is <em class="ital">Coleogyne ramosissima</em> (blackbrush]. Plant interspaces in the untrampled area are covered with well-developed cyanobacterial-lichen crust.</li>		<li>Behind-the-Rocks: Situated on Rizno fine sandy loam at 1400 m, this site is located 15 km south of Moab, Utah. Rainfall is approximately 200 mm annually. This site is dominated by <em class="ital">C. ramosissima</em>. Undisturbed soils are covered by a cyanobacterial crust similar to that at the Arches untrampled site.</li>		<li>Natural Bridges National Monument: The Monument is located 73 miles southwest of Moab at 1980 m elevation. Annual rainfall is approximately 300 mm, A trampled site was compared to an area 200 m away that had received little trampling. Both sites are on Rizno fine sandy loam of similar depth, slope, inclination and exposure, dominated by <em class="ital">Pinus edulis</em> and <em class="ital">Juniperus utahensis</em>.</li>		<li>Canyonlands National Park: Located 31 miles south of Moab at 1513 m elevation, these two study sites are in adjacent grasslands. Both have sandy loam soils (Mido and Begay) with similar soil depth, slope, exposure. Both sites are dominated by the grasses <em class="ital">Stipa hymenoides</em> and <em class="ital">S. comata</em> (Kleiner and Harper, 1977). Rainfall averages 180 mm annually.</li>	</ul>	<h3>Analyses</h3>	<p>Five randomly located transect lines were placed in each area at the Arches study site. Ground and vegetation cover were estimated with twenty 0.25-m<sup>2</sup> quadrats per transect using a nested frequency quadrat frame, Daubenmire cover classes, and density counts. All perennial plants were mapped. For those shrubs intersecting the transect line, distance from nearest neighbor and hummock height was estimated. Hummock height was estimated as the height at which a rod held parallel to the surface from the base of the shrub intersected a rod held vertically at the lowest point in the interspace between the considered shrub and its nearest neighbor.</p>	<p>Plant tissue elemental content was determined from composite samples comprising at least five individuals of each species. Analysis was done by the Brigham Young University Soil Laboratory. Nitrogenase activity in cyanobacterial crusts was determined by methods outlined in Belnap (1992, 1994). Soil biota were sampled at 0&#8211;10 cm, the depth at which maximum bacterial, fungal, and nematode biomass was found. Nematodes, total and active bacteria, microarthropods, and total and active fungal biomass were evaluated following methods outlined in Ingham et al. (1989).</p>	<p>Soil physical characteristics were determined for cores 0-10 cm deep. Soils were analyzed by the Brigham Young University Soils Laboratory. Soil depth was determined with a metal probe. Compaction was measured with a recording penetrometer and bulk density measurements. Soil temperatures were taken midday on five occasions between June and July 1994. Measurements were taken with a 1-mm-wide probe inserted just under the soil surface. Results were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), Duncan's multiple range test, and unpaired t-tests.</p>	<h2>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</h2>	<h3>Soil Physical Characteristics</h3>	<p>Soils at the trampled and untrampled sites in Arches were very similar (<a href="#table1">Table 1</a>). Percent clay, silt, and organic matter were low at both sites and did not differ significantly. There were no statistically significant differences in zinc, iron, manganese, copper, total nitrogen, potassium, magnesium, or sodium levels. There were small, but significant differences in pH and percent sand. There were larger, significant dfferences in phosphorus (P) and calcium.</p>	<p>Bulk density and soil porosity were compared in the two areas. Bulk density was found to be significantly higher at 0-3- and 3-6-cm depths in the trampled area than in the untrampled area. Soil porosity was not significantly different at 0-3-cm depth between the two areas, but was significantly lower at 3-6-cm depth in the trampled area when compared to the untrampled area. Increasing bulk density often results in lower microbial populations and lower activity levels (Torbert and Wood, 1992). In addition, increased bulk density generally results in less water infiltration and increased runoff (Webb and Wilshire, 1980; Loope and Gifford, 1972). Decreased water availability locally can lead to increased water stress for plants, thereby accelerating desertification processes (Dregne, 1983b).</p>		<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" border="1" width="560" class="figuretbl">			<caption><strong>TABLE 1</strong><a name="table1">&nbsp;</a><br />    Soil physical characteristics of disturbed and undisturbed areas at Arches National Park</caption>			<thead>				<tr>					<th>&nbsp;</th>					<th scope="col" id="t1-c2">Undisturbed<br />Mean</th>					<th scope="col" id="t1-c3">Undisturbed<br />Std.

site, soil surfaces were compared between the trampled and untrampled sites (<a href="#table2">Table 2</a>). Cover of plant litter, lichens, mosses, and cyanobacteria was significantly higher in the untrampled area. The untrampled area had 32 percent litter cover, contrasted with only 8 percent litter cover in the trampled area. While six species of lichens and four species of cyanobacteria were found in the untrampled area, only one species of cyanobacteria was found in the trampled area. Lichens and mosses combined covered 39 percent of the surface in the untrampled area; in trampled areas, they covered 4 percent. Lichen and moss species had a combined frequency four times greater in the untrampled than the trampled area. Trampled interspace surfaces were generally flat, whereas untrampled interspace surfaces supported cyanobacterial pedicels up to 7 cm high.</p>		<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" border="1" width="560" class="figuretbl">			<caption><strong>TABLE 2</strong><a name="table2">&nbsp;</a><br />Biological characteristics at Arches National Park in disturbed and undisturbed areas.

important roles in protection of soil surfaces from water and wind erosion, and in enhanced water infiltration. The combination of litter, vascular plant, lichen, and moss cover, left virtually no surfaces exposed to wind or water erosion in the untrampled area, whereas most of the interspace in the trampled area had little, if any, protection. Surfaces trampled flat promote sheet erosion. Untrampled, pedicelled surfaces create microcatchments for water and reduce velocity of surface water flows, thus encouraging suspended sediments to settle out (Harper and Marble, 1988). Consequently, trampling can greatly accelerate desertification processes through increased soil loss and water runoff (Dregne, 1983b).</p>	<p>As cyanobacteria move through the soil, they leave behind polysaccharide material that firmly adheres to soil particles, even when dry or no longer associated with a living cyanobacterium [<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). Sheath material can absorb up to eight times its weight in water, increasing the water-holding capacity of the soil (Brock, 1975; Campbell, 1979; Campbell et al., 1989). In addition, nutrient-rich clay particles adhere to sheath material, thus increasing the fertility of soils (Belnap and Gardner, 1993; Belnap and Harper, 1995). Soil crusts can also affect higher plant seedling establishment and survival. Experiments with fine and coarsely textured soils demonstrated that seedling establishment was higher for forbs and grasses in crusted areas than uncrusted areas. Survival over a 3-year period was enhanced in two species and unaffected in one species. Overall plant survival was three times higher in the crusted plots (Belnap, 1994). Other studies have reported similar enhancement of seedling germination and establishment in crusted areas when compared to noncrusted surfaces (Harper and Marble, 1988; St. Clair et al., 1986; Lesica and Shelley, 1992).</p>	<p>Surface disturbance has been shown to negatively affect the cohesion and coverage of cyanobacterial crusts, since crustal components are brittle when dry and easily crushed (Belnap, 1993; Campbell et al., 1989; Harper and Marble, 1988). Surface disturbance also reduces the depth to which abandoned cyanobacterial sheath accumulates, thereby reducing resistance to water erosion. At many disturbed sites, sheath material is often not observed below 1 mm depth, in contrast to 7-cm-thick crusts in untrampled areas. Consequently, impacts to surface crusts can reduce soil stability, soil fertility, and soil moisture retention, thus accelerating desertification in impacted areas (Dregne, 1983b).</p>	<p class="figure">		<em class="bld"><a name="fig1"></a>Figure 1</em>&#8212;A scanning electron micrograph of dry cyanobacterial sheaths winding through sandy soils from Moab, Utah.

Studies have demonstrated that nitrogen fixed by soil cyanobacteria is available to neighboring vascular plants under laboratory conditions (Mayland et al., 1966; Mayland and McIntosh, 1966). In some desert systems, these crusts have been demonstrated to be the dominant source of this often-limiting element (Evans and Ehleringer, 1993).</p>	<p>Nitrogenase activity was dramatically reduced in soil crusts regardless of the type of experimentally applied disturbance (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>) Belnap et al., 1994; Belnap, 1996). Disturbance by human feet, mountain bikes, four-wheel drive trucks, tracked vehicles (tanks), and shallow and deep raking all resulted in an immediate 40&#8211;80 percent reduction in nitrogenase activity. Measurements at 6&#8211;9 months posttreatment showed that nitrogenase activity had dropped still lower in the disturbed areas, with treatments showing an 80&#8211;100 percent reduction (Belnap et 1994). At the Arches trampled site, no nitrogenase activity could be detected, while the undisturbed site showed normal nitrogenase activity. Because disturbance generally increases nitrogen losses through enhanced denitrification and accelerated soil erosion (Peterjohn and Schlesinger, 1990), less nitrogen input often results in less total nitrogen for the ecosystem. Reduced fertility of systems is one of the most definitive, and problematic, aspects disturbed of desertification (Dregne, 1983b).</p>	<p class="figure">		<em class="bld"><a name="fig2"></a>Figure 2</em>&#8212;Percent reduction of nitrogenase activity after soil surface disturbances were experimentally applied.

Nutrient uptake rates can be affected by the ability of bacteria to solubilize and/or chelate elements (Lange, 1974). Symbiotic fungi can increase a plant's ability to exploit more soil volume, as well as increasing spatial distribution of carbon in soils. Carbon- and nitrogen-fixing soil microbiota contribute to site fertility. Larger microbial populations mean greater retention of N, P, and other nutrients bound up in microbial biomass (Skujins, 1984). Bacteria are known to secrete IAA and other plant growth regulators. Both bacteria and fungi secrete polysaccharide material that acts to aggregate soil particles (Lange, 1974). The presence of bacteria and fungi can also affect vascular plant root morphology (Skujins, 1984).</p>	<p>Ratios of microbes vary in different systems. Shrub-dominated systems generally have relatively higher fungal numbers to decompose more recalcitrant woody litter, while grass systems have relatively more bacteria. Disturbance often shifts these ratios. Both the blackbrush community at Arches and the pinyon-juniper community at Natural Bridges resulted in stimulation of bacterial activity, and a depression in fungal activity. Since different soil biota process litter differently, such a shift in soil food web structure or relative activity levels can significantly lower litter decomposition rates, lower nutrient availability to systems, and thus increase desertification rates.</p>	<p>Predators, such as nematodes and microarthropods, are an essential part of the soil food web as well. These organisms play important roles in decomposition cycles by shredding litter, mixing soil layers, and carrying litter underground. They act as dispersers of other soil microorganisms. They can modify soil pH and contribute N, P, and other nutrients to soils through fecal material and release of nutrients bound up in microbial biomass. They also influence soil food web structure through preferential predation on other soil organisms. Lowering of microarthopod numbers, and alteration of population structure, can significantly lower decomposition rates, and again accelerate the desertification process (Zak and WhitFord, 1988; Santos and Whitford, 1981 ; Seastedt and Crossley, 1984; Kitchell et al., 1979).</p>	<h3>Nutrient Levels in Vascular Plants</h3>	<p>Concentrations of nitrogen and other macronutrients in annual, biennial, and perennial plants were found to be significantly higher when the plants were growing on undisturbed crusted surfaces compared to on adjacent trampled areas at all study sites tested (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). At Arches, leaf tissue N in the untrampled area was 9 percent higher in the perennial shrub <em class="ital">Coleogyne</em>, 31 percent higher in the perennial forb <em class="ital">Streptanthella</em>, and 13 percent higher in the annual grass <em class="ital">Festuca</em>. Leaf tissue content of N in the biennial <em class="ital">Mentzelia multiflora</em> was higher in plants growing in a crusted area relative to plants from an adjacent sand dune at a nearby site in Arches (Belnap and Harper, 1995). The same results were obtained at other field sites around Utah and in greenhouse experiments, where levels of nitrogen in sorghum and rape were higher in pots with cyanobacteria when compared to pots without cyanobacteria. Dry weights of plants in pots with cyanobacteria were up to four times greater than in pots without cyanobacteria (Harper and Pendleton, 1993). Dry weights of <em class="ital">Festuca</em> plants in the untrampled area were two times those of plants in the trampled area (Belnap and Harper, 1995).</p>	<p>Maintaining normal nitrogen cycles is critical to maintaining the fertility of semiarid soils and to preventing desertification (Dregne, 1983b). After water, nitrogen is generally considered the element most likely to limit primary productivity in semiarid and arid ecosystems (Ettershank et al., 1978; Romney et al., 1978).</p>	<h3>Vascular Plant Community Structure</h3>	<p>Plant community composition and structure were examined at the Arches trampled site and compared to a nearby untrampled area, and many significant differences were observed. Fewer larger individuals of the dominant shrub <em class="ital">Coleogyne ramosissima</em> were found in the trampled area when compared to the untrampled area. Shrubs dominated the interspace of the undisturbed area, whereas annuals or perennial bulbs (with aboveground parts only in the spring) dominated the interspace in the trampled area. Exotic grasses contributed significantly to grass cover in the trampled area, whereas the untrampled area had only a few exotic plant individuals.</p>	<p class="figure">		<em class="bld"><a name="fig3"></a>Figure 3</em>&#8212;Nitrogen levels in vascular plant tissue from sites around the State of Utah, USA.

Consequently, more soil is exposed to erosion in the trampled area. In addition, small animals face crossing an average of 4.8 m between <em class="ital">Coleogyne</em> plants in the trampled area, compared to 2.0 m in the untrampled area, resulting in higher exposure to predation. The trampled area also had only small annual plants in the interspaces, instead of perennials such as <em class="ital">Opuntia polycantha</em> that might offer additional protective cover. Changes in plant community architecture has been shown to affect populations of invertebrates and vertebrates living in these communities (MacMahon, 1987). As a result, trampling may have many as yet undocumented effects on semiarid and arid landscapes that increase their susceptibility to desertification.</p>	<h3>Surface Albedo and Temperature</h3>	<p>Albedo is also of concern in semiarid and arid systems. When trampled surfaces were compared to untrampled surfaces, there was up to a 50 percent increase in reflectance from 0.25 to 2.5 &#181;m (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>). This represents a change in the surface energy flux of approximately 40 watts/m<sup>2</sup> (Roger Clark, USGS, pers. comm.) Large acreages of trampled areas, combined with lack of urban areas to offset this energy loss, could lead to changes in regional climate patterns in many semiarid regions (Sagan et al., 1979).</p>	<p class="figure">		<em class="bld"><a name="fig4"></a>Figure 4</em>&#8212;Reflectance of bare sand and <em class="ital">Microcoleus</em>-dominated soil surfaces.

Midday temperatures were taken in June and July, 1994. Air temperatures were found to average 39&#176;C (S.D. 0.25&#176;C), bare sand 52&#176;C (S.D O.5&#176;C), and dark crusted surfaces 62&#176;C (S.D. 1.O&#176;C). These differences were all significant. In the winter, surface temperatures of well-developed crusts were up to 14&#176;C higher than ambient air temperature.</p>	<p>Surface temperatures can be very important in desert systems. Nitrogenase activity is heavily temperature-dependent, with lower temperatures resulting in lowered activity levels (Rychert et al., 1978). Altered soil temperatures can be expected to affect microbial activity, plant nutrient uptake rates, and soil water evaporation rates. Sod temperatures have been shown to affect seed germination time and seedling growth rates for vascular plants. Timing of these events is often critical in deserts, and relatively small delays can reduce species fitness and seedling establishment, which may eventually affect community structure (Bush and Van Auken, 1991). Food and other resources are often partitioned among ants, arthropods, and small mammals on the basis of surface-temperature-controlled foraging times (Doyen and Tschinkel, 1974; Crawford, 1991; Wallwork, 1982). Many small desert animals are weak burrowers, and soil surface microclimates are of great importance to their survival (Larmuth, 1978). Consequently, altering surface temperatures can affect nutrient availability and community structure for many desert organisms, thus increasing susceptibility to desertification.</p>	<h3>Recovery from Surface Disturbance</h3>	<p>Some work has been done to estimate recovery rates of soil disturbances in arid systems. Recovery of soils from compaction has been estimated to require 100&#8211;130 years in the Great Basin (Knapp, 1992) and 80&#8211;140 years in the Mojave Desert (Webb and Wilshire, 1980). Recovery rates of soil biota are expected to be slow, given slow recovery of soil porosity, moisture-dependent microbial activity in a dry environment, limited dispersal ability, naturally low microbial populations, and large disturbance areas.</p>	<p>Much more is known about the recovery rates of cyanobacterial-lichen soil crusts. Recovery rates have been found to depend on the type and extent of disturbance, on the availability of nearby inoculation material, as well as on the temperature and moisture regimes that follow disturbance events. Estimates of time for visually assessed recovery have varied from 5 to 100 years (Anderson et al., 1982; Jeffries and Klopatek, 1987; Callison et al., 1985; Cole, 1990). However, Belnap (1993) showed that many components of recovery cannot be assessed visually. Assuming linear recovery rates, recovery was estimated to be 35&#8211;65 years for cyanobacterial biomass, 45&#8211;85 years for lichen cover, and 250 years for moss cover in scalped 0.25 m<sup>2</sup> plots surrounded by well-developed crusts. Since recovery time is dependent on presence of nearby inoculant, larger disturbed areas will take longer to recover. Several studies have demonstrated that inoculation can hasten the biological recovery of disturbed crusts (Tidemann et al., 1980; Ashley and Rushforth, 1984; Belnap, 1993).</p> 	<p>Nitrogenase activity recovery appears to be quite slow. In scalped areas, no nitrogenase activity was detectable after 9 years, and N content of soils was still much lower when compared to adjacent control plots. In areas disturbed with four-wheel drive activity, no recovery could be documented after 2 years (Belnap, 1996). Using isotopic ratios of N, soil and plant N and nitrogenase activity levels were found to be significantly lower in an area that had been released from livestock grazing for 30 years when compared to an area that was never grazed. These data suggest that negative effects on nitrogen dynamics may persist in systems for extended periods of time after disturbance ceases. This slow recovery from disturbance indicates that this system is vulnerable to desertification.</p>	<p>Restoration of normal surface albedos and temperatures will depend on the restoration of cyanobacteria, lichens, and mosses. While cyanobacteria form a dark matrix in which other components are embedded, dark mosses and lichens contribute up to 40 percent of the cover in an undisturbed crust (Belnap, 1993). Consequently, recovery of surface albedo characteristics in severely disturbed areas could take up to 250 years for even very small areas.</p>	<p>Different deserts may show very different resistance and resilience to surface disturbances. Some characteristics of deserts suggest that these ecosystems probably evolved with low levels of soil surface disturbance by ungulates. These characteristics include the presence of cryptobiotic soil crust, the morphology and phenology of perennial bunch grasses found in these deserts, and the dominance of C<sub>3</sub> grasses (Mack and Thompson, 1982). Some deserts, such as those found in the Colorado Plateau biogeographic province, may have also evolved with low levels of microdisturbance such as those created by soil and surface invertebrates, and thus depend more heavily on soil surface integrity for natural ecosystem functioning. As a result, these deserts may be more negatively affected by soil surface disturbances than deserts that evolved with higher levels of surface disturbance.</p>	<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>	<p>Thirty percent of the landscapes in the United States are semiarid or arid. Preventing desertification of these areas requires maintaining the sustainability and productivity of the ecosystems contained within these areas. Because most current land use practices involve extensive impacts to soil surfaces, it is critical that we understand the short- and long-term effects of such impacts on nutrient cycles and soil food webs in these ecosystems. It is apparent from the data presented here that nutrient cycles in deserts can be extremely sensitive to soil surface disturbances. Nitrogen cycles may be at the greatest risk from current land use practices. Input of available nitrogen from atmospheric and parent material sources is extremely low in arid regions, and these systems are generally dependent on biologically fixed nitrogen and nitrogen released from the decomposition of organic matter. The above data indicate that both of these input pathways are threatened by soil surface disturbances. Because nitrogen loss is a continuous process, understanding factors that decrease the input or availability of nitrogen is of critical importance to maintaining the sustainability of arid systems (Peterjohn and Schlesinger, 1990).</p>	<p>Preventing soil loss is another major challenge in these areas. Many semiarid and arid areas rely on soil surface cyanobacteria for stability, and current land uses are impacting large acreages of this resource (Belnap, pers. obs.). In addition, loss of diversity of processes and species results from current types of soil surface disturbance. The sensitivity of the semiarid and arid lands of the western United States to these impacts, combined with the low resiliency of these systems, indicate that they are at risk. In managing these areas, it is important to conserve the fertility and stability of soil resources.</p>	<h2>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h2>	<p>Greg Swayze and Roger Clark provided albedo data; Dave Evans conducted the isotopic analyses; Nancy Stanton provided nematode analysis; Andy Moldenke provided microarthropod identifications; Danielle Tilford, Gary Gurtler, and Cindy Furman provided field and technical assistance; and Kimball Harper and Elaine Ingham provided helpful comments and discussion.
