	<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
	<p>This paper reports on a process for selecting a suite of indicators that, in combination, can be useful in assessing the ecological conditions of rangelands. Conceptual models that depict the structural and functional properties of ecological processes were used to show the linkages between ecological components and their importance in assessing the status and trends of ecological resources on a regional scale. Selection criteria were developed so that relationships could be assessed at different spatial scales using ground and aerial measurements. Parameters including responsiveness and sensitivity to change, quality assurance and control, temporal and spatial variability, cost-effectiveness and statistical design played an important role in determining how indicators were selected. A total of ten indicator categories were selected by a committee of scientists for evaluation in the program. A subset that included soil properties, vegetation composition and abundance, and spectral properties was selected for evaluation in a pilot test conducted in 1992 in the Colorado Plateau region of the southwestern United States. This work is part of a major effort being undertaken by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and its collaborators to assess the condition of rangelands (primarily comprised of arid, semi-arid and dry subhumid ecosystems) along with seven other ecosystem groups (forests, agricultural lands, wetlands, surface waters, landscapes, estuaries and Great Lakes) as part of a national Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP). The indicator selection process reported upon was developed to support EMAP's goal of providing long-term, policy-relevant research focusing on evaluating the ecological condition (or health) of regional and national resources.</p>
	<h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
	<p>Assessing the condition of rangelands in the United States presents numerous challenges because of their vast diversity in structure, extent, composition, difficult access, harsh environment associated with temperature extremes and rugged topography, and our limited knowledge of how they collectively operate. Within the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and its collaborators have accepted this challenge to assess the condition of rangeland health and will be collaborating with seven other EMAP resource groups (forests, agricultural lands, wetlands, surface waters, near-coastal, Great Lakes, and landscapes) as part of a national Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP). This program is designed to provide scientists and policy makers with sound scientific data in a timely manner that can be used to assess how current policy, management strategies, and natural events are influencing the condition of the ecological resources in the U.S. Indicators of condition are important and used to evaluate changes in ecosystem processes on a large scale in a timely and cost-effective manner. EMAP is in the process of being implemented in the contiguous 48 states of the U.S. The statistical design lends itself for use on a regional, continental, or global scale (White et al., 1992).</p>
	<p>Rangelands are generally defined as land on which the native vegetation (climax or natural potential) is predominantly grasses, grass-like plants, forbs, or shrubs suitable for grazing or browsing use (SRM, 1989). Rangelands include natural grasslands, savannahs, shrublands, most deserts, and alpine tundra.</p>
	<p>Rangelands in the conterminous U.S. account for about 34% of the land and occupy much of the land surface area (excluding high-elevation forests) west of 95&#176;W longitude (Box, 1989), additionally they include grasslands of the eastern U.S. Historically, dramatic urbanization and overexploitation of natural resources have resulted in rapid degradation, i.e. the decline or loss of productivity and biodiversity due to certain natural phenomena and man-induced stresses (Bender, 1982). Once these ecosystems are degraded significantly, they are generally unlikely to return to their prior state and hence are often termed fragile because they exhibit little resistance and resilience in the face of anthropogenic impact (UCAR, 1991). Desertification, biodiversity, water resource management, air quality, and global climatic change and certain uses such as grazing, recreation, urbanization, mining etc. have been identified as regionally important issues that affect the sustainability of rangelands (Kepner and Fox, 1991).</p>
	<p>The goal of the EMAP Rangeland Resource Group is to provide an unbiased estimate, with known confidence, of the current and changing conditions of natural resources in arid, semi-arid, and subhumid ecosystems and their extent at the regional and national level.</p>
	<p>EMAP has been designed by the U.S. EPA as a multi-agency collaborative effort to address the following objectives:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Estimate the current status, trends, and changes in selected indicators of the condition of the nation's ecological resources on a regional basis with known confidence.</li>
		<li>Estimate the geographic coverage and extent of the nation's ecological resources with known confidence.</li>
		<li>Seek associations between selected indicators of natural and anthropogenic stresses and indicators of the condition of ecological resources.</li>
		<li>Provide annual statistical summaries and periodic assessments of the nation's ecological resources.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>2. DEVELOPMENT OF THE EMAP RANGELAND RESOURCE GROUP MONITORING EFFORT</h2>
	<p>One of the initial steps within the program was the selection of environmental values of concern to our U.S. society along with relevant assessment questions related to these values. The EMAP Rangeland Resource Group identified a number of regional issues and criticial assessment questions related to rangeland condition. Input was sought from scientists and managers from numerous federal agencies (U.S. Bureau of Land Management, National Biological Survey, National Park Service, Forest Service, Soil Conservation Service, Fish and Wildlife Service), universities, research institutes, and public interest groups. These issues and questions were linked with societal values that have both social and biological relevance; and indicators were identified (using the process discussed later) that could be integrated to evaluate the status and trends in the condition of rangelands. This approach is illustrated using a conceptual framework that links the indicators to the monitoring questions (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>). Three overall societal values have been identified as focal points for the EMAP Rangeland Resource Group: (1) productivity, (2) biological integrity, and (3) aesthetics.</p>

	</p>

	<p>Productivity has been defined by the EMAP Rangeland Resource Group as the quantity and quality of ecological and consumptive services or products provided by rangelands and their capacity for long-term maintenance. Key regional issues related to productivity in rangelands are desertification and climate change. Desertification is considered a form of land degradation which results mainly from adverse human impact (UNEP, 1991) in arid, semi-arid, and dry subhumid lands. Desertification is considered by the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) to be one of the major environmental problems of this century and affects nearly 35% of the global land surface and almost one fifth of the world human population, including western North America. Desertification in North America is typically accompanied by a change in species composition, a general loss of biomass, loss of soil nutrients with remaining nutrients concentrated under shrubs, and increased removal of soil materials by wind and water erosion &#8211; all of which contribute to a loss of productivity of the ecosystem (Schlesinger <em class="ital">et al.</em>, 1990; Grover and Musick, 1990).</p>
	<p>Because productivity can be defined in numerous ways for different purposes, a more detailed list of assessment questions was developed to identify the main issues of concern and focus study objectives. To support EMAP's goal of being policy relevant and useful to multiple governmental agencies, the private sector, and the general public, data will be collected to address issues such as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>extent and distributions of a resource class on a regional scale;</li>
		<li>proportion in different productivity categories;</li>
		<li>changes or trends between and among productivity categories; and</li>
		<li>soil quality (e.g. carbon/nitrogen ratio, erosion) and its association with selected indicators of stress.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The goal of EMAP's rangeland effort is to combine existing and newly acquired data into an assessment that can answer policy and research questions. This information can then be used by land managers to prioritize expenditure of resources to enhance sustainability of rangelands.</p>
	<p>Similar types of issues and assessments are being generated to more clearly
define concerns related to biological integrity and aesthetics, but will only be summarized here.</p>
	<p>Biological integrity refers to species composition, structure (abundance and spatial arrangement), and associated functions (ecological processes) at various levels of biological organization (i.e. genetic, species, population, community, ecosystem and regional landscape). The preservation of biological integrity relative to natural resources (e.g. food, medicine, shelter) and ecological services (e.g, climate moderation, water and nutrient cycling, and breakdown of wastes) is considered an issue of global importance (Noss, 1990; West, 1993). Significant changes in composition, structure, or function can ultimately result in ecological and economical consequences. Aesthetics as a societal value of EMAP's Rangeland Resource Group can be broadly defined as attributes that affect human perception and appreciation of the environment. Many people value rangeland systems not only for their ecological and productivity roles, but also for their beauty.</p>
	<p>The quality of life in rangeland systems also depends on air quality, water quality and quantity, and many other things. As EMAP's rangeland effort develops, these other values will be identified, along with assessment questions and indicators to monitor their status and trends.</p>
	<p>Following selection of values and assessment questions, the EMAP Rangeland Resource Group evaluated and selected a system for classifying vegetation. This was critical because, in order to meet the objectives, a consistent classification system was needed that would be robust, and allow for trend analysis across large regions. Numerous classification systems based upon land use, ecoregions, life zones, biotic provinces, biomes, and/or biogeographical regions were evaluated (Smith, 1990). The EMAP Rangeland Resource Group selected a hierarchical biogeographic approach to vegetation classification for North America (Brown <em class="ital">et al.</em>, 1979). The Brown <em class="ital">et al.</em> classification system was selected because it incorporates the structural classification of vegetation (i.e. classes) with climate considerations (e.g. seasonality of precipitation and temperature). This classification system is allowing EMAP Rangeland scientists to report on the extent and trends within at least eight resource classes (i.e. biomes), within seven biogeographical provinces of Nearctic and Neotropical North America. The resource classes include five upland vegetation classes (desertscrub, grassland, scrubland, woodland and alpine tundra) and three lowland vegetation classes (riparian forest, riparian scrub, and xeroriparian). Under full implementation, the EMAP Rangelands effort will also include Alaskan alpine tundra within the arctic desert.</p>
	<h2>3. INDICATOR SELECTION PROCESS</h2>
	<p>Reporting on trends in extent of a resource class is of little use without also collecting data for making statements about condition. EMAP uses an indicator paradigm to make statements on ecological condition. The term indicator is used by the EMAP Rangeland Resource Group to define any expression of the environment that estimates the condition of ecological resources, magnitude of stress, exposure of a biological component to stress, or the amount of change in a condition. Indicators (or measurements that comprise an indicator) are used to address assessment questions concerning societal values (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>). They are used because societal values typically cannot be measured directly (e.g. there is not a measure of biological integrity, but several indicators can be combined to address the value).</p>
	<p>The EMAP Rangeland Resource Group is developing a set of indicators that collectively can describe the range in condition of an ecosystem (Hunsaker <em class="ital">et al.</em> 1990). EMAP is designed to provide statistically representative information about ecosystem condition (White <em class="ital">et al.</em>, 1992). There will be site-specific problems that are overlooked that may need to be addressed by other site-specific efforts and programs; however, the indicators selected for use by the EMAP Rangeland Resource Group are designed to evalute ecological condition on a regional scale and therefore can be valuable in placing local conditions in a larger geographic context. EMAP information will be provided to land managers and decision-makers who can determine if additional action is warranted, particularly if the indicators suggest an ecosystem is in, or trending towards, a subnominal or degraded state.</p>
	<p>Figure 1 represents the indicator framework which demonstrates how ecosystem processes are linked by using indicators to address monitoring questions important to society. More detailed conceptual models (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>) can be used to show how selected ecosystem indicator categories could be linked together. Once the indicator categories were identified, workshops were held and scientists selected indicators that were most suitable to assess the condition of each category (Mouat <em class="ital">et al.</em>, 1992). <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> is an expanded version of <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a> that summarizes results of the workshops. With over 50 indicators, it was obvious that a more detailed selection process was needed to combine these categories and select a feasible subset for pilot testing.</p>

	</p>

	<p>Each indicator category was assigned to a small group of recognized scientists tasked to select important indicators for that category. An evaluation process was developed to ensure consistency in the review by different scientists. The reviewers used the literature and their knowledge to address how well each research indicator addressed the following criteria:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Applicable and readily interpretable across different regions.</li>
		<li>Correlation with change in ecosystem process.</li>
		<li>Temporal and spatial variability.</li>
		<li>Best periods to sample (index period).</li>
		<li>Ability to be quantified by synoptic or automated monitoring.</li>
		<li>Labor, equipment, analytical and data analysis costs.</li>
		<li>Amount and quality of available data.</li>
		<li>Ability to assess shift between ecotones.</li>
		<li>Responsive/sensitive to change.</li>
		<li>Is anticipatory (has early warning potential).</li>
		<li>Degree of environmental impact from sampling.</li>
		<li>Status of method (established vs experimental).</li>
		<li>Cost-effectiveness.</li>
	</ol>

	</p>

	<p>A matrix was developed for comparing research indicators to the above criteria. The process was successful in identifying indicators that could produce data of known quality in a cost-effective and timely manner. The results were presented and discussed at a subsequent workshop. The workshop was designed to encourage discussion between scientists with different disciplines and reach consensus on what should be included in the overall EMAP Rangeland Resource Group monitoring program. Decision by consensus is difficult, but if properly structured can be a useful and effective manner to design an integrated ecosystem monitoring effort among interagency and science community collaborators.</p>
	<p>At the workshop each group of scientists was tasked with developing conceptual models that supported their specific selection of indicators. <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a> is an example of a conceptual model used by the EMAP Rangeland Soil Subcommittee to show short- and long-term physical soil indicators and their relationships to input/output processes. Similar models were either extracted from the literature or developed for each indicator category.</p>
	<p>The following ten indicator categories were selected at the workshop for further evaluation within EMAP.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Spectral properties &#8211; includes albedo arid the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); measured using spectral reflectance and verified with ground measurements.</li>
		<li>Vegetation composition, structure, and above ground biomass &#8211; includes Leaf Area Index (LAI) as a measure of productivity.</li>
		<li>Biogeochemistry &#8211; includes C:NP ratio, soil, litter, and vegetation samples.</li>
		<li>Energy balance &#8211; includes air temperature, monthly precipitation, Bowen's Ratio, and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) for assessing energy balance.</li>
		<li>Landscape patterns &#8211; description of the geometry of land cover patterns, i.e. fractal dimensions, patch size, and connectivity.</li>
		<li>Water balance/water quality - includes conductivity, N, P, K, organic carbon, alkalinity, and benthic macroinvertebrates. Water quantity &#8211; water balance on watershed and ground water basin level, infiltration rates.</li>
		<li>Retrospective index &#8211; developed using dendrochronology, PDSI records, pollen records, packrat middens, and charcoal records.</li>
		<li>Fauna &#8211; includes the Breeding Bird Census, ants and ground beetle abundance, composition and distribution.</li>
		<li>Erosion index &#8211; developed using soil loss values from wind and water loss equations.</li>
		<li>Soil physical profile characteristics &#8211; includes surface and soil profile description and physical properties.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>This set of indicators will be evaluated within a four-stage process (<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>): problem formulation and indicator identification; research indicator evaluation; core indicator implementation; and indicator reevaluation (Barber, 1994). It took about 1.5 years to progress from the first stage to the second. Advancing an indicator from the problem formulation stage to the implementation stage will be a multiyear effort. The above list is not exclusive, it may be added to or reduced whenever new ideas, technology, or research identify an indicator that can be improved or replaced with a better substitute.</p>
	<p>Under full implementation, EMAP hopes to employ a hierarchical approach that will rely on process-oriented research to bring new ideas and better understanding of how indicators relate to environmental stress.</p>
	<h2>4. SELECTING INDICATORS FOR A PILOT TEST</h2>
	<p>The EMAP Rangeland Resource Group conducted a pilot rest of a selected subset of the research indicators in 1992. The primary objective of the pilot was to evaluate indicator performance within the programmatic development framework illustrated in <a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>.</p>

	</p>

	<p>A balance was required between the selection of indicators, available financial resources, and other aspects of the project. The EMAP Rangeland Resource Group used a decision analysis process, the Kepner-Tregoe (K-T) analysis (Kepner and Tregoe, 1981), to select both the site and a subset of indicators to test for the pilot. The K-T analysis allowed participants from numerous Federal agencies and research organizations to reach a logical documented decision in a short period of time as to what site should be selected and what indicators should be tested.</p>
	<p>K-T is a decision analysis technique that provides quantitative method to ensure that decisions are made in a systematic and logical manner, without inhibiting creativity and innovation. The technique focuses around a decision statement that clearly defines the desired outcome. A list of 'must have' and 'want' objectives (criteria) is developed. The 'must have' criterion is a mandatory requirement to advance through the decision process. If a proposed indicator did not address the 'must' criterion, defined in this example as 'Addresses the issues of sustainability (focus on desertification and climate change) in rangelands', it was eliminated from consideration. All proposed indicators addressed the 'must' criterion. The following discusses how the K-T process was used to select a subset of indicators that could be field tested in a pilot study. The site selected for the pilot was the Colorado Plateau in Southwestern U.S. (covers parts of the states of Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico).</p>
	<p>A set of selection criteria ('wants') was developed by an interagency group of scientists supporting EMAP's rangeland effort. The criteria were selected specifically for the pilot but were consistent with the overall EMAP approach (Hunsaker et al., 1990). The 1992 pilot objectives were to assess sampling variance, indicator sensitivity, the use of different samples frames, and issues associated with quality assurance, information management, and logistics. The 'wants' criteria were then weighted according to their relative importance in meeting the pilot objectives by government and university specialists. Each participant was required to give the most important criterion a weight of 13 (the total number of criteria); all other criterion were weighted in comparison to the first, from 13 (equally important) down to a possible 1 (not very important). The weighting scale was used to represent the relationships among 'wants'.</p>
	<p><a href="#table1">Table I</a> presents a list of the 'want' criteria and the mean weight and standard deviation of the group score (column A). <a href="#table1">Table I</a> also presents an example of how one of seven indicators (the spectral indicator) scored against the criteria relative to the other research indicators. The criteria were evaluated by a group of 12 scientists. Each research indicator was evaluated relative to each other, against all 'want' criteria one at a time. A value of close to 10 was assigned to the indicator that came closest to meeting the 'want' criterion and all other indicators were scored relative to it (<a href="#table1">Table I</a>, Column B). Once the indicators were scored, a weighted score was generated for each research indicator by multiplying the weight of each 'want' criterion by the score for the indicator and summing for all 'want' criteria. The example (<a href="#table1">Table I</a>) shows how the 12 participants scored the spectral indicator in the K-T process and selected it as the leading contender for evaluation in the 1992 pilot. <a href="#table2">Table II</a> shows the total weighted scores for each indicator category evaluated.</p>
	<p>The final step in the K-T decision process was to explore consequences of not selecting one of the research indicators. Several indicators were excluded from the evaluation process: water balance (quality/quantity), soil physical characterization, fauna, and socio-economic. Water balance was considered important (Mouat et al., 1992), but was excluded because the group determined that data suitable for EMAP usage may be obtained by cooperating with other Federal agencies, e.g. USGS monitoring networks, EMAP-Surface Waters, or from state water monitoring programs. Once data from these are obtained and evaluated, a decision will be made on how complete existing water data are and how well they can be used to meet EMAP objectives.</p>
	<p>While socio-economic indicators may well be tied with ecological condition, they were deferred from the pilot because this linkage is not well undcrstood, may be very indirect, and involves political considerations well beyond the expertise of the scientists currently involved in the project. It is hoped that such indicators may be developed in the future with the collaboration of economists.</p>
	<p>Faunal indicators were deferred from the pilot because scientists at the workshop felt that animals in general may not be as directly diagnostic of change as the other research indicators. This is due to the fact that only a small percentage (10&#8211;20%) of the net above-ground primary production is consumed by herbivores as live material. The remainder, plus egesta, carcasses, and so forth, of higher tropic levels is processed by decomposers (Whitford, 1986). Decomposers will be considered as an important part of the biogeochemistry indicator. Key faunal species may be very diagnostic of change; however, such key species are not generally present in many different habitats across a region. An approach that relies on guilds of animals that perform specific functions within ecosystems needs to be identified. Animals were identified as good indicators for exposure to toxins and will be considered for this in the future. In addition, data from the Breeding Bird Census will be evaluated for coverage in rangelands. If adequate, a similar census could be incorporated by EMAP's Rangeland Resource Group in the near future.</p>

	<p>Soil characterization (surface and profile) was determined to be a core data set that is needed to make associations with spectral and vegetation datasets. Thus, it was decided that soil profile data would be collected at each site along with descriptors of surface soil characteristics. Soil physical and chemical parameters from below 30 cm in the profile were identified as a one-time baseline measurement that would be resampled only if the surface characteristic (&lt; 30 cm) indicated change.</p>
	<p>At the conclusion of the K-T decision process, the workshop participants decided that the first test of the EMAP Rangeland Resource Group indicators would be limited in scope. Thus, the decision was made to test soil properties, vegetation composition and abundance, and spectral properties in the 1992 pilot. Upon additional consideration, the group decided to collect data to calculate an erosion index as part of the soil properties indicator. This was done because the erosion index could be calculated using soil loss models using input data from the literature or collected via the vegetation and soil properties indicators. The only additional data collected in the field were slope and management practices for the plot.</p>
	<p>As additional resources become available, the group intends to add some of the more promising indicators in Table II (e.g. biogeochemistry) with an ultimate goal of having less than 10 core indicators that are useful in assessing ecological conditions in rangelands.</p>
	<p>The following discussion briefly describes the indicators that were evaluated in the 1992 pilot.</p>
	<p><strong>Soil indicator.</strong> Selected soil properties were measured in the field and laboratory as indicators of soil erosion, productivity and moisture available for plant growth. Site characteristics (i.e. slope, aspect, land use), were recorded and soil surface and subsurface samples were obtained using established methods from the U.S. Soil Conservation Service (USDA, 1962, 1975). Site characteristics were used to evaluate type of landscape and as input values to erosion models (Lal, 1994).</p>
	<p>Surface physical and chemical soil attributes were obtained from samples collected at the surface and from all master horizons to a depth of 1.0 m. The near surface attributes should respond earliest to natural and anthropogenic stress. Deeper soil profile data were collected to develop a baseline data set that would only be resampled if notable changes occurred in surface soils or other indicators. The profile data could then be used for comparison and interpolation of long-term change issues.</p>
	<p><strong>Vegetation indicator.</strong> Vegetation composition, structure and abundance are indicators of ecosystem condition and sustainability of rangelands. Percent vegetation cover by species, total vegetation cover and bare ground attributes such as litter, rock, bare soil, and cryptogams, (i.e, cyanobacteria), are estimated in a standard quadrat along a transect using a modified Daubenmire (USDI, 1985) cover class method. Multiple transects allow for statistical comparison for each cover attribute. Trees were measured for crown area determination.</p>
	<p>Much of the vegetation and soils data will be used by the spectral group in their effort to associate spectral signatures to attributes of ecosystem condition.</p>
	<p><strong>Spectral indicator.</strong> Spectral measurements were made to determine if vegetation condition and soil properties could be related to spectral data from satellite sensors, hand-held spectrometers, or both. Tests are being conducted to determine the degree to which the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite measurements can discriminate vegetation cover and soil properties and also to determine their condition from a synoptic perspective.</p>
	<p>Ground spectra were collected using a portable field spectrometer (PSII) that has a field of view of approximately 30 cm diameter from a height of 1 m. These data are being analyzed to determine if satellite measurements can be related to ground spectral measurements to assess within-pixel spectral variability and evaluate its utility. The ground spectral measurements are also being compared to data collected by the vegetation and soils groups to develop a better understanding of the fundamental spectral properties of these objects.</p>
	<p>The spectral data acquired from the 1992 pilot have been reduced and are reported in Kepner <em>et al.</em> (1994). Data were compared to determine statistical variance within and between plots for the ground and satellite scanners on two different resource classes (desertscrub and woodland). Results for NDVI from both TM and PSII were plotted against each other and showed a high correlation (<em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.71). The results showed promise, but there were equipment calibration problems that skewed the 1992 results. In the future, Landsat TM imagery will be checked to assess how well it can discriminate vegetation and soils in a statistically acceptable manner. If successful, the use of satellite measurements will greatly reduce cost and increase coverage for EMAP and other natural resource management programs.</p>
	<h2>5. CONCLUSIONS</h2>
	<p>The EMAP Rangeland Resource Group is particularly interested in the ability of systems to sustain biotic potential relative to exposure to anthropogenic stressors such as livestock grazing, urbanization, aquifer depletion, and off-road vehicle recreation, in combination with natural phenomena such as climate variability. At this time, a sample-based approach in association with the selection and measurement of ecologically-based indicators appears to offer the best strategy for determining the status and trend of ecological condition on a regional and a national scale. Remote sensing technology (ground-based, airborne, and satellite imagery) offers a powerful tool and shows promise for monitoring spatial extent and geographic distribution of ecological resources that, when integrated with other major types of ecological information, can be critical in developing the ability of the EMAP Rangeland Resource Group effort to diagnose association between environmental stresses and conditions (Mouat <em>et al.</em>, 1991). EMAP has an indicator framework that could be employed to provide a common approach to examine regional ecological status and trends questions on other continents or perhaps, even on a global scale.</p>
