			<h3 class="section"><a name="set2"></a>OTHER VEGETATION TYPES</h3>
			<p class="note">(Specific soil and productivity/management sections were not included for these habitat types. The general descriptions are included instead.)</p>
			<p>Although this classification covers the vast majority of forest land in central Idaho, several situations supporting trees are excluded.</p>

			<h4><a name="set2a"></a><span class="ital">Juniperus osteosperma</span> Communities</h4>
			<p>Juniperus osteosperma extends northward from the Great Basin into southern portions of the Lemhi and Lost River Ranges. Here it forms extensive woodlands on foothills overlooking the valley floor. Attempts to classify h.t.'s of the pinyon-juniper zone in the Great Basin may eventually include this outlying population of juniper.</p>

			<h4><a name="set2a"></a><span class="ital">Pinus flexilis</span> Communities</h4>
			<p>Near Craters of the Moon National Monument, widely scattered <span class="ital">Pinus flexilis</span> grow on a raw substrate of lava. Undergrowth vegetation is practically nonexistent. The peculiarities of these stands appear unique in Idaho and may be broadly treated as a single unit. Small amounts of other undefined <span class="ital">P. flexilis</span> communities in our area may consolidate with future studies to the south and southeast.</p>

			<h4><a name="set2a"></a>Flood Plain Communities</h4>
			<p>In central Idaho, a few of the larger rivers and streams form floodplains as they encounter more gentle terrain toward the steppe. Various proportions of <span class="ital">Populus</span>, <span class="ital">Betula</span>, <span class="ital">Salix</span>, <span class="ital">Crataegus</span>, and occasionally <span class="ital">Alnus</span> dominate a rank undergrowth of tall shrubs and lush forbs. Sometimes conifers are weakly represented. Fluctuations of stream activity may continually alter soil depths and water tables and cyclic floods can alter substrate composition. The frequent interruption of succession and substrate alterations present unique difficulties in applying the potential climax concept that is commonly used for habitat type classification of more stable sites.</p>

			<h4><a name="set2a"></a><span class="ital">Populus tremuloides</span> Communities</h4>
			<p><span class="ital">Populus tremuloides</span> dominates a variety of sites within the study area. Its successional role varies from a rapidly seral species to persistently seral and even climax. The most apparent climax conditions are those stands that occur beyond the lower limits of conifers. These stands tend to occupy the concave slopes of low hills. Small amounts of this condition appear in foothills bordering the Camas Prairie and Snake River Plain in Elmore, Camas, and Blaine Counties. It becomes much more prevalent in southeastern Idaho and Utah were classification of these communities is in progress.</p>

			<h4><a name="set2a"></a>Grass and Shrub Communities</h4>
			<p>Grass and shrub communities are interspersed throughout much of central Idaho's forest. Schlatterer (1972, unpubl. ref.) has described many of these conditions in the Sawtooth, White Cloud, Boulder, and Pioneer Mountains. Mueggler and Harris (1960) offer some stratification to the mountain grasslands. Some classifications from adjacent areas may also be applied to portions of central Idaho. Daubenmire's (1970) classification of grasslands in Washington may apply to the extreme northwestern part of our area, and Hall's (1973) work in eastern Oregon may be helpful in our Weiser River drainage. A classification of grasslands and shrublands in Montana (Mueggler and Handl 1974, unpubl. ref.; Mueggler and Stewart 1980) should apply to adjacent portions of east-central Idaho. A current study of communities in southern Idaho (Hironaka 1977, unpubl. ref.) will also apply to southern portions of our area.</p>
