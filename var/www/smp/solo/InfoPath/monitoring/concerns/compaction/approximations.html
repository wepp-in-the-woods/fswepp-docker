<P><B>Bulk density</B> is used as an indicator of soil compaction. An increase
in bulk density correlates to decreases in soil porosity, air exchange,
root penetration, infiltration, and permeability.</P>

<P>Bulk density measurements are customarily taken 1 inch below the mineral
soil surface. Generally, samples are collected, dried and converted to a
mass per volume (g per cubic cm).</P>

<P>If the change (increase) in bulk density after an activity or event is
greater than 15%, then the soil has been detrimentally compacted.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Soil penetration</B> is another method used to determine changes in
soil condition. Clayton et al. (1987) presents a subjective, but effective,
method for estimating compaction from the resistance of pushing a shovel
into the soil. A <B>cone penetrometer</B>, when pushed into the soil at
a calibrated constant rate of speed, displays a digital estimate of bulk
density throughout a soil profile, based on resistance to insertion.</P>

<P><BR>
Measuring <B>infiltration rates</B> may be appropriate when monitoring rangelands
since the compacted layer is often too thin to measure using core sampling
techniques. If the infiltration rate is reduced by 50%, the soil has been
detrimentally compacted.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Note that each of these methods requires knowledge (measurement) of the
specific parameter <B>before</B> the activity occurs.</P>
