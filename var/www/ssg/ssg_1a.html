    <td valign="top" colspan="4"> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        All geotechnical specialists experience, at some time in their careers, 
        the problem of how to provide an appropriate, accurate, understandable 
        answer to a question posed by a land manager or project engineer. The 
        specialist realizes that the manager probably has little knowledge of 
        the scientific complexity involved in answering a seemingly simple geotechnical 
        question. Of several legitimate answers, which is "correct"? The anxiety 
        level rises if a geotechnical mentor is not readily available to guide 
        the specialist through the process of providing the correct answer. Of 
        several possible ways to begin gathering and analyzing data, which is 
        the most valid? The most cost effective? The most truly useful? We have 
        all gone through this experience, and continue to do so. Therefore, we 
        have compiled this slope stability reference guide to help us and those 
        who work with us to better understand how geotechnical specialists get 
        work done. We have included real world examples of common geotechnical 
        problems, along with the reasons behind, and the methods of, the investigative 
        techniques employed. The purpose of this guide is to provide a practical 
        document that geologists and engineers can use in their work. We hope 
        that your copy will become tattered and dog-eared as you use it to provide 
        these answers. </font> </p></td>

        This guide can be viewed either as a textbook describing concepts and

        both be understood and used. A knowledge of the theory behind the methods 
        employed in a particular example helps you to recognize the differences 
        between that example and your specific real-world problem. However, knowing

        The remainder of <a href="ssg_1toc.html">section 1</a> describes the three-level

        Geologists and engineering geologists will have use for the entire design 
        guide, but will probably find the techniques for level I and II analyses 
        the most useful. These two levels, for reconnaissance and project planning, 
        respectively, describe a method of predicting slope instability over large 
        areas. </font> </p>
      <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Reconnaissance-level 
        assessment refers to the analysis of large areas for relative landslide-hazard 
        potential. This level of analysis is used for input to forest planning, 
        timber sale and resource allocations, environmental assessment reports, 
        and transportation planning. The LISA (Level I Stability Analysis Ver. 
        2.0, 1991) computer model discussed in the guide can be used to delineate 
        areas susceptible to landslides on a broad scale to alert land managers 
        to those areas where the risk is greatest (Hammond et al., 1992). </font> 
      </p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Project 
        planning refers to the analysis of designs proposed to implement a management 
        objective. For example, a proposed road corridor is analyzed for preconstruction 
        and postconstruction slope stability. This also includes a sensitivity 
        analysis for individual proposed road design segments that cross potentially 
        unstable areas identified in LISA. DLISA (Deterministic Level I Stability 
        Analysis Ver. 1.02, 1991) works well for sensitivity analysis. An evaluation 
        of road prism conditions (e.g., cut slope heights and angles, fill slope 
        angles and depths, fill compaction, and drainage) can be completed with 
        the results from the sensitivity analysis. A level II computer program, 
        SARA (Stability Analysis for Road Access), is being developed and DSARA 
        (Deterministic Stability Analysis for Road Access) is being perfected 
        at the Intermountain Research Station. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Experienced geologists 
        and engineering geologists will find level I and II analyses useful when 
        a proposed project may change soil physical properties, slope configuration, 
        or surface and subsurface water flow. Experienced engineering geologists 
        understand the basic concepts contained in the guide. Those geologists 
        with little experience in the engineering arena may not be familiar with 
        the analytical techniques used. Those freshly out of school with degrees 
        in classical geology should seek additional training to gain a working 
        knowledge in soil mechanics, strength of materials, and basic road design. 
        For the less experienced practitioner, a mentor assisting and verifying 
        input data will help ensure accurate results. </font> </td>

        Geotechnical engineers will have use for the entire guide, but will probably 
        find the sections explaining design applications for level II (project 
        planning analysis) and level III (site-specific analysis) the most useful. 
        During a project design, efforts are generally made to minimize cost, 
        which usually translates into the minimum functional design. However, 
        site constraints or aesthetic considerations may require a deviation from 
        the standard textbook procedure. This guide shows how to calculate factors 
        of safety for these minimal or unique solutions. It is also useful in 
        answering design questions where standard designs are inappropriate. </font> 
      </p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> During failure analysis, 
        the guide is useful in leading one through the back-calculation process. 
        By back-calculation, the failure parameters can be deduced. Designing 
        a repair is then a matter of bringing the factor of safety up to a desired 
        level by buttressing, drainage, or other means. Usually, several alternatives 
        for failure correction are possible. The guide shows ways to analyze these 
        alternative repairs and calculate their factors of safety. Coupled with 
        cost data, these alternatives can be presented to management. Geotechnical 
        engineers understand the concepts and analysis techniques contained in 
        the guide. Most civil engineers are familiar with these methods. Those 
        who have not worked a number of these problems in the past may want a 
        peer review of their methods and assumptions. </font> </p></td>
