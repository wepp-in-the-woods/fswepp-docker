      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Geomorphic watershed 
        analysis uses a sediment budget approach to provide a hazard-risk assessment. 
        The hazard-risk assessment identifies what geomorphic processes operate 
        in the watershed and how these processes may affect the resources in or 
        downstream from the analysis area. The hazard-risk analysis has two parts: 
        (1) Identify the hazard and the condition over time and (2) Identify the 
        resources susceptible to degradation as the result of the hazards. </font> 
      </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> To quantify these 
        hazards, several tools are available: the Modified Unified Soil Loss Equation 
        (USLE) <a href="#Edt_Nt.1">*</a> for surficial erosion, LISA 
        (Level I Stability Analysis, 1991) for soil translational failures, SARA 
        (Stability Analysis for Road Access, in process) for soil rotational failures, 
        Benda-Cundy (1990) Model for debris flows, and the rock slope engineering 
        methodology developed by Hoek and Bray (1981). </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Quantifying hazards 
        and risks is only part of the geomorphic watershed analysis. Hillslope 
        processes must be linked over time to the way material is stored, transported, 
        and delivered to a stream channel. The next step is to develop a sediment 
        budget for the analysis area incorporating the hazard-risk assessment. 
        Using this sediment budget, you can calculate where material will travel 
        for a particular timeframe and how it gets into the stream channel and 
        is routed downstream. Suspended and bedload sediment transport rates are 
        evaluated. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A typical point 
        of reference in the analysis of cumulative watershed effects is the natural 
        or undisturbed state (sometimes known as baseline or background level). 
        Because landforms evolve over geologic time and disturbance is a natural 
        process (fire, flood, climatic change), a baseline hydrologic or geomorphic 
        steady?state condition may not exist. The condition of a watershed prior 
        to disturbance from management activities at a particular time may be 
        assessed. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> For an historical 
        perspective prior to aerial photography (generally covering the last 50 
        years), ecologists and soil scientists may have data on timing and location 
        of large fires and development of the soil profile. From interpretation 
        of geology and seismic activity maps (available through State geological 
        surveys and the U.S. Geological Survey), recent fault activity and associated 
        geomorphic features (e.g., rock avalanches, alluvial fans, etc.) may be 
        located. Using these data with historical landslide inventories and the 
        climatic history, sediment yields may be estimated. </font> </p>

      <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Historic 
        accounts reveal that the latter half of the 19th century was generally 
        wet in the Pacific Northwest and that large floods occurred in the winters 
        of 1861-62 and 1889-90. From 1915 to 1950 precipitation was low in the 
        Salmon River watershed, and peak discharges in the river at Somes Bar 
        on the Salmon River were also low. This dry period was followed by a wet 
        period from 1950 to 1975 during which floods were frequent. The largest 
        of these occurred in 1964; this flood was probably larger than the 1890 
        event but smaller than the 1861 event (Coghlan, 1984). Since 1975, the 
        climate has been primarily dry, with the exception of very wet winters 
        in 1981-82 and 1982-83 and a wet spring in 1986. </font> </blockquote>

      <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>1. Salmon 
        River:</b> During the period from 1944 to 1988, approximately 10.4 million 
        cubic yards of landslide-derived sediment entered the stream system. Of 
        this, 58 percent was associated with the 1964 flood and 17 percent with 
        the storms of 1965-75. Undisturbed land accounted for most of this volume 
        (67 percent), while roads accounted for 30 percent, timber harvest 2 percent, 
        and fire 1 percent. During this same period, surface erosion produced 
        less than 1 million cubic yards of sediment. Channel erosion was not measured 
        quantitatively, but, in most cases, was observed to be directly related 
        to storage of landslide deposits. Channel storage probably contributed 
        an additional volume of several million cubic yards of sediment to the 
        total amount moved during the period of this investigation. </font> </blockquote>

        Hydraulic mining of the main river valleys occurred from about 1880 to 
        1950 and involved at least 1,200 acres of land. Preliminary estimates 
        of volume indicate that about 15 million cubic yards of sediment were 
        discharged into the river during this time, and major channel modification 
        occurred in many areas, particularly along the upper South Fork of the 
        Salmon River. </font> </blockquote>

        There are about 3,620 acres of road in the watershed, two-thirds of which 
        were built after 1955. There are about 4 acres of road per mile of length. 
        </font> </blockquote>
      <blockquote> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>3. Timber 
        Harvest:</b> The earliest timber harvest occurred in conjunction with 
        mining and homestead activity. Regeneration harvesting of timber on public 
        land did not begin until the 1950's. By 1975, there were about 8,000 acres 
        of harvested public land (plantations) in the watershed and, by 1990, 
        about 30,000 acres. The 1990 figures include about 18,000 acres of harvested 
        land burned by the fires of 1977 and 1987. </font> </blockquote>
      <blockquote> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>4. Fire:</b> 
        Large fires involving about 70,000 acres occurred early in this century 
        (1917 and 1918). No data are available on the intensity of these fires. 
        From 1919 to 1976, the burned area was small, with only two fires larger 
        than 5,000 acres. In 1977, 57,000 acres burned in the Hog Fire, and 102,000 
        acres burned in the wildfire of 1987. There were 20,000 acres of overlap 
        between these two fires. Together, the area of land burned at high and 
        moderate intensity was about 50,000 acres. </font> </blockquote>
      <blockquote> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>5. Total 
        Disturbance Area:</b> In 1975, timber harvest, road, and hydraulic mine 
        disturbance covered only 2.5 percent of the watershed area. Following 
        the fires of 1977 and 1987, the area disturbed by fire, harvest, road, 
        and hydraulic mining covered 18.7 percent of the watershed. Substantial 
        revegetation (about 8,000 acres) has occurred on the land harvested prior 
        to 1975 because these plantations are now from 18 to 30 years old. Similarly, 
        some of the hydraulic mines have revegetated. </font></blockquote>

      Landslide Rates: Roaded lands produced landslides at a rate 24 to 100 times 
      greater than undisturbed lands. This was mainly a function of excavation 
      or fill placement during road construction that changed the existing slope 
      geometry and/or ground water regime enough to unbalance driving and resisting 
      forces on slopes that were at equilibrium. Harvested lands increased landsliding 
      by 2 to 11 times. For example, during the 1965-75 period, each acre of harvested 
      land produced 7 cubic yards of landslide material, while each undisturbed 
      acre produced 3 cubic yards. Data are insufficient to distinguish the change 
      in landslide rate associated with fire from that of harvest. Table <a href="index.html#T2F.1">2F.1</a>

      erosion was found to be a severe problem on burned granitic lands. Following

      Floods: The 1964 flood on the Salmon River caused major channel changes 
      along the main river and most of the major tributaries. Changes included 
      channel migration, aggradation, scour, and widespread loss of riparian vegetation. 
      Most low-gradient floodplains were stripped of riparian vegetation and covered 
      with fresh sediment. High-gradient reaches experienced both scour and aggradation. 
      Loss of fish habitat is clearly apparent on aerial photographs. The floods

      areas, and damage was more localized. The flood of 1955 was manifested by 
      disruption of riparian vegetation on several tributary streams and by localized

      and comments on changes in channel morphology. Koler (1992) estimated that 
      these data can be collected in a couple of field days for a watershed approximately 
      8 square miles in area. Monitoring data can be stored in a data base that 
      includes a location on a GIS for quick retrieval.</font></td>

      need options for mitigation of increased sediment transport. In watersheds 
      that exceed threshold values, it may be desirable to plan management activities 
      while stabilizing sites to diminish sediment production and transport. Engineered 
      structures may be feasible for slowing and stopping sediment (for the life 
      of the structure, usually 25 to 50 years), or living "structures"-willow 
      wattling bundles, for example-using biotechnology might be considered (usually

      and forest levels and may vary from place to place. For example, Pacific 
      Northwest Region planning direction specifies a probability of increased 
      rate or frequency of slope movement but does not identify the tools to be 
      used for this determination, whereas forests in the Pacific Southwest Region

        <b>Editor's Note:</b> <i>The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) is being 
        replaced by Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) computer programs 
        for estimating soil erosion (Elliot, 1994). The WEPP programs, under development 
        since 1986, are based on field testing and modeling of forested lands, 
        harvested lands, and roads in addition to agricultural and rangeland conditions. 
        The first forest applications of the WEPP model are being developed in 
        1994, as this guide is going to press. The WEPP programs should be considered 
        as potential replacements for the USLE discussed in this section. </i></font>
