        concepts useful in characterizing landslide processes at a river basin 
        scale. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The behavior of landslides 
        and associated processes -- such as creep, raveling, piping, and surface 
        erosion-varies considerably both in space and time. The gradients along 
        which soil and rock materials move are influenced by tectonic uplift, 
        river incision, volcanism, and glacial activity. Knowledge about these 
        slope-forming processes is useful in:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(1) Supplementing 
        understanding of site-scale landslide behavior;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(2) Assessing cumulative 
        effects;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(3) Designing a local 
        program for management of the effects of landslides; and</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(4) Defining ecological 
        units. Investigations of these processes and their products are used, 
        for planning purposes, in descriptions of the causes and effects of landsliding.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Evidence of past occurrences 
      of landslides can be used to forecast future behavior of the landscape. 
      Understanding the climate, geologic and geomorphic history, and seismicity 
      of the area is essential. Local patterns in the character of landslide processes 
      provide clues to site processes that are useful in the design of remedial 
      measures and preventive management practices. Landslides and associated 
      processes influence the distribution and structure of ecological habitats, 
      particularly riparian habitats. Opportunities to integrate a range of investigations 
      into descriptions of landscape behavior become apparent as this investigation 
      matures.</font></td>

    <td width="481"><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        technology necessary to manage slope stability, particularly at the scale 
        of river basins, continues to grow. Landslide damage to hillside homes 
        in Los Angeles in the winter of 1951-1952 led to adoption of the first 
        city grading ordinance in the United States (Scullin, 1983). By 1965, 
        most large cities in the western United States had adopted similar ordinances. 
        Improvements to the grading ordinances have been prompted by local experience 
        with damaging effects of landslides and the erosion associated with subsequent 
        storms. The technology of landslide and erosion control in urban areas 
        is still evolving. Much effort has been spent recently developing ordinances 
        addressing seismic safety.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Future developments 
        in technology are anticipated. Earth-orbital sensors are sending continuous 
        streams of data that can be interpreted for surface hydrology, geomorphology, 
        geology, and geodesy. The computing hardware necessary to analyze these 
        data is affordable and will fit on your desk. In the near future, we can 
        expect substantial improvements in the speed and volume of data processing. 
        At the same time, analytical methods are being obscured in computer software. 
        Assessment methods developed today need to be designed to accommodate 
        new data and for translation to future data processing systems.</font></p></td>

      2A.3 Scientific Method </b></font></td>
    <td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The scientific method 
      provides a systematic approach to the assessment of landsliding. Knowledge 
      about the mechanics and distribution of landslides increases with observation 
      and interpretation of features and processes on the landscape. Interpretations 
      are tested on similar ground in another area or at another time. Documented 
      observations and conclusions reviewed by peers are added to the knowledge 
      base. With increased knowledge and experience, the efficiency and economy 
      of landslide management is improved. (See section <a href="ssg_3a.html" target="_blank">3A</a> 
      for a discussion of problem definitions and applications, and <a href="ssg_3ap1.html" target="_blank">appendix 
      3.1</a> for a complete discussion of the scientific method.)</font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One 
        of the basic laws of interpreting geology is that of uniformitarianism. 
        It has commonly been restated as "the present is the key to the past." 
        The assessment of erosion and landslide processes adds a new twist to 
        the concept: "the past is the key to the future." In the classical sense, 
        uniformitarianism means that in interpretation of the rocks, we assume 
        the processes responsible for their character could or do occur in modern 
        times. In landslide assessments, we assume the processes interpreted to 
        have been acting in the past will occur again in the future.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The foundation of 
        description and analysis is the model created to represent the behavior 
        of typically very complex geomorphic systems. Measurable components of 
        the real system are represented quantitatively. If measurements are not 
        available, the value of the components is estimated or assumed. In developing 
        a model, the focus is on those elements with strong influences on the 
        system and identified values; minor influences may be generalized or omitted 
        from the model. Models are often constructed of arbitrarily defined elements 
        (stratigraphic units, landslides, etc.). The number of defined elements 
        may be optimized by iteration of calculations, using varying numbers of 
        elements, to identify the minimum number that provides maximum useful 
        resolution. If assumed or approximated values have a large influence on 
        the value of results, then a large number of elements may provide a false 
        sense of improved resolution. The results of models composed of fewer 
        elements are the easiest to comprehend.</font> </p>
      <div align="center"></div>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Model elements should 
      be designed and named so that the user is presented with a useful picture 
      of the behavior of the landscape. Descriptive terminology must be clearly 
      defined, and typically a reference to the source of definitions is provided 
      to the user. For example: <i>Debris avalanches (as defined by Varnes, 1978) 
      derived from graywacke (as defined by Hutton, 1795) occur most frequently 
      in the inner gorge (as defined by Kelsey, 1987)</i>. Some terms have been 
      used to describe such an assortment of objects that they may not convey 
      a useful idea to the user.</font></td>

    <td><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Project objectives 
      are best developed interactively with the user (typically a land manager). 
      The project design is controlled by the availability of data, technology, 
      budget, and time. Varnes (1984) reminded us that funding, available personnel, 
      and time constraints will inevitably dictate what can be done, but we should 
      not allow these factors to determine at the outset what should be done. 
      From the beginning, it is important to have an intuitive understanding of 
      the nature of the conclusions. Relatively simple questions that can be answered 
      by clean analytical procedures and clear documentation are likely to provide 
      useful conclusions.</font> </td>

    <td><div align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
        is the geologist's responsibility to determine the technical feasibility 
        of attaining project objectives. Documentation of other similar investigations 
        may help to assess feasibility; the lack thereof may result in critical 
        difficulties. In such cases, it may be useful to answer a portion of the 
        question, which may lead, in combination with the work of others, to additional 
        future investigations of larger questions. Building scientific knowledge 
        is analogous to standing on the shoulders of others, and in turn carrying 
        others on your shoulders. Figure <a href="#Fig_2A.2">2A.2</a> outlines 
        elements common to many investigations of landslide processes. </font></div>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It may 
        be necessary to analyze a sample of the population when the population 
        of objects under investigation is large. It is important to keep the design 
        simple enough that users of the results are able to understand the conclusions; 
        therefore, the design of statistical analyses will derive substantial 
        benefit from a review by a statistician for simplicity and validity.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Multiyear projects are 
      difficult to complete in an environment of annual financing. Look for ways 
      to secure future financing or to accomplish the investigation in one year. 
      This is very important in landslide investigations involving monitoring.</font>

    <td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The terms "risk" and 
      "hazard" suffer from widespread confusion about their meaning. Make sure 
      that the user understands the meaning of these and similar terms. When assessing 
      the probability of a landslide occurring, you must specify the area and 
      time period over which the assessment is made. At a specific site, the probability 
      of a landslide occurring today might be very low. At the same site, the 
      probability of occurrence of a landslide during the next 10,000 years may 
      be very high. This problem is resolved by defining the timeframe of the 
      assessment and achieving a good understanding of the processes where landslides 
      have occurred in the past. The list of resource values is site-specific, 
      and landslides affect, among other things, water quality, fish habitat, 
      soil productivity, utility of roads, reservoirs, private property, and human 
      safety.</font> </td>

      <b> 2A.4.4 Resolution and Suitability of Methods of Assessment </b></font></td>
    <td><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many assessments 
        of landslide hazards are done with computer models that try to include 
        all of the relevant landscape features and processes (such as landforms, 
        climatic influences, meteorological influences, soil properties, slope-forming 
        processes, and hydrologic processes). Microscale processes have macroscale 
        effects that are not well understood and, in many cases, are treated inaccurately 
        by models. Very often, model parameters are indices rather than measures 
        of actual behavior of processes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is critical to 
        consider the relationship between the design of a specific investigation 
        and the utility of available analytical methods. The rapid expansion of 
        technology provides us with instruments, software, and models involving 
        complex processes developed for specific applications. When the specialist 
        uses model designs, analytical procedures, and instruments without fully 
        understanding how they work, and without adjusting for local conditions, 
        he or she may reach critically defective conclusions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Models vary in their 
        ability to produce realistic results. For example, an investigator dispatched 
        to a distant location in response to an episode of catastrophic landsliding 
        might arrive with good academic preparation and experience from other 
        areas but with little knowledge about the local patterns in geology, geomorphology, 
        hydrology, climate, and seismicity. The assessment made from a vehicle 
        tour of the area would likely be very different from that made after a 
        year of local practice. As we come to understand the activity of specific, 
        lcal processes, our model can be modified to improve resolution. Existing 
        analytical models used in landslide management occupy a wide range in 
        the spectrum of resolution. It is important to understand where each model 
        lies in the spectrum and to be prepared for evolution of the methods and 
        data quality and quantity.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is also important 
        to indicate the quality and applicability of conclusions. For example, 
        one method of assessing future landslide hazards may provide a good indication 
        of the volume of landsliding expected from a certain precipitation event 
        across a large area but not indicate source sites. Another method may 
        very well indicate sites of future landsliding but not provide an estimate 
        of the cumulative landslide production potential.</font></p></td>

      For example, an assessment of reservoir sedimentation may be generally similar

    <td><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The map scale of an 
      investigation should be selected in conjunction with the objectives. The 
      map scale must be large enough to allow the smallest of the significant 
      features to be mapped. The range of choice may be constrained by the scale 
      of existing maps which may be enlarged, but the accuracy of topographic 
      information will remain that of the original scale. Custom topographic maps 
      can be made at reasonable cost from aerial photography. The accuracy of 
      large scale (1:30,000 or larger) maps may be limited in forested environments 
      where contours are drawn on the forest canopy. Where the depth of the vegetation 
      is irregular, typically greater along water courses, the topographic model 
      will be smoother than the actual ground surface. A good grasp of cartography 
      and photogrammetry is needed to do high resolution, quantitative analysis 
      of map information. If the map scale is too large, information may be classified 
      into many units of small size, and the resulting map may not provide a useful 
      image.</font></td>
