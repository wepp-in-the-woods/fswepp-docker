    <td><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Williamson (1979) developed 
      a checklist for the geotechnical specialist to use when working on a geotechnical 
      project. I have taken his checklist and added my commentary to each item. 
      Williamson's checklist is in sequential order so that the specialist will 
      know which steps to follow from start to finish of the project. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>1. Purpose of assessment.</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A geotechnical specialist 
        needs to identify the application of the assessment before proceeding 
        with a surface investigation. Field work should be completed at a level 
        appropriate for the intended use. Requests are made to answer a question 
        or provide data for a specified application. The geotechnical specialist 
        must prescribe a scope of services commensurate with the need. Sometimes 
        the specialist needs to ask the requester for additional information about 
        what is wanted. For example, the requester may be asking for a reconnaissance-level 
        project when it would be better to provide a site-specific project report. 
        The geotechnical specialist should understand what the customer wants 
        before the investigation is started. If there is a misunderstanding, the 
        specialist will certainly find out during the customer feedback.</font></p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Sequence of 
        events (slope history).</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The axiom "the key 
        to the geologic past is the present," developed by James Hutton in the 
        18th century, is useful in assessing slope stability. Understanding what 
        has occurred on the slope over geologic time helps in predicting what 
        will happen in the future. In addition to examining the geologic history 
        of a slope, we need to look at the history of development (e.g., engineering 
        and logging). Did slope instability occur following development? Can cause/effect 
        relationships be identified? A quick check of previous geotechnical/geologic 
        reports and maps and a careful review of historic aerial photographs helps 
        in assembling a slope stability history. It also is helpful to ask the 
        local road maintenance crew what they know about the slope in question. 
        The individuals who keep the road access open usually know a great deal 
        about slope stability in an area. In addition, colleagues working in engineering 
        zone offices, ranger district offices, and forest headquarters usually 
        have information about the slope stability history. A few telephone calls 
        to hydrologists, soil scientists, foresters, and other resource specialists 
        working in the forest usually generate additional information about the 
        slope stability history.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>3. Topography, 
        elevation, slope, relief, and landform.</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Together, the topography, 
        elevation, slope, relief, and landform are descriptive in assessing a 
        slope for stability. When evaluating one, the geotechnical specialist 
        needs to look at the others in this assessment. Also, these elements can 
        be used for slope stability information that the requester can use for 
        his or her work (e.g., proposed timber sale, proposed road construction, 
        and road reconstruction or closure).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Topography</u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A topographic map 
        helps identify areas with potential instability. For example, areas that 
        are concave usually concentrate more subsurface water than do planar or 
        convex slopes (Dunne and Black, 1970). These concave slopes may indicate 
        previous slope movement where the head of the slide has moved downslope, 
        leaving a bowl-shaped escarpment (Benda and Cundy, 1990). Also, slope 
        areas that are hummocky may indicate a complicated relationship between 
        ground water gradient, transitory ground water movement, and soil units 
        (Iverson and Major, 1987). Topographic maps may not show areas of hummocky 
        slopes for a level I stability analysis because of the map scale (e.g., 
        1:24,000), but the hummocky topography should be discernable at level 
        II and III stability analysis map scales (e.g., 1:3600 to 1:120).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Elevation</u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Similar elevations 
        for landslide features-such as headwalls, sag ponds, springs and seeps-are 
        common for areas that have more than one unstable slope. A topographic 
        map with a landslide overlay usually provides enough information during 
        a level I stability analysis to identify areas with a common elevation 
        for a particular landslide feature. By building an engineering soil overlay 
        during the level I stability analysis, the specialist usually can locate 
        similar materials at common elevations. Information in this soil overlay 
        may come from previous geotechnical or geologic reports, geologic or soil 
        survey maps, colleagues, road maintenance crews, or reconnaissance field 
        trips. For example, river valleys that were recently covered by glaciers 
        may have a stratigraphic order of glacial deposits from the valley floor 
        up the valley walls. This stratigraphic sequence may look like the information 
        given in table <a href="#Table_3C.1">3C.1</a>; however, the stratigraphy 
        is rarely horizontal as given in this example. Elevation information gathered 
        and evaluated during the level I analysis can be used for levels II and 
        III. Using the level I analysis elevation data, the geotechnical specialist 
        can help the transportation planner to locate proposed road corridors 
        (e.g., finding a corridor that will miss potential slope stability problem 
        areas or that will cross the slope on a landslide providing the smallest 
        risk). For design work in level III stability analysis, these data may 
        provide useful information. For example, the spring at an elevation is 
        probably associated with a slope feature a certain number of feet upslope 
        or downslope and may be a key factor in the level III analysis.</font></p></td>

    <td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One 
        useful method is to mark on a topographic map areas that form bench-shaped 
        areas. Williamson (1987) found a cyclical relationship between the elevations 
        of topographic flat areas and valley development in western Oregon. He 
        found that bench-shaped features can be found with great regularity at 
        the following elevation intervals (in feet): 300-350, 600-650, 1,000-1,200, 
        1,700-2,000, and 2,800-3,200. Williamson associated the 300-350 and 600-650 
        foot intervals with effects from the Missoula flood. In his field work 
        he has found that the 1,700-2,000 foot elevation interval goes across 
        the Oregon Coast Range and probably the Willamette River valley to the 
        west flank of the Cascade Mountain Range where it is commonly found on 
        Forest Service lands. The bench-shaped features found at these intervals 
        were developed when the valley floor was at a higher elevation than today. 
        These features are not necessarily river terraces, but commonly a combination 
        of both river and slope processes (e.g., a debris flow fan overlying a 
        river deposit). Williamson is not the only one to identify these topographic 
        features.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Similar base-level 
        elevations can be found in most mountainous areas. Diller (1902) found 
        several flat surfaces produced by erosion in the Klamath Mountains and 
        described them as peneplains. Williamson described these as river valley 
        stage development. Allen (1986) provided an excellent summary of Diller's 
        observations and gave additional information from his own field work that 
        also supports Williamson's work. All three geologists found the same elevation 
        intervals, although Williamson found some higher than the others did.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By building a map overlay 
      for the topographic flat areas in a study area (e.g., a level I stability 
      analysis for a proposed timber sale analysis area) and superimposing the 
      overlay onto the engineering soil unit and landslide overlays, the specialist 
      usually will find an association between topography, engineering soil units, 
      and areas of slope movement. This information can then be used in the LISA 
      (Level I Stability Analysis 1991) computer program to evaluate the probability 
      of slope movement in the study area. This same information can also be used 
      in the level II stability analysis when the geotechnical specialist is working 
      with the transportation planner evaluating a proposed road corridor.</font> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Slope</u></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Changes in ground 
        surface slope angle reflect differences in physical characteristics of 
        soil and rock materials or the presence of water. Slope changes observed 
        at the same location over time, when reviewing aerial photographs, usually 
        indicate either slope movement or significant erosion. These changes are 
        most readily seen in aerial photographs taken over several years or decades. 
        Slope angle for unconsolidated and noncohesive materials usually will 
        give a close approximation for &phi;, the internal angle of friction. 
        If the engineering soil units are known or even estimated for the study 
        area, the geotechnical specialist may be able to assign a f value without 
        completing a field or laboratory strength test by measuring the slope 
        angle from the topographic map or aerial photograph. However, these values 
        are sufficiently accurate only for a level I stability analysis and certainly 
        are not appropriate for consolidated and cohesive engineering soils. Therefore, 
        great caution should be used in associating slope angle with &phi; at 
        this level of analysis. For levels II and III stability analyses, the 
        specialist should collect field samples for determining &phi; and not 
        depend upon the possible slope angle-&phi; relationship.</font></p>
      <p><u><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Relief</font></u></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Relief is the overall 
        change in elevation within an area. Relief helps tell the slope stability 
        story for a study area for levels I and II stability analyses. Is the 
        topography flat, so that there is very little relief, or is it steep and 
        therefore has high relief? What are the geologic processes that are resulting 
        in the relief in the study area? Also, what is the aspect (slope direction) 
        for various types of relief (low, medium, high)? Is this association between 
        aspect and relief type controlled by bedrock structure (e.g., folding 
        and faulting), or is it a geomorphic landform (e.g., landslide), or a 
        combination of both? Are there certain types of slope movements associated 
        with a relief type and underlying bedrock structure (e.g., rock topple 
        in high relief slopes composed of vertically jointed granite)? Are there 
        changes in relief within the study area? What is occurring at those changes? 
        Are those relief changes in areas where the slope has moved? </font></p>
      <p><u><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Landform</font></u></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Geologic processes 
        use soil, rock, and water to create landforms (e.g., glacial, volcanic, 
        fluvial, eolian, and lacustrine). Landforms can be described by geologic 
        process, elevation, topography, slope, and relief. How do these control 
        the development of the landform? Has this particular type of landform 
        evolved over time from one type to another? What is the geologic/geotechnical 
        story for a landform with unstable slopes?</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>4. Weather, climate, 
        rainfall, and temperature.</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Changes in meteorological 
        conditions-weather, climate, rainfall, and temperature-will affect slope 
        stability conditions (see section <a href="ssg_2toc.html">2</a>). Unfortunately, 
        records in the Western states for these conditions go back only 100 to 
        150 years, so it is impossible to determine whether the current conditions 
        are unusual or normal for a long period of time. However, we can use data 
        collected over decades to make some comparisons for short time periods 
        (decades or half centuries). These data are probably the most useful in 
        the level I stability analysis, specifically for input to the LISA computer 
        program ground water file. It is also possible to use rainfall information 
        in back-calculating neutral effective stresses in the levels II and III 
        stability analyses.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Slope stability conditions 
      can also be influenced by changes in the vegetation canopy that intercepts 
      rain and snow. Prior to timber removal by harvesting or fire, precipitation 
      reaches the ground by throughfall (precipitation moving through the canopy) 
      and stemfall (intercepted precipitation that moves down the tree stem to 
      the trunk and down to the ground). Interception, throughfall, and stemfall 
      cease when timber is removed from the slope. The rain-on-snow phenomenon 
      (Harr, 1981) is a result of this canopy removal in areas where there is 
      a transient snow zone. Snow that is normally intercepted in the tree canopy 
      is now on the ground and has the potential of melting rapidly if rained 
      upon. This phenomenon continues until the canopy is re-established, usually 
      30 years after timber harvest. When rainfall occurs on a snowpack overlying 
      an unstable slope, there is a potential for a significant increase in slope 
      instability because of the potential increase in ground water. This will 
      occur when there is a sudden influx of water into the soil as the snowmelt 
      and the rain infiltrate into the soil column. Therefore, an evaluation for 
      the potential of rain-on-snow events on an unstable slope should be included 
      in a slope stability assessment.</font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>5. 
        Vegetation.</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The type and location 
        of vegetation should also be included in all three levels of slope stability 
        assessment. Areas where there are hydrophilic species should be recorded 
        and included in each assessment. Also, asking an ecologist or forester 
        about the fire history in the study area is important since vegetation 
        types are affected by fire and contribute to the slope instability by 
        the loss of root shear strength.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In level I stability 
        analysis, the geotechnical specialist usually uses aerial photographs 
        in observing changes in the vegetation canopy. Typical questions the specialist 
        asks at this stability analysis level are: What is the pattern in the 
        vegetation change? Is this pattern similar to one for various types of 
        slope movements and the time of those movements? Are there hydrophilic 
        species located on the photographs that would indicate areas of saturation? 
        How does this information tie in with the topographic and elevation information?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In levels II and III 
        stability analyses, the specialist needs to evaluate the role of vegetation 
        in slope stability at a more site-specific scale than in level I. For 
        example, the pattern of the vegetation on and adjacent to the slide mass 
        may be important in understanding better if, how, and why the slope has 
        moved. Questions regarding direct relationships between vegetation and 
        slope movement can also be answered. For example, careful site observation 
        will provide information on whether tree roots are providing some anchoring 
        of the slide mass to underlying rock or whether vegetation is forming 
        a network across the top of the slide mass to more stable ground (much 
        like a large net holding the mass in place). Indirect relationships, such 
        as subsurface drainage characteristics, may also be indicated by vegetative 
        pattern. A geotechnical specialist may have a good handle on the physical 
        strength properties of the slide mass, but this information may be moot 
        if the specialist has not evaluated the role of the vegetation for the 
        site in question.</font></p>

        distribution (drainage patterns).</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Understanding the 
        distribution of surface water is important at all three levels because 
        the movement of water is a critical part of whether a slope will be stable. 
        The easiest way to get a quick interpretation for surface water distribution 
        is to look at drainage patterns on a topographic map. These drainage patterns 
        reflect underlying bedrock structural characteristics within the project 
        area for timber sale and transportation planning. Typical drainage patterns 
        the geotechnical specialist may be looking for on a topographic map in 
        a level I or II stability analysis include dendritic, parallel, trellis, 
        rectangular, radial, annular, multi-basinal, and contorted (Howard, 1967).</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Dendritic</u></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The dendritic pattern 
        is tree-like in form. Usually a dendritic drainage pattern indicates that 
        the underlying bedrock is uniform, and there is no dominant control over 
        the flow direction. Commonly this pattern is found in sedimentary or igneous 
        bedrock that has a nearly horizontal dip.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Parallel</u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The parallel pattern 
        is commonly found on bedrock that is tilted steeply in one direction so 
        that the streams are forced to flow in one direction.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Trellis</u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The trellis pattern 
        resembles a grape trellis with small branches attached to elongated branches. 
        This drainage pattern is common in folded bedrock where the elongated 
        stream courses are forced to travel along valleys underlain by nonresistant 
        material, usually along the bedrock strike. The tributaries to these relatively 
        longer streams are at right angles to the main stem and usually flow down 
        bedrock dip.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Rectangular</u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Discontinuities (e.g., 
        fractures, joints, and faults) in bedrock can control the drainage pattern 
        in a study area. When this occurs, the drainage pattern can be rectangular 
        because the discontinuity geometry forces tributaries to flow into main-stem 
        streams at or near right angles. This pattern is different from the trellis 
        pattern because the tributaries are usually not as short as those in the 
        trellis pattern. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Radial</u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When streams flow 
        from a common center, usually a mountain, the resulting drainage pattern 
        is radial. This drainage pattern is common in volcanic mountain ranges.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Annular</u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Streams form concentric 
        rings around a common center in the annular drainage system. This is common 
        in the Southern states where there are salt diapers that form structural 
        domes around which this drainage system is formed.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Multi-basinal</u></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In karst areas where 
        large sink holes are common, the multi-basinal drainage pattern is dominant. 
        Because the carbonate rock in karst commonly goes to solution when exposed 
        to ground water, the resulting drainages can be isolated from one another. 
        The collection of these individual drainages is referred to as multi-basinal.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Contorted</u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In complicated metamorphic 
        terrane the underlying structure is complex; therefore, the drainage pattern 
        is commonly contorted. This type of drainage pattern is common in mountains 
        where the metamorphic core is exposed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>7. Surface distribution 
        of soil and rock units.</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within the three-level 
        system, the geotechnical specialist should spend time driving or walking 
        across the project area before any mapping occurs. Through this reconnaissance, 
        the specialist gets a feel for the surface distribution of the soil and 
        rock units. The amount of time spent doing this overview of the project 
        area depends upon the area's size, geological complexity, and logistical 
        characteristics. The time spent reconnoitering in a level I project area 
        is typically 2 or 3 days if the project is 5 to 10 square miles in size. 
        For a level II project area, this quick assessment will take about 1 day 
        for a 1- to 2-mile-long proposed road corridor. In a level III site, the 
        reconnaissance is usually several hours.</font></p>
      <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once the geotechnical 
      specialist has completed an overview of the area and knows what the soil 
      and rock units are (at this point they should be classified), then the mapping 
      of the surficial distribution can begin. The level of detail portrayed in 
      mapping soil and rock units is scale-dependent. For a level I project the 
      contact boundaries between soil and rock units may not be very accurate, 
      but for a level III project these margins will be accurate to within a few 
      inches. Level II project mapping has a level of detail similar to level 
      III, but with less scalar accuracy.</font> <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>8.

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The goal in obtaining 
        the surface distribution of soil and rock units is to be able to use these 
        data to predict the location and geometry of the units under the surface 
        and the subsurface physical relationships to form and process. This can 
        be completed by using the strike and dip of the rock (and sometimes the 
        soil) unit, the depositional or erosional form of the material (e.g., 
        lenticular, lobate, tabular, etc.), estimated moisture content, unit elevation 
        at one location relative to the same unit at another location, and stratigraphic 
        measurement of these units. In appendix <a href="ssg_3ap5.html">3.5</a>, 
        this method of measuring and projecting soil and rock units is explained 
        in detail.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Collecting samples 
        that are representative of the soil and rock units in a slope stability 
        assessment is important to give the specialist a reference sample for 
        comparison of one unit material to another. Also, having a representative 
        sample is useful if there are several people involved in the project identifying 
        and measuring the units. Mistakes can happen when classifying material, 
        so having a sample to refer to is helpful. Also, during the analysis stage 
        of a project, it is always good to have typical examples available for 
        a quick reference.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What are representative 
        samples for levels I, II, and III? Rarely in a level I stability analysis 
        will the geotechnical specialist have all the typical examples for the 
        project area, especially if the project timeframe is short and the area 
        large. At this point in the project, the specialist should know where 
        there are gaps in the knowledge and the areas that are probably most unstable 
        or have the potential to become unstable. If this is the case, then the 
        specialist can concentrate field efforts in those areas to fill in the 
        information gaps. This approach can also be used for a level II project. 
        At this level of work, the specialist usually divides a proposed road 
        corridor into segments that have similar materials and conditions. This 
        way the specialist can determine which segments probably need the most 
        attention; hence, most of the representative samples are collected in 
        these areas. Project work in a level III stability analysis is site-specific;

        water distribution and pressure.</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Subsurface water distribution 
        and pressure are analyzed in all three levels of stability analysis but 
        more commonly in levels II and III than level I because pressure head 
        is more easily identified and evaluated at these levels. The geotechnical 
        specialist does not always need subsurface exploration data to determine 
        the water distribution and pressure. Usually surface data can be identified 
        and measured to help portray subsurface water conditions (as described 
        in appendix <a href="ssg_3ap5.html">3.5</a>). Some of this interpretative 
        work is fairly obvious; for example, a concave slope covered by coarse-grained 
        soils and underlain by bedrock with no discontinuities has the potential 
        to have subsurface water. The difficult part in analyzing the condition 
        of the ground water is the time (steady or unsteady state) and depth (uniform 
        or nonuniform) variables tied to rainfall duration-intensity and the infiltration 
        of this surface water through the coarse-grained material. This rainfall/ground 
        water relationship can be estimated using a method developed by Sangrey 
        et al. (1984) if the geotechnical specialist has precipitation and water 
        well data. However, much work needs to be done to understand time and 
        depth variables for soils that are periodically unsaturated (Koler, in 
        prep.). Until this work is completed, the specialist should use all of 
        the available data to build a subsurface model (e.g., flow net or finite 
        difference) to evaluate the ground water distribution and pressure. Section 
        <a href="ssg_4e.html">4E</a> provides the instructions for building a 
        flow net model.</font></p>

        classification and strength of soil and rock units.</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Representative soil 
        and rock unit samples are classified in the field. The most common classification 
        systems are the Unified Soil and Rock Classification Systems described 
        in sections <a href="ssg_3b.html">3B.1</a> and <a href="ssg_3b.html#3B.2">3B.2</a>. 
        The geotechnical specialist may want to collect field samples for laboratory 
        testing if the soil or rock unit has a low strength value identified in 
        the field classification process. </font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For a level I stability 
      analysis, the soil and rock unit classifications are estimated from existing 
      information (e.g., maps, aerial photographs, project files, and reports) 
      and field reconnaissance. Sometimes field samples are collected at this 
      level for additional testing in the laboratory, usually for obtaining angles 
      of internal friction and cohesion. In these cases, the geotechnical specialist 
      can collect the sample using a Shelby tube (if the soil is not too coarse-grained). 
      For levels II and III, the classifications for soil and rock units are not 
      estimated but are actually measured. In the proposed road corridor evaluated 
      for level II and the P-line (preliminary survey line) for level III, the 
      specialist may also collect several soil and rock samples for testing bearing 
      capacities, Atterberg limits (plasticity), degradation, sand equivalency, 
      and so on, depending upon whether the material will be in the subgrade (undisturbed 
      or disturbed material underneath the roadway), base course (material placed 
      on top of the subgrade, sometimes referred to as road ballast), or surfacing 
      material (aggregate placed as surfacing on top of the base course and sometimes 
      directly on top of the subgrade).</font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>13. 
        Mechanics and rate of failure.</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mechanics of slope 
        failure were divided into three material types by Varnes (1978): bedrock, 
        debris, and earth; and six types of movement: falls, topples, slides (both 
        translational and rotational), lateral spreads, flows (in both bedrock 
        and soil), and complex (a combination of movement types). Hoek and Bray 
        (1981) divided rock slope failures into planar, wedge, circular, topple, 
        and ravelling, depending on the rock geometry and discontinuities (open 
        or closed separations in the rock mass). Varnes provided a rate of failure 
        movement ranging from extremely rapid (greater than 10 ft/sec) to extremely 
        slow (1 ft/5 yr). Hoek and Bray did not provide a rate of failure scale 
        for rock slopes.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are several 
        soil and rock mechanics textbooks available that go into great detail 
        about the effect of water on the strength and movement of slopes. Both 
        the paper by Varnes (1978) and the textbook by Hoek and Bray (1981) provide 
        ample information on this topic, as does section 4 in this guide. At this 
        point in the slope stability assessment, the geotechnical specialist should 
        have the location of the surface and subsurface water and the relationship 
        the water has to the overall effective stresses in the slopes being evaluated 
        for stability. This knowledge is usually estimated for a level I stability 
        analysis and measured for levels II and III. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>15. Slope stability 
        analysis.</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The method the geotechnical 
        specialist uses for analyzing slope stability is controlled by the scale 
        of the project and the type of slope movement. LISA is commonly used in 
        a level I stability analysis, but other models are also available for 
        use in conjunction with or separately from LISA. The debris flow routing 
        model developed by Benda and Cundy (1990) is one example. Because the 
        infinite slope equation is the limit-equilibrium equation used in LISA, 
        the geotechnical specialist can use this computer program for translational 
        failures. Ristau (1988) showed that LISA can be manipulated so that rotational 
        failures can also be evaluated if the landslide's centroid can be located. 
        This use of LISA, however, is unusual. In levels II and III stability 
        analyses, the geotechnical specialist can evaluate translational, rotational, 
        and complex landslides using SSCHFS (1988), SARA (Stability Analysis for 
        Road Access, in process), and XSTABL (1992) computer programs. In rock 
        slope failures, the specialist can use Hoek's and Bray's methods for all 
        three levels.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finding the factor 
        of safety or probability of instability is only part of the slope stability 
        analysis. The other part is to determine what effect or impact will result 
        from a particular land modification. For a level I stability analysis, 
        the specialist can provide probabilities of slope instability. These values 
        can then be used in the development of various alternatives for a proposed 
        timber harvest within the planning process required by the National Environmental 
        Policy Act (NEPA). For a level II stability analysis, the specialist can 
        use SSCHFS or SARA to determine how a proposed road can be constructed 
        by evaluating cut slope angles and heights, fill slope angles and compaction 
        values, road width, and whether or not a ditch will help keep the road 
        prism stable. For a level III stability analysis, the specialist can use 
        XSTABL to determine design criteria for stabilizing a slope. Section <a href="ssg_5toc.html">5</a> 
        provides instruction on how these tools are used and how the analysis 
        results can be used to predict effects and impacts resulting from land

        treatment alternatives.</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once the geotechnical 
        specialist has determined the possible consequences of slope failure, 
        then he or she can provide some viable corrective treatment alternatives. 
        In the level I stability analysis, these alternatives are usually tied 
        to timber harvesting methods. For example, how will the probability of 
        slope failure change in response to clear-cutting, shelter wood harvesting, 
        and other partial-cutting techniques? However, this level of analysis 
        is not limited to timber harvesting; it can also be used as part of a 
        watershed analysis. For example, it can determine the current state of 
        the watershed slope stability, and how it will change over a given time; 
        if the watershed slopes have a range of instability values, how much of 
        the material from these slopes reaches the streams or rivers on the valley 
        floor; and if this material is a particularly high volume within the sediment 
        budget, how this value can be lowered with certain types of corrective 
        treatments. In the levels II and III stability analyses, the corrective 
        treatment alternatives are not similar to the broad scale alternatives 
        in the first level. Rather, these alternatives are tied to a specific 
        retaining wall, support structure, or other structure designs within the 
        road prism. Also, biotechnical techniques within and outside of the road 
        prism can be evaluated using these two levels of stability analyses.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cost estimates are 
        difficult to calculate for a level I stability analysis because the analysis 
        is not site-specific. This is also somewhat true for a level II stability 
        analysis, but the geotechnical specialist can usually provide a range 
        of values for each design segment within a proposed road corridor. For 
        a level III stability analysis, the specialist should be able to calculate 
        a cost estimate for a project. Section <a href="ssg_6toc.html">6</a> provides

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once the cost estimates 
        are calculated, the geotechnical specialist can provide an assessment 
        of the slope stability risk. Are the estimated costs for each treatment 
        alternative effective for each associated slope stability risk? This information 
        needs to be clear for the decision maker.</font></p>
      <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20. Recommendations.</font></b></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At this point in the 
        slope stability assessment the geotechnical specialist provides recommendations 
        in his or her report. This part of the report can easily become ponderous 
        to read; therefore, the recommendations can be abbreviated and placed 
        at the front of the report within a short summary, sometimes called an 
        executive summary.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>21. Customer feedback.</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A few days after the 
        geotechnical report has been submitted to the requester, the specialist 
        needs to contact the requestor to find out whether the report is satisfactory. 
        If there has been frequent communication between the specialist and the 
        project requester, then there will be no surprises in the report product. 
        Unfortunately, this is not always the case, and it is a painful learning 
        experience to find out that the completed work is not what the customer 
        originally requested. Therefore, it is important to obtain this feedback.</font></p></td>
