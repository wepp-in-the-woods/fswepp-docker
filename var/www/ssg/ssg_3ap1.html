          a set of questions.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A <b>concept</b> 
          has two properties. It is an abstraction that has an assigned definition.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A <b>proposition</b> 
          is a set of concepts linked in a logical way that forms a statement.</font></p>
      </div>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An <b>axiom</b> 
        is a proposition that is assumed to be true. Axioms form the basis on 
        which we act to develop postulates. Axioms are not the immediate subject 
        of investigation; however, the concepts used in axioms may also be used 
        in postulates. They are challenged by measurements and can be shown to 
        need redefinition. Then it becomes necessary to reassess what we initially 
        considered as axioms. One difficulty in science is that very many propositions, 
        both axioms and postulates, are classified as "true so far."</font></p>
      <div align="left"></div>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the propositions 
        are as yet untested then they are <b>postulates</b>. Postulates are the 
        fulcrum of the scientific method and can be investigated by direct investigation 
        or experiment. Postulates demand investigation, but, once investigated, 
        they may force the revision, or enable the extension, of established theory.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Data</b> are the 
        results of observations, surveys, or experiments made in relation to the 
        investigation of specific postulates. Data do not exist in a logical vacuum 
        and they are not neutral. The frequently heard expression, "Let the data 
        speak for themselves," can be badly misinterpreted. Data can only be used 
        relative to the precise conditions of the investigation designed to address 
        specific postulates.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A <b>theory</b> is 
        a construction that evolves over time. It contains both axioms, which 
        are generally thought to be true but may turn out not to be, and postulates, 
        some of which are likely to be rejected as untrue. A theory contains questions.</font></p>
      <div align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        term <b>hypothesis</b> is reserved for use where a postulate can be examined 
        in relation to data so that it can be designated true or false with some 
        specified probability. In a statistical argument, the construction of 
        hypotheses takes particular forms. A hypothesis can be solved for a logical 
        answer. Not all postulates can be translated into hypotheses at the same 
        time. </font></div>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whatever 
        scientific theory is considered, there must be a set of questions which 
        motivate it and a body of propositions, axioms together with postulates, 
        that define it. As theories are considered on a broader level, specifying 
        precise linkages between the motivating set of questions and defining 
        body of propositions becomes more difficult. There are two linked reasons 
        for this. The first is technical. It must always be possible to resolve 
        the linkages between postulates and data by specific investigations. But 
        general theories also have to include propositions that link sets of axioms 
        built up from very specific investigations. These "linking propositions" 
        can be difficult to test. They tend to require wide ranging investigations 
        outside the scope of a single individual action, research experiment, 
        or investigation. The second reason it is difficult to investigate broad 
        theories is practical and sociological. Faced with the difficulty of connecting 
        their research questions to the fundamentals of the theory, scientists 
        tend to work within a general theory that really becomes a "viewpoint" 
        or "paradigm." Scientists, both as groups and individuals, have an over-arching 
        axiom that specifies basic assumptions. When working within a paradigm, 
        the logic behind the wider, more general, and linking propositions receives 
        fewer direct challenges.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first task when 
        starting a scientific research project is to make a conceptual analysis. 
        The scientific terms must be defined and the nature of their linkage in 
        the formation of axioms and postulates must be specified. This involves 
        a literature review and, from that, an analysis of the logical connections. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consider scientific 
        knowledge as a fish net that we construct, mend, and constantly use for 
        different purposes. The concepts are the material that makes up the net, 
        say the different types of filament, and the axioms are the way the filament 
        is combined, including mesh size and the total arrangement of the net. 
        The postulates are new or additional features of the net designed to catch 
        a new category of fish. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concepts, theorems, 
        and postulates can be constructed at different levels of organization; 
        for example, we use concepts to describe theories of subatomic physics, 
        plate tectonics, and evolution. We must develop our own description of 
        theory depending on the particular problem faced. The questions we ask 
        determine the necessary set of theorems. Each question is different-there 
        are no absolutes-but there is a common logical structure based upon the 
        problematic situation and the need to define axioms and develop postulates.</font></p></td>

        parts of a theory. They have matured through use in argument and tests 
        with real world data through either direct or indirect comparison with 
        concepts by inspection. Concepts by intellection are repeatedly used in

    <td valign="top" colspan="4"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Concepts 
      by imagination are those that we use in the development of postulates. They 
      do not arise entirely through logical reasoning from within the current 
      theory under examination. Concepts by imagination may originate by comparative 
      reasoning. For example, a theory on the control of growth of species A may 
      be "thought" likely to be sufficiently close to that of species B, a taxonomically 
      related but more well-researched species, to form a model of it. However, 
      an assumption is made about the similarity, that taxonomic criteria and 
      growth control processes are closely related. Unless the two bodies of theory 
      are tied together, the "borrowed" concept from species B is clearly a concept 
      by imagination when used in a theory of the growth control of species A. 
      Concepts by imagination are linked with concepts by intellection in postulates. 
      They are compared with concepts by inspection, the result of data collection 
      and analysis.</font></td>

      by inspection are data used to examine whether a postulate is rejected. 
      It is important not to assume that data have a one?to?one relationship with 
      concepts by imagination or concepts by intellection. The technical process 
      of measurement is frequently complicated. What is measured may only partly 
      represent what the concept by imagination or intellection specified. Furthermore, 
      comparisons may require a statistical framework. Observations and measurements 
      have particular sampling and distributional properties that need to be clearly 
      designated as a potential source of discrepancy between postulated and observed. 
      So it is important to distinguish between concepts by imagination or intellection 
      and those by inspection. The description of radiation by wavelengths is 
      a concept by inspection.</font></td>

      by intuition. Northrop (1983) defines these as concepts that keep their 
      meaning constant between scientists. The color blue is a concept by intuition. 
      These concepts are widely accepted and may have no rigorously defined place 
      in a particular theory under consideration.</font></td>

    <td valign="top" colspan="4" rowspan="3"> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        first requirement is to produce as precise a definition as possible of 
        the problematic situation. We make a conceptual and propositional analysis 
        of the theory. Of course the postulates will be of little value unless 
        investigations can be implemented that will result in data and comparisons. 
        This means analysis of what we think we know, axioms, and as rigorous 
        a definition as possible of the postulates (figure <a href="#Fig_3.1.1">3.1.1</a>). 
        Although we may think of data as representing the real world, this representation 
        is restricted by the postulates we construct, so it is essential to have 
        them well-defined first.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We sometimes refer 
        to data as facts. We can make the distinction between two types of facts, 
        observed and described. It is important to note that there is no such 
        thing as "pure fact." The iterative nature of scientific investigation 
        means that collecting data is always done with some proposition in mind, 
        however basic it may be. If, for example, you choose to start an investigation 
        by making a survey, the proposition exists that what you are surveying 
        is important in the theory. Nothing is neutral. "Pure fact" cannot be 
        communicated; to communicate you must describe it in a context. Ford would 
        extend this argument further to say that there is no such thing as pure 
        fact, and the term "immediately apprehended fact" is a better designator. 
        It is a contradiction to say "Let the facts speak for themselves!" They 
        do not exist other than in association with a postulate. Measurements 
        and observations should have information content, and it is the job of 
        the scientist to maximize that information content. This can be done only 
        if the limitations and explicit and implicit contexts of measurement and 
        observation are understood.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conceptual analysis highlights 
      two important challenges in scientific research. First, we have to appreciate 
      that our units of logical analysis, the concepts, are all of our own construction 
      and, as such, they are very likely to change. The terms intellection, imagination, 
      intuition, and inspection each describe mental processes, but ones that 
      we ourselves may have difficulty in separating into precise activities. 
      This is part of the second challenge of scientific research. It is a continuous 
      process, where what we discover may not only deny our theories but almost 
      inevitably will challenge the present construction. Our concepts by intuition 
      and inspection, those we develop to describe the investigations, must be 
      matched against concepts by imagination, those that we have developed to 
      extend our theory. There is almost always a need for refinement of our concepts 
      by imagination as we develop them into concepts by intellection, and this 
      in turn demands adjustment in the meaning and relative importance of the 
      concepts by intellection used in the construction of our original concepts 
      by imagination.</font></td>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That which establishes 
        the truth of anything. Generally, proof is confined to the arguments of 
        mathematical theorems. Proof is a formal, logical relationship between 
        propositions. It is independent of the status of the concepts used in 
        the construction of axioms and postulates.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ratification, confirmation, 
        substantiation. Clearly, science works by seeking confirmation in measurement 
        of what has been considered in logical development. But that is NOT sufficient 
        for the scientific method. Validation is something done to parking tickets-though 
        that use of the word is also outside the dictionary definition. What is 
        meant is that a merchant or business may certify that parking is free. 
        In both cases, the attempt to use "validate" as a one?word description 
        of a process violates the original meaning of the word. For parking tickets, 
        one can (possibly) tolerate the violation as part of the charm of language 
        development. In science, one cannot tolerate it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Verification</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Testifying, ascertaining, 
        confirming, or testing the truth or accuracy of, asserting or proving 
        to be true. While this definition of verification includes confirming, 
        confirmation is only part of the scientific method. The element of testing 
        included in the definition of verification makes it wider than either 
        validation or proof.</font></p>

        we can advance the growth of objective knowledge. Sometimes rival propositions 
        are explicit and exciting; sometimes they may require the diligent and 
        routine investigation of a series of alternatives. An important problem

      of Multiple Working Postulates</font></td>
    <td valign="top" colspan="4"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An 
      essential element of the philosophy of scientific methodology is having 
      multiple postulates. Because we cannot be sure of our propositions, we should 
      examine different ones. The examination of multiple propositions can be 
      considered to be a function of a community of scientists or a philosophy 
      for the individual. Chamberlin (1965) advanced his philosophy for the individual 
      in terms of the method of "multiple working hypotheses." He used the term 
      "hypothesis" in its general and not restricted statistical sense. His article, 
      written in 1890, compared the attitudes of working with multiple propositions 
      to that of working with a single proposition or that of working with a ruling 
      theory. His plea was for scientists to keep their minds open. He considered 
      that adopting a single proposition was akin to parenting and could lead 
      to unconscious processes of selection and neglect of argument and debate 
      in favor of the single proposition. Chamberlin suggested that multiple propositions 
      are particularly valuable where complex explanations can be anticipated. 
      He used as his example the geological processes that led to the formation 
      of the Great Lakes. This could not be ascribed to one process-e.g., glaciation-but 
      was probably the result of a number of contributing processes. This is an 
      interesting example because in geology (as frequently in ecology) one is 
      intent to develop a theory about a system where there may be multiple processes 
      operating.</font></td>

          by inspection) we intend to make will represent the concept by imagination 
          effectively. Before we specify a hypothesis, we must be sure that our 
          measurements will allow us to detect any effect of a treatment. Measurement 
          accuracy requires a combination of accuracy of the instrument making 
          the measurement and sufficient sampling to define the natural range 
          of variation. It may be necessary to define the sampling distribution 
          of measurements to see whether mathematical transformations will be 
          required.</font></li>

        what predictions can be made. Attempts to proceed too soon to develop 
        a falsifiable or confirmatory hypothesis may lead to premature rejection 
        of a partially correct theory. The objective of the maturation process

      review of the scientific method is an abridged version of Ford's lectures. 
      Specifically missing is the mathematics involved (e.g., testing the null 
      hypothesis). This is beyond the scope of this guide, but this information 
      is available in any undergraduate statistics text. In summary, the scientific 
      method can be explained as a process whereby the scientist conceptually 
      develops an idea; tests the idea through a battery of observations and measurements; 
      rejects, accepts, or modifies the idea; and shows his or her proof for peer 
      review (and hopefully acceptance).</font></td>
