          The Management Situation</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          geologic history, origin, and processes of a forest landscape have fundamental 
          influences on the capabilities and limitations of the land. The geologic 
          characteristics of an area influence landform formation, soil profile 
          development and soil characteristics, and ground-water occurrence; they 
          consequently influence vegetative types and patterns. Areal geology 
          affects the ability to manage a forest without causing adverse environmental 
          effects or impairing future land productivity. The geology of an area 
          also provides opportunities for recreation, education, and scientific 
          research. Knowledge of the geologic capabilities and limitations of 
          a national forest should result in a better understanding of the trade-offs 
          and "opportunity cost" of alternative management strategies. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Comprehensive 
          geologic information is not easily available to planners at most national 
          forests. This is because the U.S. Forest Service lacks a uniform system 
          to store and display basic geologic information. A system does not exist 
          for a variety of reasons, including a lack of a clearly demonstrated 
          need, overestimation of the costs of acquiring such information, and 
          the misconception that the information is already available from other 
          resource inventories. </font></p>

          the Need for a <BR>
          Geologic Information System</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several 
          problems that occurred on the Gifford Pinchot National Forest (GPNF) 
          underscored the need for a geologic information system.</font></p>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Availability of 
          information was people-dependent. It was recognized that information 
          became lost, stored in project files, or worse, stored in people's minds. 
          If employees left the GPNF, they took with them information gathered 
          at considerable expense.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The quality of 
          information was varied. With no consistent terminology, decisions about 
          how to compile, save, and apply information were subjective and depended 
          on the level of experience of the individuals involved. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Involvement was 
          often late and costly. Geologists working on the GPNF are assigned to 
          the Engineering Branch, due to the traditional role of geologists in 
          project design. Because of the lack of a geologic information system 
          and time to gather planning-level information on a project basis, geologic 
          expertise was usually sought only after planning decisions had been 
          made. Many decisions involved road building or timber harvest in an 
          area where, because needed geologic resources were lacking or the geologic 
          conditions were adverse, difficulties were later encountered. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Involvement in 
          planning was recognized as being valuable. If basic geologic information 
          was available at even a small scale, the consistencies (or inconsistencies) 
          of geologic resources, conditions, and processes might be projected 
          across an area between locations for which some information was available. 
          If such projected information was readily available, planners and land 
          managers would become aware that geologists could be involved in planning 
          efforts on a cost-effective basis. Informed decisions pay off in reduced 
          costs and improved resource protection. </font> </li>
      </ul>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the above factors 
      were recognized by geologists, it was not until late 1979 that the GPNF 
      Forest Management Team became aware of the usefulness of a geologic information 
      system. The Forest Planning Interdisciplinary Team was then being formed 
      to develop a Land and Resource Management Plan in compliance with the National 
      Forest Management Act. The Forest Geologist was selected to be a team member. 
      A proposal for formulation of a system to support the planning effort was 
      soon accepted. The intent of the proposal was not only to comply with the 
      needs of the GPNF planning effort, but also to break out of the project 
      mode and use the system in areal analysis. It was predicted that if a well-planned, 
      long-term comprehensive geologic information system was developed, it would 
      result in better management decisions based on better information. </font></td>

        given to format, structure, classification systems, and terminology for 
        the new system. Considerable effort was required to ensure that the system 
        would be technically valid and internally consistent, use nontechnical 
        terminology, and be easily used by geologists and non-geologists alike. 
        Also, organizational commitment was gained to ensure that the accuracy 
        of the system would be maintained and improved through regular updating. 
        Coordination was required to ensure that duplication and overlap with 
        other resource systems (such as soils, hydrology, and minerals) did not

        OF THE GEOLOGIC RESOURCES<BR>
        AND CONDITIONS SUBSYSTEM </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The initial geologic 
        information system was developed after formulating standards and guidelines 
        for information collection. In response to user needs, the format evolved 
        to the present configuration. At the urging of forest managers, the system 
        was included as one component of an overall comprehensive multi-resource 
        information system, and it was designated the Geologic Resources and Conditions 
        (GRC) subsystem. The overall system, known as the Total Resource Information 
        (TRI) system, divides the entire GPNF into more than 200 distinct geographic 
        areas (referred to as compartments) averaging about 6,000 acres each. 
        </font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The name Geologic Resources 
      and Conditions recognizes the basic division of geologic factors into resource 
      development opportunities and potential constraints to certain land-management 
      activities. The map scale used is 4 in. = 1 mi, which matches that of the 
      larger TRI system. A user Subsystem Guide (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
      Forest Service, 1986b, Forest Service]) describes the subsystem, terms, 
      systems, and methods used and possible applications of the GRC subsystem 
      information. Federal regulations, derived from Acts of Congress, and Forest 
      Service manual descriptions derived from those regulations refer to geologic 
      factors as opportunities and constraints to land-management activities. 
      Geologic opportunities include potential development and use of geologic 
      resources. Geologic constraints are factors which affect cost, safety, or 
      feasibility of management activities. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The GRC map system 
        is designed to display basic geologic information in a simple, flexible 
        format. Any land manager can have such a system developed at no major 
        cost, if data and information gathered for site-specific project work 
        are routinely plotted on system map overlays. GRC maps were developed 
        in a three-step process.</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Office preparation: 
          All available information was compiled on the 4 in. = 1 mi system base 
          map overlays. Sources of information included project files and reports, 
          published geologic information, and results of air photo interpretation. 
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Field verification: 
          Whenever possible, this step was accomplished in conjunction with other 
          priority fieldwork. On the whole, only a slight increase in field time 
          was required for verification, which greatly enhanced the product. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Compilation: Boundaries 
          were reconciled, the final map prepared, and a folder developed to store 
          all available maps, photos, and records. </font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Forest Service 
        has established a national Geographic Information Systems (GIS) steering 
        committee with a mandate to monitor, evaluate, and recommend ways to implement 
        technologies and develop a national GIS strategy. Looking ahead to future 
        GIS technology, GRC maps were developed on a controlled (spatial) base 
        map referenced to geographic coordinates to allow accurate digitizing 
        of geologic material unit boundaries and the location of landforms and 
        geologic resources. The GRC subsystem is fully compatible with GIS concepts 
        and software and can be readily digitized. </font></p>

          are stable. Ratings ranged from good (no existing features; materials 
          inherently stable) to poor (some slope movement features; inherently 
          unstable material, especially on steep slopes). </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Modified stability: 
          On the basis of material suitability, terrain, and alternative road 
          prism designs, some areas have a higher probability of slope movement 
          during or after road construction than do other areas. This measure 
          predicts the effects of each alternative on the stability of excavations 
          and embankments. Ratings range from good to poor on the basis of the 
          estimated ability to eliminate slope stability problems along each alternative 
          route. Areas in which there is a high probability of slope movement 
          will require more stabilization measures in project design than those 
          areas in which slope movements are unlikely. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Investigative complexity: 
          Field investigations may reveal conditions requiring special design 
          or construction methods to insure safety and feasibility or to mitigate 
          adverse impacts to other resources. An effect of each mute alternative 
          is the consequent variable degree of investigative complexity, which 
          also carries a variable degree of uncertainty or risk to mute safety, 
          feasibility, cost, or performance. The complexity of the mutes ranged 
          from low (little or no steep terrain, no special structures or construction 
          methods proposed) to high (steep, unstable or potentially unstable terrain, 
          low-suitability earth materials, or one or more special structures proposed).

      </ul>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is worth noting 
        that this analysis began in the fall of 1985, and within a month the area 
        began receiving snowfall. The environmental assessment was completed in 
        early spring. Had the GRC maps for the planning area not been available, 
        it would not have been possible to estimate the effects of alternatives 
        on the geologic resources and conditions due to snow cover. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Ideally, GRC maps 
        are used in the initial planning stages of a project. If this is done, 
        consideration of geologic factors would lead to a recognition of the potential 
        impacts of a project on area geologic resources and conditions. After 
        interdisciplinary analysis and management decision for the project alternative, 
        an assessment can be made of the need for and degree of involvement for 
        geoscientist personnel to participate in the predesign phase. Comparison 
        of a proposed project location with the area GRC map will reveal areas 
        where more intensive site-specific investigation is warranted. After project 
        completion, any additional information on area geologic resources and 
        conditions gained during project area investigations is added to the GRC 
        map to improve its overall accuracy. </font></p>

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>SUMMARY 
        AND CONCLUSIONS </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prior to 1980, the 
        GPNF, like most national forests, did not have a means to store and display 
        geologic information. Consequently, involvement of the geoscientist did 
        not occur until the project design stage, when changes or mitigation of 
        adverse impacts were difficult or prohibitively expensive and time consuming. 
        If a geologic information system that was easy to use, readily updated, 
        and technically valid could be developed, use of geologic information 
        would increase. With greater information availability, involvement would 
        shift from project design to forest-wide planning and area analysis. If 
        such a shift could occur, it was predicted that cost of project investigation 
        and design would be reduced, and unforseen environmental consequences 
        would also diminish. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In late 1979, the 
        opportunity arose to develop such a system with the appointment of the 
        Forest Geologist to the Forest Planning Interdisciplinary Team. A proposal 
        was accepted to develop a long-term geologic information system. This 
        system evolved and was named the Geologic Resources and Conditions Map 
        Subsystem, in recognition of the types of geologic factors (opportunities 
        and constraints) that may affect management activities. The GRC is one 
        of several subsystems in the overall TRI system. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The GRC system is 
        based on information projected from field data collected at specific sites. 
        The information has been interpreted and described in nontechnical terms 
        and is structured for ease of use. Because of its simple format, the system 
        can be easily updated, and its accuracy increases as new information is 
        acquired. Forest Service planners, engineers, and foresters have been 
        trained in use of the system, and, due to availability and simplicity 
        of the system, geologist involvement has broadened from project design 
        into planning. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since development 
        of the GRC, the following benefits have been observed: </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Geologists have 
          had full involvement in the identification of potentially unsuitable 
          lands during the forest planning process. Forest Service managers have 
          recognized the extent and status of geologic resources and conditions 
          as they may affect future management activities. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The GRC map system 
          has proved useful as a tool from which to estimate both the general 
          effects of proposed projects on the area's geologic resources and conditions 
          and the effect of those geologic factors on the safety, cost, and feasibility 
          on the proposed projects. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The GRC map system 
          has been shown to be useful in estimating project complexity and hence 
          timing and scope of involvement of geoscientist personnel. The GRC provides 
          the basic data to perform and verify area slope stability analyses for 
          the GPNF cumulative effects assessment process. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data extracted 
          from the GRC will be used in the future for planning the use of substitute 
          earth anchor systems for use as logging tower tailholds. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Using GRC maps, 
          engineering geology staff can prioritize their involvement in planning 
          for various projects. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GRC maps provide 
          data to share with other state and federal agencies, researchers, and 
          schools. For example, the State of Washington Department of Natural 
          Resources Division of Geology and Earth Resources used the GRC extensively 
          in producing the geologic map of the southwest quadrant of Washington 
          (Walsh et al., 1987). </font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The GRC system was 
        built on accurate topographic maps, making spatial location of features 
        and digitizing of the location of materials boundaries and geologic resources 
        and conditions a possibility in the future. This makes the GRC system 
        fully compatible with Geographic Information System concepts and software.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The GRC map system 
        is easy to construct. Once agreement was reached on format and materials 
        classification systems (fully documented in a User Guide), the system 
        was implemented by starting with project file information, published geologic 
        reports, and air photo interpretation. As opportunities arise, GRC maps 
        can be field verified and supplemented with additional information. With 
        rime, the maps will increase in accuracy. </font></p>

          Olympic National Forest, it is not economical to build new roads and 
          harvest timber because the source of rock road material is far from 
          the site and the mature timber is not large enough for the saw mill. 
          One solution to this problem is the, use of wood chip as road base course 
          material. By processing wood chips onsite, this material can be transported 
          ready for a pulp mill and the remainder can be used in road construction.
