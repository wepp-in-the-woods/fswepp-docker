      <b>6J.2 General Information</b> </font> </td>
    <td> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proper design 
        of a slope stabilization structure requires that the materials used (whether 
        earth, manufactured, or both) have adequate strength to withstand the 
        forces to which they may be subjected during its lifetime. These materials 
        should be used such that the cost of the structure will be reasonable 
        for the conditions present at the site. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In slope stabilization 
        construction, it is common practice to use material that is available 
        on-site or nearby rather than specifying one that may have the desired 
        properties but is located a considerable distance from the site. A number 
        of different procedures can be used to enable earth materials to be used 
        satisfactorily in slope stabilization. It is important when using earth 
        as material in slope stabilization construction that the personnel in 
        charge of construction control be familiar with the design requirements 
        and that they ensure that the structures meet these requirements (U.S. 
        Dept. of the Interior, 1974). The geotechnical engineer needs to make 
        sure that the official in charge of inspection and construction control 
        (this may well be the geotechnical engineer) understands any special geotechnical 
        design or construction requirements before construction proceeds. This 
        information should also be discussed at pre-bid and pre-work meetings 
        so that the (prospective) contractor understands the project's special 
        functional requirements.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Slope stabilization 
        projects require a close relationship between design and construction. 
        During construction, the construction engineer and project designer need 
        to compare the design assumptions with the actual conditions observed 
        in the field during construction. Differences between assumed and actual 
        conditions and associated construction problems need to be resolved. This 
        may require additional geotechnical analysis (using the actual parameters 
        discovered during construction) and contract changes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In summary, a high 
        degree of cooperation and coordination is required of the contractor, 
        construction engineer, design engineer, and geotechnical engineer. Field 
        inspection during construction is vital to the success of the stabilization 
        project.</font></p></td>

      <b>6J.3 Process</b> </font> </td>
    <td> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Slope stabilization 
      structures designed by Forest Service geotechnical engineers are usually 
      built under contract. The foundation of the contract is a set of plans and 
      specifications containing a schedule of work items. Based on the information 
      provided in the plans and specifications, the contractor submits a set of 
      prices for accomplishing the items of work which, if accepted, becomes a 
      part of the agreement between the Forest Service and the contractor. The 
      primary purpose of the construction control organization is to ensure that 
      the structure is built according to the plans and specifications; this includes 
      tracking the items of work required and the payment due the contractor. 
      Sometimes conditions in the field differ from those assumed to exist during 
      preparation of the plans and specifications (see section <a href="#6J.2">6J.2</a>). 
      If a changed condition does exist and adjustments to the plans and specifications 
      are required, a change order is agreed upon by the contractor and contracting 
      officer. It is imperative that the geotechnical engineer keep abreast of 
      the project, either by being on the site during critical phases of the project 
      or by being kept informed by the construction engineer. If a changed condition 
      exists, then he or she can be involved in the technical aspects of the changes 
      to the plans and specifications.</font></td>

    <td> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The natural variability 
        of soil, and the large number of methods used to treat the soil, make 
        it impractical to write specifications to cover every condition that might 
        exist for a slope stabilization project. Also, the experiences of the 
        contractor and Forest Service construction staff are probably not the 
        same; therefore, they will interpret the requirements of the work at hand 
        in the context of their respective backgrounds. It is not unusual to find 
        differences of opinion between the contractor and Forest Service construction 
        staff concerning the intent and requirements of the plans and specifications, 
        especially at the beginning (U.S. Dept. of the Interior, 1974). If this 
        occurs, the geotechnical engineer may have to explain the requirements 
        for the work in a way that is acceptable to both the contractor and contracting 
        officer. This problem often can be avoided by good pre-work communication.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Specification requirements 
        for earthwork construction are of two types: those based on performance 
        (also known as end-result specifications) and those based on procedures 
        (U.S. Dept. of the Interior, 1974). It is important to know the distinction 
        between the two. Usually, when performance is the requirement, it is not 
        correct for the project engineer to demand that a particular construction 
        procedure or equipment be used to produce a specific result. When procedure 
        is the basic requirement, the project engineer may not demand that a specific 
        performance (or end result) be attained.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Specification requirements 
        are also of two other kinds: explicit requirements and those characterized 
        by such phrases as "as directed by the contracting officer or project 
        engineer." The second type of requirement is usually avoided wherever 
        possible. There are three cases in which the non-explicit type of requirement 
        is used: (1) producing minor dimensions in areas where investigations 
        to determine such dimensions are not warranted; (2) areas where any of 
        several possible methods would be satisfactory; and (3) new conditions 
        for which requirements have not been established (U.S. Dept. of the Interior, 
        1974). </font></p></td>

        is determined by visual examination, measurement, and testing (U.S. Dept. 
        of the Interior, 1974). The extent to which each of these methods is used 
        will depend on local conditions, the value and importance of the work 
        being inspected, and the skill and experience of the inspector. The balance 
        of these methods also will vary as the project progresses. During the 
        beginning of the project, intuitive (experiential) and visual judgment 
        should be verified at frequent intervals by tests and measurements. In 
        some cases, the amount of measuring and testing can be reduced as the 
        work progresses, but it should never be entirely eliminated (U.S. Dept.

        is started, the engineer and the contractor should review the topography 
        and the erosion control plan for the project. As the representative of 
        the Forest Service, it is the engineer's responsibility to protect the 
        property and facilities adjacent to the project from environmental pollution 
        originating from the project (Transportation Research Board, 1990). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is in the contractor's 
        best interest to control surface erosion so that damage to completed work 
        is minimized and present and future work are not jeopardized. The benefits 
        of erosion control are large. From the Forest Service point of view, the 
        adjacent lands and streams need to be protected from construction pollutants; 
        from the contractor's point of view, surface water is prevented from saturating 
        the foundation and embankment area and facilitates such operations as 
        trench excavation and subsurface drain installation. </font></p></td>

    <td valign="top"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Satisfactory 
      earthwork is most easily accomplished by careful monitoring of contract 
      compliance early in the contract (Transportation Research Board, 1990). 
      Spending a significant amount of time closely inspecting the work at this 
      stage will be time well spent because, once the contractor has established 
      a satisfactory earthwork operation, the project generally runs smoothly. 
      Input from the geotechnical engineer can be highly beneficial at this stage 
      of construction. For example, he or she may alert the inspector to the fact 
      that the material being compacted is a clayey silt which is highly moisture-sensitive. 
      Knowing this, the inspector would carefully monitor the process or end result 
      to ensure that excess water is not added to the material. It is important 
      for the inspector to be familiar with the contractor's proposed earthwork 
      construction plan because this will help in scheduling the inspector's duties. 
      This in turn results in more efficient inspection requiring less field testing.</font></td>

    <td valign="top"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The specifications 
      may require that top- or mid-slope ditches be completed before materials 
      are removed from the cut. Some contractors like to ignore this requirement 
      because it is not a pay item (as are excavation and fill embankment), assuming 
      that they can complete this work in their spare time (Transportation Research 
      Board, 1990). If the ditch work is not done in the beginning, problems that 
      are harmful to the work may occur and expensive corrective procedures may 
      be required. </font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two 
        problems may occur if ditches are not completed during the correct phase 
        of construction. First, the ditches are designed to intercept surface 
        runoff that would otherwise flow down the slope and into the excavation. 
        This water could cause serious erosion and problems with cut slope stability. 
        Second, if the water is allowed to flow into the excavation, the soil 
        in the excavation and cutbank may become saturated, which will make it 
        difficult to achieve specified compaction (Transportation Research Board, 
        1990). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To prevent such problems, 
        the contractor should be required to submit a work plan describing progression 
        of work. This work plan should be discussed during the pre-work meeting

      Preparing the foundation may require removing the topsoil and organic deposits, 
      adding material to establish a stable foundation, and compacting the ground 
      surface. A geotechnical engineer should inspect the prepared foundation 
      before the fill is placed on it. For problems encountered during the design, 
      exact treatment will be shown on the plans or described in the contract 
      documents. If foundation conditions differ from what was anticipated, the 
      inspector should consult the design engineer and the geotechnical engineer.

      compaction is one of the most important parts of the earthwork portion of 
      a slope stabilization project. An evenly and densely compacted embankment 
      will provide a reasonable platform upon which to place running courses (in 
      the case of road construction). If the embankment is uniformly compacted 
      during construction, then, assuming the foundation is stable, the running 
      course will behave uniformly. Compaction increases bearing capacity, slope 
      stability, and resistance to frost action and decreases settlement and permeability. 
      Poor compaction may result in general and differential settlement, which 
      cause depressions, premature failure of the running course, and possibly 
      failure of the embankment itself. </font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The

        to drive hauling equipment as evenly as possible over the entire surface 
        of the embankment during fill placement. This helps reduce the total amount 
        of compaction required and minimizes rutting and damage that might be 
        caused by heavy repetitive concentrated tracking by equipment (Transportation 
        Research Board, 1990). Large loaded scrapers may overload even a densely 
        compacted embankment. The performance of the embankment under the tires 
        of heavy equipment will give a good indication of the uniformity and quality 
        of compaction.</font></p></td>

      <b>6J.7.8.1 Compaction-Moisture Control</b></font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All 
        projects that have the AASHTO compaction specifications should receive 
        from the laboratory a set of laboratory compaction control curves developed 
        from standard (AASHTO T-99) or modified (AASHTO T-180) Proctor values 
        representing the soil being used in the embankment. These curves are plots 
        of density (dry unit weight) versus moisture (water content) and provide 
        a standard of acceptability for the field tests (Transportation Research 
        Board, 1990). When field compaction control tests are performed, the results 
        are compared with the laboratory compaction control values to determine 
        the applicable percent of maximum density, called the relative density 
        or the percent compaction. The specifications will give the percent compaction 
        required (i.e., 95 percent of T-99). If this value is not obtained, more 
        compactive effort or a change in the water content will be required to 
        reach the minimum specified value (Transportation Research Board, 1990).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moisture control becomes 
        more important as the particle size of the material being compacted decreases. 
        Clays are more sensitive to changes in moisture content than are sands. 
        Small amounts of fines in granular materials will have a marked effect 
        on the moisture requirements. Well-graded materials will usually have 
        steep, sharp compaction control curves showing a well-defined optimum 
        moisture content (OMC). Uniform materials, especially sands, will show 
        flat curves without a well-defined OMC. Uniform materials may be compacted 
        properly at a large range of moisture contents (Transportation Research 
        Board, 1990). For further discussion on moisture control, see section

      <b>6J.7.8.2. Compaction-Weaving and Pumping</b></font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Weaving-and-pumping 
        is an elastic-type deformation of soil. When loaded, the material deforms, 
        and when the load is removed, the material springs back to its original 
        position. The construction equipment looks as if it were riding on a wave 
        as it travels over the fill. The soil will deflect and a wave will be 
        created ahead of the wheel, but once the equipment moves on, the area 
        looks unchanged (although there may be some cracking of the surface). 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Weaving occurs when 
        the soil is too moist and does not have time to drain as the load is applied, 
        thus creating excessive pore water pressure. The load is shared by the 
        soil structure and the pore water pressure. This gives a temporary elasticity 
        to the soil and creates the weaving or pumping effect. In this condition 
        the strength of the soil is dramatically lowered. The best way to solve 
        the problem is to stay off the affected area and allow the excess pore 
        water pressures to dissipate naturally (Transportation Research Board, 
        1990). The soil will then regain its strength. If the fill is weaving 
        as a result of the compaction equipment, a smaller compactor will result 
        in lower pore water pressures and help reduce weaving and pumping. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Initially the weaving 
        does not damage the embankment, but if the excess loading is repeated, 
        pore pressures will continue to build and may eventually result in shear 
        failure or rutting. If a weaving condition exists, a geotechnical engineer 
        should be consulted. Weaving conditions can be verified by testing for 
        moisture-density specifications. Weaving could be caused by saturation 
        of embankment material by ground water flow or surface drainage. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

        is a surface shear or bearing failure caused by equipment moving across 
        the embankment. When the loading exceeds the shear strength of the soil, 
        the soil is displaced, the wheel sinks, and deep ruts occur. Rutting destroys 
        uniform compaction and makes it difficult to place the next lift to uniform 
        thickness. The quality of the work suffers. It is the contractor's responsibility 
        to take corrective measures, such as changing the method of operation, 
        materials, or loading (Transportation Research Board, 1990).</font></p>

        the contractor will use whatever equipment he already owns or has leased

      <b>6J.7.8.5. Compaction in Confined Areas</b></font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Compaction 
        projects may be in large areas that are accessible to normal-sized compactors 
        or in confined areas accessible only to smaller, highly maneuverable, 
        or hand-operated mechanical compactors (Transportation Research Board, 
        1990). There is no precise definition of confined areas; therefore, each 
        case should be considered on its own. Backfill behind retaining walls 
        and minor structures are common examples of projects that require confined-area 
        compaction.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Compaction equipment 
        typically used in small, confined areas includes compactors with a tamping 
        foot that is actuated by a small two-cycle engine, static vibratory plate 
        compactors (that must be manually pushed or pulled), and small self-propelled 
        static or vibratory rollers controlled by an operator walking behind.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Equipment that is 
        not acceptable in some situations may be acceptable in confined areas. 
        The basic question for a confined-area compactor is: "Will it do the job?" 
        (Transportation Research Board, 1990). Material compacted in confined 
        areas should be limited to lifts of not more than 6 to 8 inches before 
        compaction. Some equipment may require thinner lifts. The material should 
        be compacted with a sufficient number of passes to meet the specification 
        density requirements (Transportation Research Board, 1990). The inspector 
        should consult with the geotechnical engineer if he or she has any questions 
        or problems with compaction in confined areas.</font></p>

      <b>6J.7.8.6. Compaction Inspection</b></font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        field inspector has a number of things to check during compaction operations. 
        There may be different density requirements for different parts of the 
        stabilization project, and certain types of compaction equipment may work 
        better with one soil type than another. Diligent inspection can ensure 
        that the work is done according to the specifications.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Various methods are 
        commonly used to specify compaction control. Performance of moisture-density 
        measurements may be required at randomly selected sampling sites. If the 
        project is large, the embankment to be compacted may be divided into lots 
        and the acceptance of each lot determined by the statistical outcome of 
        random sampling within it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Embankment compaction 
        may also be controlled by the use of test strips. A compaction test strip 
        is specified for each soil type or for a certain number of lots. The type 
        of compaction equipment and the number of passes required to achieve specified 
        density is recorded. Acceptance of the work is determined by completion 
        of the number of passes with the right equipment.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The inspector should 
        ensure that the compactor applies at least the minimum number of passes 
        at or below a maximum speed. The initial passes increase the density of 
        the soil significantly. Therefore it is important that the minimum number 
        of passes are applied so the bottom of the lift will be adequately compacted 
        and there will be no significant settlement of that layer.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Corrective methods 
        should be taken when the lift being compacted shows significant weaving, 
        pumping, or rutting under the force of the compactor. The compactor's 
        merely leaving a tire print should not be considered significant rutting; 
        if the equipment displaces the soil laterally out of the wheelpath and 
        leaves a visible rut, then the compaction procedure must be evaluated 
        and modified.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main purpose of 
        inspection of the compaction operations is to validate that the soil is 
        uniform and dense (Transportation Research Board, 1990). Once the inspector 
        is aware of how the compaction and hauling equipment affects a correctly 
        compacted layer, the contractor should be allowed to proceed with additional 
        fill when the minimum specification requirements have been met. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It may be necessary 
        to perform density tests more frequently at the beginning of the project 
        or when a new soil type is encountered.</font></p></td>

    <td> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is becoming 
        very common to use some type of tensile reinforcement in backfills behind 
        retaining walls, earth embankments, and slope stabilization projects (Transportation 
        Research Board, 1990). A number of reinforcing materials, such as steel 
        strips, sheets of geotextiles or geogrids, welded wire mats, metal grids 
        or bars, and various anchor systems, have all been used successfully for 
        reinforcement. Soils are relatively strong in compression and shear but 
        are weak in tension. When a material of high tensile strength is placed 
        in the soil, the soil mass possesses greater strength and is able to experience 
        larger movements without distress. The mechanically stabilized embankment 
        (MSE) structure must satisfy both external and internal stability requirements 
        and be durable enough to last the entire design life. For additional material 
        concerning design and use of MSE's, see section <a href="ssg_6f.html">6F</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earthwork construction 
        control for MSE structures is basically the same as for conventional retaining

        gradation, connection details, construction sequence, etc. (Transportation 
        Research Board, 1990). Several of the proprietary firms have published 
        quality control procedures and manuals. The Forest Service also has specifications 
        for MSE structures. The contractor should obtain a copy of the proprietary 
        manuals from the company and a copy of the Forest Service specifications 
        for the project MSE structure. The recommendations for these structures 
        should be followed as closely as possible. Field substitution of backfill

        the foundation involves the removal of unsuitable materials from the area

      <b>6J.8.5 Backfill</b> </font> </td>
    <td> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reinforced backfill 
      structures usually require at least 95 percent of the maximum dry density, 
      as determined by AASHTO T-99, in order to mobilize adequate frictional properties 
      along the reinforcement (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1975).</font> <hr>

      Placement</b></font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On 
        the majority of Forest Service projects, the backfill for MSE walls and 
        embankments is gathered from the project site and placed with reinforcement. 
        A facing is added if it is to be a wall. The material in the fill is normally 
        tested for the standard engineering properties during the design stages, 
        and it is the results of these tests that are used to design the MSE wall 
        or embankment.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Consistent</i> 
        compaction is critical. The lift thickness of wall fill must be controlled 
        according to specification requirements and vertical location of reinforcement 
        elements. The uniform loose lift thickness of the reinforced backfill 
        should not exceed 12 inches (Christopher et al., 1990). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moisture and density 
        control is critical. Wall fill material should be placed and compacted 
        within 2 percent on the dry side of the optimum moisture content. Placement 
        moisture content can have a substantial effect on the reinforcement-soil 
        interaction. Moisture content higher than optimum makes it increasingly 
        difficult to maintain an acceptable facing alignment, especially if the 
        fines content is high (Christopher et al., 1990). Moisture content that 
        is too low could result in significant settlement during periods of precipitation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reinforced backfill 
        should be deposited onto or parallel to the rear or middle of the reinforcements 
        and bladed toward the front face. Construction equipment should not come 
        into direct contact with the reinforcements. Soil layers should be compacted 
        up to or even slightly above the elevation of each level of the next reinforcement 
        prior to placing that layer of reinforcing elements (Christopher et al., 
        1990).</font></p>

      Compaction Equipment<br>
      </b></font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within 
        3 feet of the wall or slope face, use small single or double drum vibratory 
        rollers or vibratory plate compactors. Placement of the backfill in the 
        front should not lag behind the rest of the structure by more than one 
        lift. Poor fill placement and compaction in this area has sometimes resulted 
        in vertical void immediately behind the facing elements (United States 
        Department of Transportation, 1990). Within this 3-foot zone construction 
        control should be maintained by method specification (such as three passes 
        of a vibratory plate compactor). High quality fill is sometimes used in 
        this zone to achieve the desired properties with less compactive effort. 
        Use of excessive compactive effort or overly heavy equipment near the 
        wall face may result in lateral displacement of the wall face or structural 
        damage and overstressing of the reinforcement elements (Christopher et 
        al., 1990).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Generally, with the 
        exception of the 3-foot zone directly behind the wall face or slope face, 
        large smooth drum vibratory rollers should be used to obtain the desired 
        compaction (Christopher et al., 1990). Sheepsfoot rollers should not be 
        used because of their potential to damage the reinforcements.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Inconsistent compaction, 
        under-compaction due to insufficient compactive effort, and "compaction" 
        of backfill by trucks and dozers will lead to settlement and alignment 
        problems and should not be permitted. Compaction control testing of the 
        reinforced backfill should be done regularly throughout construction.</font></p></td>

    <td> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Subsurface water is 
      usually removed with an underdrain, such as a geotextile-lined, gravel-filled 
      trench or a prefabricated geocomposite drain. For a more thorough discussion 
      of drainage and drains, see section <a href="ssg_6d.html">6D</a>. There 
      are several important points to remember when installing geotextiles and 
      geocomposites to ensure that they work as designed. They should be protected 
      from exposure to sunlight, dirt, and contamination during shipping and storage. 
      Installing and backfilling should be done carefully in order to avoid tearing 
      or puncturing the geotextile. Damage to the core must be avoided, and the 
      drainpipe and its outlets must be properly located and aligned.</font></td>

        for examples of slope stabilization projects that use temporary excavations 
        and/or trenches as part of the construction process.) These methods of 
        construction pose a serious risk to all persons involved with the project. 
        The greatest risk is in collapse, and when this occurs there is a higher 
        probability of worker fatalities than with other excavation-related accidents 
        (U.S. Department of Labor, 1991). Therefore, this section will cover the 
        main points in the safety, stability, and design of excavations and trenches. 
        For more in-depth coverage of this subject, refer to the U.S. Department 
        of Labor (1990) and (1991), both of which are excellent.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the Occupational 
        Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), "A trench is referred to as a 
        narrow excavation made below the surface of the ground in which the depth 
        is greater than the width-the width not exceeding 15 feet. An excavation 
        is any manmade cut, cavity, trench, or depression in the earth's surface 
        formed by earth removal" (U.S. Department of Labor, 1991). Excavations 
        can be made for anything from cellars to highways.</font></p></td>

    <td valign="top"> <hr> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OSHA 
      requires that in all excavation where employees are exposed to potential 
      cave-ins, they must be protected by: (1) sloping the sides of the excavation, 
      (2) benching the sides of the excavation, (3) supporting the sides of the 
      excavation, or (4) placing a shield between the side of the excavation and 
      the work area. The contractor is allowed to choose the most practical of 
      these four design approaches. Once a method has been selected, the required 
      performance criteria must be met by that system (U.S. Department of Labor, 
      1991).</font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        OSHA standard does not require the installation and use of a protective 
        system when an excavation is made entirely in stable rock, or is less 
        than 5 feet deep and a competent person has examined the ground and found 
        no indication of potential cave-in (U.S. Department of Labor, 1991).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The standard prohibits 
        excavation below the level of the base or footing of any foundation or 
        retaining wall unless a support system such as an underpinning is provided, 
        the excavation is in stable rock, or a registered professional engineer 
        examines the structure and decides that it is sufficiently far from the 
        excavation to pose no hazard to employees (U.S. Department of Labor, 1991).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The OSHA standard 
        provides several different methods and approaches for designing protective 
        systems used to protect against cave-ins (U.S. Department of Labor, 1990).

        method is to slope the sides of the excavation to an angle not greater 
        than 1-1/2 horizontal to 1 vertical (34&deg; measured from the horizontal). 
        These slopes must be excavated in a configuration in accordance with those 
        for type C soil found in appendix B of the OSHA standard (U.S. Department 
        of Labor, 1990). A slope of this angle or less is considered safe for

        second method, which is applicable to both sloping and shoring, involves 
        using tabulated data approved by a registered professional engineer. The 
        tables specify required slope angles (on sides of trench) or shoring as 
        a function of soil type and trench depth. The data must be in writing 
        and must include enough explanatory information, including the criteria 
        for determining the selection and the limits on the use of the data, to 
        enable the user to make a decision (U.S. Department of Labor, 1991).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One copy of the above 
        information, along with the name of the registered professional engineer

        a registered professional engineer. OSHA standards allow the use of a

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When a geotechnical 
        engineer is assessing the stability of shallow open cuts, his past experience 
        is usually a good guide. Deep cut stability should be based on geotechnical 
        investigation and slope stability analysis. If an accurate analysis is 
        impossible due to unusual soil conditions, conservative estimates of soil 
        and ground water parameter values should be used in the stability analysis. 
        Studying the condition of previous cuts or trial cuts in the area is also 
        useful. All deep trenches should be monitored closely-preferably instrumented-for 
        signs of collapse.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In attempting to improve 
        the stability of open cuts, the geotechnical engineer should try to decrease 
        the stress within the cut or increase the soil strength. Stress may be 
        decreased by flattening of the slope, partial support, or surface drainage 
        control. Soil strength may be increased by dewatering (drainage), temporary 
        freezing, use of piles, or densification.</font></p></td>
