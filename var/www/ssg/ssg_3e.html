      Importance of Monitoring</font></td>
    <td valign="top" colspan="4" height="387"> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Monitoring 
        can provide valuable information on incipient as well as active landslides. 
        Monitoring of potential slide areas can serve both as a warning system 
        and as a method of gathering important data for use in the analysis of 
        possible repairs. The monitoring of active landslides is one of the few 
        methods of gathering accurate data that can be helpful in determining 
        the causes of a stability problem and in analyzing and designing a solution 
        to stabilizing the landslide. Monitoring can also provide the necessary 
        information to determine whether a constructed repair is working effectively 
        and in accordance with the design requirements. Typical information that 
        can be obtained from monitoring is: </font></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Depth and shape 
          of the sliding surface. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Vertical and horizontal 
          limits of the landslide. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rate of movement 
          of the landslide. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ground water levels 
          or pore pressures. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Relationship of 
          precipitation, ground water, and movement. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Effects of corrective 
          measures regarding some or all of the above. </font></li>
      </ol>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Without the information 
      acquired through some type of monitoring system, many of the variables that 
      have to be identified during a stability analysis remain unknown. As a result, 
      the accuracy with which the slide can be modeled decreases, lowering the 
      designer's confidence in the reliability of the analysis and the resulting 
      recommendations. This will generally result in more conservative designs 
      and thus higher repair costs. </font></td>

      Instrumentation Planning</font></td>
    <td valign="top" height="128" colspan="4"> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Determining 
        the amount and type of monitoring best suited for a particular slide requires 
        adequate planning and preparation. The planning must involve forming a 
        hypothesis as to the causes of the landslide, as well as estimating the 
        surface limits and depth of the slide (see section <a href="ssg_3a.html">3A</a> 
        and appendix <a href="ssg_3ap1.html">3.1</a> on the scientific method). 
        With this hypothesis and the knowledge of possible repair options, a monitoring 
        system can be designed for a particular site. Generally, the instrumentation 
        used should be sufficient to define the magnitude, rate, and distribution 
        of the movement and include some method to collect ground water readings 
        (see section <a href="ssg_4e.html#4E.6">4E.6</a>). If the slide is relatively 
        small and the depth and limits can be determined from surface features, 
        monitoring may be neither economical nor necessary to gather the information 
        required to perform an analysis. Likewise, if it is critical that the 
        repairs be accomplished within a very short time, it may not be practical 
        to install complex or sophisticated monitoring. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the 
        landslide is large and complex, or if the depth of the failure and ground 
        water information cannot be inferred from mapping surface features, then 
        monitoring with inclinometers, standpipes, piezometer, or similar devices 
        may be required to collect adequate data. These types of monitoring systems 
        are generally installed during the drill portion of the subsurface investigation. 
        The cost of installing monitoring when it is done in conjunction with 
        the subsurface investigation is relatively low, and it is a good practice 
        to install at least a slotted PVC pipe in any drill holes that have water 
        level information (see section <a href="ssg_3d.html#3D.6">3D.6</a>). Accurate 
        surface measurements of scarp height, crack location, and so forth, should 
        be collected and referenced during the survey for use as base data for 
        monitoring changes. </font></p></td>

      Types of Monitoring</font></b></td>
    <td valign="top" colspan="4"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
      most landslides, the two critical areas that need to be monitored are the 
      slope movement (magnitude, rate, time movement occurs, etc.), and the changes 
      in ground water levels or pore pressures. The instrumentation available 
      for each of these types of monitoring ranges from simple manual systems 
      to sophisticated electrical devices. The particular equipment selected depends 
      upon the size and complexity of the slide, the overall significance of the 
      site, the cost of the various systems, and the time associated with gathering 
      the data. (For exact descriptions of how to set up and conduct the following 
      types of monitoring, see Wilson and Mikkelsen, 1978.) </font> </td>

      Survey</font></b></td>
    <td valign="top" colspan="4" height="362" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ground 
        surveys are essential to the investigation of all sizes of slides, although 
        the degree of accuracy and sophistication may vary. It is most convenient 
        while the site is being surveyed to locate its boundaries, and such, to 
        install some surface controls that can later be checked to monitor surface 
        displacements. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Standard surveying 
        equipment can be used to install these monitoring systems. The desired 
        accuracy with which they are placed will depend upon the anticipated magnitudes 
        of movement. The survey monitoring should start with the location of several 
        benchmarks well off the active area. The subsequent monitoring can consist 
        of survey lines, grids, targets, and elevations to monitor both horizontal 
        and vertical displacements.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If definite boundaries 
        and scarps have been identified, another useful and inexpensive monitoring 
        technique is the use of stake arrays placed across scarps at the limits 
        of the active areas. To help locate the limits, you must sometimes look 
        for such subtle indications as disturbed vegetation, distortion of shrubs 
        and trees, stretched roots, and displaced rocks or soil. Stake arrays 
        require only an accurate tape measure that will not stretch and some type 
        of permanent markers, such as metal or plastic stakes or pipes. By installing 
        two stakes off the active area and two stakes on the slide mass and taking 
        measurements from each stake to the other three, the magnitude and direction 
        of movement can be determined from subsequent readings. </font></p></td>

      Photogrammetry</font></b></td>
    <td valign="top" colspan="4" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Photogrammetric 
      methods can be used on various sizes of slides to monitor slide changes. 
      For large slides, aerial photography will help delineate the boundaries 
      and determine the relationship of the area of concern to the surrounding 
      geography and geology. Subsequent flights can be made to reveal any significant 
      changes. Varying amounts of detail and precision can be obtained depending 
      upon the elevation of the flight, equipment, and such. If stereo pairs are 
      taken, measurements of surface irregularities and changes can be obtained 
      with sophisticated electronic stereo plotters. With good control, some of 
      these methods are accurate to within less than 1 foot. These methods are 
      generally expensive and use specialized equipment and thus are practical 
      only for large critical sites. However, on-the-ground photography with either 
      still or video cameras will also show changes that occur over time. Using 
      this type of monitoring requires that specific photo points be located well 
      off the active area and that both the angles of the photographs and the 
      lighting be duplicated in subsequent photos. </font></td>

      Extensometers</font></b></td>
    <td colspan="4" ><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Extensometers 
      are another method of measuring the displacement that takes place between 
      two areas of concern. These areas can either be on the surface, such as 
      across a scarp, or between contacts below the surface. Extensometers can 
      either be simple homemade devices read manually on a routine basis or one 
      of several sophisticated systems that take readings automatically at regular 
      intervals. For the information collected from extensometers to be useful, 
      both the magnitude of movement and the exact time the movement was initiated 
      in relation to other factors such as precipitation or ground water levels 
      need to be known. For this reason, the type of extensometers that have to 
      be read manually are of little use other than for academic information or 
      to verify that movement is taking place. It is not realistic to obtain manual 
      readings frequently enough to provide useful data for the analysis process. 
      On the other hand, the automatic recording equipment now available (for 
      example, the continuously recording extensometer developed by Rod Prellwitz; 
      see section <a href="ssg_3d.html#3D.6">3D.6</a>) can record changes in displacement 
      on as short as 15-minute intervals for several months. The equipment is 
      battery-operated, lightweight, reuseable, and easily installed. The information 
      can be downloaded into a personal computer and the resulting displacements 
      plotted on a graph of displacement versus time. When set up in conjunction 
      with ground water recording equipment, this provides invaluable data to 
      be used in the analysis of the stability of the slide. Of course, not all 
      slides demand such sophisticated monitoring, but it is available for complex 
      or critical sites. </font> </td>

      Inclinometers</font></b></td>
    <td colspan="4" ><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order 
      to determine the depth at which movement is occurring on a slide, some type 
      of subsurface monitoring is required. These devices and techniques can also 
      be either simple or sophisticated. A simple technique may consist of manually 
      checking how far various lengths of rods can be lowered down plastic pipes 
      installed in investigation drill holes. A slightly more sophisticated method 
      to determine whether movement is occurring at more than one level can be 
      set up by leaving sections of rebar attached to wire rope at various levels 
      in the pipe and pulling them up to check for displacements in the pipe. 
      If the magnitude of movement is relatively large then either of these methods 
      works well. However, if very small movements are expected, then more sophisticated 
      and more expensive equipment must be used. The standard method involves 
      the installation of grooved plastic pipe down some type of drill hole. With 
      the use of an inclinometer, which measures angles of deflection between 
      various points at specified depths along the plastic pipe, the location 
      as well as the amount and direction of movement can be determined. With 
      the latest equipment, this information can be stored on portable recorders 
      and downloaded into a personal computer and graphs plotted showing the location 
      and magnitude of displacements. Because of the length of the inclinometer 
      device that has to be lowered down the pipe, this method is not useful once 
      displacement occurs that prevents the measuring device from being lowered 
      below the slip surface. Thus, for very rapidly moving slides, the reading 
      must be taken at short intervals so subsequent readings can be compared. 
      If only one set of readings is collected before the pipe shears off or displacements 
      prevent the reader from being lowered down the pipe, then you might as well 
      have used the simple, less expensive method. </font> </td>

      Precipitation, Ground Water, and Pore Pressures</font></b></td>
    <td colspan="4"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because 
      ground water and pore pressures play such an important role in the overall 
      stability of most slopes, it is very important that some type of monitoring 
      be established to gather data regarding precipitation, surface water, and 
      ground water or pore pressures. The monitoring of precipitation is mainly 
      academic, but if enough information can be collected to correlate it with 
      slide activity, then potentially useful predictions about future movements 
      can be made. Rain gages can be installed at the site and equipped with continuously 
      reading data recorders to obtain intensity and duration of rainfall. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More directly applicable 
        in the stability analysis is knowledge of changes in the ground water 
        or pore pressures. The systems used to monitor ground water, like those 
        to monitor movement, can be either simple or elaborate depending upon 
        the complexity and seriousness of the slide. The simplest and most economical 
        method is to install plastic pipes in the holes used for subsurface investigation. 
        The pipes can be slotted with a hand saw and the zones to be monitored 
        can be isolated by placing bentonite clay in the drill hole when backfilling 
        it. After the water levels have stabilized, readings should be taken as 
        frequently as necessary to collect the information to be used in the stability 
        analysis. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Past experience has 
        indicated that in many situations the response time of the ground water 
        to precipitation can be very rapid, and the overall pressure changes that 
        various soil layers are exposed to due to extreme ground water fluctuations 
        can be quite large. Because of the possibility of missing the critical 
        measurements, hand monitoring has proven to be unreliable for collecting 
        information on critical sites. Continuous monitoring systems developed 
        by Rod Prellwitz have proven to be reliable, accurate, and easy to install. 
        They use a sensitive pressure transducer, an electronic timing device, 
        a voltage regulator, and a recording device. The same recording equipment 
        may be used for the extensometer readings and precipitation monitoring, 
        with one system recording both. This allows synchronization and correlation 
        of readings, which is valuable for determining the critical relationships 
        that occur and which must be used in stability analysis and the repair 
        options. </font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If an effective monitoring 
      system has been established and followed, the assumptions are clearer and 
      the necessary work is easier in doing the actual stability analysis. This 
      will result in a more accurate analysis and a more economical solution than 
      if the values had to be conservatively estimated, or if the wrong conclusions 
      were assumed. In most cases, monitoring can be justified from both safety 
      and economical standpoints.</font></td>
