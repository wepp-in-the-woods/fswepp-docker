    <td> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shear keys are 
        commonly used with retaining walls to resist sliding failure. A shear 
        trench, as described in this section, is similar to a shear key and consists 
        of a trench excavated through a potential or existing slope failure surface. 
        Material that has failed or may fail is then replaced with stronger material. 
        Shear trenches can be used alone or as a contributing portion of a combination 
        of actions, such as with a counterbalance weight (buttress). </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The purpose of using 
        a shear trench is to increase the resisting force along a failure surface. 
        A shear trench will accomplish this in two ways. The first is by replacing 
        the material comprising the failure surface with stronger material, usually 
        compacted granular material possessing significantly higher shear strength 
        (angle of internal friction). The depth and width of the trench are determined 
        by stability analysis. The second is by acting as a ground water intercept 
        trench, lowering perched ground water, thereby reducing pore pressures 
        acting on the failure surface. Methods of determining ground water drawdown 
        are discussed further in section <a href="ssg_4e.html#4E.2">4E.2.</a>

    <td valign="top"> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        shear trench is used for shallow, planar-type failures which would be 
        analyzed using a sliding block or a noncircular procedure as discussed 
        in section <a href="ssg_5toc.html">5</a>. As with any slope stability 
        analysis, developing an accurate model to analyze is important. The need 
        for an adequate site investigation to determine such things as the location 
        of soil and rock units, soil and rock strength parameters, ground water 
        location, and the location of potential or existing failure surfaces cannot 
        be overemphasized. The reader is referred to section <a href="ssg_3toc.html">3</a> 
        for guidance in evaluating site conditions and developing a model. </font> 
      </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Items to consider 
        when thinking about using a shear trench for slide stabilization include:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The location of 
          a flatter portion of the slide where construction equipment may gain 
          access to the rest of the slide. </font> </li>
        <li> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The existence 
          of a thin portion of the slide where excavation can be minimized. Benching 
          the excavation could allow the depth to be increased. The Oregon Department 
          of Transportation (ODOT) has found shear trench excavations approaching 
          40 feet in depth become very massive and difficult to construct (ODOT, 
          1991); therefore, they limit shear trench depth to 40 feet as a rule 
          of thumb. </font> </li>
        <li> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Filling or partially 
          filling in the excavation to satisfy stage construction requirements. 
          Often, shear strength along the failure surface and pore pressures acting 
          on the failure surface are the variables most difficult to define. Movement 
          often lowers shear strength to residual values. Repeated (reversed) 
          direct shear tests can be used to estimate residual friction angles. 
          Charts relating simple index tests, such as plasticity index (PI), to 
          residual friction angle are available to estimate residual shear strength. 
          Additional discussion of residual shear strength, tests, and charts 
          can be found in section <a href="ssg_4cs.html#4C.3.4">4C.3.4.</a> Estimated 
          ground water level can be used with the measured residual shear strength 
          to calculate a factor of safety (FOS) along the failure surface. The 
          ground water table can be raised or lowered until the FOS is approximately 
          1. If the investigation has provided some confidence on the ground water 
          conditions at the site, the residual friction angle can be back-calculated 
          by solving for the residual friction angle for an FOS of 0.95 to 1.00. 
          In this back-analysis, the portion of the residual shear strength contributed 
          by cohesion is assumed to be very small or zero (section <a href="ssg_4cs.html#4C.3.4">4C.3.4</a>). 
          Figure <a href="#Fig_6G.1">6G.1</a> shows a slope with the failure surface 
          location inferred by a site investigation. Figure <a href="#Fig_6G.2">6G.2</a> 
          shows the FOS from several XSTABL runs with friction angle plotted against 
          FOS. An estimate of the residual friction angle can be made by setting 
          the FOS to 1 and solving for the friction angle as shown in figure 6G.2.

    <td> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Excavation for 
        the shear trench should be observed by a geologist or geotechnical engineer 
        to confirm that the base of the shear trench is the required depth below 
        the actual failure surface and into competent material based upon the 
        analysis. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In general, shear 
        trench material should consist of clean, hard, durable, free-draining, 
        angular gravel or rock, reasonably well-graded from coarse to fine (ODOT, 
        1988). The shear trench rock should be placed and manipulated to provide 
        a dense and well-filled mass. Geotextile may be required along the shear 
        trench if the trench is also functioning as a ground water cutoff trench. 
        The reader is directed to section 6F and Christopher and Holtz (1984) 
        for further discussion on geotextile design. Collected ground water within 
        the shear trench should be directed away from the slide area. This often 
        can be done by placing a french drain or a perforated pipe along the toe 
        of the shear trench cut slope and carrying the collected ground water 
        off-site in a nonperforated pipe. </font> </p></td>

    <td> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Signs of movement 
      above the shear trench (such as surface cracking) should be expected for 
      2 to 4 years after construction. Minor movement is required to develop shear 
      strength within the shear trench. During slide movement prior to shear trench 
      construction, voids often form in the active wedge. Rearrangement of soil 
      is to be expected, because these voids may surface after construction. Post-construction 
      maintenance should fill in any cracks to reduce voids and water infiltration.
