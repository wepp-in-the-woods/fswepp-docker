      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The following paper 
        gives examples of the three-level analysis concept as used on steep, forested 
        terrain in the Olympic National Forest. The paper also illustrates how 
        slope stability analysis is initiated within the planning process (level&nbsp;I), 
        evolving on a continuum through the project level (level&nbsp;II) and 
        design level (level&nbsp;III). The most important point is that information 
        used in each level can be used in the next levels and vice versa. For 
        example, the design level analyses for road construction and reconstruction 
        in the Binder and Chestershire timber sales were used in the planning 
        analysis of the Backdrop timber sale. Planning boundaries for proposed 
        timber sales frequently change as issues, concerns, and opportunities 
        evolve in the NEPA process. Note that all data available, regardless of 
        artificial boundaries, are viable bits of information at all three levels.

      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The practice of 
        engineering geology in the Olympic National Forest (<a href="#App1.1_Fig1">Figure 
        1</a>), as in other national forests, is a recent development resulting 
        from environmental policy legislation enacted in the late 1960s and early 
        1970s. These laws include the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
        (NEPA), the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, the 
        Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, the 
        Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 (RPA), and 
        the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA). Prior to this suite 
        of legislation, the application of earth sciences in the Olympic and most 
        other national forests was primarily the concern of soil scientists. Geologists 
        were involved almost solely with economic mineral deposits. By 1974, engineering 
        geologists, along with geotechnical engineers, technicians, and drill 
        crews, were employed full-time as members of geotechnical teams in many 
        national forests, including the Olympic. Initially, the practice of engineering 
        geology was limited to solving problems related to road design and construction. 
        However, it soon became apparent that the practice of engineering geology 
        had much broader applications, particularly as related to timber sale 
        project planning. The two case histories presented in this paper, Chestershire 
        and Backdrop timber sales, are examples of how our profession has contributed 
        to project work in the Olympic National Forest and how the "state of the 
        art" has progressed since 1975. </font> </p>

        of Project Investigation and Application</b> </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Since 1975, a majority 
        of project work completed by engineering geologists in the Olympic National 
        Forest has been directed toward planning, locating, designing, and constructing 
        low-volume, single-lane logging roads. Most of this work involves both 
        evaluation and analysis of slope and foundation stability and evaluation 
        of the suitability of rock and aggregate materials for use in construction. 
        </font> </p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Engineering geology 
        projects in the Olympic National Forest are three-tiered and scale dependent. 
        The theory behind this system is that each tier forms a base on which 
        the next higher tier is built. Level 1, the lowest tier, consists of reconnaissance 
        mapping for area planning purposes, at a scale of 1 in. = 2,000 ft (1:24,000). 
        Level 2, the intermediate tier, consists of reconnaissance mapping for 
        transportation planning, or road or facilities location, at a scale of 
        1 in. = 300 ft (1:3,600). Level 3, the highest tier, consists of site-specific 
        investigation, usually for design of roads or other facilities, with data 
        collected at a scale of 1 in. = 50 ft (1:600) or less. </font> </p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The level of data 
        collected is scale dependent. The number of data points and the accuracy 
        and reliability of data collected increase in direct proportion to the 
        square of the percent increase in scale; for example, a section developed 
        at 1 in. = 10 ft has 25 times as many data points as one developed at 
        1 in. = 50 ft. In like fashion, the type of decision that can be based 
        on a specific set of data is also scale dependent, from Level 1 decisions 
        regarding the suitability of a parcel of land for management, modification, 
        or use, to Level 2 decisions regarding impacts along alternative corridors 
        through that parcel, to Level 3 decisions regarding designs to fit terrain 
        characteristics at a specific site along the selected route (<a href="#App1.1_Fig2">Figure

        Standards</b> </font> </p>
      <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Since 
        the inception of the full-time practice of engineering geology in the 
        Olympic National Forest, all project work has followed a set of standards. 
        Rock and soil units designations are based on stratigraphic relations 
        and physical characteristics. Soil units are classified in the field using 
        the Unified Soil Classification System (Casagrande, 1948; American Society 
        for Testing and Materials [ASTM], 1987). Rock units are classified in 
        the field using the Unified Rock Classification System (Williamson, 1984). 
        Designation of rock and soil units is completed at a scale appropriate 
        for the investigative level. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> For Level 1 and 
        2 investigations, a topographic map at the pertinent scale is used for 
        plotting of field data, and specific conditions and interpretations relative 
        to a given location are recorded in a field notebook. Site-specific (Level 
        3) investigative work follows the Field-Developed Cross-Section Method 
        (Williamson et al., 1981). This method involves the measurement to scale, 
        in section, of the distribution of terrain features and related subsurface 
        characteristics of rock, soil, and ground water interpreted by the engineering 
        geologist. Field-developed cross-sections are constructed using the Brunton 
        Compass, hand clinometer, and cloth tape. </font> </p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Level 3 investigations 
        are commonly tied to engineering site surveys for reference. Subsurface 
        exploration is conducted on Level 3 investigations as needed to confirm 
        interpreted subsurface relations, to obtain soil and rock samples, and 
        to conduct tests at specified locations and depths. The payoff for using 
        these standards is a consistent methodology used by the project engineering 
        geologist; this is essential to providing consistently high quality and 
        reliable services to the client. </font> </p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> For specific project 
        applications (usually during Level 3), representative samples of soil 
        and rock units are tested in the materials laboratory for engineering 
        quality and strength parameters following the testing procedures set by 
        ASTM (1987) and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation 
        Officials (1986). Laboratory testing is completed to confirm field testing 
        and to provide more accurate data on materials characteristics and strength. 
        </font> </p>
      <p align="center"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Analytical 
        Standards</b> </font> </p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The goal of slope 
        stability analysis is assessment of risk of failure. Prior to 1984, calculation 
        of factor of safety for these involved "hand cranking" of values using 
        hand-held calculators, or even slide rules. Slope stability analyses were 
        completed only for site-specific investigations of slope movement features. 
        Evaluations of broad areas for risk of failure were usually done subjectively; 
        infrequently, the infinite slope equation was used for area analyses. 
        (Methods of slope stability analysis are outlined in Morgenstern and Sangrey, 
        1978.) </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> With our acquisition 
        of programmable hand calculators and personal computers, the speed and 
        sophistication of analysis increased several orders of magnitude. Prellwitz 
        (1985, 1988; Prellwitz et al., 1985) employed these new tools and refined 
        the three-level method of completing project work. Using the infinite 
        slope equation as part of an algorithm for Levels 1 and 2, Prellwitz wrote 
        the programs Slope Stability Infinite Slope (SSIS) and Slope Stability 
        Infinite Slope for Critical Height (SSISCH) for use on the Hewlett-Packard 
        41 (HP 41) hand-held programmable calculator. (Critical height refers 
        to the maximum height of an excavated road cutslope that can be constructed 
        without slope failure.) Prellwitz (1985) also developed the program Slope 
        Stability Method of Slices (SSMOS) for the HP 41 for use in site-specific 
        (Level 3) analyses; it uses three methods of analysis: Fellenius or Ordinary 
        Method of Slices, Modified Bishop, and Simplified Janbu. Armed with these 
        three programs and the HP 41, the engineering geologist could now finish 
        a major portion of his/her analysis in the field utilizing a field-developed 
        cross-section. Hammond et al. (1988) have taken this work a step further 
        with their program Level I Stability Analysis (LISA) for IBM and other 
        compatible personal computers. The major differences between Prellwitz's 
        calculator-based programs and Hammond's LISA are that the latter uses 
        probability statistics and as many as 1,000 iterations of the infinite 
        slope equation to determine failure probabilities by area. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Forest Service 
        engineering geologist has transitioned through the adoption of these programs 
        from use of a mostly subjective process for planning (Levels 1 and 2) 
        and a somewhat cumbersome but sophisticated slope stability analyses for 
        site-specific (Level 3) projects, to use of easily applied, highly sophisticated 
        computer programs for slope stability analyses for all project phases, 
        from planning (Levels 1 and 2) through design and construction (Level 
        3). This has significantly increased project and program efficiency and 
        effectiveness. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Analyses of rock 
        and aggregate sources are also three-tiered. During Level 1, the quality 
        of each designated rock or soil unit is evaluated to determine potential 
        suitability for use, with the end-product being identification of new 
        prospects to be investigated. During Level 2, rock and soil units are 
        designated and evaluated for each proposed site. Suitability of each unit 
        is evaluated, on the basis of the results of field tests, for the proposed 
        use. The suitability and estimated quantity of rock and aggregate materials 
        must be evaluated along with terrain characteristics and local environmental 
        conditions and the distance of the site from the proposed application 
        to determine whether any further investigative work is warranted. Level 
        3 analyses consist of synthesis of data developed during measurement of 
        field-developed cross-sections, results of lab testing, and confirmational 
        drilling; separation of materials into suitability use zones; and, where 
        appropriate, slope stability analyses using the previously <!-- sic? --> 
        Level 3 methods for soils, plus Hoek and Bray's methods (1981) for analyzing 
        wedge and planar rock failures. </font> </p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> To demonstrate how

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> An investigation 
        of the Chestershire Timber Sale planning area was requested by the Quinault 
        Ranger District in 1978. The stated purposes for the investigation were 
        to: </font> 
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Determine the probability 
          of reactivating the Chester Creek landslide by reopening a segment of 
          Forest Service Road 2261 that crosses the toe of the slide;</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Locate corridors 
          that would be suitable road location alternatives to the existing road 
          crossing the toe of the slide; and</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Determine effects 
          of road development and timber harvest on Chester Creek and other potential 
          slide areas.</font></li>
      </ol>
      <p></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The District Ranger 
        was concerned that a potential increase in sedimentation into Chester 
        Creek would occur as a result of harvesting timber and constructing roads 
        in this planning area. Since Chester Creek was identified as an anadromous 
        fishery, any increase in sedimentation would have a potential for causing 
        both short- and long-term adverse effects. Because of these concerns, 
        the District Ranger requested two investigations, one (Level 1) of the 
        Chestershire planning area, and a second (Level 3) of the Chester Creek 
        landslide. Two teams of engineering geologists were mobilized to conduct 
        both investigations concurrently. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Aerial photographic 
        interpretation and field mapping of the Chestershire Planning Area were 
        completed in 1978. Field mapping was completed according to standards 
        discussed in the introduction of this paper. Soil and rock units were 
        designated and classified. Areas of saturated soils and slope movement 
        features in soil and rock were identified and mapped. Slope percent was 
        measured in the field or derived from existing topographic maps. The map 
        scale used for this study was 4 in. = 1 mi (1:15,840). Analyses of rock 
        structures were completed to identify portions of slopes where the potential 
        existed for slope movement due to road excavation. </font> </p>
      <p> 
      <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Office analyses and 
      documentation included the development of a series of overlays to relate 
      physical characteristics of soil and rock materials and the distribution 
      of ground and surface water to existing slope movement features. This formed 
      a union/intersection of data sets, which allowed the identification of critical 
      factors related to slope stability and erosion. These critical factors are: 
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Slopes greater 
          than 70 percent;</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hard rock units 
          covered by shallow soil;</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adversely oriented 
          mass planar features in rock; and</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Saturated soils.</font></li>
      </ul>
      </font> 
      <p></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A slope stability/erosion 
        zonation map was then compiled from these data (<a href="#App1.1_Fig4">Figure 
        4</a>). Zone 1 has stable slopes; Zone 2 has potentially unstable rock 
        slopes; Zone 3 has slopes that have a low to moderate probability of slope 
        movement; Zone 4 has stable slopes but a high potential for soil erosion; 
        and Zone 5 has unstable soil slopes. Subjective estimates were then made 
        of the potential of initiating slope movements from road construction 
        and timber harvest activities; the scope of predicted effects was also 
        estimated. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A short report (Neal, 
        1979) outlining predicted impacts in each slope stability/erosion zone 
        was submitted to the Quinault Ranger District interdisciplinary timber 
        sale planning team (ID team) as a reference for the timber sale environmental 
        analysis report (EAR) as required under the NFMA. This report included 
        a geotechnical assessment of transportation and logging alternatives and 
        an evaluation of alternative rock sources in the area. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> To answer the question 
        regarding the probability of reactivating the Chester Creek landslide 
        by reconstruction of the existing road, a Level 3 study of the slide area 
        was made concurrently with the Level 1 study of the Chestershire planning 
        area, using standards specified for Level 3 (site-specific investigations) 
        outlined in the introduction. Interpretations of subsurface conditions 
        were confirmed by drill exploration. On the basis of analysis of the slide 
        data, Savage and Neal (1979) recommended that no timber harvesting, road 
        reconstruction, or new road construction be conducted adjacent to or within 
        the landslide area. Results of this investigation were also utilized in 
        the Chestershire Sale EAR. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> It should be noted 
        here that while the level of investigation conducted on the Chester Creek 
        landslide was appropriate for the scope and nature of the problem, it 
        is unusual for Level 3 standards to be applied to project planning and 
        environmental assessment. This example shows, however, that the three-tiered 
        system is a flexible standard that can fit most circumstances. </font>

      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Backdrop Timber 
        Sale Planning Area</b> </font> </p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Since the Chestershire 
        planning area overlaps the Backdrop Timber Sale planning area (<a href="#App1.1_Fig2">Figure&nbsp;2</a>), 
        pre-existing data collected for the former were utilized for the latter 
        as much as possible. Additional fieldwork to cover areas not previously 
        mapped was completed during the 1986 field season. The objectives for 
        this project were the same as those stated for Chestershire. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A series of overlay 
        maps was compiled to augment those used for the Chestershire area. Included 
        as a new overlay was a map of all proposed timber sale clearcut units 
        (<a href="#App1.1_Fig5">Figure&nbsp;5</a>). Each unit was analyzed 
        to determine the probability of slope movement using the LISA computer 
        program. The following data were used for these analyses: physical characteristics 
        and depth of soil, slope percent, the ratio of ground-water depth to soil 
        depth (dw/d), root shear strength, and tree surcharge. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As noted in the 
        introduction, LISA analyses are completed using probability statistics; 
        LISA generates as many as 1,000 iterations of the infinite slope equation. 
        By using LISA, the engineering geologist provides more statistically meaningful 
        results than those provided by the older subjective methods. <a href="#App1.1_Table_1">Table&nbsp;1</a> 
        shows the probability of the occurrence of slope movements for each proposed 
        timber sale clearcut unit under existing natural conditions (base level), 
        after a 50 percent partial cut, and after clear cutting. From the data 
        developed, it is apparent that many of the units are potentially unstable; 
        slope movements are predicted to occur in some even without logging. Aerial 
        photographic interpretation and field reconnaissance of existing clearcuts 
        in the area indicate that the locations of slope movement features appear 
        to correlate well with predictions generated with LISA. Although there 
        are no large slope movement features in the area other than the Chester 
        Creek landslide, there are a number of small features within each timber 
        sale unit. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Calculations of 
        safety factor for the Chester Creek landslide (Savage, 1979) indicated 
        a high probability of failure. Koler (1988) synthesized the Chester Creek 
        landslide data into a format suitable for LISA by using SSIS to back-calculate 
        the physical parameters for input. Results from the LISA analysis for 
        the Chester Creek landslide showed that under natural conditions 68 percent 
        of the area would continue to fail without any timber harvest, as compared 
        to 72 percent after a 50-percent partial timber cut, and 77 percent after 
        clear cutting. These analyses provided a statistical probability for potential 
        management alternatives that clearly shows that the earlier "no go" decision 
        was valid. </font> </p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Results of these 
        analyses were compiled and documented (Koler, 1988) in a report for use 
        in timber sale area environmental analysis. </font> </p>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Quinault District 
        Ranger decided, on the basis of reports by Neal (1979) and Savage and 
        Neal (1979), to abandon the segment of Road 2261 that crossed the toe 
        of the Chester Creek landslide. In 1981, the District Transportation Planner 
        proposed two corridors for possible road construction (<a href="#App1.1_Fig6">Figure&nbsp;6</a>). 
        The first corridor was planned to provide access to slopes west of the 
        Chester Creek landslide, upslope from Road 2261. The second corridor involved 
        the extension of Forest Service Road 2220-011 along a broad glaciofluvial 
        terrace above the west bank of Chester Creek. This extension was planned 
        to provide access to slopes west of Chester Creek and to tie back into 
        Road 2261 southwest of the Chester Creek landslide. A third corridor would 
        provide temporary access across the middle part of the Chester Creek landslide 
        to access timber northeast of the slide, and a fourth was planned (after 
        the third was dropped) to access that same timber from the east. Level 
        2 geotechnical work along these corridors consisted of interpretation 
        of aerial photographs and reconnaissance mapping along proposed alignments 
        at 1 in. = 300 ft (1:3,600) to substantiate Level 1 interpretations and 
        to supplement the detail of available data. During this process, each 
        corridor was divided into terrain segments, and typical ground conditions 
        were sketched in cross-section. Data and information were synthesized 
        and evaluated, and several short reports were written (McBane, 1981a, 
        1981b; Neal, 1982a, 1982b). The Quinault District Ranger's decisions, 
        formed on the basis of these reports, included constructing a road along 
        the second corridor, dropping the first and third corridors, and, tentatively, 
        planning to construct a road along the fourth corridor at a later time.

      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In December 1983, 
        Neal conducted a Level 2 investigation of an area at the toe of the Chester 
        Creek landslide to evaluate the potential for increased slide activity 
        that might result from logging there. As a result of his report (Neal, 
        1983a), a follow-up memo (Neal, 1983b) and subsequent meetings with District 
        and Supervisor's Office staffs, the Chester Creek landslide was removed 
        from further consideration for timber harvesting. </font> </p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As with the Level 
        1 analyses, this Level 2 assessment predated Prellwitz's computer programs. 
        Field and office analyses at that time were still "hand cranked". Since 
        many of the recommendations were based on subjective conclusions, considerably 
        more communications were necessary to reach the recommended decision than 
        have been necessary since probability analyses using LISA have been completed 
        on similar slopes. </font> </p>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When the Backdrop 
        area was first designated for timber sale planning, a great deal of attention 
        was focused on the Quinault Ridge Road (Forest Service Road 2258, <a href="#App1.1_Fig5">Figure&nbsp;5</a>). 
        Prior to any planning of timber sale units or boundaries, the Quinault 
        District Ranger requested a geotechnical report for transportation planning 
        along this road because it is the only access along Quinault Ridge and 
        numerous road-associated slope movements have closed it. A geotechnical 
        reconnaissance for reconstruction of the road was conducted by McBane 
        (1981). As of early 1988, no transportation planning for the Backdrop 
        Timber Sale has been finalized. To complete transportation planning, the 
        1981 geotechnical work by McBane would need updating because of more recent 
        slope movements. Future slope stability analyses will be conducted using 
        Prellwitz's SSISCH and rock slope analysis methods developed by Hoek and 
        Bray (1981). </font> </p>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A site-specific 
        geotechnical investigation was conducted in 1982 along the preliminary 
        survey line (P-line) for design of the 2220-011 tie road along Corridor 
        2 (<a href="#App1.1_Fig5">Figure&nbsp;5</a>). This investigation 
        built upon data collected during Levels 1 and 2 project work. The project 
        engineering geologist divided the P-line into terrain segments. Soil, 
        rock, topographic, and ground- and surface-water conditions were used 
        as criteria for delineating segments. The purpose of segmentation was 
        to provide data and portray conditions that represented typical terrain 
        characteristics, and, in turn, to enable the development engineer to select 
        a design that was appropriate for ground conditions encountered for each 
        segment. The project engineering geologist completed slope stability analyses 
        for areas of existing slope movement features, or which appeared to have 
        the potential for slope movement to be initiated by road construction. 
        In addition to small slope movement features, conditions encountered included 
        steep slopes with saturated soils and spring lines, plastic soils with 
        low shear strength values, and rock slopes with inherent adverse discontinuities.

      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Modified Bishop 
        Method of Slices (Bishop, 1955) was used to analyze features with ongoing 
        or predicted rotational movement. The infinite slope equation was used 
        to analyze features with ongoing or predicted translational movement. 
        Different design alternatives were evaluated for conditions in each segment. 
        The project engineering geologist presented analyses of alternatives and 
        recommendations in his report (Koler, 1982). </font> </p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Wineglass pit,

        phase of drill exploration there prior to the Chestershire road construction 
        was completed in 1981. The Geotechnical Section provided a rock source 
        operating plan to be included in the timber sale contract package (Blair, 
        1982). </font> </p>

        dealing with the suitability of subgrade materials for use at constructed 
        grade level (Neal, 1985; Jordan, 1988). To date, no new logging has been 
        conducted in the area because of decreased demand. Resale of some of the 
        old Chestershire timber sale units is contemplated. </font> </p>

        Timber Sale -- Road 2258000, Station 67+76 to 67+90</b> </font> </p>
      <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In 
        1983, subsequent to McBane's Level 2 investigation of Road 2258000 for 
        transportation planning, a site-specific (Level 3) investigation was conducted 
        of the segment of Road 2258000 between Stations 67+76 and 67+90 to evaluate 
        alternative ways to regain adequate width for log haul. Road 2258000 was 
        needed for log haul for the Binder timber sale area, located on the west 
        slopes of Quinault Ridge. A team comprised of engineering geologists and 
        a geotechnical engineer investigated the site using the field-developed 
        cross-section method, Unified Rock Classification System, and Unified 
        Soil Classification System, as outlined in the introduction. Subsurface 
        conditions were confirmed and foundation strength characteristics were 
        measured during drill exploration (refer to <a href="#App1.1_Fig7">Figure&nbsp;7</a>, 
        Geotechnical Cross Section 30 for Binder Timber Sale). Road alignment 
        alternatives were analyzed using a yarder simulator. Construction of a 
        Hilfiker retaining wall to support the roadway was selected as the preferred 
        alternative. Design analyses were completed using the Region 6 retaining 
        wall design guide (Driscoll, 1979). Conclusions and recommendations were 
        documented in a report written for design (Blair and Scheible, 1983).

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Binder timber sale 
        was dropped from the program because of environmental and economic considerations, 
        so the retaining wall was not constructed. However, with upcoming planned 
        logging of the Backdrop timber sale area, a contract was prepared in 1987 
        for wall construction in 1988. After award of the contract (and after 
        the snow had melted), additional slope movement, which resulted in loss 
        of all remaining soil in the foundation area, was discovered. The project 
        engineering geologist remeasured site conditions and is currently working 
        on modifying the wall design (Jordan, 1988). </font> </p>
      <p align="center"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>CONCLUSIONS</b> 
        </font> </p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Employment of engineering 
        geologists in the U.S. Forest Service increased significantly in the mid-1970s 
        after enactment of federal environmental legislation. The Olympic National 
        Forest began employing engineering geologists as part of its geotechnical 
        staff in 1974. Engineering geologic services have greatly expanded from 
        those early years, from investigation of rock and aggregate sources and 
        road corridors to investigations for area planning, water well and drainfield 
        location and design, and, most recently, review of small hydroelectric 
        project applications. Since the mid-1970s, the geotechnical staff employed 
        by the Olympic National Forest have been assigned to the Supervisor's 
        Office, with their duty station at Ft. Lewis, Washington. The Geotechnical 
        Section is comprised of a team of engineering geologists, geotechnical 
        engineers, civil engineering and lab technicians, and a drill crew. While 
        each of these fields is essential to the production of complete geotechnical 
        services, none can operate independently of the others. Having all skills 
        in a centralized location fosters teamwork. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Engineering geologists 
        on the Olympic National Forest staff complete work within a scale-dependent, 
        three-tiered system. Level 1, the lowest tier, comprises the area and 
        project planning stage; data are collected and mapped to a minimum 1:24,000 
        scale. Level 2 involves reconnaissance mapping of corridors for transportation 
        planning or road or facilities location, at a scale of 1:3,600. Level 
        3 is site-specific, and mapping is completed to a scale of 1:600 or greater. 
        This paper traces the evolution of this three-tiered method of work over 
        the past 10 years by examining two overlapping projects, the Chestershire 
        and Backdrop Timber Sale areas, located on the Quinault Ranger District 
        of the Olympic National Forest. During this period, the "computer age" 
        has come into being for engineering geologists in the Forest Service. 
        The Chestershire Timber Sale examples demonstrate past methods, which 
        included subjective evaluations of broad areas and analyses of mathematical 
        models developed for specific sites. The Backdrop Timber Sale examples 
        demonstrate current methods, with expanded use of mathematical models 
        to predict probabilities of slope movements over broad areas, with assistance 
        from programmable calculators and personal computers. The net effect of 
        this computerized analysis is a statistical probability of slope movement 
        for each proposed activity during each project phase, from planning through 
        design and construction. This adds credibility to geotechnical conclusions 
        and recommendations and facilitates more objective management decisions 
        regarding resource management and use. </font> </p>
