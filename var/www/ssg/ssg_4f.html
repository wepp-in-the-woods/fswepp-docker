        and O'Loughlin and Ziemer (1982) found that fibers and roots did not affect

        thought of as supplemental cohesion.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some attempts have 
        been made to quantify the magnitude of root reinforcement by measuring 
        the tensile strength of individual roots, by direct shear tests on soil-root 
        masses, by pull tests on large root systems or whole trees, and by back-calculation 
        analysis of existing failures. In addition, several researchers have used 
        the tensile strength of individual roots in mathematical models to estimate 
        the root resistance per unit of soil. Hammond et al. (1992) have summarized 
        these methods and their shortcomings and state:</font></p>
      <blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additional 
        research is necessary to increase our understanding of soil-root interaction 
        during slope failure and to estimate defensible values for root strength 
        to use in stability analysis. In the meantime, we suggest using root strength 
        values reported in the literature, considering also root density and root 
        distribution along the failure plane. </font></blockquote>

        strength depends not only on the tensile strength of the individual roots, 
        but on the pullout resistance (or skin friction) and, probably most importantly, 
        on the morphology of the root system; that is, how many roots there are 
        and whether they cross the failure plane. Root tensile strength and morphology 
        depend on species of tree, climate, and such site factors as slope, soil, 
        and ground water conditions. Hammond et al. (1992) have adopted a soil-root 
        classification scheme presented by Tsukamoto and Kusakabe (1984). Figure 
        <a href="#Fig_4F.2">4F.2</a> describes the four soil-root morphology types. 
        Figure <a href="#Fig_4F.3">4F.3</a> shows suggested probability distributions 
        by Hammond et al. for each soil-root morphology type for both densely 
        forested and clearcut conditions. These probability distributions were 
        selected based on the following observations and assumptions as discussed 
        by Hammond et al. (1992):</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The measured values 
          of root strength reported in the literature (table <a href="#Table_4F.1">4F.1</a> 
          and figure <a href="#Fig_4F.1">4F.1</a>) were assumed to apply to densely 
          forested types B and C, where roots intersect the entire failure plane. 
          The mean and range of values are larger for type C to account for greater 
          tree buttressing and root penetration along the base of the failure 
          plane.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mean and range 
          of values were reduced for types B and D based on three-dimensional 
          modeling of failures.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All distributions 
          have large standard deviations to account for the great variability 
          and uncertainty in reported values.o Lognormal probability distributions 
          were selected to reflect the tendency for right skew in the data (figure 
          <a href="#Fig_4F.1">4F.1</a>), thereby giving a low but positive probability 
          of simulating relatively high values.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hammond et al. discussed 
        in greater detail the rationale for selecting the suggested probability 
        distributions for dense timber stands. In addition, they recommended that 
        the user adjust the suggested distributions to account for other factors, 
        such as roots in saturated clay (Waldron and Dakessian, 1981), less dense 
        timber stands, or the user's personal judgment and experience.</font></p></td>

      Root Strength After Timber Harvest (Excerpted from Hammond et al., 1992)</font></font></td>
    <td colspan="2"> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
        timber harvest, root decay causes both the numbers of roots and the tensile 
        strength of the remaining individual roots to decrease with time (Burroughs 
        and Thomas, 1977). Ziemer (1981a, b) and O'Loughlin (1974) also measured 
        a decrease in biomass and, consequently, root strength with time after 
        harvest using direct shear tests. These studies indicate that the period 
        of minimum root strength is from about 3 to 5 years until about 10 to 
        20 years after harvest, depending on climate, which affects root decay 
        and vegetation regrowth. In areas severely burned following harvest, minimum 
        root strength may occur even sooner-0 to 3 years. After about 10 to 20 
        years postharvest, root reinforcement will increase to its uncut level 
        if significant regrowth has occurred.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ziemer (1981a, b) 
        estimated that at its minimum, root reinforcement conceptually could be 
        20 to 40 percent of its undisturbed value (figure <a href="#Fig_4F.4">4F.4</a>). 
        Therefore, we suggest using the distributions shown in figure <a href="#Fig_4F.3">4F.3</a> 
        to represent the time of minimum root reinforcement after clearcut timber 
        harvest for each soil-root morphology type. These distributions were obtained 
        by finding a mean and standard deviation for a lognormal distribution 
        which gives a mode value equal to about 30 percent of the mode for the 
        uncut distribution.</font></p></td>

      Type B - consists of shallow soils overlying fractured or weathered rock

      penetration depends on the number and nature of the discontinuities in the 
      substratum; but in general the roots are restricted somewhat by the substratum. 
      Root reinforcement is fairly significant because roots tend to intersect 
      the failure plane along its full length.</font></td>

      - consists of a transition zone; that is, a nondistinct zone in which the 
      soil shear strength and unit weight increase gradually with depth. It is 
      assumed that the transition zone acts as a drainage barrier allowing the 
      concentration of groundwater and the development of high pore-water pressure. 
      As a result, the failure plane passes somewhere through the transition zone. 
      It is assumed also that this zone is penetrated more easily by roots than 
      is a less fractured substrate of type B. Therefore, the maximum root reinforcement 
      is expected in type C. Examples of type C include decomposed granite over 
      granite bedrock, and a loose ash or glacial till overlying a medium-dense 
      compacted till over bedrock.</font></td>

      Type D - consists of soils and a potential failure plane both deeper than 
      the root zone of the trees. The actual depth of the soil needed for a type 
      D classification depends on the root morphology of the particular tree species. 
      For example, less soil depth would be required for Sitka spruce, which has 
      a shallow lateral root system, than for Douglas-fir, which has a deep root 
      system. Because the bedrock does not constrain the root system, the root 
      densities, and therefore the root strength, are assumed to be less than

        should be modified. Ziemer (1981b) discussed conceptual models for the 
        change in relative root reinforcement following shelterwood and selection 
        harvesting systems (figure <a href="#Fig_4F.4">4F.4</a>). A shelterwood 
        system is described as having 70 percent of the original stand being harvested, 
        followed by removal of the remaining trees 10 years later. For this system, 
        Ziemer hypothesized that the root reinforcement drops to about 70 percent 
        of its uncut value about 2 to 3 years postharvest, then rises to about 
        10 percent above the uncut value about 7 years after harvest as the residual 
        trees quickly expand. About 5 years after the residual trees are harvested, 
        root reinforcement again will drop to about 50 percent of the uncut value. 
        The selection harvesting system is described as having 20 percent of the 
        trees cut every 10 years. Ziemer anticipated that the root strength could 
        decrease by about 3 percent 2 years after harvest, then increase to about 
        7 percent above the uncut strength due to rapid expansion of the roots

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tree surcharge depends 
        on the species, size, and density of the timber stand. Considering the 
        weight to be uniformly distributed across the entire slope area is a common 
        assumption for stability analysis (Greenway, 1987; Sidle, 1984; Wu et 
        al., 1979). Estimates of equivalent uniform tree surcharge can be obtained 
        from timber inventories of the volume of timber per acre and the weight 
        per board foot of that timber. If the values given are for merchantable 
        timber, they should be increased somewhat to account for the non?merchantable 
        volumes. An example calculation is shown below:</font></p>
      <blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(3 to 5 lb/bf)(100,000 
        bf/acre)(1 acre/43560 ft<sup>2</sup>) = 7 to 12 psf</font></blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gray and Leiser (1982) 
        discussed a slightly different method for calculating tree surcharge. 
        They considered a Douglas-fir stand in the Cascade Range of central Oregon 
        that contained 50,000 to 65,000 board feet of merchantable timber per 
        acre. At 10 lb/bf, the uniform surcharge would be 12 to 15 psf. If the 
        weight of the trees is divided by the actual basal area of the trees (300-500 
        ft<sup>2</sup>/acre), the stress directly under a tree would be about 
        1,400 psf. They then assumed that the weight of the trees is distributed 
        over 75-square-foot circles spaced 30 feet apart in a cubic array. In 
        this case, the 1,400 psf surface stress would produce a stress increase 
        of 20 to 75 psf midway between trees at depths of 5 and 20 feet, respectively. 
        They concluded that even with this more exact analysis method, tree surcharge 
        plays an insignificant role in slope stability.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lacking tree species 
        and density data, estimates of tree surcharge can be taken from the literature. 
        When doing so, care must be exercised to ascertain whether an equivalent 
        uniform surcharge or a surcharge directly under the tree is being reported. 
        An equivalent uniform surcharge is recommended because the stresses at 
        depth and between trees will not be as high as the surcharge directly 
        under the tree. Some equivalent uniform surcharge values from the literature 
        are listed in table <a href="#Table_4F.2">4F.2</a>.</font></p></td>
