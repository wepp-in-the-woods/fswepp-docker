These files are used by ANUSPLIN programs to produce grid and point 
estimates. Each file contains coefficients with respect to a specific
variable, named as follows:

x4.sur corresponds to average monthly maximum temperature degrees C
t4.sur corresponds to average monthly mean temperature degrees C
m4.sur corresponds to average monthly minimum temperature degrees C
p6.sur corresponds to total monthly precipation in mm
