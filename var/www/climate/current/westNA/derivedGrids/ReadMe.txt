We used many additional variables are computed from these, good examples are:

ADI Annual dryness index, DD5/MAP or sqrt(DD5)/MAP (once named AMI annual moisture index)
SMI Summer dryness index, GSDD5/GSP (once named SMI, summer moisture index)
PRATIO Ratio of summer precipitatioin to total precipitation, GSP/MAP
