    The <i>Armillaria</i> Response Tool assesses variability in climate 
    and terrain within forest stands
    to more accurately predict potential risk of Armillaria root rot 
    as a result of fuels treatments.

    <br>
    Root rot fungi and other diseases respond differently to forest disturbance, based on
    interactions among soil, topography, climate, tree species and disturbance type.
    Classification of forested parcels by habitat type accounts for some of this variability, but many
    stands were given a stand-wide plant association label that may encompass two or more ecologically 
    different areas.  Use of  GIS and new unbiased plant community classification 
    systems can reveal such significant within-stand heterogeneity.  
    The <i>Armillaria</i> Response Tool (<i>A</i>RT) assesses that variability to more accurately 
    predict potential risk of Armillaria root rot as a result of fuels treatment in a stand.

    As an alternative to running <i>A</i>RT, which involves GIS analysis of 
  local terrain and climate, a manager can simply provide the known habitat type 
  classification of the stand in question and use our &quot;crosswalk tables&quot; to 
  estimate potential risk of Armillaria root rot.
