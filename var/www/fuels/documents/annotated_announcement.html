      We have compiled an annotated bibliography on the effects of green fuel reduction projects on various resources in the Northern Rockies.
      We will publish this bibliography in a Rocky Mountain Research Station General Technical Report.
      However, because we recognize the immediate value of this information to resource managers and scientists, we are making the draft version available for downloading.
      <b>Because the bibliography is still in draft form, we would appreciate any comments or suggestions from readers.</b>
      <br><br>
      The bibliography includes studies of the effects of thinning and prescribed fire treatments on the following resources in the Northern Rockies: 
      <blockquote>
       Air Quality<br>
       Economics<br>
       Fire Behavior and Fuel Reduction<br>
       Fisheries<br>
       Hydrology<br>
       Insects and Diseases<br>
       Social and Human Dimensions, and Esthetics<br>
       Soils<br>
       Vegetative Effects at the Stand Level<br>
       Vegetative Effects -- Trees<br>
       Vegetative Effects -- Understory<br>
       Wildlife<br>	
      </blockquote>
      The bibliography focuses on the following cover types: ponderosa pine, western larch, Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, and mixed conifer.
      Treatments include using prescription fire alone, using mechanical fuel treatments alone, and using a combination of prescription burning and mechanical treatments.
      Mechanical treatments might include some overstory removal with understory thinning, or might include just understory thinning.
