   The Wildlife Habitat Response Model (<b>WHRM</b>) was developed by David Pilliod and Elena Velasquez.
   <b>WHRM</b> is a web-based tool meant to assist fuel treatment planners in evaluating the effects of
   fuel treatment alternatives on wildlife habitat elements.
   <i><b>WHRM</b> does not provide estimates of wildlife population changes or viability</i>.
   <br><br>
   <b>WHRM is based on published literature</b> about species/habitat relationships,
   and provides qualitative information about potential changes in wildlife habitat elements.
   These relationships are updated as new literature comes to our attention.
   The date of last revision will be noted for each species.
   <br><br>
   Basically, <b>WHRM</b> functions as a data look-up table.
   For each species, information has been gleaned from the literature about habitat associations and life history requirements,
   including requirements for reproduction and food resources, and about predators and hazards.
   These habitat associations and requirements were categorized into habitat elements such as down wood and live trees.
   Users determine how a fuel treatment will change these elements and <b>WHRM</b> reports how a species. habitat may be
   affected by these changes.

   <b>To run WHRM</b>, the user first selects from a menu listing the taxonomic group and species.
   Two options are then available:
   <ul>
    <li>display habitat associations, and</li>
    <li>view species information.</li>
   </ul>
   To evaluate habitat element changes ("habitat associations"),
   the user must already have some knowledge or estimates about how the fuel treatment is going to affect the stand.
   In <b>WHRM</b>, the user then chooses (by broad category) the relative change from pre-treatment conditions in
   forest floor components, down wood, standing dead wood, understory vegetation, and live trees.
   These values can come from any source -- for example, based on fuel treatment objectives or desired future conditions,
   or on predictions from computer simulations such as the Forest Vegetation Simulator with the Fire and Fuels Extension
   (FVS-FFE).
   (One can find some examples of common fuel treatments and changes to structure and fuels on the
   fire hazard/forest structure website.)
   Then the user runs <b>WHRM</b>.
   The output includes predicted effects on the various habitat requirements in qualitative terms:
   positive, null, or negative, and some summary text about the results.
   <br><br>
   It might be helpful for users to work with a wildlife specialist <b>to interpret the results</b>.
   Remember, <b>WHRM</b> is based on scientific literature that sometimes may not be applicable to local conditions.
   What <b>WHRM</b> essentially provides is a summary of the literature about how wildlife habitat might respond
   to fuel treatments.
   From this and perhaps the assistance of a local wildlife expert, the fuels planner can evaluate
   the potential consequences of fuel treatment alternatives on wildlife habitat elements under local conditions,
   and support that evaluation with the available scientific literature.
   <br><br>
   <b>WHRM</b> is in nearly final form and currently under review.
   The literature used in <b>WHRM</b> has already been published and was reviewed according to the standards
   of the individual publishers.
   The model itself is under open review by academic, federal, and non-governmental organization scientists
   with expertise in various taxonomic groups and species.
   In the end, all products related to <b>WHRM</b> will have undergone rigorous review and will conform to the standards
   of the Data Quality Act.
   <br><br>
   We invite comments and suggestions about <b>WHRM</b>;
   please contact David Pilliod or Elaine Kennedy Sutherland (team leader for the Environmental Consequences group)
   <!-- how?? --> with your ideas.
