<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The Vaccinium genus is taxonomically complex [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Hybridization and
polyploidy make delineation of species difficult [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].  The genus
is characterized by rapid speciation among polyploids and widespread
hybridization with backcrosses [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Dwarf huckleberry is a particularly
difficult taxon.

Dwarf huckleberry is a member of the section Myrtillus [<a href="#58">58</a>] and has been
placed in the complex Caespitosae which includes a number of
low-statured Vacciniums [<a href="#16">16</a>].  The currently accepted scientific name of
dwarf huckleberry is Vaccinium caespitosum Michx [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Great variation
exists in leaf and twig morphology and a number of forms have been
described [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Hitchcock and others [<a href="#34">34</a>] note that dwarf huckleberry
has been "separated by seemingly intangible characteristics into two or
three additional taxa."  Nevertheless, Kartesz [<a href="#39">39</a>] recognizes the
following varieties:

                 V. c. var. caespitosum
                 V. c. var. paludicola (Camp) Hulten

Intermediates between dwarf huckleberry and ovalleaf huckleberry (V.
ovalifolium) have been described [<a href="#8">8</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Dwarf huckleberry occurs as an understory dominant or codominant in high
elevation spruce (Picea spp.)-fir (Abies spp.) forests throughout much
of western North America.  It also grows, often in great abundance, in
some relatively moist Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesia), quaking aspen
(Populus tremuloides), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) communities.
Common understory codominants in these western forests include bog
Labrador tea (Ledum groenlandicum), grouse whortleberry (Vaccinium
scoparium), queencup beadlily (Clintonia uniflora), and bluejoint
reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis).  Dwarf huckleberry also occurs in
alpine heath communities and is codominant with species such as grouse
whortleberry, and pine dropseed (Blepharoneuron tricholepis) or other
forbs.  In the lower alpine zone of the West, this shrub, along with
grouse whortleberry, commonly dominates shrubfields which develop in
areas of prolonged snow cover [<a href="#38">38</a>].  In the East and North, it occurs in
black spruce (Picea mariana), balsam fir (A. balsamea)-white spruce (P.
glauca), paper birch (Betula papyrifera)-balsam fir, oak-maple
(Quercus-Acer spp.), and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) forests
[<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  In the East, blueberries (Vaccinium spp.) commonly dominate
the understory of many eastern hemlock, red maple (A. rubrum)-red oak
(Q. rubra), eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), sugar maple (A.
saccharum), and jack pine (Pinus banksiana)-red pine (P. resinosa)
forests.

Plant associates:  In the West, dwarf huckleberry commonly grows in
association with twinflower, queencup beadlily, Labrador tea, swordfern
(Polystichum spp.), huckleberries (V. membranaceum, V. globulare),
bluejoint reedgrass, elk sedge (Carex geyeri), and kinnikinnick
(Arctostaphylos uva-ursi) [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>].  Common eastern understory
associates include maples (Acer spp.), blueberries (Vaccinium spp.),
lichens (Cladonia spp.), bog Labrador tea, wintergreen (Gaultheria
spp.), maianthemum (Maianthemum spp.), black crowberry (Empetrum
nigrum), mountain-laurel (Kalmia polifolia), and viburnum (Viburnum
spp.)  [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vaccinium caespitosum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Browse:  Dwarf huckleberry browse apparently provides minimal forage for
big game and domestic livestock [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>].  This short-statured shrub may
be buried by snow and is often unavailable during much of the winter
[<a href="#22">22</a>].  However, certain Douglas-fir/dwarf huckleberry habitat types of
northwestern Montana, which commonly occur on relatively warm, dry sites
where snow depths are not extreme, are preferred wintering areas for
white-tailed deer, elk, and moose [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  Lack of hiding cover may
prevent deer from using recent clearcuts dominated by dwarf huckleberry
and other low shrubs [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Fruit:  The sweet, attractive berries are an important food source for
many birds including the ruffed grouse, gray catbird, American robin,
and eastern bluebird [<a href="#72">72</a>].  The spruce grouse, ptarmigans, scarlet
tanager, bluebirds, thrushes, thrashers, titmice, blue grouse, and
towhees feed on the berries of many species of Vaccinium [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>].  The
fruit of dwarf huckleberry is readily eaten by small mammals such as the
white-footed mouse, red fox, and fox squirrel [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>].  Chipmunks,
skunks, the common opossum, and raccoon also consume large amounts of
huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.) [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>].

Huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.) are an extremely important food source
for grizzly and black bears and both species typically adjust their
seasonal ranges to exploit this resource most effectively [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>].
Bears generally move from low elevation riparian areas to middle
elevation berry fields as soon as huckleberries become ripe.  In western
Montana, grizzly bears frequent open, midseral burns at higher
elevations during late summer or fall when berries are at their peak
ripeness [<a href="#50">50</a>].  The dwarf huckleberry is generally less productive than
the globe huckleberry (V. globulare) and fruit tends to be smaller.
Nevertheless, dwarf huckleberry is still considered an important grizzly
bear food [<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>].  It is reported to be a "major" grizzly food in
terrestrial spruce stands of floodplain complexes in the Bob Marshall
Wilderness Area of Montana.  Bench land habitat characterized by a dwarf
huckleberry understory is extremely important to grizzly bears during
fall in parts of British Columbia [<a href="#89">89</a>].

Reproductive success of black bears has been correlated with the size of
huckleberry crops [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].  Similarly, cub survival appears to be
reduced during years of low huckleberry availability [<a href="#66">66</a>].  Huckleberry
crop failures increase the likelihood of bear-human encounters, as
wide-ranging, hungry bears seeking alternate food sources come into
contact with recreationists or home owners.  Damage to crops and
beehives, as well as livestock losses, typically increase during poor
huckleberry years.


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Dwarf huckleberry browse is relatively unpalatable to most wild
ungulates and to domestic livestock [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>].  However, berries are
highly palatable to black and grizzly bears, and to many small birds and
mammals [<a href="#47">47</a>].  The palatability of dwarf huckleberry has been rated as
follows [<a href="#18">18</a>]:

Upland game birds      ----    ----    good    good
Waterfowl              ----    ----    poor    poor


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Huckleberry foliage (Vaccinium spp.) is relatively high in carotene and
energy content [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Protein value of dwarf huckleberry browse is rated
as fair [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Fruits of dwarf huckleberry are sweet and contain high
concentrations of both mono- and di- saccharides [<a href="#72">72</a>].  Huckleberries
are high in vitamin C but low in fat [<a href="#65">65</a>].  The crude fat content of
dwarf huckleberry fruit averages approximately 3.80 percent [<a href="#72">72</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Because of its low growth form, dwarf huckleberry provides minimal cover
for most large mammals.  However, dense thickets can serve as good cover
for smaller birds and mammals.  Grand fir (Abies grandis)/dwarf
huckleberry habitat types of central Idaho reportedly offer adequate
cover for elk and white-tailed deer [<a href="#70">70</a>].  Cover value of dwarf
huckleberry has been rated as follows [<a href="#18">18</a>]:

                       UT      WY

Pronghorn             poor    poor
Elk                   poor    poor

Small mammals         good    good
Small nongame birds   fair    good
Waterfowl             poor    poor


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
The dwarf huckleberry has a fibrous, spreading root system [<a href="#73">73</a>] and can
presumably aid in preventing soil erosion on some sites.  It is rated as
having low to moderate value for short-term rehabilitation projects and
moderate value for long-term rehabilitation [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Species within the genus Vaccinium can be propagated from hardwood
cuttings [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Dwarf huckleberry can also be grown from seed which
averages 5,300,000 per pound (11,674/g) [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>].  Seedlings grown in the
greenhouse can be transplanted onto favorable sites 6 to 7 weeks after
emergence [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Seed collection and storage techniques have been
examined in detail [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Berries of the dwarf huckleberry are edible [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>] but of no economic
importance [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Fruit is delicious when fresh or in jams and jellies
[<a href="#81">81</a>].  Huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.) were an important traditional food
source for many Native American peoples.  Berries of the dwarf
huckleberry are often less abundant than those of other species and were
presumably less important than those of more productive huckleberries.

Numerous cultivars of huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.) have been developed
for use as ornamentals or in garden plantings [<a href="#65">65</a>].  The dwarf
huckleberry can be used in landscaping and forms an attractive ground
cover [<a href="#73">73</a>].  It was first cultivated in 1823 [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Chemical control:  Huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.) exhibit variable
susceptibility to herbicides such as 2,4-D [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Recreational impacts:  Studies indicate that dwarf huckleberry is
moderately resistant to trampling by recreationists.  Short-term
resilience is rated as moderate [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Timber harvest:  Dwarf huckleberry often survives clearcutting which is
followed by broadcast burns, although the shallow rhizomes may be killed
by severe scarification [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Studies conducted in the Swan Valley of
northwestern Montana suggest that dwarf huckleberry responds more
favorably to clearcutting than to other methods of timber harvest.
Average cover by timber harvest method was documented as follows [<a href="#23">23</a>]:

             treatment              average percent cover

             untreated                      12
             clearcut                       12
             plantation                      3

             selection                       3

Impacts of timber harvest on bears:  Despite good fruit production in
clearcuts, bears may avoid these sites unless sufficient hiding cover is
present.  The extent to which grizzly bears use clearcuts dominated by
dwarf huckleberry and other Vacciniums depends largely on the
availability of cover.  The size and shape of cutting units as well as
proximity of roads influence bear use.  In northern Idaho, black bears
avoid clearcuts, but in parts of western Washington, 18- to 25-year-old
clearcuts are used, although 9- to 14-year-old cuts are generally
avoided.  In a northern Montana study, bears used 10-year-old clearcuts
but did not utilize newer cuts [<a href="#78">78</a>].  Evidence suggests that grizzly
bears may prefer older clearcuts with sufficient cover and areas burned
by wildfires 25 to 60 years ago [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Berry production and grizzly bear
use has been poorly documented with respect to the dwarf huckleberry.
Most research efforts have focused on the blue huckleberry complex (V.
membranaceum-V. globulare) [see VACGLO].

Grizzly habitat value of huckleberry shrubfields can be increased by
permanent or appropriate seasonal road closures, by coordinating timber
harvest dates to have minimal impact on habitat use patterns, and by
considering cumulative effects of habitat modification on adjacent
areas.  Site preparation should include minimizing soil compaction,
using broadcast burns rather than piling slash to generate hot fires, or
by eliminating site preparation where possible.  Grizzly use can be
favored by retaining hiding cover through treating small, irregular
patches rather than large contiguous areas and by leaving stringers of
timber in larger cuts [<a href="#88">88</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vaccinium caespitosum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Dwarf huckleberry is a dwarf-to-low, spreading, rhizomatous shrub
[<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>].  This often mat-forming shrub grows 2 to 20 inches (5-50
cm) in height [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>].  Twigs are much-branched, angled, glaucous,
and glabrous to puberulent [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].  When young, twigs are green,
tannish, or reddish, but with age twigs become brown or brownish-gray
[<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>].  The shreddy bark is yellowish-green, green, or reddish
[<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>].  Roots of the dwarf huckleberry are fibrous and spreading [<a href="#73">73</a>]
and reach depths of 0 to 67 inches (0-170 cm) [<a href="#57">57</a>].  Plants are
relatively short-lived [<a href="#73">73</a>].

The deciduous, alternate leaves are elliptic to oblanceolate or obovate,
and widest well above midlength [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].  Leaves are acute or
rounded at the apex, entire, crenulate or serrulate from the tip to
middle, and 0.4 to 2 inches (1-5 cm) in length [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].  The upper
surface is bright green and glabrous, whereas the lower surface is
glandular and a paler, light green [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>].

Flowers are urn or bell-shaped and borne singly in the axils of leaves
[<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  The small, inconspicuous, waxy flowers are pink, white, or
red [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>].  Floral morphology of the dwarf huckleberry has been
considered in detail [<a href="#59">59</a>].  Fruit is a subglobose to globose berry which
averages 0.2 to 0.8 inch (5-8 mm) in diameter [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].  Berries are
dark blue to black with a glaucous bloom [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].  Fruit is sweet
[<a href="#34">34</a>] but generally not produced in abundance [<a href="#80">80</a>].  Berries contain
small, brown, cellular-pitted seeds [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Dwarf huckleberry reproduces both sexually and vegetatively, although
vegetative regeneration appears to be of primary importance.

Seed:  Vaccinium seeds are not dormant and require no pretreatment for
germination.  Seedlings first emerge within 1 month after seeds are
planted, and germination continues over a long period of time if no cold
stratification is provided.  Germination capacity of dwarf huckleberry
in laboratory tests was estimated at 96 percent [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Berries are
sweet, nutritious, and highly attractive to mammalian dispersers.
Colorful berries are also consumed in great numbers by both year-round
resident and transient breeding birds which can effect long-distance
dispersal.  The tough seeds generally pass through digestive tracts
undamaged [<a href="#72">72</a>].

Dwarf huckleberry seedlings are rarely observed under natural conditions
in the West.  Germination may be limited to exceptional sites in
favorable, moist years.  Seed stored on-site appears to contribute
little to regeneration of this species [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Buried seeds have been
recovered from the top 1.2 inches (3 cm) of soil in balsam fir (Abies
balsamea)-white spruce (Picea glauca) forests of Quebec, but viability
was very low (0-16 percent) [<a href="#53">53</a>].

Vegetative regeneration:  Dwarf huckleberry is rhizomatous [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]
and plants are often capable of resprouting after the crown is removed
or damaged.  However, these regenerative structures are fairly shallow
and can be damaged or eliminated by deep, duff-consuming fires or
mechanical treatments which include severe soil scarification.  Twigs
are capable of regenerating at the nodes [<a href="#81">81</a>] and vegetative expansion
can occur even in the absence of disturbance.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Dwarf huckleberry occurs at the margins of subalpine meadows, in
mountain ravines, along riverbanks, near snowbanks, or along the shores
of ponds and bogs [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>].  It commonly grows on moist
subalpine or alpine slopes and on mossy forest floors where it
frequently forms a low, nearly continuous layer [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  Dwarf
huckleberry is particularly abundant on flat terraces, benches, or
basins subject to frost [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].

Soils:  Dwarf huckleberry grows well on medium-coarse, well-drained,
granitic soils [<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>].  Most huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.) require
acidic soils and can grow on infertile sites which have relatively small
amounts of many essential elements [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Dwarf huckleberry commonly
occurs on soils with a pH of 5.5 to 7.0 [<a href="#73">73</a>].

Elevation:  Dwarf huckleberry extends through the subalpine zone to well
above treeline [<a href="#33">33</a>].  In eastern North America, it typically occurs at
higher elevations [<a href="#68">68</a>].  Generalized elevational ranges by state are as
follows [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>]:

                     to 3,800 feet (1,200 m) in AK
                   from 7,000 to 12,000 feet (2,134-3,660 m) in CA
                        8,000 to 12,000 feet (2,438-3,660 m) in CO
                        3,500 to 10,000 feet (1,067-3,048 m) in MT
                        7,300 to 10,363 feet (2,225-3,420 m) in UT
                        8,500 to 10,600 feet (2,591-3,233 m) in WY 


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Dwarf huckleberry occurs in climax Douglas-fir or spruce-fir forests
throughout much of the West [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].  However, it is also considered an
important seral shrub in many areas of western North America [<a href="#26">26</a>].  An
extensive network of shallow rhizomes enables this shrub to rapidly
reestablish after most light to moderate disturbances.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Dwarf huckleberry flowers in late spring or summer with fruit maturation
beginning immediately after flowering [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>].  Fruit ripens in mid to
late summer or fall, and seed dispersal occurs from July to September
[<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>].  Leaves drop in early autumn [<a href="#40">40</a>].  However, specific
phenological development varies annually according to weather
conditions.  Seasonal development in various geographic locations has
been documented as follows [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>]:

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vaccinium caespitosum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Patches of dwarf huckleberry commonly develop after fire in lodgepole
pine and fir-spruce communities of the Pacific Northwest and Rocky
Mountains [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  This shrub is also a prominent constituent of
postfire communities in black spruce forests of eastern Canada [<a href="#20">20</a>].
The widespread representation of dwarf huckleberry in many postfire
communities suggests that it is capable of surviving many, if not most,
fires.  Dwarf huckleberry has shallow rhizomes [<a href="#55">55</a>] and can presumably
resprout after fires of light or moderate severity [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Berries are
well adapted to animal dispersal and can be transported long distances
[<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].  Very limited seedling establishment from off-site sources may
occur in favorable years, but vegetative regeneration appears to be of
primary importance in the postfire reestablishment of most Vacciniums.
Martin [<a href="#50">50</a>] notes that "the role of fire in establishing new populations
of western Vacciniums or in maintaining existing ones, is not
well-documented."

Many sites occupied by dwarf huckleberry burn infrequently.  Areas such
as wet meadows, bog and pond margins, and areas below timberline which
are too rocky to support trees are unlikely to experience fires at
frequent intervals.  However, fire is an important influence in many
forested communities.  Fire-free intervals have been estimated at 20
years in Douglas-fir/dwarf huckleberry forests in the Swan Valley of
northwestern Montana and at 28 years in the Bitterroot Mountains of
western Montana.  Fire-free intervals of 17 years have been suggested
for spruce/queencup beadlily-dwarf huckleberry habitat types of western
Montana [<a href="#22">22</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vaccinium caespitosum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Underground portions of dwarf huckleberry can survive most light to
moderate fires.  However, rhizomes are relatively shallow and may be
killed by hot duff-reducing fires [<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Seedling establishment:  Seedbanking does not appear to be an important
postfire regenerative strategy of dwarf huckleberry.  Although seeds
were observed within the top 1.2 inches (3 cm) of soil in paper
birch-balsam fir-white spruce forests of Quebec, viability was low and
few seedlings could be expected to develop from seed stored on-site
[<a href="#53">53</a>].  Seeds of dwarf huckleberry are dispersed considerable distances
by birds and mammals [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].  Seeds are generally unharmed by digestive
processes and can germinate on favorable sites during moist years.

Vegetative regeneration:  Shallow rhizomes may enable dwarf huckleberry
to sprout and quickly reoccupy a site after most light to moderate fires
[<a href="#37">37</a>].  After severe treatments in which rhizomes are eliminated,
reestablishment most likely proceeds slowly through seedling
establishment or clonal expansion at the burn's periphery.  Following
small, patchy fires, such as those occurring after lighting strikes on
high elevation sites with discontinous fuels, reestablishment would
presumably occur through rhizomatous spreading from the perimeter of the
burn.

Postfire reestablishment:  Light fires may favor dwarf huckleberry by
reducing competitors, increasing nutrient availability, and opening the
canopy so that greater amounts of light reaches low shrubs.
Reestablishment is rapid where rhizomes are capable of resprouting.
Postfire cover can greatly exceed preburn levels [<a href="#20">20</a>].  In parts of the
central Rockies, light fires in high elevation spruce-fir forests create
a ground cover made up primarily of dwarf huckleberry and a "few hardy
herbaceous ... relics" [<a href="#46">46</a>].  

Postfire increases in dwarf huckleberry have also been reported in
eastern North America.  After fire in a black spruce community in
Labrador, frequency of dwarf huckleberry was 44.4 percent in unburned
stands compared with 63.1 percent in burned stands [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Postharvest treatment:  Dwarf huckleberry can often survive broadcast
burns which follow timber harvest [<a href="#37">37</a>].  However, shallow rhizomes can
be seriously damaged by hot burns which occur in piled slash or where
fuel loading is heavy.

Wildlife:  Evidence suggests that fire suppression may have an adverse
impact on bear habitat [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>].  Once productive seral berry fields are
currently being invaded by conifers.  Logging treatments which include
severe soil scarification or slash fires may also result in decreased
berry availability.  Even where timber harvest favors berry production,
lack of cover in early years can limit bear use.  However, wildfires
often create diverse habitat mosaics which include elements of hiding
cover which favors bear use.  Succession proceeds slowly on high
elevation berry fields, particularly on south slopes, and fires often
generate shrubfields that remain productive for long periods of time
[<a href="#88">88</a>].

Prescribed fire:  Prescribed fires, particularly those carried out
during the spring, may increase berry production for bears and other
animals.  Little research has been conducted on dwarf huckleberry,
although the use of prescribed fire has been evaluated with respect to
blue huckleberries (Vaccinium globulare, Vaccinium membranaceum).  [see
VACGLO].  Light or moderate burns, conducted when the soil is somewhat
moist, may be most effective in promoting western huckleberries [<a href="#50">50</a>].
