<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Eastwood manzanita is a common dominant in coastal chaparral
communities.  It frequently codominates or associated with chamise
(Adenostoma fasciculatum) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Eastwood manzanita is also
associated with chaparral whitethorn (Ceanothus leucodermis) and
bigberry manzanita (Arctostaphylos glauca) [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

The following published classifications list Eastwood manzanita as a
dominant species:

  Jacinto Mountains [<a href="#42">42</a>]

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arctostaphylos glandulosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Eastwood manzanita is useless as livestock browse but is a valuable
source of food for wildlife.  Manzanita spp. fruits are eaten by various
chaparral mammals including coyote, dusky-footed woodrat, deer mouse,
and brush rabbit.  The fruits are also consumed birds, including wild
turkey and band-tailed pigeon [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Older leaves are sometimes eaten by
black-tailed deer, although they prefer sprouts or seedlings [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability of Eastwood manzanita leaves is rated as poor for
goats, sheep, cattle, horses, and black-tailed deer [<a href="#33">33</a>].  The
palatability of the fruits and seeds is fair [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>

No species of manzanita provides high-quality browse [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  The
protein content of Eastwood manzanita leaves varies from 11 percent in
April to 5 percent in October.  Bissell and Strong [<a href="#6">6</a>] state that
deer need a minimum of 7 percent protein in their diet for normal
maintence.


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Eastwood manzanita often forms dense stands that provide good hiding,
resting and nesting sites for small birds and mammals.  Horton [<a href="#17">17</a>] has
reported dusky-footed woodrat using Eastwood manzanita as cover for
their food caches.
       
Open stands of Eastwood manzanita provide good hiding and resting cover
for black-tailed deer [<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Eastwood manzanita's deep litter layer and deep root system help
stabilize steep hillsides and road cuts.  It has been underutilized for
rehabilitative purposes in the past because it is difficult to germinate
and to transplant [<a href="#8">8</a>].  It can, however, be successfully propagated from
stem cuttings [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Food:  The fruits of Eastwood manzanita can be used to make jelly [<a href="#2">2</a>].
Native Americans dried and ground the fruits to make flour [<a href="#36">36</a>].

Landscaping:  Eastwood manzanita is used for ornamental landscaping [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Watershed:  Eastwood manzanita is valuable for soil erosion control
because its roots and litter layer bind soil.  Kittredge [<a href="#23">23</a>] states
that it may have the greatest ability to build and maintain a stable
ground floor of all the chaparral shrubs.

Timber:  Eastwood manzanita allelopathically inhibits growth of
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and knobcone pine (P. attenuata)
seedlings [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].

Control:  Eastwood manzanita can be controlled by aerosol application of
2,4-D in late June or July.  Precautions for its use with ponderosa pine
seedlings have been detailed [<a href="#38">38</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arctostaphylos glandulosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Eastwood manzanita is a long-lived, erect, spreading evergreen shrub.
It ranges from 5 to 8 feet (1.5-2.5 m) in height, with a lignotuber from
2 to 15 feet (0.6-2.5 m) in diameter.  Root depth is from 8 to 28 inches
(20-70 cm).  The leaves, stems, and fruits are glandular.  The fruit is
a small drupe bearing hardcoated seeds [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Eastwood manzanita reproduces by seed [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Seeds are
dispersed by birds and mammals and can remain dormant for years [<a href="#21">21</a>].
Germination does not occur until after a fire, and is triggered by an
oligosaccharin leached from charred wood [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Seedling success rates
are low [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Vegetative:  Eastwood manzanita sprouts from the lignotuber [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Eastwood manzanita is found on dry, rocky, often steep slopes [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].

Soil:  Eastwood manzanita grows in gravelly-clay soil.  The soil layer
is typically less than 10 inches (25 cm) with a pH of 5.7 [<a href="#10">10</a>].  

Elevation:  Eastwood manzanita occurs between 1,000 to 6,000 feet
(305-1,829 m) [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Climate:  Eastwood manzanita grows in a mediterranean climate, with cool
moist winters and hot dry summers [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].


       


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Eastwood manzanita is shade-intolerant.  It occurs in climax chaparral,
but is replaced by oak (Quercus spp.) woodland or coniferous forest in
the absence of fire [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Eastwood manzanita flowers from February to April.  The fruit ripens
from April to August, and seeds are disseminated from August to
November.  Older leaves are dropped from August to February [<a href="#2">2</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arctostaphylos glandulosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Plant adaptations:  Eastwood manzanita sprouts from the lignotuber
after aboveground portions of the plant have burned [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].
It also regenerates by fire-stimulated germination of dormant
soil-stored seed [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Fire ecology:  Eastwood manzanita produces more ground litter than most
chaparral shrubs.  Kittredge [<a href="#24">24</a>] has measured its litter volume at 1.1
tons per acre (2.5 t/ha) per year.  The leaves, twigs, and fruits contain
flammable resins [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Small shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arctostaphylos glandulosa

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire top-kills Eastwood manzanita [<a href="#42">42</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Charate-induced germination of a few seedlings occurs the first year
following fire [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Lignotubers of top-killed plants sprout during the
first postfire growing season.  Rapid growth continues, and preburn
cover is regained by postfire year 4 [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Effects of fire supression:  Fuel build-up resulting from fire
supression can result in extreme fire and flood danger.  Manzanita
fires are severe and typically comsume all standing material down to
ground level [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Loss of watershed vegetation results in downstream
flooding and the filling in of reservoirs with debris [<a href="#26">26</a>].  

Fuel management:  Manzanita communities have a natural fire cycle of 10
to 25 years [<a href="#34">34</a>].  To reduce fire danger in these communities,
prescribed winter burns are recommended at intervals of 10 to 20 years.
Humidity should be under 30 percent and winds less then 10 miles per
hour [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].
