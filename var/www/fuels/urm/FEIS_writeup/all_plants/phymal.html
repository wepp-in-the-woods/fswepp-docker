<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Ninebark occurs in a wide variety of habitat types from cool/moist
subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), grand fir (A. grandis), and Engelmann
spruce (Picea engelmannii) to more mesic Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
menziesii) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) sites.  Ninebark's
associates generally include ocean-spray (Holodiscus discolor), common
snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus), mountain snowberry (Symphoricarpos
oreophilus), white spiraea (Spiraea betulifolia), serviceberry
(Amelanchier alnifolia), Oregon grape (Mahonia repens), and pinegrass
(Calamagrostis rubescens) [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Ninebark's importance to livestock and wildlife is generally low to
moderate.  In central Idaho and western Montana, the grazing values for
livestock and wildlife are poor to none [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  Ninebark made up only
8 percent of bighorn sheep browse in central Idaho [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Wildlife use of ninebark is usually minimal because more palatable
shrubs are commonly associated with it.  For up to 3 years following
fire, ninebark sprouts are frequently browsed by deer.  Ninebark becomes
a more important browse species on drier sites [<a href="#38">38</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Ninebark is generally avoided as browse.  In northern Idaho, ninebark
was scarcely browsed when it exhibited a high cover percent [<a href="#31">31</a>].  In
cedar/hemlock (Thuja/Tsuga) ecosystems, it was found to be less
palatable than associated browse species [<a href="#19">19</a>].  In northern Utah,
however, mule deer browsed on ninebark during the summer months [<a href="#44">44</a>].
In northern Idaho, livestock browsing on ninebark seemed to increase its
utilization by producing more palatable stems.  Thilenius [<a href="#48">48</a>] found
that ninebark became more palatable to white-tailed deer following
browsing by livestock.

The degree of ninebark use shown by livestock and wildlife species 
in several western states is rated as follows [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>]:

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
In Montana and Utah, ninebark only rated "fair" in energy and protein
values [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Mean mineral concentration values of the upper one-third of ninebark's
current annual growth measured over 3 years (1974-76) on burned and
unburned sites on the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, Idaho, were as

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Ninebark can form dense thickets, which provide good shelter and cover
for a variety of wildlife species from small birds to large mammals.


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
The Soil Conservation Service in Pullman, Washington, has evaluated
ninebark in order to develop this shrub's soil-stabilizing
characteristics for streambank stabilization projects [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Results
from this evaluation are not available.

Ninebark suitability ratings for revegetating road cuts in northwestern
Montana are as follows [<a href="#18">18</a>]:

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Ninebark decreases the productivity of forest lands by severely
restricting regeneration.  Tordon 22K and Tordon 101 have been used
successfully to control this deep-rooted, perennial shrub [<a href="#41">41</a>]. Distortion, curling, and browning of ninebark leaf margins were
noted 1 week after application.  At the end of one growing season, there
was almost 100 percent browning and drying of foliage [<a href="#41">41</a>].

In northern Idaho, ninebark showed two peaks of apparent susceptibility
to damage from spraying 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T:  in June, when the plants
were in bloom, and again in September before leaf drop.  Crown kill
averaged 99 and 80 percent respectively.  Following these treatments,
sprouts averaged about two per plant.  Spraying at these times decreases
ninebark, thereby possibly benefitting associated species [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].

Two to three quarts (1.9-2.8 l) of Roundup herbicide with water
top-killed 62 to 80 percent of ninebark foliage when applied during late
foliar development [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Ninebark control using Esteron brush killer
achieved best results when this herbicide was mixed with diesel and
sprayed by helicopter from low altitudes [less than 150 feet/(46 m)]
[<a href="#34">34</a>].

In many Douglas-fir/ninebark habitat types, pocket gophers have been
identified as a management problem.  They apparently damage young pines,
perhaps allowing ninebark communities to outcompete conifer species.
Burning, livestock grazing, and scarification have been attempted to rid
ninebark sites of pocket gophers [<a href="#46">46</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Physocarpus malvaceus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
This deciduous shrub is generally 2.0 to 7.0 feet (0.6-2.1 m) tall;
broad stem structure; twigs glabrous; bark shreddy on older branchlets;
inflorescence corymbose [<a href="#21">21</a>].  The fruit is an inflated two- to
three-chambered capsule with two to four very small seeds per chamber.
Ninebark leaves are palmately three- to five-lobed, and begin to turn
color as early as late July, becoming brownish-red by early autumn [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Ninebark has a horizontal perennating root system, although it is often
called a "rootcrown shrub".  Sectioning revealed that its perennating
organ is a rhizome [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Seeds, flowering, and fruiting:  Flowering dates vary from May to July,
and fruit ripening occurs between late August and early October.
Ninebark averaged 756,000 cleaned seeds per pound (344,000/kg), with a
16 percent soundness value [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Ninebark seeds are primarily
transported by gravity.  Seeds stored in the soil are 11 percent viable,
and germinate in partial shade on scarified soil [<a href="#46">46</a>].

Regeneration following disturbance:  In western Montana, Bradley [<a href="#4">4</a>]
found ninebark to occur in two forms:  singularly or in small clumps of
stems sprouting from one rhizome; or in large groupings with many stems
originating from a number of interlaced rhizomes.  External observations
of rhizomes revealed numerous suppressed buds along the entire length of
the axis.  One half of the shrubs excavated had stems arising from more
than one section of the rhizome.  Presence of buds throughout the
rhizome may permit sprouting at many points given the proper
environmental conditions [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Ninebark is most commonly found on hillsides, canyons, and grasslands on
mesic ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir sites [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  It also has been
found on moist slopes and streamsides in mountain-brush, aspen, and
mixed-conifer woodlands at 5,250 to 10,000 feet (1,600-3,000 m)
elevation [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Soils:  Ninebark is found predominantly on soils with no exposed rocks.
Parent materials range from calcareous/noncalcareous sedimentary rocks
such as limestone, sandstone, and conglomerates, to igneous rock such as
granites and basalts.  Soil textures found on ninebark sites range from
sandy loams to silty clay loams.  Ash layers have been found on some
loess soils in central Idaho.  Surface soil acidity range from pH 5.5 to
7.1.  The average duff layer is 2.6 inches (6.5 cm) with an effective
rooting depth generally at 15 inches (38 cm) [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Ninebark is associated with a variety of species through its
successional progression.  In early seral stages, ninebark is a part of
communities that reflect great species diversity.  This would include
overstory species such as quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), shrub
species like redstem ceanothus (Ceanothus velutinus), and numerous
herbaceous species.  In mid-seral communities ninebark is associated
mostly with ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir, shrubs in the Salix and
Prunus genera, and herbs such as penstemon (Penstemon attenuatus) and
Fragaria species.  In climax ninebark associations, Douglas-fir is the
dominant overstory species and occurs in pure stands.  Shrub layers
become increasingly simple, consisting primarily of Physocarpus,
Symphoricarpus, Amelanchier, and Spiraea.  The herbaceus layer decreases
and is generally limited to shade-tolerant rhizomatous species [<a href="#46">46</a>].

In the Intermountain West, ninebark forms a union primarily in the
Douglas-fir/ninebark association.  In northern Idaho, this association
is generally found between the drier ponderosa pine/Idaho fescue
(Festuca idahoensis) or ponderosa pine/ninebark associations, and the
moister grand fir/mountain lover (Pachistima myrsinites) association
[<a href="#6">6</a>].

Ninebark responds to various forms of disturbance such as silvicultural
cutting or wildfire by major vegetative responses.  This includes an
increase in coverage from existing plants and vigorous rhizome sprouting
[<a href="#46">46</a>].  Ninebark is an obligate pioneer species that predictably
increases rapidly in average height following disturbance.  Over time,
as overstory competition increases, the height of ninebark generally
decreases [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Ninebark shrubs in northern Idaho showed stem elongation 25 days earlier
on southern aspects than on the cooler eastern aspects.  From this, it
is hypothesized that stem elongation may be controlled by air
temperature [<a href="#11">11</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Ninebark sprouts vigorously following fire.  Sprouts originate from
horizontal rhizomes, of which a high proportion are situated in mineral
soil.  Ninebark has 36 to 99 percent of its rhizomes buried in mineral
soil, ensuring its potential for survival and sprouting following a
fire.  It has been ranked in the highest fire-survival category in a
western Montana study [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Ninebark is classified as fire resistant [<a href="#14">14</a>].  It is, however,
susceptible to death from severe fire temperatures.  Roots may be damaged by
moderate to severe fires.  Often there is a decrease in aboveground
parts following fire, subsequently delaying regeneration [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].

<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Ninebark has been found to be more abundant on burned sites than on
unburned sites.  Twig densities on ninebark shrubs increased through the
third postfire growing season in northern Idaho.  Shrub heights on
burned and unburned sites were equal by the fourth growing season, while
aboveground biomass of burned shrubs was only 64 percent of that of
unburned shrubs [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Owens [<a href="#39">39</a>] found that the annual twig
production for ninebark increased proportional to the removal of shrub
canopy by fire in northern Idaho.
