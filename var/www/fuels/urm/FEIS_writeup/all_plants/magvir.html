<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name for sweetbay is Magnolia
virginiana L. [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Sweetbay is often confused with loblolly-bay
(Gordonia lasianthus) and redbay (Persea borbonia) but is readily
distinguished from them by the white pubescence of its lower leaf
surface [<a href="#33">33</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Magnolia virginiana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
The high-quality wood of sweetbay is medium soft, uniform, and
straight-grained.  Sweetbay wood is resistant to heavy shrinkage, is
highly shock absorbant, and has a relatively low bending and compression
strength.  It takes glue well, has a good nailing quality, and stains
and varnishes easily [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].

Nearly two-thirds of commercial magnolia (Magnolia spp.) is used in
making furniture products [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Magnolia wood is used by the food
industry for making cherry boxes, flats, and baskets [<a href="#9">9</a>].  The wood is
also used for popsickle sticks, tonque depressers, broomhandles, veneer,
and venetian blinds [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Sweetbay is an important forage for deer and cattle [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Winter use by
cattle can account for as much as 25 percent of their diet [<a href="#20">20</a>].
White-tailed deer browse the leaves and twigs year-round [<a href="#22">22</a>].  The
seeds are eaten by gray squirrels and to a lesser extent by white-footed
mice, wild turkey, quail, and song birds [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Sweetbay is highly palatable to cattle and white-tailed deer [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Seasonal nutrient content of sweetbay browse collected in Texas was as
follows [<a href="#20">20</a>]:
                   
                              N-free          Phosphoric
         Protein  Fat   Fiber  extract   Ash     acid      Calcium
                                (percent)
Summer     10.67  ---   ---     ---      ---     0.18        ---  
Winter      9.44  7.52  22.13  40.59     5.39    0.20       0.79

The protein level is fair to good in summer and fair in winter; the
phosphoric acid level deficient in summer and winter; and the calcium
grade is high [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Sweetbay provides perching and nesting sites for several species of
birds [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The flowers and foliage of sweetbay make it a valuable and extensively
planted ornamental [<a href="#27">27</a>].  The leaves are used in flavoring foods [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Sweetbay can endure prolonged flooding but is susceptible to drought.
Winter drought can cause extensive dieback and mortality.  Seedlings are
very susceptible to frost damage; even a light frost can cause mortality
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  The leaves and twigs of sweetbay are well above the ground and
are often browsed by white-tailed deer in winter.  Sweetbay can be 80 to
100 percent defoliated by the end of the first or second growing season
if browsed heavily [<a href="#20">20</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Magnolia virginiana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sweetbay is a slow-growing, small- to medium-sized evergreen tree or
shrub [<a href="#15">15</a>].  In northern climates sweetbay grows mainly as a shrub,
usually 2 to 5 feet (0.6-1.5 m) tall.  In the southern portions of its
range, the tree may range in height from 50 to 100 feet (15 to 30 m)
[<a href="#27">27</a>].

The white flowers of sweetbay occur on solitary, stout, terminal
peduncles at the end of leafy twigs.  The fruit is a conelike aggregate
consisting of many one- or two-seeded follicles [<a href="#12">12</a>].  At maturity, the
follicles dehisce and the long scarlet seeds emerge to hang suspended
for a time by fine silky threads.  The leaves are alternate, entire, and
thin, with bright green upper surfaces and pubescent, white lower
surfaces.  The bark is thin, smooth, and gray to reddish-brown [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State: Phanerophyte (mesophanerophyte)
   Undisturbed State: Phanerophyte (microphanerophyte)
   Burned or Clipped State: Cryptophyte (geophyte)


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Seed production and dispersal:  Sweetbay produces some seed annually,
but yields are small.  Cleaned seeds average about 7,530 per pound
(16,600/kg) [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Seeds are dispersed by wind, birds, and occasionally
by water [<a href="#33">33</a>].

Dormancy and germination:  Sweetbay seeds exhibit embryo dormancy that
can be broken by 3 to 6 months of cold stratification at 32 to 41
degrees F (0-5 degrees C).  Various tests with stratified seeds have
yielded germination capacities averaging 32 to 50 percent [<a href="#33">33</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Sweetbay stumps produce sprouts but their
vitality and growth potential are not known [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sweetbay occurs mainly east of the Mississippi River on lower elevations
in the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  It occurs on sites that
are usually moist throughout the year, and on sites characterized by
soils of low base saturation [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  Trees commonly associated with
sweetbay are red maple (Acer rubrum), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica),
sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), water oak (Quercus nigra), laurel
oak (Q. laurifolia), southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), and
American holly (Ilex opaca) [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Common understory associates
include buckwheat-tree (Cliftonia monophyla), swamp cyrilla (Cyrilla
racemiflora), swamp dogwood (Cornus stricta), southern bayberry (Myrica
cerifera), Virginia willow (Itea virginica), dahoon (Ilex cassine), red
chokecherry (Sorbus arbutifiolia), large gallberry (I.  coriacea),
inkberry (I. glabra), sweet pepperbush (Clethra alnifolia), and small
switchcane (Arundinaria tecta) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Sweetbay is a late successional species that is intermediate in shade
tolerance [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Sweetbay will invade pine and hardwood stands, and once
established, it can maintain or increase by growing up through openings
in the canopy [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Sweetbay has been migrating onto mesic sites and
establishing itself as a climax species in mixed hardwood forests [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
The flowers open during a period of several weeks from April to July
with the fruit ripening from July through October [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Magnolia virginiana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Sweetbay is moderately adapted to fire.  Although the bark is relatively
thin, the cork layer underneath the bark does not burn easily and is
relatively fire resistant [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by animals or water; postfire yr 1&2

<pre>
<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Magnolia virginiana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Sweetbay seedlings are easily killed by fire.  Older trees, due to bark
characteristics, are quite fire resistant [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Sweetbay sprouts from surviving root collars following top-kill by fire
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In the absence of fire, sweetbay becomes one of the dominant species in
southern mixed hardwood forests [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  Repeated burning may eliminate
sweetbay from some of the flatwoods and bays [<a href="#10">10</a>].
