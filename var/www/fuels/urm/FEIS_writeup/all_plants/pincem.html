<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of Mexican pinyon is Pinus
cembroides Zucc.  It is a member of the pine family (Pinaceae)
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>].  Two varieties in addition to the typical variety are
recognized:  papershell pinyon (P. c. var. remota Little) and Mexican
pinyon (P. c. var. bicolor Little) [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>].

There is taxonomic disagreement about P. cembroides in the strict sense.
Bailey and Hawksworth and others have split P. cembroides infrataxa and
raised them to specific status [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>].  Two subspecies (P.
c. ssp. lagunae D. K. Bailey and P. c. ssp. orizabensis D. K. Bailey)
beside the typical subspecies of P. cembroides were recognized; however,
recently each was raised to specific status [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].  The two varieties,
P. c. var. remota and P. c. var. bicolor, were synonomized to P. remota
(Little) Bailey & Hawksworth and P. discolor Bailey & Hawksworth (border
pinyon), respectively [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>].  All names are currently used in
the literature.

Bailey and Hawksworth relegated P. c. var. bicolor to synonomy with P.
discolor based on differences in flowering times, bark color, needle
color and number, and two monoterpene compounds [<a href="#70">70</a>].  Variation in
flowering time and needle number throughout the revised range of P.
cembroides is inclusive of P. discolor characters [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Therefore,
this writeup considers P. cembroides in the broad sense.  For readers
who support the realignment, studies concerning United States
populations of P. cembroides may be interpreted as P. discolor [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>].

Hybrids occur between Mexican pinyon and true pinyon (P. edulis) where
their ranges overlap [<a href="#29">29</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Mexican pinyon occurs as individual scattered trees in interior
chaparral [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>] and as occasional to frequent trees in the
Madrean evergreen and encinal woodlands [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].  Mexican
pinyon becomes dominant in the pygmy conifer (Pinus spp.)-oak (Quercus
spp.) scrub [<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>], pinyon (Pinus spp.)-juniper (Juniperus spp.)
woodlands [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>], and pine (Pinus spp.)-oak woodlands
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].

Mexican pinyon is an important species in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
menziesii), Chihuahua pine (Pinus leiophylla var. chihuahuana), and
ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa) series [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].

Mexican pinyon is one of the dominant trees in pinyon series [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].
It is minor in geographical range compared to true pinyon and is
included in the true pinyon series, since Mexican pinyon replaces true
pinyon across limited areas in Arizona and New Mexico [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>]

Mexican pinyon occurs as a minor species in some of the relict Arizona
cypress (Cupressus arizonica) forests that are in upland positions
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].

Some of the publications that list Mexican pinyon as a dominant or
indicator species are:

(1)  Preliminary classification for the coniferous forest and woodland
       series of Arizona and New Mexico [<a href="#49">49</a>]
(2)  A series vegetation classification for Region 3 [<a href="#63">63</a>]
(3)  Plant communities of Texas (Series level): February 1992 [<a href="#84">84</a>].

Woody species associated with Mexican pinyon but not previously
mentioned in Distribution and Occurrence include Arizona madrone
(Arbutus arizonica), Texas madrone (Arbutus texana), western white
honeysuckle (Lonicera albiflora), and Madrean mockorange (Philadelphus
madrensis) [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus cembroides
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Mexican pinyon is used for fuel, fenceposts, and small construction timbers,
but rarely for lumber [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>].  The wood is soft, heavy, and
varies from fine- to coarse-grained [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Mexican pinyon seeds are utilized by wildlife including Merriam's
turkey, thick-billed parrot, black bear, porcupine, squirrels,
chipmunks, and other small mammals and birds [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>].
Collared peccary infrequently consume Mexican pinyon seeds from July to
September [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Cattle, goats, and mule deer browse Mexican pinyon [<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>].

In oak-juniper-pinyon woodland of southeastern Arizona, 36 breeding bird
species foraged for insects more on Mexican pinyon and Chihuahua pine
needles than would have been expected from random foraging patterns [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Mexican pinyon seeds have the highest amounts of protein of the pinyons.
Its seeds are approximately 19 percent protein, 60 percent fat, and 14
percent carbohydrates [<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Mexican pinyon groves and pinyon-juniper associations furnish cover for
wildlife such as white-tailed deer, pronghorn, rock squirrel, mountain
cottontail, mice, ringtail, and common hog-nosed skunk [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Mexican pinyon was 1 of 38 pine species tested in planting trials on
sandhills in northwestern Florida.  Mexican pinyon did not survive [<a href="#12">12</a>].




<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The oily and edible Mexican pinyon seeds are an important food source in
the southwestern United States and in Mexico [23,40,43, 51,53,69].
Seeds are harvested by native Americans and commercial pickers in the
fall after the cones open [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  Mexican pinyon and other pinyons
have been harvested commercially for about 50 years; Mexican pinyon
seeds are primarily marketed in Mexico [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  Mexican pinyon seeds
are less preferred than those of other pinyons due to the hard seedcoat [<a href="#47">47</a>].

Mexican pinyon has been used as an ornamental in the United States since
1830 [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>].  It is cultivated for Christmas trees [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].

Mexican pinyon resin is used to waterproof and cement pots, baskets, and
jewelery [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Mexican pinyon and the woodlands it occurs in have been examined for
production potential, silvicultural practices, utilization, and
alternative products [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>].  Seed-tree and shelterwood cutting
do not usually work well for Mexican pinyon due to harsh site conditions
[<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>].  Individual tree and group selection cutting has been
successful in some pinyon-juniper woodlands [<a href="#78">78</a>].  Volume equations have
been derived for Mexican pinyon assessment [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Grazing occurs in most pinyon-juniper woodlands [<a href="#47">47</a>].  Grazing removes
young Mexican pinyon leader shoots; Mexican pinyon recovers by growing
from lateral buds [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Conversion of natural pinyon-juniper woodlands
in which Mexican pinyon occurs to grasslands has resulted in the
destruction of mature trees on a few hundred thousand acres [<a href="#53">53</a>].
Despite the report by Little [<a href="#53">53</a>] that he had never seen evidence of
pinyons invading grasslands, the pinyon-juniper type is reported to have
invaded surrounding communities, including grasslands, for the past 50
to 80 years [<a href="#8">8</a>].  In Arroyo Ancho of Chihuahua, Mexico, 5- to 7-year-old
Mexican pinyon had invaded an area dominated by oaks and grasses [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Mexican pinyon should be considered for reforestation projects in arid
and semiarid areas.  It normally produces useful products such as fuel
and food under these climate conditions [<a href="#70">70</a>].

Mexican pinyon is susceptible to pinyon blister rust (Cronartium
occidentale) and pinyon dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium divaricatum).
Mexican pinyon infected by pinyon dwarf mistletoe has reduced growth
rates, reduced seed production, increased mortality, and is predisposed
to infection by other pests [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus cembroides
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Mexican pinyon is a native, monoecious small tree.  It averages 23 feet
(7 m) tall with a trunk diameter of 7 to 12 inches (17.8-30.5 cm), but
in protected areas it can reach up to 50 feet (15 m) high and have a
trunk diameter of 14 inches (35 cm) [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>].  Stout, spreading
branches make a compact to spreading, rounded crown [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>].  The bark
is thin, 0.5 inch (1.3 cm) or less [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].  Evergreen needles are in
bundles of three or infrequently in bundles of two or four.  The needles
are 0.8 to 2 inches (2-5 cm) long [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>].  Cones are 0.8 to 2
inches (2-5 cm) long [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  The seeds are thick walled, wingless, and
0.5 to 0.75 inch (1.3-1.9 cm) long [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Mexican pinyon regenerates by seed; reports of vegetative reproduction
were not found in the literature.  Mexican pinyon begins bearing seeds
at about 25 years, although trees on dry sites have delayed maturity
[<a href="#57">57</a>].  Seed production increases with age [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Cones require 3
years to mature.  In Arroyo Ancho, Chihuahua, Mexico, Mexican pinyon
produced about 110 to 125 cones per tree during 1978 [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Large crops
are produced at intervals of 3 to 8 years [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Synchrony of cone
crops has not been found [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Rainfall is positively correlated with
the production of the cone buds.  Summer moisture stress at the time of
cone bud production occasionally may promote an above-average crop of
strobili the following spring, indicating that reproductive growth is
favored over vegetative growth when trees are stressed.  Temperatures in
late August and early September are negatively correlated with cone
production; maximum production occurred when the mean maximum weekly
temperature was below 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 deg C) [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Cones can experience heavy predation by invertebrates; up to 90 percent
of the seed crop may be lost to insect predation [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Insects
destroy a higher percentage of the cones from small than large cone
crops [<a href="#53">53</a>].

Mexican pinyon and other pinyons produce only a few seeds per cone.
Seed viability is initially high (85-95%) but decreases within 1 year
[<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  The heavy, wingless seeds fall and germinate beneath the
relatively open seed tree canopies [<a href="#80">80</a>].  The seeds are adapted to
dispersal and burial by rodents, other mammals, and birds such as
Clark's nutcrackers and jays [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].  Clumped seedlings may
reflect animal facilitation and/or microsite differences.

Conditions for cone and seed collection and seed germination are
discussed in the literature [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>].  Seeds are thick walled, but
stratification is not necessary for germination [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

Establishment of Mexican pinyon seedlings depends on the availability of
adequate water during the first dry seasons.  Mexican pinyon
establishment is facilitated by nurse plants such as low shrubs and
trees [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  In a transplant study, Mexican pinyon seedlings
without cover died within 8 weeks, and seedlings planted beneath
adjacent oak canopies survived [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Four-month-old seedlings of
Mexican pinyon and other pines were subjected to drought tolerance
experiments in a greenhouse study.  Mexican pinyon was the most drought
resistant species; its seedlings survived 60 days without water [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Tree growth rates vary widely [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].  Mexican pinyon stand
structure and regeneration patterns are strongly influenced by
disturbances such as fire [<a href="#80">80</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Mexican pinyon occurs in semiarid climates with relatively high
temperatures and evaporation rates.  Precipitation is bimodal with wet
winters and summers [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].

Mexican pinyon is found on nearly level to steep slopes, foothills and
ridgetops, and in mid- to upper slope draws, ravines, and washes
[<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].  It belongs to woodlands that are very dense on
north-facing slopes but open on south- and east-facing slopes [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Mexican pinyon typically occurs from 4,000 to 7,000 feet (1,219-2,188 m)
in elevation [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>].  The maximum elevation of Mexican pinyon
changes with latitude, extending from as low as 2,000 feet (610 m) in
the northeastern part of its range to as high as 8,203 feet (2,500 m) in
southern Mexico [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>].

Mexican pinyon occurs on soils that vary in texture and depth [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].
Soils may be shallow and eroded with textures ranging from sandy loam to
loamy sand [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].  However, soils also can be more than 60 inches (152
cm) deep with moderately fine to very fine textures or with alluvial
layers of stratified sands, gravels and cobbles [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].  Mexican
pinyon occupies soils derived from a broad range of parent materials
including granite, basalt, limestone, sandstone, and mixed alluvium
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].

Along a moisture gradient from mesic to xeric sites in Arizona, Mexican
pinyon was not present on the mesic end of the gradient.  It had 124
stems per acre (306 stems/ha) at the midmesic point and increased to 618
stems per acre (1526 stems/ha) at the most xeric end of the gradient.
The increase in Mexican pinyon stem number may have been due to a
release from competition with other less drought-tolerant conifers such
as Chihuahua pine [<a href="#96">96</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Mexican pinyon does well as an understory tree when canopies are
relatively open.  Most Mexican pinyon seedlings establish beneath open
canopies in partial shade.  Mexican pinyon becomes less shade tolerant
as a sapling [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].

Mexican pinyon woodlands vary in community structure; succession is not
well defined for these systems.  The pine-oak woodlands and forests in
which Mexican pinyon occurs are considered both as ecotones that are not
well developed and as climax vegetation that is extensive and well
developed [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].

Since pinyons will invade dry rocky sites, Little [<a href="#53">53</a>] suggested that
Mexican pinyon could be considered a pioneer species.  However, most
authors identify it as a late successional or climax species, especially
since nurse plants facilitate Mexican pinyon establishment [20,24,25,
100].  Mexican pinyon is climax in pinyon, evergreen oak, and Chihuahuan
pine woodlands [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Mexican pinyon is an infrequent and minor seral
species in white fir (Abies concolor) and Douglas-fir forests [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].



<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
New leaves are formed annually in the spring and persist for 3 to 4
years [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Seed production requires 3 years.  Female cone buds are
formed from August to September [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Pollination occurs the following
spring during March and April [<a href="#98">98</a>].  Cones mature from August through
October of the third year [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>].  Seeds begin to drop by mid- to late
October [<a href="#33">33</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus cembroides
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Community composition and the spatial distribution of intermixed woody
species and understory species influence the effect fire has on Mexican
pinyon.  Despite its thin bark, mature Mexican pinyon is relatively
resistant to low- to moderate-severity fires.  Mexican pinyon more than
80 years old have survived at least four fires, including one of
moderate severity, in Big Bend National Park, Texas [<a href="#62">62</a>].  Seedlings
probably establish from bird and rodent caches following fire.

Mexican pinyon belongs to diverse communities with varying fire regimes.
Historically, fires probably occurred every 10 to 30 years in
pinyon-juniper woodlands.  Fire is the primary cause of secondary
succession in pinyon-juniper woodlands [<a href="#42">42</a>].

Pygmy conifer-oak scrub on steep, rocky slopes and crests develops in
response to fire and drought [<a href="#67">67</a>].  It is fire adapted and its structure
is maintained by periodic fires [<a href="#95">95</a>].

Madrean oak-pine woodlands probably are fire-tolerant, fire-maintained
communites.  The fire regime is not well understood for these
associations [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].  Mexican pinyon occurs in a Madrean oak-pine
woodland in Rhyolite Canyon in Chiricahua National Monument, Arizona.
Historically, surface fires occurred here in 1- to 38-year intervals.
The fire regime has become longer here and elsewhere since livestock
grazing has reduced surface fuels [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>].

In a Madrean evergreen woodland in Boot Canyon in Big Bend National
Park, Texas, ring counts from fire scarred Mexican pinyon indicated that
at least 10 fires occurred between 1770 and 1940, an average of about 1
every 20 years.  Low-severity surface fires do not always produce scars
on Mexican pinyon.  Additionally, cross dating with other species is
necessary due to missing growth rings in Mexican pinyon [<a href="#62">62</a>].  Average
intervals between scar-producing fires were estimated at possibly 70
years for seven sites in the Chisos Mountains in Big Bend National Park
[<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus cembroides

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Low-severity fires kill Mexican pinyon seedlings and young trees; severe
fires kill even mature trees [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  Fire probably kills seeds unless
they are covered with an insulating layer of soil.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Mexican pinyon probably establishes from seed cached by birds and small
mammals following fire.  A proposed sere for the pinyon-juniper
woodlands in which Mexican pinyon occurs suggests that tree seedlings
establish within approximately 30 years following fire [<a href="#25">25</a>].

In narrow canyons in the highlands between Puebla and Veracruz, Mexico,
Mexican pinyon forests reach crown closure 20 years following fire [<a href="#80">80</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Although varying with microsite differences or canopy closure, fuel
loads in pinyon pine habitats where Mexican pinyon is the principal tree
are usually discontinuous and light, resulting in low fire frequencies
[<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].  Fuel in uncut stands is mostly on the surface beneath tree
canopies, which limits fire spread between trees.  With open canopies,
the understory can vary from sparse to dense herbaceous and shrubby
vegetation [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].  Surface fuel build up is slow in low productivity
pinyon-juniper savannas [<a href="#62">62</a>].  Fire effects in this vegetation type are
not well understood [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Fire suppression and reduction of surface fuels by grazing have resulted
in the invasion of grasslands and chaparral by pinyon [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].
Prescribed burning can kill invading seedlings and young trees less than
4 feet (1.2 m) tall [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  A single fire can reduce Mexican pinyon
sapling density tenfold.  Mexican pinyon 80 years or older are more
resistant to fire [<a href="#62">62</a>].  If fires do not kill mature trees, follow up
with mechanical control methods can be used to eliminate pinyon [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].

Low-severity surface fires at 50 or 60 year intervals will thin Mexican
pinyon, preventing development of thickets.  Fire intervals greater than
80 years result in dense stands of Mexican pinyon and a build up of
fuel.  There is also a larger risk of severe fires and crowning [<a href="#62">62</a>].

In narrow canyons, Mexican pinyon crowns can overlap both with one
another and with herbaceous vegetation on slopes.  Small fires can
easily become crown fires.  Fire hazard can be reduced by thinning
stands [<a href="#80">80</a>].

Dwarf mistletoe infection in Mexican pinyon stands may affect fire
hazard conditions by increasing flammability within crowns and
increasing downed woody fuels [<a href="#35">35</a>].
