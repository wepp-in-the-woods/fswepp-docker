<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Western white pine is a seral species that is present in a number of
habitat types, associations, and communities throughout its range.  In
northern Idaho and eastern Washington, it may dominate early
successional stages of the western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla)/queencup
beadlily (Clintonia uniflora) and western redcedar (Thuga
plicata)/queencup beadlily habitat types [<a href="#71">71</a>].  It is also a major seral
species in the western hemlock/queencup beadlily habitat type in western
Monatana and is a major constituent of the western hemlock zone in the
Puget Sound area of Washington [<a href="#11">11</a>].  A western white pine riparian
dominance type has been described for northwestern Montana [<a href="#14">14</a>].
Associated species are those associated with the Aralia phase of the
subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa)/queencup beadlily habitat type [<a href="#14">14</a>].
Western white pine is moderately abundant, usually growing in small
groups and often interspersed with other species, in the subalpine
forest zone on the west slope of the Sierra Nevada [<a href="#50">50</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus monticola
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Western white pine is highly valued as a timber species.  Its wood is
straight grained, nonresinous, lightweight, and exhibits dimensional
stability.  These qualities render the wood useful in the production of
window and door sashes.  The wood is also used in the production of
doors, paneling, dimension stock, matches, and toothpicks [<a href="#11">11</a>].  The
dimension stock works well.  It takes nails without splitting, and it
takes a nice finish.  The wood is also excellent for carving [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Western white pine provides habitat for a variety of mammals, aviafauna,
and insects [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].  Western white pine comprises less than 1
percent of the winter diet of elk [<a href="#61">61</a>]; however, it is browsed by
black-tailed deer in the winter when other browse is limited [<a href="#3">3</a>].  The
seeds of western white pine are an important part of the diet of red
squirrels and deer mice [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability of western white pine's foliage to large ungulates is
generally rated as poor [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].  Blue grouse prefer western white
pine needles over those of western hemlock [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The foliar nutrient levels for current year's growth of western white
pine were listed as follows [<a href="#65">65</a>].

            Percent                             Parts per million

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Western white pine provides nesting, thermal, and foraging cover for a
variety of aviafauna [<a href="#52">52</a>]; it also provides hiding and thermal cover for
elk [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Native Americans chewed the resin, wove baskets from the bark, concocted
a poultice for dressing wounds from the pitch [<a href="#62">62</a>], and collected the
cambium in the spring for food [<a href="#68">68</a>].

Western white pine forests have aesthetic and recreational value.  Cones
of western white pine are collected for novelty items [<a href="#11">11</a>].  The tree is
also planted as an ornamental [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
White pine blister rust:  The most serious damaging agent of western
white pine is white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].
This rust was introduced into this country at the turn of the century
from infected seedlings that had been imported from nurseries in France
[<a href="#1">1</a>].  White pine blister rust has a life cycle requiring alternate hosts
for its completion: five-needled pines and currants (Ribes spp.).  The
rust produces spores on currants that infect white pines.  These spores
can be dispersed by wind [<a href="#28">28</a>] up to 10 miles (17 km) [<a href="#1">1</a>].  The spores
germinate on the needles, and use the stomatal openings as a vector to
the bole of the tree.  This usually results in the death of the host
tree [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Breeding programs have produced strains that are 65 percent resistant to
intense exposure to white pine blister rust [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Selection of naturally
rust-resistant trees for seed sources for natural regeneration and
planting rust-resistant nursery stock may keep future damage from bister
rust minimal [<a href="#11">11</a>].  In established stands that are not rust resistant,
thinning tends to increase the number of new lethal infections, while
pruning tends to decrease the number of new lethal infections [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Fungi:  Western white pine is susceptible to three species of needle
cast fungi:  Lophodermella arcuata, Lophodermium nitens, and Bifusella
linearis.  It is also susceptible to butt-rot fungi, the most important
being Phellinus pini, Phaeolus schweinitzii, and Heterobasidion annosum
[<a href="#11">11</a>].

The most damaging root disease of western white pine is Armillaria spp.,
which causes fading foliage, growth reduction, dead and rotten roots,
and black rhizomorphs, resulting in weakened or dead trees [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].
Annosus root disease (Heterobasidion annosum) also causes some mortality
[<a href="#11">11</a>].  It spreads radially, infecting an area up to 0.25 acre (0.1 ha)
away from stumps [<a href="#70">70</a>].  Treating freshly cut stumps with borax has been
proven effective in preventing the spread of annosus root disease [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Insects:  Western white pine is susceptible to mountain pine beetle
(Dendroctonus ponderosae) and emarginate ips (Ips emarginatus), and is
the principal host for the ips beetle (Ips montanus) [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Pole blight:  Pole blight is a physiological disorder brought on by
drought.  This disease caused significant mortality from 1935 to 1960.
Tree mortality was believed to have resulted from rootlet mortality,
which reduced western white pine's ability to absorb moisture [<a href="#11">11</a>].  The
disease is restricted to sites with shallow soils or soils with low
moisture retention [<a href="#30">30</a>].

Other:  Western white pine is sensitive to sulfur dioxide and flouride
smelter fumes.  These contaminants cause the foliage to yellow and drop
prematurely.  Dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium spp.) attacks western white
pine [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Silvicultural practices:  The method of choice is clearcutting.
Selection cutting is not practical because it favors more shade-tolerant
species.  The composition of a western white pine stand is determined in
the first 30 years.  Until that time it is fairly plastic, and the stand
can be modified by thinning to enhance western white pine growth [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Planting:  Western white pine seedlings are well suited for planting.
Both bareroot and container-grown stock exhibit excellent survival and
growth [<a href="#11">11</a>].  When planting seedlings on droughty sites, it is
beneficial to mound the seedbed, as this incorporates organic matter,
increases microbial activity, decreases density, and increases the
moisture capacity of the soil.  This results in increased nutrient
availability for seedling growth and increases root penetration [<a href="#41">41</a>].
The soil should be packed lightly around the seedling.  This practice
inceases the growth rate in the first year by up to 30 percent [<a href="#31">31</a>].
Seedlings planted in fall have a significantly reduced height growth
compared with those planted in the spring; however, there is little
difference in their survival rates [<a href="#35">35</a>].

Nitrogen can be limiting on some sites after harvest.  The application
of nitrogen at 200 pounds per acre (225 kg/ha) has been found to
increase the growth rate of young western white pine stands (less than
10 years old) by 30 percent [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Frost tolerance:  When dormant, western white pine is one of the more
frost-tolerant species of the Northwest [<a href="#36">36</a>].

Competitors:  Competing vegetation of western white pine can be
effectivly controlled by the application of Roundup herbicide
(isopropylamine salt of glyphosate).  The recommended rate of
application is 1 to 3 quarts (1-3 l) of Roundup to 10 gallons (38 l) of
aqueous solution per acre (0.4 ha).  This treatment had no observable
effects on western white pine [<a href="#33">33</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus monticola
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Western white pine is a native, evergreen, long-lived (400+ years),
monoecious tree [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  It can reach 200 feet (60 m) in height
and 8 feet (2.4 m) in d.b.h.  The needles, 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm) long,
are in bundles of five.  The bark on young trees is smooth and grayish
green but on mature trees becomes grayish brown, scaley, and separated
into rectangular plates [<a href="#16">16</a>].  The crown is narrow and composed of
regularly spaced branches [<a href="#1">1</a>].  In dense stands western white pine
self-prunes well, leaving a long, clean bole [<a href="#16">16</a>].

The root system consists of a taproot and lateral roots which can spread
up to 26 feet (8 m).  Most (75 percent) of the lateral roots are in the
upper 24 inches (60 cm) of soil [<a href="#11">11</a>].

The male strobili are yellow, and the female strobili are reddish
purple.  Mature female strobili are 5 to 15 inches (12-38 cm) in length
[<a href="#44">44</a>].

The early growth of western white pine is not rapid, but it is the
fastest growing sapling and pole-sized tree in the Northern Rockies
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Western white pine can begin producing strobili at 7 years of age [<a href="#11">11</a>],
but production can be limited by moisture stress and timing.  Moisture
stress in the early summer of the year strobili mature leads to
abortion, while moisture stress in the early summer of the first and
second years prior to strobili emergence causes an increase in the
number of strobili.  Moisture stress in the late summer prior to
strobili emergence causes a decrease in strobili numbers [<a href="#47">47</a>].

A good crop of female strobili is about 40 per tree [<a href="#1">1</a>].  During fair to
poor crop years cone beetles (Conophthorus spp.), cone moths (Dioryctria
abietivorella and Eucosma rescissorianna), red squirrels, and deer mice
can cause partial or complete crop failures [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Seed production requires 3 years from the onset of bud initiation.  Good
seed crops occur every 3 to 4 years.  The mean number of seeds per pound
is 27,000 (59,000/kg).  The seed can be dispersed by wind up to 2,620
feet (800 m) from the parent tree.  Seeds remain viable in the duff for
up to 4 years, but the germination rate decreases.  After 2 years the
rate is 25 percent, and after 4 years the rate is 1 percent.  Western
white pine's seed requires cold moist stratification of 30 to 120 days
to germinate; germination is epigeal [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Moisture and soil
temperature are believed to control the onset of germination.  The
perferred germination substrate is mineral soil, but seeds will also
germinate in duff [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].

Seedling mortality is quite high in the first year due to snow mold
(Neopeckia coulteri), rodents, late season drought, and elevated soil
temperatures on dry sites [<a href="#11">11</a>].  On dry sites seedling establishment is
favored by partial shade, while on moist sites full sunlight favors
establishment [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Western white pine does not naturally
reproduce by sprouting or layering.  However, cuttings from young trees
treated with rooting hormones (indolebutyric acid) have rooted with fair
success [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Williams [<a href="#69">69</a>] describes the process and considerations
for rooting cuttings from older trees (25 years).  He obtained a mean
success rate of 37 percent.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Western white pine is restricted to climates characterized by dry
summers and a predominance of winter precipitation [<a href="#72">72</a>].  The most
extensive and best stands of western white pine are found in the river
bottoms and less steep lower slopes of the Priest, Coeur d'Alene, St.
Joe, and Clearwater River basins [<a href="#72">72</a>].  In British Columbia, western
white pine is a minor species on moderately dry to wet, nutrient-medium
to nutrient-rich sites in the maritime and submaritime climates [<a href="#23">23</a>].
Here, western white pine requires sites fairly rich in calcium and
magnesium [<a href="#25">25</a>].  However, in the coastal Northwest, western white pine
becomes abundant only on poor sites, where it can outcompete Douglas-fir
(Pseudotsuga menziesii) and other conifers.  It does well on
unproductive, gravelly soils in the Puget Sound area and reportedly
thrives at the edges of bogs on the Olympic Peninsula [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Soils:  Western white pine grows on a wide variety of soils within its
range, the majority of which have been classified as Spodosols [<a href="#11">11</a>].
Along the West Coast, it attains best development on deep, porous soils,
but it is most common on poor, sandy soils.  In northern Idaho and other
inland sites, it is found on shallow to deep soils, with the surface
layers composed of loess or loessial-like material.  Parent materials
include granite, shist, basalt, and sedimentary rocks.  The pH ranges
from 4.5 to 6.8 with a mean of 5.4 [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Elevation and topography:  Western white pine is generally a montane
species, but grows at a wide range of elevations [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].  Elevational
ranges vary as follows [<a href="#11">11</a>]:

Area                         Feet                   Meters

British Columbia            0 to 1,480              0 to 450
Vancover Island, BC         0 to 3,940              0 to 1,200
California              6,000 to 10,990         1,830 to 3350
Idaho                   1,540 to 5,910            500 to 1,800
Montana                 1,540 to 5,910            500 to 1,800
Oregon                  6,000 to 7,020          1,830 to 2140
Washington                  0 to 6,070              0 to 1,850

Associated species:  In Washington, Oregon, and the Inland Empire,
western white pine grows in communities that are rich in other woody and
herbaceous flora, but in the Sierra Nevada associated vegetation is
usually sparse [<a href="#11">11</a>].  In addition to those previously listed under
Distribution and Occurrence, overstory associates include Pacific silver
fir (Abies anabilis), noble fir (A. concolor), whitebark pine (Pinus
albicaulis), foxtail pine (P. balfauriana), limber pine (P. flexilis),
sugar pine (P. lambertiana), Jeffrey pine (P. jeffreyi), quaking aspen
(Populus tremuloides), and paper birch (Betula papyrifera) [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Understory associates include Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia),
huckleberry (Vaccinium spp.), willow (Salix spp.), honeysuckle (Lonicera
spp.), currant, Rocky Mountain maple (Acer glabrum), snowberry
(Symphoricarpus spp.), ocean-spray (Holodiscus discolor), serviceberry
(Amelanchier alnifolia), pachistima (Pachistima myrsinites), sedges
(Carex spp.), pinegrass (Calamagrostis rubescens), false-solomons-seal
(Smilacina), wild ginger (Asarum caudatum), and queencup beadlily [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species
Facultative Seral Species

Western white pine is classified as shade intolerant to very intolerant
[<a href="#24">24</a>].  It is usually seral to fir (Abies spp.), spruce (Picea spp.), or
hemlock (Tsuga spp.) [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  Stickney [<a href="#59">59</a>] classified western white pine
as a colonizer.

Western white pine does not respond favorably after release from 30 to
60 years of suppression [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Height and diameter growth starts from May to late June depending on
elevation, aspect, and latitude [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Strobili buds emerge in June.  The buds are differentiated in July and
August of the year preceding emergence.  Pollen dispersal lasts for a
mean of 8.5 days and usually starts the last week in June.  Time of
flowering varies over a period of 20 days and is strongly controlled by
temperatures during the preceding weeks.  It is delayed for 5 days for
every 1,000 feet (300 m) gain in elevation, and 6 days per degree
Fahrenheit below normal temperatures for May and June.  The female
strobili ripen from August to September of the second year after bud
emergence [<a href="#11">11</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Mature western white pine, with its moderately thick bark (1.5 inches [3
cm]), moderately flammable foliage, height, and evanescent lower limbs,
is rated moderate in fire resistance [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  However, dense stands,
lichen growth, and resinous bark can decrease western white pine's
resistance to fire [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Young trees with their thin bark are very susceptible to lethal damage
by fire [<a href="#12">12</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus monticola
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire of any intensity will damage the cambium layer of young trees,
usually resulting in death of the tree [<a href="#12">12</a>].

In a mature western white pine stand, a cool fire will kill scattered
trees, while only scarring others.  However,the fire scars provide a
vector for butt rots to enter the tree [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Moderate to severe fire in
a mature western white pine stand results in cambium damage and
crowning, which usually results in the death of the tree [<a href="#56">56</a>].

The large amount of humus in western white pine forests renders the
trees susceptible to death from heating of the roots [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
After a stand-replacing fire, western white pine will seed in from
adjacent areas [<a href="#17">17</a>].  After a cool to moderate fire that leaves a mosaic
of mineral soil and duff, western white pine will reoccupy the site from
seed stored in the seed bank [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Western white pine is a fire-dependent, seral species.  Fire supression
and white pine blister rust have decreased western white pine stocking
from 44 percent in 1941 to 5 percent in 1979 [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Periodic,
stand-replacing fire or other disturbance is needed to remove competing
conifers and allow western white pine to develop in early seres
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].

Slash burning:  Dry sites in the western white pine forest type respond
poorly to slash burning, while moist sites respond favorably [<a href="#24">24</a>].
Stark [<a href="#57">57</a>] provides information on how to estimate nutrient losses from
the harvest and slash burning of a western white pine stand.  The use of
chemical retardent around leave trees in selective cuts has been found
to be effective in reducing cambium damage when slash concentrations are
light or moderate [<a href="#51">51</a>].

For effective fire hazard abatement the recommended Federal slash hazard
index is 11 when planning a prescribed fire in western white pine slash.
An index of less than 9 will provide little reduction, and greater than
12 generates risk of fire escape [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Reinhardt and others [<a href="#49">49</a>]
provide information on prescribed fire, slash disposal, duff
consumption, and management considerations after harvest in western
white pine stands in northern Idaho.

Wildlife:  Prescribed fire has been recommended in western white pine
stands to maintain areas of abundant browse for elk [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Other:  After wildfire it is recommended that salvage operations begin
within the first 2 years [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Peterson and Ryan [<a href="#42">42</a>] have developed a
model based on site, fire, and silvicultural information to predict
conifer mortality after wildfire for long-term planning.
