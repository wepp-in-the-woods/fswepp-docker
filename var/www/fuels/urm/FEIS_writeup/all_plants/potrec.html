GENERAL DISTRIBUTION:</a>
</span>
<br />


The following information on the origin, North American introduction, and spread 
of sulfur cinquefoil is based on reviews [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>], unless otherwise cited. 

<p>
Sulfur cinquefoil is native to the eastern Mediterranean region of Eurasia. It occurs 
sparsely in England, and occurs in central and southern Europe from central 
France and Germany to central Spain, Sicily and the Middle East. It is found in 
western and central Asia to approximately 100 E longitude, and south to Asia Minor 
and northern Iran. Sulfur cinquefoil also occurs in the mountains of North Africa [<a href="#91">91</a>]. 
More recent field surveys of western, central, and southeastern Europe did not locate 
sulfur cinquefoil in the upper Rhine valley,  Alsace, the Swiss Jura; the alpine 
regions of Switzerland, Italy, and France; or in 
eastern Austria, southern Hungary, and northern Romania, although these areas 
have been listed as within its distribution. The surveys did locate sulfur 
cinquefoil in Macedonia, northern Greece, western Turkey and Bulgaria [<a href="#39">39</a>].</p>

<p>
The exact time and place of the original introduction of sulfur cinquefoil to 
North America is not known. The 1st collection of sulfur cinquefoil in North 
America was made sometime before 1900 in Ontario. In 1950 its reported 
distribution was from Newfoundland and Nova Scotia to Ontario, with scattered 
populations in southern British Columbia, and rapidly spreading. By this time, 
sulfur cinquefoil was also established in the northeastern U.S. and the Great 
Lakes region [<a href="#91">91</a>]. The first known collection in western North America was on 
western Vancouver Island in 1914. The earliest record of sulfur cinquefoil in 
the Columbia River Basin was in Idaho in 1934 [<a href="#70">70</a>]. By 1940 sulfur cinquefoil 
had also been identified in Washington [<a href="#22">22</a>].</p>

<p>
In North America, sulfur cinquefoil occurs from the eastern coast of Canada and the 
northeastern seaboard of the U.S. to the Pacific coast of British Columbia, Washington, 
and Oregon. It is not found north of 53 N latitude. Heavy infestations occur in 
southern Ontario, Quebec, southern interior British Columbia, the Great Lake states, 
Montana, Idaho, Oregon and Washington. Many federal wilderness areas surveyed in the 
Rocky Mountain region report the presence of sulfur cinquefoil [<a href="#55">55</a>]. Scattered 
populations of sulfur cinquefoil occur in Manitoba, along the Pacific coast from 
British Columbia south into California [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>], and west into northwestern Nevada [<a href="#41">41</a>] 
and Colorado [<a href="#90">90</a>]. In the Great Plains, sulfur cinquefoil is infrequent to locally common 
in disturbed areas and less frequent in prairies [<a href="#28">28</a>]. It extends south into Florida [<a href="#94">94</a>] 
and Texas [<a href="#18">18</a>]. The <a href="https://plants.usda.gov/">Plants Database</a> provides a distribution map for 
sulfur cinquefoil.</p>

<p>Powell [<a href="#60">60</a>] describes the need for an accurate, comprehensive inventory of 
sulfur cinquefoil in British Columbia. He suggests inventories at a scale relevant 
to ultimate management units, that include geographic location, plant community type, 
seral stage, site characteristics, and size, density, and canopy cover of sulfur 
cinquefoil infestations. Inventories of this nature would help to establish ecological 
limits and to define potential distributions of sulfur cinquefoil and other nonnative, 
invasive species in North America. This information could provide objective direction 
for the nature, degree, and location of management activities. Inventory information can 
also serve as a baseline for monitoring population dynamics, and the effectiveness of 
various management activities [<a href="#60">60</a>]. </p>

<p>
The ecological amplitude of sulfur cinquefoil must be determined to confirm 
which ecosystems and habitat types  are suitable to its establishment and 
persistence, and to define its distribution and potential areas of impact 
[<a href="#60">60</a>].</p>

<p>
The following lists are meant to provide some idea of where sulfur cinquefoil 
might occur or be invasive, but provide no certainty without the aforementioned 
inventory information. <br><br>

Sulfur cinquefoil occupies a wide variety of habitats in its native range in 
southeastern Europe and southwestern Asia, from marine shorelines to 
pine-dominated forests, and  is most common on hillsides in grass- or 
shrub-dominated communities (Schaffner and Tosevski 1994, as cited by Powell 
[<a href="#60">60</a>]). Surveys in parts of western, central and southeastern Europe located sulfur 
cinquefoil mainly in pine-forest clearings and forest borders. Sulfur cinquefoil 
occurred in open grassland vegetation only in Bulgaria [<a href="#39">39</a>].

<p>
Sulfur cinquefoil populations in North America are commonly associated with roadsides, 
vegetation disturbance, abandoned agricultural fields, and &quot;waste areas&quot; [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>]. 
According to Rice [<a href="#70">70</a>], sulfur cinquefoil can also invade &quot;native plant 
communities that are remote from any apparent human disturbance,&quot; and is now 
common in natural grasslands, &quot;shrubby areas,&quot; and open-canopy forests in the 
northwestern U.S. [<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].</p>

<p>
Rice [<a href="#69">69</a>] conducted a summary analysis of ecological and management 
data for 85 sites infested with sulfur cinquefoil in Montana. Sulfur cinquefoil was 
identified in ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>), Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga 
menziesii</i> var. <i>glauca</i>), spruce (<i>Picea</i> spp.), grand fir (<i>Abies 
grandis</i>), subalpine fir (<i>A. lasiocarpa</i>), western redcedar (<i>Thuja 
plicata</i>), western hemlock (<i>Tsuga heterophylla</i>), antelope bitterbrush 
(<i>Purshia tridentata</i>), skunkbush sumac (<i>Rhus</i> <i>trilobata</i>), 
western wheatgrass (<i>Pascopyrum smithii</i>), bluebunch wheatgrass 
(<i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i>), Idaho fescue (<i>Festuca idahoensis</i>), rough fescue 
(<i>F. altaica</i>), and Kentucky bluegrass (<i>Poa pratensis</i>) communities. The majority 
of these sites had other nonnative invasive plants present, as follows:</p>

<p>
Of the 27 species of cinquefoil found in Montana, 6 native cinquefoils (shrubby cinquefoil 
(<i>Dasiphora floribunda</i>), tall cinquefoil (<i>P. arguta</i>), sticky cinquefoil (<i>P. 
glandulosa</i>), slender cinquefoil (<i>P. gracilis</i>), horse cinquefoil (<i>P. hippiana</i>), and 
Pennsylvania cinquefoil (<i>P. pennsylvanica</i>)) and 1 nonnative cinquefoil, (silver cinquefoil 
(<i>P. argentea</i>)) occurred with sulfur cinquefoil on 1 or more of the 85 sites studied [<a href="#69">69</a>]. </p>



<p>
In British Columbia, sulfur cinquefoil is most commonly found in bunchgrass, 
ponderosa pine, interior Douglas-fir, and coastal Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> var.
<i>menziesii</i>) biogeoclimatic zones. Sulfur cinquefoil is a transient component of dry subzones 
of interior cedar-hemlock and coastal western hemlock biogeoclimatic zones. Sulfur cinquefoil is 
also commonly associated with diffuse knapweed populations in British Columbia [<a href="#60">60</a>].  </p>



<p>
In Michigan, Werner and Soule [<a href="#91">91</a>] found sulfur cinquefoil occasionally in wood margins, 
but not under forest canopies. It is sometimes found invading dry, open woods such as aspen (<i>Populus</i> 
spp.) [<a href="#88">88</a>]. Sulfur cinquefoil may be found in fallow fields with the following
plants: aster (<i>Symphyotrichum </i>spp.), staghorn sumac (<i>R. typhina</i>), 
western yarrow (<i>Achillea millefolium</i>), Queen Anne's lace (<i>Daucus carota</i>), 
Canada bluegrass (<i>Poa compressa</i>), Norwegian cinquefoil (<i>Potentilla norvegica</i>), 
eastern daisy fleabane (<i>Erigeron annuus</i>), garden yellowrocket (<i>Barbarea vulgaris</i>), 
silvery cinquefoil, smooth brome (<i>Bromus inermis</i>), and annual ragweed (<i>Ambrosia artemisiifolia</i>) 
[<a href="#91">91</a>].</p>



<p>
Sulfur cinquefoil is also found on eastern Minnesota prairie sites [<a href="#64">64</a>].

Correct identification of sulfur cinquefoil is important if control strategies 
are planned, because sulfur cinquefoil may be confused with 
native cinquefoils, particularly slender cinquefoil (<i>Potentilla gracilis</i>). 
Seven varieties of slender cinquefoil have been identified [<a href="#35">35</a>], further 
complicating identification. The following contrasting characteristics are suggested to help 
separate sulfur cinquefoil from slender cinquefoil [<a href="#70">70</a>]:

The following description of sulfur cinquefoil presents characteristics that may 
be relevant to fire ecology, and is based on descriptions from several sources 
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>], unless otherwise cited. It is not meant for identification. Identification 
guidelines, line drawings, and color photos are available (e.g. [<a href="#66">66</a>]). Keys for
identification are also available (e.g. [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>]). </p>

<p>
Sulfur cinquefoil is a perennial forb with a short caudex attached to a woody 
taproot. Sulfur cinquefoil roots are persistent and may have some lateral 
growth, but have no rhizomes [<a href="#68">68</a>]. Sulfur cinquefoil has 1 to several slender, erect, 
hairy stems that are 8 to 30 inches (20-80 cm) tall. The upper portion of the 
stem may be branched. Sulfur cinquefoil stems bear many palmately compound leaves 
with 5 to 9 leaflets that are 1 to 3 inches (3-8 cm) long and 0.2 to 1 inch (0.5-2.5 cm) wide, 
and covered on both sides with sparse, stiff hairs. Lower leaves have long petioles and
upper leaves have shorter or no petioles and fewer leaflets. Sulfur cinquefoil flowers are
many, and are borne in open, branched, flat-topped inflorescences above the principal
foliage. Flowers are 0.6 to 1 inch (1.5-2.5 cm) wide with 5 petals. Sulfur 
cinquefoil fruits are achenes, about1 mm long, with a slightly 
winged margin [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>].</p>

<p>There are no reports in the literature of sulfur cinquefoil growing in 
monospecific stands. It has been recorded at densities up to 39 
flowering plants per m<sup>2</sup> at a site in Michigan [<a href="#91">91</a>], and up to 75% canopy 
cover on a site in Montana [<a href="#69">69</a>]. Density of sulfur cinquefoil in a 
field left fallow for 10 years in Michigan was 2.67 flowering stems per m<sup>2</sup> 
[<a href="#91">91</a>]. </p>

<p>
Sulfur cinquefoil forms relatively clear annual growth rings in the root 
xylem that can be used to estimate plant age [<a href="#17">17</a>].  </p>

<p>
According to Werner and Soule [<a href="#91">91</a>], aging of sulfur cinquefoil by counting rings 
in the taproot is not possible after about 6 years because the central core of 
the root decomposes. Estimates based, instead, on total diameter of the root 
ring of plants in Michigan indicate that 20-year-old plants are not unusual [<a href="#91">91</a>]. 
Using this method to estimate the age of herbaria specimens, it appears 
most sulfur cinquefoil plants collected in British Columbia in the last 20 
years are less than 6 years old [<a href="#60">60</a>]. </p>

<p>
Sulfur cinquefoil has no known mycorrhizal associations [<a href="#60">60</a>].

REGENERATION PROCESSES:</a>
</span>
<br />

Sulfur cinquefoil reproduces by seed and vegetatively by sprouting from a caudex. 

<p>
Soule and Werner [<a href="#79">79</a>] studied reproductive effort (the proportion of aboveground 
biomass allocated to reproductive parts) in sulfur cinquefoil in 3 old fields in 
Michigan and found it to be variable among years and habitats. The average reproductive 
effort ranged from 16 to 28%. The 1st year of sampling indicated reproductive 
effort declined from the least successionally mature population to the most 
mature population. However, this relationship was not observed in the 2nd year 
of sampling [<a href="#79">79</a>].</p>

<p>
<b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Breeding system:</font></b> 
Cross-fertilization is the most common means of fertilization in sulfur 
cinquefoil, but some seeds are produced by self-pollination. Sulfur 
cinquefoil is cross-pollinated by wind or insects [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>].</p>

<p>
<b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Seed production:</font> </b> 
Werner and Soule [<a href="#91">91</a>] report an average of 61.5 <u>+</u> 28.0 seeds per flower, 
25.0 <u>+</u> 10.7 flowers per stem, and 1.1 <u>+</u> 0.4 stems per plant 
from sulfur cinquefoil studied in old fields in Michigan. From these data they 
calculate that a single sulfur cinquefoil plant might produce
about 1,650 seeds under the site conditions of their study. In a population with 2.7 
plants per m<sup>2</sup>, about 4,400 seeds per m<sup>2</sup> may be produced each 
year [<a href="#91">91</a>]. On a grassland site in northwestern Montana, the proportion of sulfur 
cinquefoil plants producing fruit ranged from 3 to 86%, was highly variable, 
and was highest during years with highest precipitation. These plants produced 
an average of 123 seeds per fruit, when averaged over 3 years. Number of seeds 
per fruit was highest in the 2 wettest years, and lowest on the most xeric plot 
in the study [<a href="#52">52</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seed dispersal:</b></font> 
When mature, most sulfur cinquefoil seed is dispersed by falling passively 
to the ground [<a href="#91">91</a>]. The importance of seed-dispersal mechanisms has not been specifically 
documented in sulfur cinquefoil. While grazing animals rarely eat sulfur 
cinquefoil, and feeding by small mammals or birds on sulfur cinquefoil plants or 
seeds is unknown, more research is needed to determine whether seed could be distributed 
by birds, small mammals, ungulates, and other grazing animals in the following ways [<a href="#60">60</a>]:</p> 

<ul>
  <li><p class="subframeText"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">

  <li><p class="subframeText"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">

</ul>

<p>
Human activities also provide several potential seed dispersal vectors [<a href="#60">60</a>]:</p>

</ul>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seed banking:</b></font> 
In a laboratory experiment, some viable sulfur cinquefoil seeds remained after 28 months of 
burial at 3 inches (7 cm), suggesting the potential for forming a persistent 
seed bank. Several other cinquefoil species form persistent seed banks [<a href="#7">7</a>]. 
According to Rice and others [<a href="#66">66</a>], &quot;sulfur cinquefoil re-establishes within 3 or 
4 years following herbicide treatment. This suggests that cinquefoil seeds 
remain viable in the soil for more than 4 years.&quot; They do not indicate what 
herbicide was used or the site conditions under which this observation was made; 
nor do they address the possibility of sulfur cinquefoil seed dispersal from 
offsite sources.</p>

<p>
The ultimate longevity of sulfur cinquefoil seeds in soil, and the 
relationship between soil conditions and rate of sulfur cinquefoil seed decay is 
yet unknown [<a href="#60">60</a>]. More research in this area is needed.</p>

<p>
<b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Germination:</font></b> 
Baskin and Baskin [<a href="#7">7</a>] conducted a laboratory experiment to study germination ecology of sulfur 
cinquefoil. Fresh, mature sulfur cinquefoil seeds were buried and exposed to 
natural yearly temperature cycles. Seeds were exhumed at monthly intervals and 
tested in light and darkness at various 12/12 hour alternating temperature 
regimes. At maturity, a high percentage of sulfur cinquefoil seeds was dormant 
(i.e. did not germinate at any thermoperiod in either light or darkness). 
Some of the fresh, mature seed was conditionally 
dormant (2-38% germinated in light only at 59/43 and 68/50 degrees Fahrenheit 
(15/6 and 20/10 �C)). During summer, sulfur cinquefoil seeds after-ripened, and 
germination percentages and the maximum temperature at which germination 
occurred increased. All sulfur cinquefoil seeds were nondormant by autumn. Once dormancy is 
broken, seeds do no re-enter dormancy if they fail to germinate. Sulfur 
cinquefoil seeds did not exhibit a seasonal cycle in their germination responses. 
No sulfur cinquefoil germination occurred in darkness. The upper temperature limit for 
germination of sulfur cinquefoil seeds is around 95/68 degrees Fahrenheit (35/20 �C). 
Thus, buried seeds can potentially germinate during any month of the growing season, 
if a disturbance brings the seeds to the soil surface and moisture is not limiting [<a href="#7">7</a>]. In 
northwestern Montana, seeds collected in August germinated readily in October 
with warm/dark-light (55% germination) and warm-cold/dark-light (70% germination) treatments. 
About 5% germinated in the dark [<a href="#52">52</a>].</p> 

<p>
Werner and Soule [<a href="#91">91</a>] cite a study in which a maximum germination rate of 
17.5% occurred for sulfur cinquefoil seeds after 1 month of storage in sand or 2 
months in peat, under moist conditions. Germination was very low in seeds stored 
under dry conditions [<a href="#91">91</a>].</p> 

<p>
A study by Bosy and Aarssen [<a href="#11">11</a>] demonstrates that physical orientation of 
sulfur cinquefoil seed in the soil can affect germination rates. They conclude 
that the effects of the environment on an individual seed can depend entirely on its 
orientation (which may occur by chance), even within a substrate that is 
completely homogeneous [<a href="#11">11</a>].</p> 

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seedling establishment/growth:</b></font> 
Very little information is available on seedling establishment and growth of 
sulfur cinquefoil. Research regarding its growth characteristics in various 
environments with varying degrees of plant competition is necessary to understand its 
potential impacts. </p>

<p>
Recruitment of sulfur cinquefoil was low during 4 years of a study in 
grassland sites in northwestern Montana. Two plots 
averaged less than 0.5 recruits per fruiting plant, and the plot with the highest 
recruitment rate averaged 2 recruits per fruiting plant. The majority of plants 
remained in the same size class or became smaller during the study in all 4 
sample populations. Mortality rates of sulfur cinquefoil in these plots ranged from 6 to 48%, 
and density of small sulfur cinquefoil plants remained low during the 4 years of 
this study. This time period coincided with 15-30% below average precipitation. 
Mortality rates were highest in 1999, because most of the small 
plants (probably recruited in 1998, a year with above average precipitation and 
high seedling recruitment) died. The author suggests drought combined with 
competition from established vegetation caused high mortality of seedlings [<a href="#52">52</a>]. </p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Asexual regeneration:</b></font> 
The usual pattern of yearly regeneration of sulfur cinquefoil is by new shoots appearing 
near edges of the caudex, while the old central part slowly rots away during 
successive growing seasons. The result is that long-lived plants are in the form 
of a circle of upright stems, sometimes with other plants growing in this 
central area. Through this means of asexual regeneration, a sulfur cinquefoil 
plant eventually becomes several independent closely spaced plants. Sprouting 
from the caudex also allows sulfur cinquefoil to survive along roadsides and 
other areas that are disturbed periodically, as new shoots sprout soon after 
established shoots are cut off [<a href="#91">91</a>]. This method of vegetative reproduction does not 
result in broad dispersal of sulfur cinquefoil plants, as the offspring grow 
close to the former root system of the parent plant. The importance of vegetative 
reproduction relative to reproduction by seed is unknown [<a href="#60">60</a>].</p>


<p>
A Pacific Northwest extension publication suggests that sulfur cinquefoil 
can &quot;spread by roots when they are 
transported by tillage or on soil-moving equipment&quot;; and that &quot;stems that are 
knocked to the ground can produce roots at the nodes&quot; [<a href="#13">13</a>]. 
The source of this information is not specified and reference to sulfur cinquefoil 
reproduction by this means is not found elsewhere in the literature. </p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SITE CHARACTERISTICS">
SITE CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Little information is available regarding site characteristics that are suitable to
sulfur cinquefoil's establishment and persistence. A detailed inventory could facilitate 
determination of the ecological amplitude of sulfur cinquefoil and identify potential 
areas of impact in North America [<a href="#60">60</a>]. According to Rice [<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>], sulfur cinquefoil has a wide 
ecological amplitude, occurring in a wide range of habitat types, soil textures, 
aspects, and elevations.

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>General climate:</b></font> 
In its native habitats in southeastern Europe and southwestern Asia, sulfur cinquefoil grows 
in areas with a Mediterranean climate (Schaffner and Tosevski 1994, as cited by 
Powell [<a href="#60">60</a>]). In Canada, sulfur cinquefoil is found where less than 1% of the 
minimum daily temperatures fall below 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 �C) in May and 
less than 5% fall below 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 �C) in July [<a href="#91">91</a>]. Sulfur cinquefoil 
flourishes in Montana's semiarid climate in areas similar to those inhabited by 
spotted knapweed [<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Soil characteristics, soil moisture, precipitation:</b></font> 
Sulfur cinquefoil does not seem to be limited by soil texture. In Montana, it is found on 
sites with all soil textures except pure silt, but grows mainly on sandy-clay loam soils 
[<a href="#69">69</a>], with dense growth reported on clay soils [<a href="#68">68</a>]. Sulfur cinquefoil occurred on a seasonal wetland 
site in Montana that had coarse textured, cobbly soils [<a href="#69">69</a>]. In Kansas, sulfur cinquefoil is 
often found in rocky or sandy soil [<a href="#6">6</a>]. Sulfur cinquefoil is usually found in dry soil in 
the northeastern U.S. [<a href="#25">25</a>], and along the eastern coast from Newfoundland to North Carolina [<a href="#20">20</a>]. 
According to a review by Werner and Soule [<a href="#91">91</a>], sulfur cinquefoil is most common on limey and 
stony soils in eastern North America.  </p>

<p>
In Canada, the distribution of sulfur cinquefoil corresponds to those areas 
with 30 to 50 inches (750-1,250 mm) mean annual precipitation [<a href="#91">91</a>]. In Nevada, 
sulfur cinquefoil occurs only in the northwestern part of the state on wet or 
damp soil around lakes, ponds, streams, and ditches [<a href="#41">41</a>]. At Dancing Prairie Preserve 
in northwestern Montana, where mean annual precipitation is 17 inches (438 mm), sulfur cinquefoil 
populations appear to be more variable and more likely to dramatically increase 
under favorable conditions on more xeric sites, while mesic-site populations are 
smaller, yet more stable [<a href="#52">52</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Aspect, elevation, latitude/longitude:</b></font> 
Sulfur cinquefoil is found from sea level to over 7,500 
feet (2,300 m) in its native habitats in southeastern Europe and southwestern 
Asia (Schaffner and Tosevski 1994, as cited by Powell [<a href="#60">60</a>]). In Montana, 
sulfur cinquefoil infestations are found at all aspects and at low to 
mid-elevations, up to 6,580 feet (2,000 m) [<a href="#70">70</a>]. In California, sulfur 
cinquefoil is found between 500 and 5000 feet (150-1500 m) [<a href="#34">34</a>]. In Nevada it is 
found between 4,800 and 6,000 feet (1,400-1,800 m) [<a href="#41">41</a>]. Sulfur cinquefoil is 
found mainly below 50� N in Canada [<a href="#91">91</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Evidence of disturbance:</b></font> 
Disturbed sites are particularly susceptible to early colonization and rapid dominance by
sulfur cinquefoil [<a href="#70">70</a>]. Sulfur cinquefoil is reported to occur in disturbed areas in 
California [<a href="#34">34</a>], Nova Scotia [<a href="#72">72</a>], the Great Plains [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>], Texas [<a href="#18">18</a>], Montana [<a href="#47">47</a>], 
the northeastern U.S. [<a href="#25">25</a>], Illinois [<a href="#57">57</a>], the Carolinas [<a href="#62">62</a>], along the coast from 
North Carolina to Newfoundland [<a href="#20">20</a>], West Virginia [<a href="#82">82</a>], and 
Michigan [<a href="#88">88</a>]. Disturbed areas are typically described as &quot;weedy areas,&quot; 
&quot;waste places,&quot; roadsides, railroads, clearings, pastures, old fields, and 
gravel pits.</p>

<p>
Sulfur cinquefoil populations in the northwestern U.S. and British Columbia 
are often associated with roadsides, abandoned agricultural fields, logged 
areas, areas with heavy livestock grazing, &quot;waste places,&quot; and other sites 
associated with vegetation and/or soil disturbance [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>]. An exclosure 
designed to illustrate effects of livestock and wildlife grazing by 
excluding elk, deer, and cattle was built in southeastern British Columbia in 
1951. No sulfur cinquefoil was recorded in the area until 1991, and then it 
occurred only in the grazed area outside the exclosure [<a href="#73">73</a>]. Sulfur cinquefoil 
is, however, reported to rapidly invade bluebunch wheatgrass rangeland &quot;that is 
in good condition and properly grazed&quot; [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>]; and, while it is most common and 
spreads more rapidly on disturbed sites on the Dancing Prairie Preserve in 
northwestern Montana, it is also capable of invading relatively undisturbed 
sites [<a href="#52">52</a>].</p>

<p>
On another grassland site in western Montana, dominated by bluebunch 
wheatgrass and Idaho fescue on warm slopes and rough fescue on cool slopes, a 
study to monitor changes in species composition under the influence of 
cattle grazing was initiated in 1985. Canopy cover of sulfur cinquefoil 
increased on 2 of 3 warm slope plots and on 2 of 3 cool slope plots between 1985 
and 1996. Canopy cover of sulfur cinquefoil is negatively associated with canopy 
cover of rough fescue and total grass. This relationship reflects the fact that 
sulfur cinquefoil is generally more common on more xeric sites where grass cover 
is less abundant. Abundance of sulfur cinquefoil also appeared to be associated 
with pocket gopher burrowing on 2 transects. The author suggests that, because 
little of the variation in sulfur cinquefoil abundance at the microplot level 
was explained by grass cover, other unmeasured factors, such as proximity and 
productivity of seed sources, may have more effect on sulfur cinquefoil cover 
than competition with grass. It is also not possible to determine whether the 
decline in grass cover is caused by grazing or by an increase in sulfur 
cinquefoil at this site [<a href="#50">50</a>].

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SUCCESSIONAL STATUS">
SUCCESSIONAL STATUS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Sulfur cinquefoil is an early successional species in North America, as indicated by its common 
occurrence in disturbed habitats (see <a href="#SITE CHARACTERISTICS">Site Characteristics</a>).
Sulfur cinquefoil is often found in association with early seral stages in the Interior 
Douglas-fir biogeoclimatic zone in British Columbia [<a href="#60">60</a>].
In abandoned fields in Michigan, sulfur cinquefoil is found from the earliest stages of 
succession until extensive woody cover is present [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>].
Sulfur cinquefoil was present on old fields in Michigan abandoned from 
cultivation 5 and 15 years previously but was not a major species on a field 
abandoned for only 1 year [<a href="#29">29</a>]. According to Beckwith [<a href="#9">9</a>], sulfur cinquefoil is common 
in the mixed herbaceous perennial stage of old-field succession which usually 
predominates 11 to 15 years after abandonment from grain crops and 16 to 20 
years after abandonment from cultivated fields and hay fields in Michigan. 

<p>
According to Rice [<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>] land managers have reported sulfur 
cinquefoil increases while spotted knapweed declines on numerous sites in 
Montana. Preferential grazing by cattle of up to 30% of spotted knapweed has 
also been observed, with only trace utilization of sulfur cinquefoil. This may 
explain, in part, why succession to sulfur cinquefoil is sometimes observed, 
although the possibility of species selection through herbicide use cannot be 
excluded (see <a href="management_considerations.html#Chemical:">
Chemical control</a> section), since management history of 
these sites is not described. It is also suggested that sulfur cinquefoil competes 
successfully with yellow starthistle (<i>Centaurea solstitialis</i>) and leafy 
spurge on several sites [<a href="#70">70</a>]. However, there is no reference indicating the 
co-occurrence of sulfur cinquefoil and yellow starthistle, and only 1 example of 
the co-occurrence of sulfur cinquefoil with leafy spurge on 1 site in Montana 
[<a href="#69">69</a>]. There is no experimental evidence regarding the relative competitiveness 
of these species in the literature.</p>



<p>
Light regime: Sulfur cinquefoil appears to be intolerant of complete shade. 
Sulfur cinquefoil is never associated with a 100% 
canopy cover of other vegetation, and is normally found in areas with less than 
90% vegetative cover in southeastern Europe and southwestern Asia (Schaffner and 
Tosevski 1994, as cited by Powell [<a href="#60">60</a>]). In Michigan, sulfur cinquefoil is found 
along wood margins, but not under forest canopy [<a href="#91">91</a>]. Sulfur cinquefoil occurred 
in 3 old fields in Michigan which received 51 to 84% of full sunlight. The 
lowest light level (51%) was in a shrubby habitat dominated by staghorn sumac 
[<a href="#79">79</a>]. Shading from a dense overstory prevents 
establishment of sulfur cinquefoil in mature forests in western Montana, but sulfur cinquefoil can 
successfully occupy areas below natural gaps in the forest canopy [<a href="#70">70</a>].

Sulfur cinquefoil plants germinating in the spring establish woody taproots in their 
1st growing season [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>]. In Montana, sulfur cinquefoil is one of the 1st plants to 
emerge in spring. It begins flowering in May and will continue to flower throughout the 
summer if conditions are favorable [<a href="#66">66</a>]. It is one of the fastest plants 
to green up in fall in response to late summer/early fall rains, and continues to 
grow until freezing temperatures are sustained [<a href="#69">69</a>]. The following table

In Michigan in 1975, sulfur cinquefoil began flowering about 1 June, with the 
majority of the buds in anthesis about 21 June. On any individual plant, flowers 
were produced for many weeks, the earliest forming mature seed heads at the same 
time the later buds are coming into flower. Flowering continued until about 7 
August, at which time 59.8% of the flower heads had produced mature seeds [<a href="#91">91</a>].

FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font> 
There is little information available regarding sulfur cinquefoil's 
adaptations to fire. The survival of plant parts after fire depends on 
depth of burial and fire severity. Perennating buds in the caudex of sulfur 
cinquefoil can survive fire if they are not exposed to lethal temperatures. 
The available literature does not specify the location of sulfur cinquefoil's 
perennating buds in relation to the soil surface. 

<p>
Sulfur cinquefoil is likely to resprout from the caudex following  fire, and/or plants 
may respond by developing heavier rootstocks, as was observed with plants whose 
topgrowth was removed by mowing in Michigan [<a href="#91">91</a>]. Heat tolerance of sulfur 
cinquefoil's perennating tissues is unknown.</p>

<p>
Heat tolerance of sulfur cinquefoil seeds is also unknown; buried seeds 
may survive fires of low severity. Postfire conditions including decreased 
aboveground competition, increased light at the soil surface, and enhanced 
nutrient availability are favorable for sulfur cinquefoil establishment from 
seed. Plants may re-establish either from on-site seed or from seed 
dispersed into a burned area following fire.</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font> 
Sulfur cinquefoil occurs in ecosystems with historic fire regimes of varied frequency and 
severity, from frequent, low-severity fires in ponderosa pine ecosystems, to 
less frequent and more severe fires in bunchgrass ecosystems, to 
frequent and severe fires in plains and prairie grassland ecosystems. Many of 
these historic fire regimes have been dramatically altered. Sulfur cinquefoil was 
not widespread in these communities when historic fire regimes 
were functioning, but has established since habitat alteration and fire exclusion began. 
It is unclear how historic fire regimes might affect sulfur cinquefoil populations in 
many situations, and it is unclear how the presence of sulfur cinquefoil in native 
ecosystems might affect fire regimes.</p>

<p>
On fescue-wheatgrass-needlegrass (<i>Festuca</i> spp.-<i>Agropyron</i> 
spp.-<i>Hesperostipa</i> spp.) habitats of the Tobacco Plains in 
northwestern Montana, fires caused by lightning and ignited by Native 
Americans played an important role in structuring vegetation [<a href="#42">42</a>]. Most presettlement 
fires occurred during the summer and early fall [<a href="#31">31</a>]. In this area, on The Nature 
Conservancy's Dancing Prairie Preserve, sulfur cinquefoil has become a major 
component in portions of the grassland. Experiments with prescribed fire 
indicate that sulfur cinquefoil had a more positive response to fall burning 
than to spring burning. In this case, fall fires may favor sulfur cinquefoil and damage 
desirable native species. This may be especially true after a long period of fire exclusion 
leading to a build-up of fuels and increased fire severity [<a href="#53">53</a>]. In other ecosystems, 
such as the C<sub>4</sub>-dominated grasslands of North America, early- and late-spring burns 
can result in high mortality of early-germinating, nonnative species, with little 
damage to native flora [<a href="#78">78</a>].</p>

<p>
There is no evidence in the literature that sulfur cinquefoil alters historic 
fire regimes in ecosystems it invades. In general, in ecosystems where sulfur 
cinquefoil replaces plants similar to itself (in terms of fuel characteristics), 
it may alter fire intensity or slightly modify an existing fire regime. However, 
if sulfur cinquefoil is qualitatively unique to the invaded ecosystem, it may have 
the potential to alter the fire regime [<a href="#16">16</a>].</p>

The following table provides fire return intervals for important plant 
communities and ecosystems in which sulfur cinquefoil may occur. If you are interested in 
the fire regime of a plant community that is not listed here, please consult the complete

IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT:</a>
</span>
<br />

There is little published information available regarding  effects of fire on 
sulfur cinquefoil. The survival of plant parts after fire depends on their depth 
of burial and fire severity. Sulfur cinquefoil is top-killed by 
fire, and perennating buds in the caudex can survive fire if they are not 
exposed to lethal temperatures. The available literature does not specify the 
location of sulfur cinquefoil's perennating buds in relation to the soil 
surface. 

<p>
At Dancing Prairie Preserve in northwestern Montana, neither 
fall nor spring burning resulted in mortality of large (<u>&gt;</u>5 leaves and 
a woody caudex) sulfur cinquefoil plants. Fire had a significant (p&lt;0.05) 
negative effect on density of small (1-4 leaves without a well-developed caudex) 
sulfur cinquefoil plants immediately after burning; however this effect was 
detectable for only 1 year following burning [<a href="#53">53</a>].</p>

<p>
Heat tolerance of sulfur cinquefoil seeds is unknown. Results from Dancing 
Prairie Preserve indicate recruitment of sulfur cinquefoil occurred in burn 
plots the 1st year following both spring and fall burning. More recruitment was 
observed in fall burn plots, which had higher fire severity [<a href="#53">53</a>]. If no sulfur 
cinquefoil seed was dispersed into the burned area from offsite sources, it may be 
assumed that sulfur cinquefoil seeds can survive this type of grassland fire.
<br><br>

<span class="subframeName">
<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT">
DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Density of small sulfur cinquefoil plants declined in both burn and control 
plots the 1st year following burn treatments on Dancing Prairie Preserve, and 
was probably caused by 51% below average precipitation the previous summer. Mean 
density of small sulfur cinquefoil plants declined by 47% in control plots, by 
42% in spring burn plots, and by 12% in fall burn plots. Smaller declines in 
density of small sulfur cinquefoil plants in burn versus control plots may 
indicate that fire has a positive effect on germination and recruitment of 
sulfur cinquefoil, especially following fall burns [<a href="#53">53</a>].

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE">
PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:</a>
</span>
<br />

There is little information available regarding sulfur cinquefoil's response to fire. 
Sulfur cinquefoil's response to fire probably depends on fire severity, plant phenological 
stage at the time of burning, depth of burial of perennating tissues and seeds, 
and the composition of the prefire plant community. Postfire conditions including decreased 
aboveground competition, increased light at the soil surface, and enhanced nutrient availability 
favor growth of surviving sulfur cinquefoil plants and establishment of sulfur cinquefoil from 
seed. Plants may re-establish either from on-site seed or from seed dispersed into a burned area 
following fire. Sulfur cinquefoil resprouts from the caudex and develops heavier rootstocks 
when topgrowth is removed by mowing [<a href="#91">91</a>]. Sulfur cinquefoil plants may react in 
a similar way when topgrowth is removed by fire as long as perennating tissues 
survive.

<p>
At Dancing Prairie Preserve, density of small sulfur cinquefoil plants declined 
less in burn plots compared to control plots during the year following burn 
treatments, indicating that fire enhanced survival of new recruits. During the 
2nd year following burn treatments, the number of small plants continued to 
decline, while the number of large plants increased, probably indicating growth 
into the larger size classes rather than attrition. There was a tendency for the 
number of large plants to increase in burn plots, although the difference was not 
statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) [<a href="#53">53</a>].</p>

<p>
Results from Dancing Prairie [<a href="#53">53</a>] also suggest that prescribed fire can 
enhance germination of sulfur cinquefoil. However, survival of seedlings depends 
on sufficient moisture. In semiarid grasslands, moisture is often lacking, and 
may not, therefore, result in population growth of sulfur cinquefoil. 
Burning will lead to an increase in mature plants only if the climate in 
subsequent years is conducive to survival [<a href="#53">53</a>].

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE">
DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Fire can, but will not always, cause an increase in population growth of 
nonnative invasive plants in semiarid regions. &quot;The vagaries of climate will 
likely play a major role in determining whether prescribed fire will do more harm 
than good&quot; [<a href="#53">53</a>]. Season of burning and timing of burning within the season also 
appear to affect  response of sulfur cinquefoil to fire in the 
fescue-wheatgrass-needlegrass grasslands at Dancing Prairie Preserve in 
northwestern Montana [<a href="#53">53</a>]. 

<p>
Response of sulfur cinquefoil to fire differed between spring and fall 
burns at Dancing Prairie Preserve. Density of small plants increased more in 
fall-burn plots the 1st year after burning. However, density of small plants was 
greater in spring-burn plots by the final year of the study (5 years after fire). 
Observations of postfire residual litter indicate that fire severity was greater 
for fall burns, possibly resulting in 'better' physical conditions for seedling establishment (less 
litter, more light, less competition). Plant response to season of fire may depend on 
germination requirements. Sulfur cinquefoil seeds germinate without stratification, suggesting 
that many seeds may germinate in fall if conditions are suitable. In this study, sulfur cinquefoil had a more 
positive response to fall burning than to spring burning [<a href="#53">53</a>]. </p>


<p>
Timing of fire within the season is also important to plant response. 
&quot;Relatively cool&quot; fire prior to germination may stimulate seeds to germinate (by 
breaking physical dormancy or providing important nutrients) while fire after 
germination could cause high mortality of seedlings [<a href="#53">53</a>]. A large proportion of 
sulfur cinquefoil seeds will germinate in fall without cold treatment [<a href="#52">52</a>], so a fall burn could 
cause high mortality of young seedlings. At Dancing Prairie, it appears that a large number 
of sulfur cinquefoil seeds had not germinated by mid-October in 1996 when the 
fall burn was conducted. Further research on the relationship between 
germination requirements and timing of burns could lead to fire prescriptions 
that minimize the increase of invasive plants [<a href="#53">53</a>]. </p>


<p>
Effects of season of burning on sulfur cinquefoil may also depend on composition 
of the plant community. In C<sub>3</sub>-dominated grasslands such as those at 
Dancing Prairie, dormant season and late fall burns are more likely to harm 
nonnative, invasive plant populations without damaging native species, while 
late-spring and early-fall burns are more detrimental to native species. However, 
early and late spring burns in C<sub>4</sub> dominated grasslands, such as those of 
central North America, result in high mortality of early-germinating C<sub>3</sub> 
nonnative plants with little damage to the native flora [<a href="#78">78</a>] and may therefore be 
preferable to growing- or late-season burns [<a href="#53">53</a>].

<a name="FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

<b>Fire as a control agent:</b> 
Burning may not be recommended for control of sulfur cinquefoil, because 
perennial roots are likely to survive and resprout following fire. 

<p>
Prescribed fire may be used as a management tool on some sites to control woody 
plants, restore historic fire regimes, and promote desirable species [<a href="#53">53</a>]. The disturbance 
created by fire can, however, favor invasive perennial forbs (e.g. [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>]). 
Season of burning and other management activities (e.g. herbicide treatments, 
livestock and wildlife use) are important factors to consider when prescribing fire for natural 
area restoration where nonnative invasive plants are present [<a href="#53">53</a>]. </p>

<p>
Understanding the regeneration niche of  invasive and desirable plants and selecting the 
best season for burning can help reduce the chance of problems. Practices that 
reduce the target plant's seed bank can reduce the chance of increased 
recruitment following fire. In some cases prescribed fire should be delayed 
until nonnative invasive plants have been controlled [<a href="#53">53</a>]. </p>


<p>
On The Nature Conservancy's Dancing Prairie Preserve in northwestern Montana, 
dormant-season fire can inhibit ponderosa pine invasion, reduce litter, 
invigorate native bunchgrasses, and enhance recruitment of native forbs 
including the federally-listed, threatened Spalding's silene (<i>Silene 
spaldingii</i>) [<a href="#51">51</a>]. Spalding's silene has a more positive response to spring 
burns compared to fall burns, while sulfur cinquefoil had a more positive response to 
fall burns. Additionally, more severe fall burns can be detrimental to rough fescue, the 
dominant native grass at the preserve, especially if there have been many years 
of fire exclusion leading to build-up of fuels and more severe fire effects. Prescribed burning 
conducted in the spring would be more beneficial than fall burning at this site 
[<a href="#53">53</a>].</p>


<p>
When  herbicide (e.g. picloram) is applied prior to prescribed burning, 
its residual activity may be reduced as a result of soil heating during and 
following fire. Sulfur cinquefoil seeds began germinating 1 to 3 years earlier 
in herbicide/burn plots compared to plots with only herbicide. There may be 
little benefit from residual activity of such herbicides where annual or 
biennial burning is practiced, as on many tallgrass prairies [<a href="#53">53</a>]. 
Alternatively, efficacy of herbicide on mature target plants may be enhanced by 
burning prior to herbicide application. Further research is needed on 
effects of combining herbicide treatments and prescribed fire. </p>

<p>
<b>Postfire colonization potential:</b> 
Sulfur cinquefoil may establish after fire either by seed imported to the site or by 
soil-stored seed. More information is needed regarding sulfur cinquefoil seedling 
establishment and growth with and without fire.</p>

<p>
<b>Preventing postfire establishment and spread:</b>
The USDA Forest Service's &quot;Guide to Noxious Weed Prevention Practices&quot; [<a href="#85">85</a>] provides 
several fire management considerations for weed prevention in 
general that apply to sulfur cinquefoil.</p>

<p>Preventing invasive plants from establishing in weed-free burned areas is 
the most effective and least costly management method. This can be 
accomplished through early detection and eradication by careful monitoring, 
and by limiting invasive plant seed dispersal into burned areas by 
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>]:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p class="subframeText"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">
  re-establishing vegetation on bare ground as soon as possible</font></li>
  <li><p class="subframeText"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">

  <li><p class="subframeText"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">

  <li><p class="subframeText"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">
  regulating or preventing human and livestock entry into 
  burned areas until desirable site vegetation has recovered sufficiently to 
  resist invasion by undesirable vegetation</font></li>
  <li><p class="subframeText"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">
  detecting weeds early and eradicating before vegetative spread and/or seed 
  dispersal</font></li>
  <li><p class="subframeText"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">
  eradicating small patches and containing or controlling large infestations 
  within or adjacent to the burned area</font></li>
</ul>

<p>
In general, early detection is critical for preventing establishment of large 
populations of invasive plants. Monitoring in spring, summer, and 
fall is imperative. Managers should eradicate established sulfur cinquefoil plants and small patches 
adjacent to burned areas to prevent or limit seed dispersal into the site [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].</p>

<p>
The need for revegetation after fire can be based on the degree of desirable vegetation 
displaced by invasive plants prior to burning and on postfire survival of 
desirable vegetation. Revegetation necessity can also be related to invasive 
plant survival as viable seeds, root crowns, or rhizomes capable of 
reproduction. In general, postfire revegetation should be considered when 
desirable vegetation cover is less than about 30% [<a href="#26">26</a>]. </p>

<p>
When prefire cover of sulfur cinquefoil is absent to low, and prefire cover of desirable 
vegetation is high, revegetation is probably not necessary after low- and medium-severity burns. 
After a high-severity burn on a site in this condition, revegetation may be necessary 
(depending on postfire survival of desirable species), and intensive monitoring for invasive 
plant establishment is necessary to detect and eradicate newly established invasives before they spread [<a href="#26">26</a>]. </p>

<p>
When prefire cover of sulfur cinquefoil is moderate (20-79%) to high (80-100%), 
revegetation may be necessary after fire of any severity if cover of desired vegetation 
is less than about 30%. Intensive weed management is also recommended, especially after fires of 
moderate to high severity [<a href="#26">26</a>].</p>

<p>
Fall dormant broadcast seeding into  ash will cover and retain seeds. If there is 
insufficient ash, seedbed preparation may be necessary. A seed mix should contain 
quick-establishing grasses and forbs (exclude forbs if broadleaf herbicides are anticipated) 
that can effectively occupy available niches. Managers can enhance the 
success of revegetation (natural or artificial) by excluding livestock until 
vegetation is well established (at least 2 growing seasons) [<a href="#26">26</a>].</p>

<p>
When planning a prescribed burn, managers should preinventory the project area 
and evaluate cover and phenology of any sulfur cinquefoil and other invasive 
plants present on or adjacent to the site, and avoid ignition and burning in areas at 
high risk for sulfur cinquefoil establishment or spread due to fire effects. Managers 
should also avoid creating soil conditions that promote weed germination and establishment. 
Weed status and risks must be discussed in burn rehabilitation plans. Also, wildfire 
managers might consider including weed prevention education and providing weed identification aids 
during fire training; avoiding known weed infestations when locating fire lines; 
monitoring camps, staging areas, helibases, etc., to be sure they are kept weed 
free; taking care that equipment is weed free; incorporating weed prevention 
into fire rehabilitation plans; and acquiring restoration funding. Additional 
guidelines and specific recommendations and requirements are available [<a href="#85">85</a>].

<br />

There is little information on use of sulfur cinquefoil by grazing animals, 
although it is thought to be avoided by most grazing animals [<a href="#70">70</a>]. Utilization of 
sulfur cinquefoil by cattle was less than 1% on 98% of 85 sites studied in 
Montana; and 1-5% on the remaining 2% of these sites. This trace grazing usually 
consisted of removal of buds and flower tops from a small number of plants. Intensive 
grazing systems can increase utilization to above 5%, but sulfur cinquefoil appears to 
be one of the last plants selected [<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].

<p>
Other studies indicate that cinquefoil species generally make up a very small 
percentage of the diets of grazing animals. In the lower Rocky Mountain Trench 
of British Columbia, cattle, elk and mule deer diets averaged 0.4, 0.2, and 
0.3%, respectively, cinquefoil species (of which sulfur cinquefoil was a 
constituent) [<a href="#91">91</a>]. Campbell and Johnson [<a href="#14">14</a>] 
found that cinquefoil species comprised 2.5, 0.3, 1.3, and 0.2% of winter, 
spring, summer, and fall diets, respectively, of mule deer in Washington. Winter 
elk diets in New Mexico contained 1.1% cinquefoil species [<a href="#75">75</a>].</p>

<p>
Feeding by small mammals or birds on sulfur cinquefoil plants or seeds is unknown [<a href="#60">60</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Palatability/nutritional value:</b></font> 
According to reviews by Powell [<a href="#60">60</a>] and Werner and Soule [<a href="#91">91</a>], sulfur cinquefoil has a 
tannin content of 17-22% dry weight that likely 
lowers its palatability relative to many other forage and browse species. Even 
when forage and browse choice is limited, cattle have been reported to graze the 
bitter-flavored spotted knapweed preferentially over sulfur cinquefoil [<a href="#66">66</a>]. 
There are no reports of sulfur cinquefoil toxicity to animals that consume it. </p>

<br />

A review by Powell [<a href="#60">60</a>] indicates that sulfur cinquefoil may have been used as a 
folk medicine in eastern Europe. The possible medicinal value, however, has not 
been thoroughly studied [<a href="#60">60</a>].

<p>Because of its perennial nature and showy flowers, sulfur cinquefoil is also 
used in horticulture [<a href="#60">60</a>].

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="IMPACTS AND CONTROL">
IMPACTS AND CONTROL:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Impacts:</b></font> Explicit in the definition 
of sulfur cinquefoil as a problem species is the assumption that it displaces 
other plant species and the myriad organisms that depend on these plant 
communities, as well as the negative economic consequences for industries based 
on these natural resources. Sulfur cinquefoil may have harmful impacts on native 
flora and fauna, however more research is needed to clarify the extent of these 
impacts [<a href="#60">60</a>]. Untested hypotheses and unsubstantiated claims can be perpetuated 
in the literature until they become widely accepted, without the benefit of 
experimental analysis or peer review. A well-documented example of this occurred 
with purple loosestrife [<a href="#32">32</a>] (see &quot;Management considerations&quot; for 
<a href="../lytsal/index.html">purple loosestrife</a> in FEIS).

<p>
The following information on impacts of sulfur cinquefoil, its ability to 
outcompete native and other nonnative plants, and its rapid rate of expansion 
are commonly found in agricultural extension and gray literature though they are largely 
untested. To better define its potential impacts, research is needed on the 
competitiveness of sulfur cinquefoil relative to other plant species, its rate 
of expansion, its persistence at various seral stages in different ecosystems, 
its ecological amplitude, and its influence on the dynamics of various 
ecosystems [<a href="#60">60</a>].</p>

<p>
There are no specific data on the relative competitiveness of 
sulfur cinquefoil. Its perennial nature and large root reserves likely give it a 
competitive advantage in open-canopied situations, but the relative advantage of 
these attributes remain unquantified [<a href="#60">60</a>]. According to Rice and others [<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>] 
sulfur cinquefoil displaces native plant species in undisturbed habitats, reduces grass 
production, and may alter the functioning of ecosystems by lowering 
biodiversity, although this is not documented quantitatively. </p>

<p>
Based on canopy cover estimates of sulfur cinquefoil at 85 sites in western
Montana, Rice [<a href="#70">70</a>] concludes that &quot;sulfur cinquefoil often becomes a significant 
component of the plant community, and has proceeded to dominance on many sites&quot; 
[<a href="#69">69</a>]. At 75% of the 85 sampled sites, sulfur cinquefoil 
canopy cover exceeded 5% of the plant cover; on 50% of the sites, sulfur 
cinquefoil canopy cover exceeded 15%; on 14% of the sites, sulfur cinquefoil 
canopy cover was 50% or more; and on 1 site, sulfur cinquefoil canopy cover was 
75%. On most sites sulfur cinquefoil canopy cover ranged from 5 to 15% [<a href="#69">69</a>].
While Rice [<a href="#69">69</a>] suggests that canopy cover is a useful measure of the severity of 
a weed infestation and the competitive ability a particular plant, Lesica [<a href="#50">50</a>] indicates 
that canopy cover estimates are subjective and can be dependent on yearly climatic
fluctuations, and not, therefore, very useful for monitoring trends in plant
communities.</p>

<p>
Rice also suggests that sulfur cinquefoil competes well with other nonnative,
invasive species such as yellow starthistle, leafy spurge, and spotted knapweed,
although no quantitative evidence is given [<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>]. Land managers in Montana
indicate that sulfur cinquefoil displaces spotted knapweed on several sites
[<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>]. The management history of these sites is unknown, and may 
influence the relationship between sulfur cinquefoil and spotted knapweed. For 
example, if clopyralid is used to control spotted knapweed, sulfur cinquefoil 
would be favored since sulfur cinquefoil is not sensitive to clopyralid [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].
Similarly, sulfur cinquefoil may be displacing diffuse knapweed on 
sites in British Columbia where knapweed vigor is reduced by introduced 
biological control agents [<a href="#60">60</a>]. </p>

<p>
In 1981, Forcella and Harvey [<a href="#22">22</a>] plotted the number of counties 
reporting the presence of each of 100 nonnative plant species 
in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming over time and described 3 
patterns of infestation. They described infestation by sulfur cinquefoil as following 
an &quot;exponential pattern.&quot; The distribution of 
sulfur cinquefoil was rapidly increasing as of 1980, and they predicted that it 
would become a problem in western Montana, eastern Washington and central Idaho 
&quot;at some later date&quot; [<a href="#22">22</a>]. According to Rice [<a href="#70">70</a>] 
&quot;sulfur cinquefoil is  rapidly increasing its geographic 
distribution. The number of new colonies is increasing exponentially. Many of 
these infestations are reaching environmentally severe sizes and densities.&quot; 
These assessments, however, remain neither confirmed nor denied by experimental 
data [<a href="#60">60</a>].</p>

<p>
While it has been suggested that sulfur cinquefoil infestations can expand
rapidly, and large infestations are not uncommon, the majority of colonies of
sulfur cinquefoil observed in western Montana were small, with half of them less
than 10 acres (4ha) [<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>]. </p>

<p>
The influence and interaction of sulfur cinquefoil with chemical and biological soil 
processes are also largely unknown. As a pioneer species on disturbed soil, it may 
help to bind soil and prevent erosion [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>]. The breakdown of annual growth and 
root exudates likely releases tannins into the soil, but their influence on soil ecology and water 
quality have not been examined. Sulfur cinquefoil is not known to be allelopathic, and its 
interactions with  soil biota also remain unquantified [<a href="#60">60</a>]. </p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Control:</b></font> 
Correct identification is an important first step in controlling sulfur cinquefoil, 
as it may be easily mistaken for native cinquefoils (see 
<a href="botanical_and_ecological_characteristics.html#GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS">
General Botanical Characteristics</a>). </p>

<p>
Prevention of sulfur cinquefoil establishment by maintaining native plant communities in an 
undisturbed condition is the most effective control strategy. Monitoring, early detection and 
eradication of newly established plants before seeds are produced and populations expand is more 
efficient and effective than laboring to control established infestations. Individual 
plants and small patches of sulfur cinquefoil can be eliminated by hand-pulling or digging, 
or by spot spraying of herbicides. The root crown (upper portion of the root system) must be 
removed or killed so that plants cannot resprout.</p>

<p>
Because sulfur cinquefoil seeds may remain viable in the soil for 3 years or 
more [<a href="#66">66</a>], treated sites must be monitored annually for newly established sulfur 
cinquefoil plants [<a href="#70">70</a>].</p>

<p>
Because sulfur cinquefoil occurs and is competitive with several other invasive 
species [<a href="#69">69</a>], management to control it and/or other species must consider 
the possibility of succession to other undesirable species when plants are 
removed.</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><font size="4">Prevention:</font></font>
Preventing sulfur cinquefoil infestations is the most time- and cost-effective management 
approach. This is accomplished by maintaining desirable plant communities (by limiting livestock 
grazing, minimizing soil disturbance, and seeding disturbed sites with desirable 
species), preventing sulfur cinquefoil seeds from entering uninfested areas, and careful monitoring 
for and early eradication of newly established sulfur cinquefoil plants. This is especially 
important where sulfur cinquefoil is common in areas around the management site, especially 
along roads, trails, and rivers.</p>

<p>
Prevent sulfur cinquefoil seeds from entering uninfested areas as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p class="subframeText"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">
  Check and clean equipment before moving it into infested areas or before bringing 
  it from infested areas.</font></li> 
  <li>
  <p class="subframeText"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">
  When moving livestock from infested to uninfested areas, hold them in corrals or 
  small pastures until viable seeds have had time to pass through the digestive tract 
  (6 days for cattle, 11 days for sheep).</font></li>
  <li>
  <p class="subframeText"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">
  Monitor for sulfur cinquefoil seedling establishment in livestock holding areas
  and areas where dirt has been imported [<a href="#48">48</a>].</font></li>
  <li>
  <p class="subframeText"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">
  Avoid purchasing feed or seed that could be contaminated with weed seeds. Viable sulfur
  cinquefoil seeds may even be present in feed pellets.</font></li>
  <li>
  <p class="subframeText"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">
  Treat road construction projects as 10- to 20-year 
  biological projects rather than 1- to 2-year engineering projects, with 
  biologists and resource managers overseeing road construction and restoration. 
  Projects should not be considered complete until native vegetation is fully 
  established. Topsoil removed during construction can be redeposited in 
  roadside ditches, and roadsides reseeded with native species. Roadsides should 
  then be regularly monitored and actively managed for control and eradication 
  of nonnative species [<a href="#84">84</a>].</font></li>
</ul>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4">Integrated management:</font> 
While there is no specific information on integrated management of sulfur cinquefoil, 
a combination of control methods is often necessary to eradicate or successfully contain 
infestations of nonnative invasive plants. Managers are encouraged to integrate different 
control methods that can complement one another in a given situation. Integrated management 
includes considerations of not only killing the target plant, but also of 
establishing desirable species and discouraging nonnative, invasive species over 
the long-term.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
<font size="4">Physical/mechanical:</font> </font>
Hand-digging or hand-pulling sulfur cinquefoil plants can be effective in small 
infestations, but may be impractical for large infestations, since the entire root 
crown must be removed in order to kill the plant [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>]. Annual monitoring must be 
conducted to locate new plants that may establish from the soil seed bank or from 
seed dispersed from off-site sources.</p>

<p>
Mowing is not effective for controlling sulfur cinquefoil. It responds by developing 
 
heavier, horizontally spreading roots 
and increasing vegetation near ground level [<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>]. In Michigan, the mean dry 
weight of roots was much greater in plants growing in a mown strip (4.2 g per 
plant) than from plants in the adjacent undisturbed field (2.0 g per plant) [<a href="#91">91</a>].</p>

<p>Sulfur cinquefoil can be controlled by plowing and planting to a 
clean-cultivated crop [<a href="#91">91</a>]. In a sulfur cinquefoil-infested field in Michigan 
plowed in May, seedlings of sulfur cinquefoil were numerous by mid-June, as well 
as plants&nbsp;emerging from old rootstock [<a href="#91">91</a>]. Discing and reseeding to grass 
at a site in British Columbia resulted in complete 
control of sulfur cinquefoil. This, of course, cannot be applied over grassland 
and forest ecosystems that are managed in their natural state [<a href="#60">60</a>].  </p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4">Biological:</font>  
Biological control of invasive species has a long history,
and there are many important considerations to be made before the implementation
of a biological control program. The reader is referred to other sources (e.g. [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>]) and the <a href="https://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/handbook.html">Weed
Control Methods Handbook</a> [<a href="#83">83</a>]
for background information on biological control. Additionally,
<a href="https://www.nysaes.cornell.edu/ent/biocontrol/">Cornell University</a>,
<a href="https://bc4weeds.tamu.edu/index.html">Texas A &amp; M University</a>, and
<a href="https://ceris.purdue.edu/napis/index.html">NAPIS</a> websites offer 
information on biological control. </p>

<p>
There are currently no biological control agents available 
for sulfur cinquefoil, although a number of insects and fungi are associated 
with sulfur cinquefoil. A field survey in Eurasia identified 26 phytophagous insect 
species associated with sulfur cinquefoil in its native range [<a href="#76">76</a>]. A survey in the 
northeastern U.S. identified 47 species of phytophagous 
insects and pollinators on sulfur cinquefoil; among them are the strawberry root 
weevil and the strawberry aphid [<a href="#8">8</a>]. A rust fungus was found on sulfur cinquefoil 
at 79% of sampled sites in Montana. Root and crown boring insects were also collected from 
sulfur cinquefoil plants on numerous sites, and 6 species  were isolated from these 
collections. Three of the identified species are known to be pests on 
strawberry (<i>Fragaria </i>spp.) [<a href="#69">69</a>]. The rust fungus is also known to occur on several of the 
sulfur cinquefoil populations in British Columbia. Three plant diseases have also been 
associated with sulfur cinquefoil populations in British Columbia [<a href="#60">60</a>].</p>

<p>
A biological control program using insects against sulfur cinquefoil would be 
difficult due to the close genetic relationship between strawberries and cinquefoils, 
and probable attractiveness of strawberry to phytophagous insects that attack 
<i>Potentilla</i> [<a href="#8">8</a>]. Based on this close relationship, Batra [<a href="#8">8</a>] concludes 
that initiation of a biological control program for sulfur cinquefoil is not highly 
recommended. Additionally, a potential biocontrol agent must also be benign to (or incapable 
of occupying the habitats of) about 70 species of <i>Potentilla</i> with more 
than 80 subspecies and varieties that are found in North America [<a href="#60">60</a>]. 
Given the close relationship between sulfur cinquefoil and other <i>Potentilla</i> 
and <i>Fragaria</i> species, and the large number of native and introduced 
plants that must be screened, the search for a suitable biological control could 
be the longest and most costly in the history of North America [<a href="#60">60</a>].</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, by 1996, 2 potential biological control agents were targeted for screening, 
a root moth (<i>Tinthia myrmosaeformis</i>) and a seed head weevil (<i>Anthonomus rubripes</i>) 
[<a href="#67">67</a>]. Field releases of any such insects would occur a decade or more in the future [<a href="#70">70</a>].</p>

<p>
Sulfur cinquefoil is unpalatable to most livestock. Goats are the only 
animals that have been reported to select for sulfur cinquefoil [<a href="#70">70</a>]. 
Intensive grazing systems can increase sulfur cinquefoil utilization to about 
5%, but sulfur cinquefoil appears to be one of the last plants selected [<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><a name="Chemical:">Chemical:</a></font>  
Herbicides are effective in gaining initial control of a new
invasion (of small size) or a severe infestation, but are rarely a complete
or long-term solution to invasive species management [<a href="#12">12</a>]. Herbicides are more effective on large infestations when incorporated 
into long-term management plans that include replacement of weeds with desirable species, 
careful land use management, and prevention of new infestations.
Control with herbicides is temporary, as it does not change conditions that
allow infestations to occur (e.g. [<a href="#95">95</a>]).
See the <a href="https://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/handbook.html">Weed Control Methods
Handbook</a> [<a href="#83">83</a>] for considerations on the use of herbicides in natural areas and
detailed information on specific chemicals. </p>

<p>
Dicamba and clopyralid do not effectively control 
sulfur cinquefoil [<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>]. Picloram (applied in fall or spring), 2,4-D ester (applied in 
spring at rosette through bud stage), or a mix of dicamba and 2,4-D amine (applied at the 
rosette stage), are each effective at controlling sulfur cinquefoil. 2,4-D ester is suggested 
where potential water contamination is a consideration. On dryland sites, picloram may be 
preferred because its residual activity can suppress re-establishment from seeds in the soil 
seed bank [<a href="#70">70</a>], but it is still necessary to conduct appraisal surveys of treated sites in 
subsequent years, and plan systematic retreatments if eradication is 
the management goal [<a href="#69">69</a>].</p>

<p>
Because sulfur cinquefoil is not sensitive to clopyralid [<a href="#46">46</a>], application of clopyralid 
to mixed stands of sulfur cinquefoil and spotted knapweed will depress the 
spotted knapweed without harming sulfur cinquefoil, thereby giving sulfur 
cinquefoil the competitive advantage [<a href="#70">70</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><font size="4">Cultural:</font> </font>
Because sulfur cinquefoil is intolerant of complete shade, land management practices that 
allow other vegetation to increase in cover, and therefore contribute to a concomitant 
decline in sulfur cinquefoil, should be promoted. Grazing should be managed with appropriate 
timing, intensity, frequency, and duration to leave adequate desirable vegetation. Soils disturbed 
by logging, construction, or other management activities should be revegetated as soon as 
possible with desirable species [<a href="#60">60</a>].
