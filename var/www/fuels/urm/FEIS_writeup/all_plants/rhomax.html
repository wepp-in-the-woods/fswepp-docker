<pre><center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rhododendron maximum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Rosebay wood is occasionally used to make small craft items and as fuel
for wood stoves [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Deer occasionally browse rosebay leaves and twigs, but it is not a major
part of their diet [<a href="#28">28</a>].  In a Greenwhich, Connecticut study, only 17
seventeen percent of rosebay shoots examined showed moderate leaf or
twig damage from browsing [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Although nutrient concentrations of rosebay leaves are generally lower
than those of deciduous trees, leaf longevity allows significant storage
of nutrients.  Fresh leaf litter has lower concentrations of nitrogen,
potassium, and phosphorus than do harvested leaves, indicating a
resorption of these nutrients before leaf fall.  The nutrient
concentration (% dry weight) of leaves changes with age [<a href="#17">17</a>]:

Leaf Age    Nitrogen    Phosphorus    Potassium    Calcium    Magnesium
1 mo         1.60        0.17          1.34         0.36       0.17
6 mo         1.05        0.16          0.87         1.00       0.29

3 yr         0.86        0.12          0.35         1.30       0.21

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Rosebay provides cover for the sharp-tailed grouse, white-tailed deer,
and a variety of other birds and mammals [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Rosebay is useful in providing watershed protection and erosion control
on steep slopes.


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Rosebay is cultivated for its beautiful flowers [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Rosebay presents timber management problems throughout the Appalachian
Mountains [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Rosebay regenerates vigorously through stump sprouting,
root suckers, or from layered stems after it is cut, burned, or
otherwise disturbed [<a href="#30">30</a>].  As it grows, it forms dense thickets that
cast so much shade over the forest floor that tree species cannot
reproduce, and eventually the site becomes unable to support commercial
timber production [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Rosebay is best controlled through chemical
treatment.  Basal spraying and mist blower applications of 2,4,5-T have
been reported to kill 100 percent of new sprouts [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rhododendron maximum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Rosebay is a spreading, thicket-forming, evergreen shrub or small tree,
3 to 15 feet (1-5 m) tall [<a href="#6">6</a>].  The flowers are large, round clusters;
the fruit is a capsule containing many seeds.  The bark is thin.
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].

Rosebay exhibits an interesting adaptation to climatic change.  During
periods of cold weather, the leaves roll lengthwise.  The lower the
temperature, the tighter the roll gets, until the leaves become slender
hollow cylinders [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Microphanerophyte
   Nanophanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Seed and Seedlings:  Rosebay does not produce large seed crops, and
seeds do not remain viable past the first growing season.  Seedlings are
limited to open sites where there is a moist seedbed and little shade
covering.  In closed thickets, rosebay reproduces vegetatively [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

Flowering:  The flowering potential of rosebay is extremely limited.
Flowering and fertilization reaches it greatest capacity when the shrub
is 2 years old.  Rosebay stops producing flowers after the fifth growing
season [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].

Vegetative:  Rosebay reproduces almost exclusively by stump sprouting,
root suckers, or layering [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Rosebay occurs mostly at elevations below 3,300 feet (1,000 m) but in
the southern Appalachians occasionally occurs at elevations over 5,900
feet (1,800 m).  Rosebay flourishes on well-drained acidic soils in cool
moist locations. It grows on shaded mountain sides, in ravines, and
along bottoms [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Some trees commonly associated with rosebay are
pitch pine (Pinus rigida), white pine (P. strobus), table mountain pine
(P. pungens), numerous oaks (Quercus spp.), and hickories (Carya spp.).
Some understory associates include mountain-laurel (Kalmia latifolia),
blueberry (Vaccinium vacillans), black huckleberry (Gaylussacia bacata),
wild grape (Vitis spp.), greenbrier (Smilax rotundifolia), fetterbush
(Pieris floribunda), and white-alder (Clethra acuminata) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Rosebay is very shade tolerant and survives even in the deep shade of
closed canopies [<a href="#30">30</a>]; however, new thicket formation is generally
restricted to openings created by logging, fire, or other types of
disturbance [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>].



<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Rosebay flowers open during a period of several weeks from May to July.
The fruit ripens in September through October; seed dispersal occurs
from October to November [<a href="#20">20</a>].

<pre><center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rhododendron maximum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Rosebay is well adapted to fire.  It typically survives by sprouting
from the root crown or stump [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex




</pre>

<pre><center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rhododendron maximum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire usually kills aboveground stems smaller than 1.5 inches (4 cm)
d.b.h.  Larger stems often survive fire [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Rosebay typically sprouts vigorously after the aboveground portions are
killed by fire.  A fall prescribed burn in North Carolina top-killed 70
percent of rosebay less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) d.b.h., but 17 months after
the burn, nearly all the top-killed rosebay had resprouted [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Rosebay is susceptible to annual burning.  Annual intense burning for
extended periods has eliminated rosebay populations on many sites in the
Appalachians [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].
