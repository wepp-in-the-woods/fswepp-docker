 The currently accepted scientific name for western larch is <i>Larix
occidentalis</i> Nutt. (Pinaceae) [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#154">154</a>]. </p>

<p> 
Natural hybridization of western larch and alpine larch (<i>Larix lyallii</i>) has
been documented in the Carlton Ridge Research Natural Area and in the
Cabinet Mountains and Bitterroot Range of Montana, where the species are
sympatric. Usually, however, western larch and alpine larch are isolated by
elevation [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>]. Carlson and Ballinger [<a href="#28">28</a>] reported that 1st generation western larch-alpine
larch crosses are viable. Carlson and others' [<a href="#27">27</a>] literature review reported successful crosses 
of western larch with European larch (<i>L. decidua</i>) and with Japanese larch 
(<i>L. kaempteri</i>).

Except when it is young, western larch is rarely found in pure stands. Its most 
common tree associate is Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>), and on 
low-elevation dry sites it is found with ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>). 
Common associates in warm, moist forests include grand fir (<i>Abies
grandis</i>), western hemlock (<i>Tsuga heterophylla</i>), western redcedar 
(<i>Thuja plicata</i>), and western white pine (<i>P. monticola</i>). In cool, 
moist, subalpine forest types Engelmann spruce (<i>Picea engelmannii</i>),
subalpine fir (<i>A. lasiocarpa</i>), lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i>), and mountain 
hemlock (<i>Tsuga mertensiana</i>) are more common.

<p> 
Hardwoods that occur with western larch include paper birch (<i>Betula papyrifera</i>), 
black cottonwood (<i>Populus balsamifera </i>ssp. <i>trichocarpa</i>), and quaking aspen 
(<i>P. tremuloides</i>) [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>].</p>

<p> 
Major understory associates include common beargrass (<i>Xerophyllum tenax</i>), huckleberry 
(<i>Vaccinium </i>spp.), thimbleberry (<i>Rubus parviflorus</i>), menziesia (<i>Menziesia ferruginea</i>), 
ninebark (<i>Physocarpus malvaceus</i>), serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier</i> spp.), 
Oregon boxwood (<i>Paxistima myrsinites</i>), and bearberry (<i>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</i>).</p>

<p>
Western larch is not considered a climax species, but it is a
long-lived early successional species. Refer to the '<a href="botanical_and_ecological_characteristics.html#SUCCESSIONAL STATUS">Successional Status</a>'
section of this species summary for more details [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#156">156</a>]. Classifications describing

GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS:</a></span>
<br />

Western larch is a fast growing, long-lived, deciduous conifer native to
alpine and subalpine forests of the northwestern United States and adjacent
Canada [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#154">154</a>]. Trees over 900 years old have been reported [<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>].

<p>
One of the world's largest larches, western larch typically grows 100 to 180
feet tall (30-55 m) but can be over 200 feet (60 m) tall [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>], with 
diameters up to 6 feet (2 m) [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>]. Basal area increases rapidly to about 
age 40, then decelerates and nearly levels off after age 100 [<a href="#115">115</a>]. A deep, 
spreading root system stabilizes these large trees [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>]. In a synthesis 
of literature on northwestern trees, Minore [<a href="#93">93</a>] ranked western larch root depth 
in the middle category of 5 categories. </p>

<p>
Bark in mature trees is 
thick and furrowed into large, flaky plates [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>]. At age 50, basal bark 
thickness ranges from 5 to 10 inches (12-25 cm), and at age 100 bark is 10 to 18 inches
(25-45 cm) thick [<a href="#12">12</a>]. Western larch trunks are usually bare 
for a half to a third of the height when in stands, while trees in the open may have branches 
to within a few feet of the ground [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>]. Crowns are generally short,
open, and pyramidal with nearly horizontal branches, though branches may droop in the lower 
crown of older trees grown in the open [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>]. Crown length, width, and density 
were all ranked low in Minore's [<a href="#93">93</a>] synthesis of literature on northwestern trees.</p>

<p>
Branches are stout and brittle, changing from pubescent to glabrous with age.
Buds are small, rounded, and hairless [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>]. As trees mature, clustered epicormic 
branches replace older branches, beginning with the lower portion of the crown. Eventually, 
epicormics, which grow from dormant buds at the base of first order branches, comprise the 
entire crown [<a href="#83">83</a>].</p>

<p>
Clusters of 15 to 30 slender, soft, spirally-arranged needles 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5.0 cm) long arise 
from dwarf twigs [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>]. Western larch foliage is replaced annually [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].</p>

<p>
Male western larch cones are 0.4 inch (1 cm) long [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>]. Ovulate cones
are papery, 1 to 1.5 inches long (2.5-3.5 cm) and 0.5 to 0.6 inch (1.3-1.6 cm) 
wide with long subtending bracts [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>]. Seeds are 0.1 inch (3 mm) long with 
0.2 inch (6 mm) wings [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>].</p>

<p>
The preceding description provides characteristics of western larch relevant
to fire ecology and is not meant to be used for identification. Keys for
identifying western larch are available [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Breeding system:</b></font> 
Western larch is monoecious with both staminate and ovulate cones distributed throughout
the crown
[<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>].



<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Pollination:</b></font>   
Western larch pollen is distributed by wind and is less abundant than that of other 
conifers. Owens [<a href="#101">101</a>] described the physiological details of pollination in 
western larch.</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed production:</b></font>   
Western larch cone production may begin as early as age 8 though it is unusual on 
trees less than 25 years old. Heavier crops usually begin at approximately 40 to 50 
years of age and continue for 300 to 500 years [<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>]. Trees usually produce 
cones annually, but crop size varies with year and location; heavy cone crops occur
every 5 years on average, with fair to poor crops in other years [<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>]. Shearer and 
Carlson [<a href="#121">121</a>] reported an annual average of 1,393 potential cones per tree over a 6-year 
period. Because western larch cones are borne throughout the crown, the size of the crop 
generally corresponds to the size of the crown [<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>]. Shearer and Kempf's [<a href="#132">132</a>] 
literature review indicated that the number of cones also increases with increased 
spacing of trees.</p>

<p>
Western larch seeds are small and light, just 137,000 to 143,000 per 
pound (301,00-315,00/kg) [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#154">154</a>]. On average each mature cone produces 39 seeds, but 
some may contain as many as 80, and mature stands of western larch may produce more than 
0.5 million seeds per acre (1.2 million seeds/hectare) [<a href="#115">115</a>]. Roe [<a href="#111">111</a>] described a method 
for estimating the size of western larch seed crops up to 1 year in advance.</p>

<p>
Viability of seeds typically increases 
with crop size and decreases with tree age [<a href="#115">115</a>]. Inviable seed results from lack of 
pollination, inviable pollen, lack of fertilization, later ovule abortion, or embryo 
abortion [<a href="#102">102</a>]. Over a 6-year period, Shearer and Carlson [<a href="#121">121</a>] found that 4% of potential 
seeds at the time of bud burst matured as filled seeds.</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed dispersal:</b></font>    
Most of western larch's small, light, long-winged seeds are distributed within 328 feet 
(100 m) of the parent. However, depending on wind conditions, they may be dispersed up 
to 820 feet (250 m) or more [<a href="#116">116</a>]. This distance is comparable to that of Engelmann
spruce seeds, but is longer than Douglas-fir and subalpine fir [<a href="#115">115</a>]. Seed spread rate 
is considered moderate [<a href="#154">154</a>].</p> 

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed banking:</b></font>  
Western larch seeds are viable only until the year following fertilization [<a href="#117">117</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Germination:</b></font>   
Seeds of western larch germinate well on a variety of seedbeds and aspects [<a href="#117">117</a>], but
Stoehr [<a href="#147">147</a>] found that germination and survival was greatest in mineral soil.
In a synthesis of literature on northwestern trees, Minore [<a href="#93">93</a>] ranked western 
larch germination and survival in the highest category for mineral seedbeds, in 
the middle category for burned seedbeds, and in the lowest category for organic 
seedbeds. The ideal temperature for germination is 80� Fahrenheit (27� C), but
germination can occur at temperatures as low as 65� Fahrenheit (18� C). Germination 
occurs at or above the soil surface. Natural stratification
during winter results in rapid, complete germination. Spring-sown western larch seeds
without stratification germinate slowly and erratically; some do not germinate
until the following season [<a href="#115">115</a>]. Oswald [<a href="#100">100</a>] reported seed predation and shade 
both had negative effects on germination rates of western larch, though shading was not 
a significant factor. Shade appears to be more important as seedlings develop.</p> 

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Seedling establishment/growth:</b></font>
On average 1 western larch seedling will establish for every 53 seeds produced and
dispersed [<a href="#127">127</a>]. Seedlings grow rapidly and vigorously [<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#154">154</a>], averaging 2 inches (5 cm) 
of growth during the 1st season and 12 inches (30 cm) per year over the next 4 years. 
Western larch seedlings grow faster than all major associates except lodgepole pine, 
and the species grows faster than any other Rocky Mountain conifer until 100 years of age [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>].</p>

<p>
<b>Site variation:</b> 
Site requirements for establishment and growth of western larch seedlings are more specific 
than those for germination. Seedlings are well adapted to the mineral soil and sunlight of 
exposed seedbeds, such as those created by burning or mechanical scarification. They do not 
thrive in areas with undisturbed litter, humus, sod, or heavy root competition
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>]. Overly dense stands slow growth. For the 1st few years shaded
seedlings usually grow faster than those in full sunlight; thereafter, seedlings in full sunlight
outgrow shaded seedlings. North, northwest, and northeast exposures and gentle to 
flat topography are best for seedling survival; high surface temperatures on south and west 
exposures may kill many seedlings [<a href="#115">115</a>].</p>

<p>
<b>Mortality:</b> 
Seedling mortality is usually highest in the 1st season; losses after year 3 are minimal [<a href="#115">115</a>]. 
Biotic factors, such as fungi, birds, and rodents, cause the most 1st year seedling deaths 
early in the season, but drought is more detrimental after mid-July [<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>]. Newly germinated 
seedlings were killed by high soil-surface temperatures (&gt;130� Fahrenheit (54� C)) in Montana, and these
effects were most severe on western and southern exposures [<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Asexual regeneration:</b></font>   
Western larch does not reproduce by sprouts, but propagation by cuttings has been successful [<a href="#115">115</a>].

<br />

Western larch occurs in mountain valleys and lower slopes, often in somewhat
swampy areas [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>]. It needs well-lighted areas for maximum development, 
so it performs best in open stands [<a href="#72">72</a>]. Western larch is usually found at elevations
of 1,500 to 5,500 feet (460-1,700 m) in the northern portions of its range and may be 
found at elevations over 7,000 feet (2,100 m) in the southern parts of its distribution 
[<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>]. Latitude and elevation affected genetic variation patterns of western larch 
populations in the Rocky Mountains. Populations from more northern areas and from high 
elevations had lower growth potential, lower resistance to disease, and lower survival [<a href="#108">108</a>].
Elevational ranges for some states and 1 province in western larch's range are:

<p>
<b>Soil:</b> 
Western larch is found on a wide variety of soil types, most of which are
derived from bedrock or glacial till, but some are of&nbsp; loessial or volcanic ash
origin. Deep, porous soils, such as those of mountain slopes and valleys are
ideal, and growth is related to soil depth [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>]. Western larch is 
also quite dependent on mineral soil or burned seedbeds, more so than any associated tree
species including lodgepole pine [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>]. Western larch is adapted to medium and coarse 
textured soils with a pH of 6 to 7, and has no salinity tolerance [<a href="#154">154</a>].</p>



<p>
<b>Topography:</b> 
Western larch occupies valley bottoms, benches, and mountain slopes. It is found on 
all exposures but is more common on north and east aspects. South and west exposures are 
often too severe for seedling establishment [<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>]. This trend is more
pronounced in the southern parts of its range, where it is found almost
exclusively on north- and east-facing slopes [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].</p>



<p>
<b>Harsh environments:</b> 
Western larch has moderate to high resistance to wind throw because its root system 
provides good anchorage. It is adapted to a wide range of temperatures, but since buds 
open earlier than associated conifers, hard frosts in late spring may result in cone crop loss
[<a href="#117">117</a>]. Frozen seed cones are associated with nighttime air temperatures of 25� Fahrenheit
(-4� C) or less [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>]. Snow and ice are generally not threats
to western larch survival. Wet snow when needles are present (early spring
or late fall) may cause snow bend, but rarely results in permanent damage [<a href="#117">117</a>].

<br><br>



<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SUCCESSIONAL STATUS">
SUCCESSIONAL STATUS:</a></span>

<br />

Western larch is the least shade tolerant conifer in its range [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>].
As such, it is a seral species whose populations have been historically maintained by
disturbances such as wildfire and glacial retreats [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>] and is therefore usually found in even-aged 
stands [<a href="#116">116</a>]. It is an aggressive pioneer species after fire or other major disturbance
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>] and competes best on moist sites [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>]. In drier environments where fires
are frequent, western larch may form a &quot;fire climax&quot; [<a href="#152">152</a>].</p>



<p>
Western larch uses nitrogen more efficiently than evergreen trees, reducing its
dependence on soil for nitrogen and increasing its effectiveness as a pioneer in disturbed,
infertile habitats [<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#149">149</a>]. This aggressive pioneer quickly colonizes disturbed areas 
and grows rapidly, remaining taller than its associates for approximately 100 years 
[<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>]. Western larch's rapid height growth may indicate
allocation of resources to early growth rather than early seed production, which would
explain the species' relatively advanced age of 1st reproduction compared to
other early successional species. Western larch extension growth was
significantly greater than that of 6 other northwestern conifers.
This characteristic and low shade tolerance were both associated with early
successional species studied [<a href="#152">152</a>].
</p>



<p>
In the absence of disturbance, shade tolerant
associates form understories that shade out future generations of western larch
seedlings [<a href="#116">116</a>]. However, western larch's long lifespan and resistance to damage
from fire and pathogens accounts for the presence 
of relict trees in late-successional stands that can repopulate the stand if
fire or other disturbance removes competition and opens the canopy [<a href="#45">45</a>].

FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS:</a></span>

Western larch is considered the most fire-resistant tree in its range
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>]. Fire is an important part of western
larch's ecology; without fire or other stand replacing disturbance, western larch will not
regenerate successfully and will eventually be replaced by more shade-tolerant
species [<a href="#116">116</a>].

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font>   
Western larch has many adaptations that enhance its ability to either survive 
fire or to quickly colonize recently burned areas. While seedlings, saplings, and 
poles are somewhat susceptible to fire, trees that are 150
to 200 years old or older are able to survive all but the most severe fires [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>].
It is common for a handful of mature western larch trees to be the sole
survivors after fire [<a href="#24">24</a>]</p>

<p>
Surviving fire: 
Western larch's extremely thick basal bark protects
its cambium from overheating [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>,<a href="#155">155</a>]. Low resin content and 
light lichen growth also decrease flammability [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. Western larch's characteristic high, 
open crown; open stand habit; and self-pruning lower branches minimize ladder fuels and risk 
of crown fire [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. Its deep roots are protected from surface and 
ground fires [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. In a synthesis of the literature on northwestern 
tree species, Minore [<a href="#93">93</a>] ranked western larch's bark in the most fire resistant 
category and its foliage in the least resistant category. He ranked western 
larch the most fire resistant tree in British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and 
Idaho.</p>

<p>
Needles of western larch are less flammable than other species' 
due to their small size. Because they are never more than 5
months old, they maintain a higher water content than other
conifers' needles that are replaced every 2 or 3 years [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>].
Since western larch replaces its needles annually anyway, it is better adapted
to defoliation than other conifers. In fact, after defoliation early in the season 
western larch trees often will produce a 2nd set of needles from heat-resistant 
woody buds and epicormic branches [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>]. The small needles
also minimize accumulation of surface litter at tree bases [<a href="#24">24</a>].</p>

<p>
Postburn colonization: 
Western larch survivors quickly reseed burned-over areas; on mineral soil seedlings 
develop rapidly and outgrow competitors [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>].
Fire-killed trees may contribute to seeding if fresh cones in the burned
crown mature and disperse seed [<a href="#10">10</a>]. Seeds are very light and long-winged, allowing 
trees in nearby stands to reseed even if no onsite seed source is present
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>]. Since western larch is a very long-lived and fire-resistant species, a potential
seed source remains in the area for centuries once it has established [<a href="#13">13</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font> 
Wildfires have occurred in western larch forests for over 10,000
years [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>]. Barrett and others [<a href="#20">20</a>] suggest 2 fire regimes for western larch
forests: 1) 25-75 year intervals between mixed-severity fires, and 2) 120-350
year intervals between primarily stand-replacing fires. While the species is 
primarily associated with these regimes, frequent surface fire regimes can also support 
western larch populations [<a href="#8">8</a>]. Frequency and severity of fires vary with
elevation, aspect, and habitat type.</p>

<p> 
Frequent understory fires: 
Warm, dry sites at the lower elevations of western larch's range
in western Montana have been characterized by frequent, low-intensity surface
fires occurring at 10 to 30 year intervals. These habitat types include 
Douglas-fir and grand fir. Stand replacing fires occurred in some of 
these stands at 150- to 400-year intervals [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p> 
 In ponderosa pine-western 
larch habitat in Pattee Canyon near Missoula, Montana,
fire scars indicate a mean fire return interval of 7.1 years from 1557 to 1918.
Fire occurred an average of every 5 to 10 years from 1750 to 1850, and in 10 to
20 year intervals from 1850 through 1900. After 1900, intensity and frequency of fires
were reduced until the late 1900s, when high intensity fires swept through north
and south slopes of the canyon [<a href="#60">60</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p> 
 In the Flathead National Forest of
western Montana, underburning occurred on average every 20 to 30 years in even-aged
ponderosa pine-western larch stands before 1900, with stand replacing fires
occurring at 150- to 400-year intervals. From 1735 to 1900 in the grand fir
habitat type of western Montana, an average fire return interval of 17 years
(range 3-32) maintained western larch as the most abundant tree followed by
lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir. Western larch was also found on 3 Douglas-fir
habitat type sites with average intervals of 7 (range 2-28), 16 (range 4-29),
and 19 (range 2-48) years [<a href="#15">15</a>].</p>

<p> 
Arno's [<a href="#8">8</a>] literature review reported that
understory fire regimes prior to 1900 in ponderosa pine-mixed conifer habitat types 
of western North America favored western larch and other fire resistant species 
such as ponderosa pine and Jeffrey pine. From 1600 to 1900 in several relict
habitat types where western larch occurs in western Montana, fire return
intervals averaged 27 (range 17-35) years in the Douglas-fir-big huckleberry 
(<i>V. membranaceum</i>) type, 25-30 years in the Douglas-fir-dwarf huckleberry 
(<i>Gaylussacia dumosa</i>) type, and 24 (range 9-42) years in the subalpine
fir-queen cup beadlily (<i>Clintonia uniflora</i>) type [<a href="#7">7</a>].</p>

<p> 
Mixed-severity fires: Much of the northern Rocky Mountains are characterized
by 30- to 100-year-interval fires of varying severity, which favor open
stands of western larch and Douglas-fir in Douglas-fir, western
larch, and lodgepole pine habitat types [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>]. In the Bob Marshall 
Wilderness, Montana, western larch-Douglas-fir-lodgepole pine and ponderosa pine 
forest types were historically maintained by mixed severity fire
regimes. Many live western larches in this area had 1 to 3 fire scars, 
and 1 was found with 4 scars. Fire return intervals in this area are nearly 
twice as long as historic mean intervals [<a href="#14">14</a>].</p>

<p>In western larch-Douglas-fir forests of the North Fork of Glacier National
Park, Montana, mean fire frequency from 1650 through 1935 was 36 years in
relatively dry sites and 46 years in relatively moist sites. In the drier areas,
up to 7 understory fires occurred between stand-replacing fires, which occurred
at a mean interval of 141 years. Only 1 or 2 understory fires occurred between
the less frequent stand-replacing fires (186-year mean intervals) on moister
sites [<a href="#20">20</a>].</p>

<p> 
On dry subalpine fir and cool, moist
Douglas-fir habitat types that were codominated by western larch, lodgepole
pine, and Douglas-fir, average fire return intervals ranged between 
30 and 75 years. Severity varied from understory burns to stand-replacing fires [<a href="#10">10</a>].</p>

<p> 
Infrequent stand-replacement fires: 
In western larch-Douglas-fir forests 
of northwestern Montana, average fire return intervals from 1735 to 1976 
were 120 years in valleys and montane slopes and 150 years for subalpine 
slopes. Most fires were small and of moderate intensity
with occasional patches of high intensity. Though some stands had as many 
as 6 fires during the period studied, most stands had only 1. A trend of 
decreasing mean frequency with increasing elevation was noted, and fires 
on north aspects were more intense and less frequent. Multiple burns occurred 
primarily on south-facing slopes. In these forests, single burns of low to
moderate intensity thinned the 
overstory and tended to favor regeneration of mixed conifers with patches of
seral species, while single intense burns resulted in even-aged forests.
Intense, repeated burns (fire return interval &lt;50 years) created shrubfields
or homogeneous stands, usually of lodgepole pine [<a href="#35">35</a>].</p>

<p> 
From 1650 to 1935, relatively 
moist western larch-Douglas-fir forests in Glacier National Park had stand 
replacement fires at mean intervals of 140 to 340 years [<a href="#20">20</a>]. In subalpine
fir and Engelmann spruce habitat types in the Middle Fork Drainage of Glacier
National Park, Montana, lodgepole pine and western larch stand-replacement 
intervals were generally 150 to 300 years but as short as 25 years [<a href="#19">19</a>], 
and in grand fir habitat in the Swan Valley of Montana,
stand-replacing fires occurred in average 150-year intervals, ranging 
from less than 20 to more than 300 years [<a href="#2">2</a>].</p>

<p> 
Moist sites of grand 
fir, subalpine fir, western redcedar, and western hemlock habitat types, 
which were dominated by western larch, lodgepole pine, Douglas-fir, and 
Engelmann spruce, burned primarily as stand-replacement fires with average 
fire return intervals of 120 to 350 years [<a href="#10">10</a>].</p>

<p> 
In western redcedar-hemlock 
(<i>Tsuga</i>) forests of northern Idaho, fire free intervals ranged from 
50 to 100 years with varied intensity. In subalpine fir habitat type, low 
to medium intensity fires occurred at intervals greater than
150 years [<a href="#9">9</a>].</p>

<br />

Mature western larch trees are more fire-resistant than any other species in
their range. (Refer to  '<a href="fire_ecology.html#FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS">
Fire Ecology or Adaptations</a>' in the FIRE ECOLOGY section of this species
summary for more information.). Unless a
smoldering surface fire or ground fire girdles boles or the buds are killed by torching,
mature western larch trees will survive all but the most severe fires
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>]. Peterson and Ryan [<a href="#105">105</a>] found that death of dormant buds on burned western
larch occurred 20% lower on trees than foliage death.

<p> Seedlings and saplings 
of western larch are readily killed by fire [<a href="#61">61</a>].
They are less tolerant than those of ponderosa pine [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>], but may
tolerate low-severity underburning better than white fir (<i>A. concolor</i>),
lodgepole pine, or Douglas-fir [<a href="#155">155</a>].

A severe fire in the Bitterroot National Forest, Idaho, killed nearly all grand
fir, Douglas-fir, and western redcedar, but most western larch over 8 inches (20
cm) d.b.h. survived [<a href="#73">73</a>]. After low-severity surface burns in ponderosa pine
forests of eastern Oregon, 64% of western larch showed no negative effects, 33%
were scarred at the base with wood exposed, and 2% burned off at the base and
were felled. No trees were killed by burning material around the base of the
trees [<a href="#94">94</a>]. A model presented by Peterson and Ryan [<a href="#105">105</a>] predicts zero probability of
western larch (13 inches (34 cm) diameter) mortality after fire with a scorch height of 
33 feet (10 meters).

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">

<br />

<b>Survivors:</b> 
Young larch that are wounded by surface fires often
heal and survive for centuries [<a href="#10">10</a>]. Trees defoliated by May slash
burning may produce new needles 1 month later, and appear completely recovered within 2 years
[<a href="#49">49</a>]. One year after underburning shelterwood units in Idaho, western larch overstory 
mortality was 7% [<a href="#136">136</a>]. After prescribed underburning of Douglas-fir-western
larch forest in western Montana, western larch's radial growth 
was reduced in the 1st year postfire, but increased over the 
following 7 years, suggesting that decreased competition may have 
enhanced western larch growth [<a href="#109">109</a>].


<p>
<b>Early Regeneration:</b> 
Fires that expose mineral soil and reduce competition, especially on 
north-facing slopes, favor rapid and abundant western larch
regeneration and dominance [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>]. Western larch usually establishes 
in the 1st season after fire [<a href="#2">2</a>], and as much as 5 inches (13 cm) of 
1st year postburn seedling growth has been reported after spring, summer, 
and fall burning of white fir sites on Wallowa-Whitman
National Forest, Oregon [<a href="#104">104</a>]. In the Flathead National Forest of northwestern
Montana, western larch began colonizing both wildfire and prescribed burn sites 
during the 1st year postfire [<a href="#133">133</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>]. Burned seedbeds from underburning in
shelterwood units in Idaho produced 3 to 7 times more western larch seedlings than
unburned seedbeds [<a href="#136">136</a>]. After clearcutting in northern Idaho
subalpine fir-Engelmann spruce-menziesia type, western larch stocking
was 20% on clearcuts that were burned and scarified, compared to 8% stocking on
unburned clearcuts [<a href="#23">23</a>]. After fires in 1910 and 1919 in Coeur d'Alene National Forest, Idaho,
western larch had restocked up to 200 seedlings per acre (500 seedlings/ha) on the 
north aspect of the study area by the fall of 1923. Western larch seedlings accounted for 83% of
conifer seedlings present on all slopes and 88% of those on the north-facing
slope [<a href="#84">84</a>]. Overstocking may result on some sites if too much mineral
soil is exposed [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>].</p>



<p>
Old skid trails often support high densities of
western larch seedlings, but the compacted soil does not allow trees to grow as
well as on other sites. Good sites for potential for western
larch establishment decrease as regeneration of a burned site progresses [<a href="#2">2</a>].</p>



<p>
Latham and others [<a href="#86">86</a>] found that in general, fires that resulted in open sites, 
relatively free of vegetation, with full sun, moving shade, and a mineral soil 
seed bed favored the development of western larch forests. In these conditions, 
western larch seedlings were generally able to establish quickly and grow taller 
than other vegetation. Where tree establishment was delayed, however, shrubs 
were able to establish and suppress western larch.</p>



<p>
<b>Competition and Succession:</b> 
Following fire, western larch must establish rapidly.
Insufficient sunlight or exposed mineral soil will delay 
western larch establishment, allowing development of shrubs or more 
shade-tolerant tree species [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>]. If the area does not burn again, 
shade will prevent western larch regeneration, and other species 
will eventually replace western larch [<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>]. Generally, stand-replacing 
fires favor western larch over its competitors because western larch is most 
likely to survive and postfire survivors will provide an onsite seed 
source, while less fire-resistant competitors must rely on offsite sources 
or unburned islands [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#135">135</a>]. Low to moderate intensity fires thin out 
competitors [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>]. The species may dominate the area for 150-350 years in 
the absence of fire [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#135">135</a>]. </p>


<p>
Western larch and lodgepole pine are early seral species that often
compete in the same recently burned areas.
In general, lodgepole pine performs better on drier or more exposed sites [<a href="#135">135</a>]. 
Due to western larch's later age of 1st seed production and longer
lifespan, it may be favored over lodgepole pine on sites that burn less
frequently [<a href="#138">138</a>]. Western larch-lodgepole pine stands in grand fir sites of
northwestern Montana with as little as 10% western larch overstory can
eventually be dominated by western larch [<a href="#1">1</a>]. In Coram Experimental Forest 
in northwestern Montana, single high intensity burns in western
larch-Douglas fir habitat thinned the overstory and favored regeneration of western
larch, Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine, while multiple severe burns tended to promote
lodgepole pine [<a href="#138">138</a>]. Western larch benefits from periodic surface
fires that kill competing shade-tolerant conifers [<a href="#15">15</a>].</p>


<p>
<b>Absence of fire:</b> 
Prior to 1900, fire maintained western larch as a dominant
seral species in various habitats [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>]. Lack of periodic  fires may
limit western larch regeneration [<a href="#37">37</a>]. Fire suppression in last
century has favored thickets of suppressed shade-tolerant conifers [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>], 
which result in a decline in the vigor of all trees [<a href="#10">10</a>].
These sites are at risk of high-intensity wildfires [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>]. Large
areas in and around the western larch habitat type are now characterized by such
crowded and stagnant stands [<a href="#10">10</a>], and fire suppression has been linked
to the decline of western larch habitat in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and
Washington [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>].</p>

<p>In Bear Creek Canyon of the Bitterroot Mountains, Montana, where the old
western larch are prevalent and younger ones less abundant and dwarf mistletoe 
has infected most trees, the species is near extinction due to lack of fire or 
other disturbance [<a href="#91">91</a>]. Remaining old-growth ponderosa pine-western larch habitat 
in Pattee Canyon near Missoula, Montana, has a thick understory of Douglas-fir 
saplings and pole-sized trees. This understory could provide ladder fuels, resulting 
in a crown fire [<a href="#60">60</a>]. If fire does not occur before the remaining trees die in these 
areas, or if ladder fuels create a crown fire that burns intensely enough to kill the
remaining trees, the western larch seed source may be eliminated. However, if a
seed source remains after fire, western larch may thrive in the postfire mineral
seedbed with reduced competition.

DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE:</a></span>
<br />

Regeneration of western larch after fire depends on site conditions and fire
intensity. After moderate fires in grand fir habitat of the Blue and Wallowa mountains of
northeastern Oregon, western larch in cool, moist areas had increased by the 1st
and the 5th years. After severe fires, the species decreased after the 1st year, 
but increased by postfire year 5. In warm, dry
grand fir habitats, moderate fires resulted in a decrease after the 1st year
and no change by the 5th year postfire, while severe fires caused a decrease in
western larch after the 1st year and an increase by 5 years postfire. Western
larch's response to burning in several grand fir associations was [<a href="#75">75</a>]:

<p>
In early postfire succession in the northern portion of the Bitterroot Mountains,
Montana, western larch formed nearly pure stands on north and east exposures, and
western white pine and Douglas-fir replaced western larch in the absence of fire
in 1929 [<a href="#85">85</a>]. Historically, following intense stand-replacing fires in mesic to moist 
habitats of the northern Rocky Mountains, even-aged western larch stands often
developed, while in drier habitats, western larch was maintained by frequent surface 
fires that minimized competition [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].</p>


<p>
In ponderosa pine-Douglas-fir forests of the inland northwest, the FIRESUM
model predicts successful regeneration of ponderosa pine with a 10- to 20-year
fire return interval. More severe fires at 50-year intervals predict western
larch dominance for 150 years, then an increase in ponderosa pine, and
Douglas-fir dominance after 200 years. Without fire, Douglas-fir would dominate
the understory and eventually the overstory, limiting regeneration of western
larch and ponderosa pine [<a href="#77">77</a>].

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Fire is an important management practice for maintaining western larch
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>]. Ideally, prescribed burns should expose well-distributed 
patches of mineral soil and reduce sprouting potential of competitors [<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>]. 
However, even areas with very little burned surface result in significantly better 
western larch regeneration than unburned sites [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>]. In good seed crop 
years, overstocking may result in mesic habitats where too much mineral soil is 
exposed, and thinning may be necessary to facilitate a vigorous stand [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>]. 
Harsh sites with poor regeneration potential may require planting after burning
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].

<p>
Norum [<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>] provides detailed recommendations for
prescribed burning in western larch-Douglas-fir forests. Based on studies 
of fire and harvest regimes, Antos and Shearer [<a href="#2">2</a>] make recommendations for 
management practices on grand fir-queencup beadlily habitat type in northwestern 
Montana.</p>



<p>
<b>Timing and Site Conditions:</b> 
The timing of prescribed burns is important for western larch site 
preparation; large fuels should be dry and soil moisture low
in order to expose mineral soil [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>]. Norum [<a href="#98">98</a>] reported 
that 10 to 17% water content in small diameter (&lt;4 inch (&lt;10 cm)) fuels
is a safe and effective range for burning in western larch-Douglas-fir 
habitat. Spring and early summer fires usually burn only the surface of the 
duff layer, while late summer or early fall fires after dry summers
tend to be more effective at exposing enough mineral soil for larch 
regeneration. August or early September, before the fall rains, are the best 
times for burning north-facing slopes, but on other aspects, there is more 
flexibility for timing a successful burn [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>]. 
Timing of seed dispersal should also be considered when planning fall fires;
burning before seedfall is preferable [<a href="#37">37</a>]. 
Depending on site conditions, removing duff from bases of western larch trees 
to prevent cambium and root damage and/or thinning understory to reduce ladder 
fuels may be necessary prior to burning [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>].</p>



<p>
<b>Fire Intensity:</b> 
An adequate seedbed for western larch usually results from
moderate intensity fires in dry duff. High intensity fires may expose too much
mineral soil and result in overstocking [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].
Prescribed burning after clearcutting or shelterwood cutting is sometimes used
to mimic the effects of severe wildfires on western larch habitat [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>].</p>



<p>
While western larch seedlings usually establish best on severely burned sites 
[<a href="#109">109</a>], underburning may lead to consistent successful natural regeneration but 
requires careful attention to fuel and site conditions
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>]. Harvey and others [<a href="#69">69</a>] found burning to remove slash 
reduced ectomycorrhizal activity after partial cuts in western larch-Douglas-fir 
forests of northwestern Montana. They recommend against burning to remove 
slash on harsh sites where understory competition may limit conifer germination 
or where soil organic matter is low. They suggest underburning is better 
suited for areas where excessive regeneration is expected or where understory 
vegetation is desired, especially if burn conditions are chosen to limit duff 
reduction, which in turn will limit conifer (including western larch) germination.</p>



<p>
<b>Models:</b> 
Reinhardt and Ryan [<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>] present a model for predicting postfire
mortality of western larch and 6 other western conifers using bark thickness 
and percent crown volume. Desired levels of mortality can be predicted
using tree species, diameter, height and crown ratio, and maximum allowable
flame length.&nbsp;FIRE-BCG simulates fire succession on coniferous forest 
landscapes of the northern Rocky Mountains, including western larch habitat [<a href="#78">78</a>], 
and FIRESUM models tree establishment, growth, mortality, fuel accumulation, fire
behavior, and fuel reduction in ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir forests of the inland
northwest [<a href="#77">77</a>].

primarily of Douglas-fir and western larch (<i>Larix occidentalis</i>) with
small amounts of lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i>) and ponderosa pine (<i>P.
ponderosa</i>). The largest and best trees had been selectively logged
about 50 years earlier. Subsequently, an uneven understory of dense
Douglas-fir had developed. There were a large number of widely spaced,
large-diameter western larch stumps to indicate preharvest conditions. 
In addition to conifers and bearberry, huckleberries (<i>Vaccinium</i>  spp.),
white spirea (<i>Spiraea betulifolia</i>), and heartleaf arnica (<i>Arnica
cordifolia</i>) were common in the understory [<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>].

Western larch's phenological state can be inferred based on timing of the burns. 
Fires occurred from May through October, so western larch's phenological state 
would have been varied. During the May through July burning period, needle 
growth would have been ending, diameter growth would occur, and height growth 
would have peaked near the end. Pollination and fertilization would have 
occurred during this time period. By the August and September burns, tree growth 
for the year would have been complete, and cones would have been mature. Most 
seed dispersal would have occurred during the burning period. Western larch

The site is located at about 4,800 feet (1,464 m) with east to northeast
exposures and slopes of 20 to 50%. The area has warm summers and
cold winters with annual precipitation of about 18 inches (470 mm), most
of which falls as winter snow.  Soils in the area are thin, poorly
developed sandy loams in the Holloway Series [<a href="#96">96</a>]. They formed in residuum
weathered from quartzite, argillite and, on these sites, contain
sufficient rock to be considered talus slopes. Calcium and phosphate
are limited in these soils [<a href="#142">142</a>]. The site had a substantial complex fuel
load including many dead small trees in understory thickets. Total dead
fuel loadings ranged from 5.5 to 50 tons per acre (12.3-112.1 metric tons/ha). 
Over 100 parameters were measured in connection with these fires [<a href="#141">141</a>].

Out of the 20 test plots broadcast burned during 1973, 9 were burned
from early May to the 1st of July.  The rest were burned from early
September to mid-October.  The average dead fuel moisture contents
ranged from 8.5 to 35% and wind speeds were from 0 to 15 miles per
hour (0-24 km/hr).  Strip ignition horizontally across plots was used
for most plots, and fire intensity on each strip was allowed to drop

Stark and Steele  analyzed prefire and postfire nutrient content of soil, soil water, and
plants. Three years after the fires, average cover of western larch in the study
area was as follows: 0.27% on lightly burned plots, 0.23% on moderately burned plots, 2.4% on
intensely burned sites, and no western larch seedlings had established on control

Eight years after the fires an analysis of radial and basal area growth was performed. 
Western larch's relative radial increment on burned plots was less than on unburned 
plots in the 1st year and greater on burned plots thereafter. The difference in growth
of trees on burned plots compared to trees on control plots increased
each year for the 1st 4 years. Western larch's response was more
positive than that of Douglas-fir, and from the 4th to the 8th year
the average relative radial increment was 60 to 80% greater on
burned plots than on unburned plots. The average unadjusted radial
growth increment of trees on burned and unburned plots for the 1st 8

<br />

Underburning in similar western larch-Douglas-fir forests is feasible [<a href="#96">96</a>].
An average of 15% of the overstory trees were killed in the plots. Within 
the range of fuel loadings in this study, fires were most
manageable and still effective when the moisture content of 0 to 1 inch
(0-2.5 cm) dead fuels was around 15% [<a href="#95">95</a>]. Strip ignition helped
overcome control and ignition problems caused by discontinuous
concentrations of heavy fuels. Underburning requires attention to the
form, moisture status, and amount of living vegetation [<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>].

<p>
Western larch seedlings established best on sites burned by the hottest
fires. Prescribed underburns in western larch stands can result in an
increase in individual tree relative radial increment. However, growth
of western larch in these poorly growing stands continued to be slow.
Growth, even in trees with fire damage, was not reduced by the fire, and
fire may be a useful tool for fuel reduction or other purposes in such stands
[<a href="#109">109</a>].

commencing. Pollen and seed cones would be apparent, and pollination may have
been occurring. The latest October burns would have occurred when tree growth
was complete for the season, and seed dispersal probably would have been

A total of 76 treatment plots were established at the 2 sites, with an equal
number of sites facing each of the 4 cardinal directions. Miller Creek had 60,
10-acre (4-ha) units, and Newman Ridge had 16 units, ranging in size from 20 to
58 acres (8-24 ha). Prior to fire treatment, most study plots were clearcut and
slashed between 1966 and 1969. Other sites were left uncut for comparison.


<p>
<b>Miller Creek:</b> 
Elevation at Miller Creek ranges from 4,200 to 5,000 feet 
(1,280-1,524 m) with slopes averaging 24% and ranging from 9 to 35%.
Soils are Andic Cryoboralfs that developed in glacial till from the
argillites and quartzites of the Wallace (Belt) formation. Average
precipitation is about 25 inches (640 mm) annually; approximately
two-thirds falls as snow during the long, cool winter [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>].</p>


<p>
<b>Newman Ridge:</b>
Elevation at Newman Ridge ranges from 4,400 to 5,400 feet (1,341-1,646 m) with slopes
averaging 55% and ranging from 44 to 76%. Soils are Andic
Cryochrepts that have developed in place or in colluvium from argillites
and quartzites of the Belt formation. There is a surface loess deposit
containing ash from the Mt. Mazama and Glacier Peak volcanic eruptions
at both sites which is 0.5 to 2.5 inches (1-6 cm) thick at Miller Creek
and 2 to 3 inches (5-8 cm) thick at Newman Ridge. Average precipitation
is nearly 40 inches (1020 mm) at Newman Ridge of which two-thirds falls
as snow[<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>].</p>

<p>
<b>Fuel loads:</b> 
Duff depth averaged 2.2 inches (5.5 cm) at Miller Creek and 2.1
inches (5.2 cm) at Newman Ridge, with deeper duff on north and east exposures 
than on south and west aspects. Fuel loads after clearcutting and before
fire, excluding duff, ranged from 60 to 165 tons per acre (135-370 T/ha), 
but were generally uniform within each size class. Fuel loads
at the Miller Creek sites were slightly higher than at Newman Ridge. Mean weights
of fuel loads by size class are as follows [<a href="#21">21</a>]:</p>

<b>Prescribed burns:</b> 
Slash fuels were allowed to cure for an average of 9 months before
burning (range: 2-18 months) [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>]. Prescribed burns were conducted in the

at Newman Ridge [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>]. Fires were ignited by center-firing, by flanking, 
or by a combination of these, and most fires were ignited in late afternoon or 
evening after winds had decreased [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>]. Due to concern about fire control,
clearcuts with heavier fuel loads were burned under wetter conditions [<a href="#37">37</a>].
Burning patterns and fire severity varied among the plots burned. After broadcast 
burns at Miller Creek, 75% of the fuels less than 3.9 inches (10 cm) burned and
60% of the larger fuels burned. At Newman Ridge 89% of
the fuels less than 3.9 inches (10 cm) burned and 55% of the
larger fuels burned [<a href="#21">21</a>]. Greater surface soil heating occurred at Newman
Ridge than at Miller Creek because the duff layer was shallower and
water content of both duff and soil was lower. The average duff
reduction ranged from 36 to 70% at Miller Creek and 44 to 99% at Newman Ridge
[<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>].

<p>
<b>Wildfires:</b>
On August 23, 1967, a wildfire burned 5 units that had
been clearcut and 4 units that were uncut forest at Miller Creek [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>].
Average duff reduction from the wildfire was 93% with a range of
84 to 100%; all overstory and understory trees were killed and shrubs
and herbs were burned to the ground [<a href="#145">145</a>]. Fuel moisture of 0 to 0.4 inch (0-1 cm)
branchwood ranged from 6 to 21% [<a href="#21">21</a>]. A wildfire occurred at Newman
Ridge on July 25, 1969 [<a href="#130">130</a>].

<b>Seedbed condition:</b> 
Seedbeds after the fires varied. Early 1967 and most 1968 fires did not completely
burn litter and duff or expose much mineral soil. The 1967 wildfire
consumed most of the duff and killed most roots of sprouting species.
Other fires were spotty and exposed some mineral soil [<a href="#19">19</a>]. Unburned duff continued
to decrease for several years, exposing bare soil on areas where the fire
had left charred duff. The reasons for this decrease may include:
increased decomposition stimulated by warmer surface temperature during
May and June where adequate moisture was present; redistribution by
precipitation, runoff or wind; and oxidation. However, since western
larch needs to establish quickly and become dominant, continued duff reduction may benefit
other conifer species more.

<p>
<b>Seed Supply:</b> 
Clearcutting and burning eliminated onsite seed sources [<a href="#133">133</a>]. Nearby uncut trees, 
onsite survivors (uncut stands only), and scorched cones from fire-killed trees 
provided the postfire seed source [<a href="#129">129</a>]. In addition to natural seeding, seeds were
sown in 1967 on test plots, and bareroot seedlings were planted on
Newman Ridge from 1970 through 1975 and on 4 clearcuts at Miller
Creek from 1970 through 1973. Postfire seed dispersal into the clearcuts from 
western larch in the timber around clearcut areas was good. The best seed year for all
conifers was 1971; however, heavy frost in May of that year decreased
the potential western larch seed crop [<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>]. Another good crop
occurred in 1980 [<a href="#130">130</a>]. Seed fall was highest on south-facing clearcuts,
followed in order by west, east, and north aspects [<a href="#127">127</a>]. The cumulative average number of
sound seed of western larch from 1969 through 1974 on 8 clearcuts on
Newman Ridge by distance from the source is listed below [<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>]:</p>

<b>Germination and growth:</b> 
Fire influenced the amount and height of natural regeneration. Germination 
of western larch began the 1st year after fire several days before snow 
completely melted, and was greater on mineral soil than on unburned duff over 
0.5 inches (13 mm). Depending on the site, early succession associates were 
fireweed (<i>Epilobium angustifolium</i>), Scouler willow (<i>Salix
scouleriana</i>), snowbrush ceanothus (<i>Ceanothus velutinus</i>), Douglas-fir, subalpine
fir, and/or lodgepole pine [<a href="#133">133</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>]. Despite an adequate seed source, very few western
larch seedlings established on unburned duff [<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>].</p>

<p>  
In 1978 at Miller Creek, stocking of established western larch seedlings 
averaged 54% on burned units and 5% on unburned clearcuts, and by 1984 stocking 
averaged 71% on burned units and 1% on unburned clearcuts [<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>]. Western 
larch seedlings outnumbered other conifers on 10 of 18 units. By 1984 western 
larch had stocked well on all Miller Creek aspects but had the highest stocking 
on west-facing slopes [<a href="#130">130</a>]. On 7 Miller Creek sites studied on south and east 
slopes, western larch regeneration decreased from 1974 through 1984 while 
regeneration of other conifers more than doubled [<a href="#133">133</a>].</p>

<p>  
Natural regeneration of western larch at Newman Ridge was
lower than at Miller Creek due to harsh site conditions, larger
clearcuts, and poor seed production [<a href="#130">130</a>]. In 1979 at
Newman Ridge, stocking of established western larch seedlings averaged
10% (6%-16%) on burned clearcuts [<a href="#128">128</a>]. Expected survival for planted 
western larch on such sites at Newman Ridge was high in the western 
redcedar-queencup beadlily habitat type; moderate in the grand fir-queencup beadlily,
grand fir-common beargrass, and Douglas-fir-dwarf huckleberry habitat types;
and low in the Douglas-fir-ninebark habitat type. Actual survival by
1979 was lower than expected, only 38% for western larch overall [<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>]. 
Stocking was best on north-facing slopes at Newman Ridge [<a href="#130">130</a>].</p>

<p>  
The average number of established (>1 foot (30.5 cm) tall) western larch 
seedlings in 1979 and 1984 and the range in 1984 on 37 burned units

At Newman Ridge in 1979, the tallest western larch seedlings averaged 3.0 feet 
(0.9 m) [<a href="#128">128</a>]. At Miller Creek in 1978, the tallest western larch seedlings 
averaged 8.5 feet (2.6 m) on uncut plots burned by the wildfire, which was 
significantly greater than the average of 5.3 feet (1.6 m) on clearcuts that 
were burned by the wildfire. This average was significantly greater than the 
average height of 3.7 feet (1.1 m) on clearcuts that were burned by prescribed 
fire in 1967. This sequence may be because the uncut units burned by wildfire 
had a greater proportion of older western larch. Another possible explanation 
was that the presence of shade-killed trees may have decreased 
evapotranspiration and increased the number of growing days.</p>



<p>
Height was also related to habitat type and phase with the tallest trees on the
warmer and drier common beargrass phase of the subalpine fir/queencup beadlily
habitat type and shorter trees on the cooler and moister menziesia phase. 
Trees were significantly taller on east and south aspects than on west or 
north aspects. The tallest western larch trees in 1978 were on uncut stands 
burned by wildfire. Evidently, soil moisture is not as limiting in early stand 
development as it is later; also, trees on the warmer sites began growth earlier 
in the spring and may have benefited from extra nitrogen contributed by snowbrush 
ceanothus [<a href="#129">129</a>].</p>



<p>
Thirty years after the fires, basal area of western larch regeneration
was greater than that of all other tree species in the common beargrass phase. In the menziesia
phase, western larch had the highest basal area in the prescribed burn
treatments as well as in treatments that were clearcut and burned by wildfire.
Lodgepole pine had higher basal area in the uncut wildfire plots [<a href="#150">150</a>].</p>



<p>
<b>Mortality:</b> 
Seed and seedling losses were caused by rodents, drought, frost
heaving, high temperatures at the soil surface, and migrating dark-eyed juncos
that ate emerging seedlings in 1968 [<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. Drought was the leading cause of
death on south-facing slopes and 2nd highest on other aspects. The average
survival of larch plantations in Newman Ridge was 38% 10 years after treatment
[<a href="#128">128</a>].


<br><br>



<span class="subframeContent">
<a name="FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS(2nd CASE STUDY)">
FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS:</a></span>
<br />


In general, fires that resulted in open sites relatively free of
vegetation with full sun, moving shade, and a mineral soil seed bed favored
the development of western larch forests. In these conditions, western larch
seedlings were generally able to establish quickly and grow taller than other
vegetation before being shaded out. Where tree establishment was delayed, shrubs 
were able to establish and suppress western larch
[<a href="#86">86</a>].


<p>
During late spring and early summer, duff is usually wet, and fires do
not expose much mineral soil.  Late summer or early fall fires (on
south, east, and west slopes) are more
effective at removing duff and exposing mineral soil for western larch
regeneration. On north-facing slopes, summer burning before the fall
rains is probably best [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>]. However, if precipitation occurs, fuels and duff need to
dry for several days. At Newman Ridge, moderate intensity fires removed
most of the duff and prepared an adequate seedbed. At Miller Creek, the
same intensity fire exposed less mineral soil because the duff was
thicker and wetter.</p>


<p>
Habitat type and site conditions alter the amount of duff removal needed for 
western larch regeneration. On mesic habitat types severe fires that expose a 
high proportion of mineral soil, followed by good seed years, lead to dense 
stocking. On steeper slopes with drier conditions, such as at Newman Ridge, 
residual duff layers have an adverse impact on the survival of seedlings.</p>


<p> Seed dispersal should be taken into account when deciding the time of
fall fires.  In a plentiful seed year, dispersed seed could be destroyed by
fires after early September at lower elevations and a few weeks later at
higher elevations. The light seeds of western larch enable it to
establish a high proportion of the seedlings in the center of larger
clearcuts such as those on Newman Ridge. Planting, rather than
seeding, may be necessary for reforestation on
steep, harsher sites [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Larch forests provide food and cover for a wide range of
fauna. Rodents eat seeds and seedlings, birds forage for insects and nest in
western larch, and squirrels often cut and cache cones. Deer, elk, and moose 
browse larch, though probably only as a last resort, and black bears forage on 
sugars that are concentrated in the sap layer in the spring [<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>].

<p>
Several studies have investigated the importance of western larch forests to
woodpeckers. McClelland [<a href="#90">90</a>] found that pileated woodpeckers, a sensitive
species dependent on old-growth western larch forests, used 17
times more western larch trees than Douglas-fir even though Douglas-fir trees 
were 5 times more abundant. Hadfield and Magelsson [<a href="#62">62</a>]
reported all western larch trees in their 5-year postburn study showed 
signs of woodpecker foraging, and most feeding occurred in 1st year after 
tree death. After stand replacing fires in conifer forests of the northern Rocky
Mountains, Hutto [<a href="#74">74</a>] found evidence of woodpecker foraging on 64% of western larch trees
larger than 3.9 inches (10 cm) d.b.h. compared with 81% of ponderosa pine, 48%
of Douglas-fir, 2.3% of Engelmann spruce, and 0.2% of lodgepole pine.</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Palatability/nutritional value:</b></font>    
Western larch appears to be unpalatable to most big game animals, but it is 
eaten as emergency food [<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>]. Its seeds are palatable to small birds and 
mammals, although larger seeds are preferred [<a href="#131">131</a>]. Larch needles provide a major 
source of food to several species of grouse [<a href="#12">12</a>].</p>

<p>
Nutrient values for western larch needles, twigs, and other tree parts
have been reported from 2 sites in western Montana [<a href="#140">140</a>]. Whole tree
values have also been published [<a href="#139">139</a>]. Western larch needles at
two locations in eastern Washington contained 2.0% and 1.7% nitrogen,
respectively [<a href="#57">57</a>]. Green needles from Lubrecht Experimental
Forest in western Montana, had a mean ash content of 5.8% with a range of 3.47
to 8.16%, and those from Coram Experimental Forest, Montana, had mean ash
content of 5.3% with a range of 4.9 to 8.9%. The following table summarizes
nutrient values for needles from these 2 sites [<a href="#140">140</a>].</p>

Woodpeckers and other cavity nesters utilize western larch. Around its decaying
interior, a dead western larch tree retains a protective layer of sapwood, which
provides nesting, roosting, and feeding
opportunities. Flying squirrels, woodpeckers, owls, and various songbirds 
nest in rotting western larch cavities. Snags are used by osprey, bald eagles,
and Canada geese for nesting [<a href="#12">12</a>], and raptors may nest in brooms
of trees infected with dwarf mistletoe [<a href="#25">25</a>].

Western larch performs well on sites disturbed by fire, as well as on sites
disturbed by shelterwood, seed tree, and clearcut logging methods followed by
prescribed burning or scarification [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>]. However it does not compete 
well with grasses and shrubs [<a href="#114">114</a>]. Fiedler [<a href="#46">46</a>] describes how to estimate 
regeneration probabilities for various habitat type and site preparation combinations. 
Research on western larch indicates that artificial regeneration by bare root, container,
and seed may be possible on a large scale [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#154">154</a>].

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Wood Products:</b></font>  
Western larch is one of the most important timber-producing species in the 
western United States and western Canada. It has the densest wood of the northwestern 
conifers and is also very durable and moderately decay-resistant. Its high heating 
value makes it one of the best fuel woods in the region. The wood is also used 
commercially for construction framing, railroad ties, pilings, mine timbers, interior and
exterior finishing, and pulp, and burned snags are often used to make shakes
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#154">154</a>]. High sugar content of western larch makes it undesirable for 
concrete forms because the sugars react chemically with the concrete [<a href="#117">117</a>]. Faurot [<a href="#43">43</a>] 
describes methods for estimating total volumes of western larch wood, wood residue, and bark.

<p>
<b>Non-wood uses:</b> 
Native Americans used western larch for treatment of cuts and
bruises, tuberculosis, colds and coughs, sore throats, arthritis, skin sores,
cancer, and for blood purification [<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>].
They also made syrup from the sap, ate the cambium, and chewed solidified pitch
as gum [<a href="#68">68</a>]. Arabinogalactan, the gum from the tree, is used for lithography and in food,
pharmaceutical, paint, ink and other industries. The most desirable sources of
this gum are waste butt logs. Oleoresin from western larch is used
to produce turpentine and other products [<a href="#117">117</a>].

<b>Pests and Disease:</b> 
Though many insects and diseases can affect western larch,
damage is usually more severe in other associated species [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>]. 
Its deciduous habit helps with resistance to pests; if trees are defoliated, 
they produce a 2nd set of needles later in the season. Repeated defoliation, 
however, slows growth and may affect competitive ability
[<a href="#12">12</a>]. Epicormic branching (see 
<a href="botanical_and_ecological_characteristics.html#GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS">
General Botanical Characteristics</a> in 
&quot;BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS 
&quot;) appears to offer protection against disease by replacing older,
potentially infected branches [<a href="#83">83</a>].


<p>
Dwarf mistletoe (<i>Arceuthobium laricis</i>) is the most serious parasite that affects western larch.
Diseases include sporadic needle blight (<i>Hypodermella laricis</i>), needlecast (<i>Meria laricis</i>),
and root and stem rots [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>].</p>


<p>
Larch casebearer (<i>Coleophora laricella</i>) and western spruce budworm 
(<i>Choristoneura occidentalis</i>) are the most damaging insect pests to 
western larch. Western spruce budworm affects the form of western larch in 
western Montana, and height growth may be reduced 25-30% [<a href="#44">44</a>]. The most
damaging effect of larch casebearer is loss of growth, which may weaken trees, 
predisposing them to mortality [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>]. Other insect pests
that affect western larch are the larch sawfly (<i>Pristiphora erichsonii</i>)
and larch bud moth (<i>Zeiraphera improbana</i>) [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>].
Species that damage seed cones include the larch cone maggot (<i>Strobilomyia laricis</i>),
western spruce budworm larvae, woolly adelgids (<i>Adelges viridis</i>), 
and cone midges (<i>Resseliella </i>spp.) [<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>].</p>


<p> 
Some birds and mammals may also affect western larch survival. Birds and rodents 
may reduce germination capacity by foraging heavily on seeds. Squirrels may damage 
branches while cutting and caching cones, and bears often completely girdle and kill 
trees while foraging for sugars [<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>]. A review by Shearer and Kempf [<a href="#132">132</a>] 
reported that up to 5% of pole-size larches have been damaged by bears
in a given year at Coram Experimental Forest in Montana.</p>


<p>
<b>Stand management:</b> Schmidt and others [<a href="#117">117</a>] review literature regarding 
site preparation, direct seeding, planting, cutting methods, and stand management 
for western larch. Many western larch stands are susceptible to overstocking when 
good seed crops, adequate site preparation, and favorable weather coincide. In overstocked 
stands, individual tree growth may be inhibited, and tree mortality will be high. Dominant 
trees will eventually emerge, but may be suppressed in height and diameter [<a href="#115">115</a>]. In
these cases, it may be advantageous to thin stands in order to maintain
vigorous, rapidly-growing trees [<a href="#32">32</a>]. In western larch stands infested with dwarf 
mistletoe, Filip and others [<a href="#47">47</a>] recommend thinning to increase volume growth and to 
reduce new infections in remaining trees. Diameter, basal area, height, and cubic-foot volume 
growth are all improved by thinning of dense western larch stands in the northern Rocky
Mountains [<a href="#112">112</a>]. Thinning from above may increase mortality from wind throw and exposure 
[<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>]. Roe and Schmidt [<a href="#112">112</a>] describe specific recommendations for thinning
western larch.
