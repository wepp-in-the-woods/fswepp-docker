<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Taxus floridana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Florida yew is known only from bluffs and ravines along the Apalachicola
River in northwestern Florida, in Gadsden and Liberty counties [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].
Several populations occur along a 15-mile [24 km] stretch of the river
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  A single population was reported by Kurz [<a href="#10">10</a>] in an Atlantic
white-cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides) swamp 8 miles [12.8 km] southeast
of Bristol, Florida.  The Nature Conservancy, however, reported that no
further observations of the Atlantic white-cedar swamp population have
been made [<a href="#7">7</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Florida yew usually occurs in small clonal stands or clumps and rarely
as individual stems [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  It occurs as disjunct populations of
several hundred to several thousand stems per hectare in hardwood
forests dominated by American beech (Fagus grandiflora) and southern
magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), in both open forest habitats and dense
mountain-laurel (Kalmia latifolia) thickets.  It is an important
component of the forest understory in some drainages [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Florida yew
occurs in habitats which include the rare Florida torreya (Torreya
taxifolia), false hellebore (Veratrum woodii), and bladdernut (Staphylea
trifolia).  More common species occurring with Florida yew include
laurel oak (Quercus laurifolia), American beech, horse sugar (Symplocos
tinctoria), highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum), and in an
Atlantic white-cedar swamp, inkberry (Ilex glabra) [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  Additional
species that occur with Florida yew as reported by Southeastern Forestry
Services [<a href="#20">20</a>] include white oak (Q. alba), mockernut hickory (Carya
tomentosa), tree sparkleberry (V. arboreum), and yaupon (I. vomitoria).
On lower slopes the forests are dominated by American beech, southern
magnolia, and American holly (I. opaca).  In some ravines Florida yew
occurs in dense stands of fetterbush (Leucothoe racemosa),
mountain-laurel, greenbriers (Smilax spp.), and canebreak (Arundinaria
spp.).  No indicator species associated with Florida yew have yet been
identified.  Southeastern Forestry Services suggested that differences
in soil, aspect, moisture, or a combination of these factors may
influence the distribution of Florida yew, and that further research is
needed.

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Taxus floridana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>



<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Birds consume almost of all ripe Florida yew cones [<a href="#6">6</a>].  The relatively
small distribution of this tree makes it unlikely that it is an
important food source for any species.  White-tailed deer rubs on
Florida yew are common, sometimes causing extensive damage or death to
the stem.  Florida yew is a preferred food for beavers.  Yellow-bellied
sapsuckers excavate Florida yew for insects; holes characteristic of
this bird were found on mature Florida yew stems [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Taxol, a compound used to combat cancer, has been isolated from Florida
yew bark [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Florida yew occurs in forests that may be subject to logging and/or
other private development.  It has also been found to contain taxol in
quantities similar to those found in Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia), and
may be exploited for that purpose.  This may pose a major threat to
Florida yew, considering the small number of extant individuals and its
extremely restricted range.  If in vitro production of taxol is
developed, exploitation of Florida yew for taxol production may become
less of a threat to remaining populations [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Florida yew occurs in some areas that have been protected (The Nature
Conservancy's Apalachicola Bluffs and Ravines Preserve and Torreya State
Park), but many populations remain without specific protection.
Long-term monitoring programs, artificial propagation studies, and
studies on the fungi associated with Florida yew (as possible taxol
producers) are underway.  Further studies on its reproductive biology
and other ecological characteristics have been recommended [<a href="#7">7</a>].

The seeds and fresh foliage are poisonous to humans [<a href="#3">3</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Taxus floridana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Florida yew is a native, evergreen, small, bushy tree or shrub [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].
Maximum height at maturity is usually 26 feet (8 m), although one survey
reported an individual that was 30 feet (9 m) tall and 6.5 inches (16.5
cm) d.b.h. [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  The bark is purplish brown, sloughing in plates.
The leaves are needlelike, flat, linear, and somewhat falcate, 0.8 to 1
inch (2-2.5 cm) long.  The branches are arranged in an irregular manner,
long branches are often oriented ar nearly right angles to the trunk.
Even though the wood is hard when dried, live trunks are flexible [<a href="#16">16</a>].
The ovulate cones occur singly in only a few leaf axils [<a href="#6">6</a>].  The
ovulate cones have a fleshy outer covering (aril) that is 0.4 inch (10
mm) broad [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Florida yew is dioecious [<a href="#16">16</a>].  The seeds of other yews (Taxus spp.)
often take two growing seasons to germinate.  Passage through the
digestive tract of birds is probably required for germination of any yew
seed [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Seedling recruitment in Florida yew varies among sites.  The
majority of seedlings occur under female Florida yew trees, but seedling
height growth is negatively affected by the presence and density of a
canopy.  Of one hundred tagged seedlings at each of two sites, 21 and 39
percent survived to 10 months.  Seedlings are apparently only moderately
shade tolerant; very low levels of seedling recruitment were observed at
the site which had a closed canopy [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Florida yews form clonal stands largely through layering [<a href="#16">16</a>], although
root sprouts have also been reported [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Stems which have had their
tops chewed off by beavers will sprout, resulting in a bushy growth form
[<a href="#20">20</a>].  Individual Florida yew stems often fall over after reaching
maturity, or have branches forced to the ground by overstory branches or
stems which allows new Florida yew stems to form.  The flexible trunk
and long branches of Florida yew appear to facilitate the formation of
clonal stands.  Female genets have significantly more ramets than male
genets [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Florida yew occurs on steep slopes in the ravines and occasionally on
bluffs along the the Apalachicola River.  Soils are slightly acidic to
neutral sandy loams [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].  Florida yew occurs at elevations between
upland sandhill (longleaf pine [Pinus palustris]) habitats and very
moist ravine bottoms [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  It also occurs in an acidic peat (pH
range 4.2-4.5) swamp [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Florida yew is tolerant of shade.  Seed germination occurs under light
to deep shade, although seedling establishment and survival are low
under very deep shade [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Florida yew is, however, apparently adapted
to disturbance.  Disturbances that topple Florida yew stems, such as
shifting sands or windfall of overstory stems create opportunites for
new ramet formation, often downslope of the original stem.  Individual
stems of Florida yew may be relatively short-lived, but genets may be
long-lived, shifting location along slopes.  The largest (and oldest)
genets are often found on the lowest slopes [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Florida yew arils mature in September or early October of their first
season [<a href="#3">3</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Taxus floridana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Florida yew occurs in humid forests on moderate to steep slopes that
rarely burn.  Fire was historically frequent in the longleaf pine/grass
habitats upland of these slopes; observers note that surface fires there
often burn to the edges of the slopes and then naturally extinguish
[<a href="#24">24</a>].  Fires in the mesic hammocks in which Florida yew occurs usually
originate elsewhere, and consist of surface fires that creep and burn
only litter [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Florida yew will sprout after tops have been damaged
by means other than fire.  It is possible that fire-damaged stems may
respond the same way.  Sprouts that form after tops have been damaged,
however, are of low vigor and do not usually survive [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Other yews
are very susceptible to heat damage and rarely sprout after fire [<a href="#26">26</a>].
