Mountain snowberry is a dominant shrub species in numerous nonforested 
and forested communities in the western United States.  Habitat types using 
mountain snowberry as an indicator species have been identified within 
the Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>), white fir (<i>Abies concolor</i>),
ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>), subalpine fir (<i>A. lasiocarpa</i>), Gambel 
oak (<i>Quercus gambelii</i>), and quaking aspen (<i>Populus tremuloides</i>) series. 
Mountain snowberry also occurs within the pinyon-juniper (<i>Pinus-Juniperus</i> spp.) zone and is
a dominant understory species within the quaking aspen type throughout the
western mountains. It is a major component on open slopes in the mountain-brush zone, where it
may form pure stands. The upper limits of mountain snowberry's
elevational range extend into the subalpine zone [<a href="#33">33</a>].<br><br>

Common associates of mountain snowberry in quaking 
aspen communities are western yarrow (<i>Achillea millifoilium</i>), Wood's 
rose (<i>Rosa woodsii</i>), black chokecherry (<i>Prunus virginiana</i> var. <i>melanocarpa</i>), 
fireweed (<i>Epilobium angustifolium</i>), Saskatoon serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier alnifolia</i>), 
blue elderberry (<i>Sambucus coerulea</i>), lupine (<i>Lupinus</i> spp.) and  
sticky geranium (<i>Geranium viscosissimum</i>) [<a href="#2">2</a>].<br><br>

Common associates in Douglas-fir communities include Rocky mountain maple 
(<i>Acer glabrum</i>), heartleaf arnica (<i>Arnica cordifolia</i>), 
bristly black currant (<i>Ribes lacustre</i>), Saskatoon serviceberry, snowbrush 
ceanothus (<i>Ceanothus velutinus</i>), elk sedge (<i>Carex geyeri</i>), 
fireweed, and butterweed (<i>Senecio</i> spp.) [<a href="#49">49</a>].<br><br>

In Gambel oak communities of Utah, mountain snowberry often occurs with smooth sumac 
(<i>Rhus glabra</i>), skunkbush sumac (<i>Rhus trilobata</i>), hackberry 
(<i>Celtis occidentalis</i>), and mountain big sagebrush (<i>Artemisia 
tridentata</i> var. <i>vaseyana</i>) [<a href="#36">36</a>]. Mountain snowberry is common within the big sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i>)/grass region and may become a codominant with big sagebrush, occurring most conspicuously on the more mesic sites with mountain big sagebrush [<a href="#24">24</a>].<br><br>

Because of its abundance and wide distribution, mountain snowberry is important forage on many mountain ranges.  Although not highly nutritious or palatable, mountain snowberry is frequently one of the first species to leaf out, making
it a highly sought after food in the early spring [<a href="#46">46</a>]. Use by livestock and game is moderate throughout the summer and declines in fall. Mountain snowberry's low growth form makes its foliage easily available.  Plants withstand browsing well and produce numerous basal sprouts following browsing [<a href="#65">65</a>].  Results of clipping experiments carried out in the mountain-brush zone of Utah indicate that mountain snowberry can withstand early season browsing if given sufficient time to  recover [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Mountain snowberry is readily eaten by all classes of livestock, particularly domestic sheep.  Palatability varies in different localities and different plant communities.  In general mountain snowberry has greater palatability in the Intermountain region than on more southern or western ranges [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Mountain snowberry is a highly valued elk and domestic sheep forage within quaking aspen types in Colorado and Wyoming [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Mountain snowberry is of no value for horses [<a href="#43">43</a>].<br><br>
Mountain snowberry is an important forage species for deer and elk on high elevation summer ranges.  On quaking aspen forest summer range in Utah, mountain snowberry comprised 24% of the diet for elk and 20% for mule deer [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Ruffed grouse, ring-necked pheasants, and yellow-billed magpies utilize the fruits [<a href="#50">50</a>].<br><br>

Due to its relatively low growth form, mountain snowberry provides 
moderate to low cover for most ungulates.  In Oregon
mule deer utilize mountain snowberry-dominated communities for cover where these communities provide 
the only diversity in large expanses of big sagebrush [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Mountain

Mountain snowberry is useful for establishing cover on bare sites and has done well when planted onto roadbanks [<a href="#38">38</a>]. Once established it persists well and spreads vegetatively through layering [<a href="#46">46</a>]. Revegetation has been particularly successful using 
transplanted wildings.  Transplants are easily obtained
by pulling up small rooted portions of plants in the early spring before leaf growth has begun.  Plants can also be propagated via stem cuttings [<a href="#17">17</a>] and seed [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Mountain snowberry
is recommended for riparian plantings in wet meadow and forested communities [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Direct seeding is generally recommended in the fall or winter on
well-drained sites in the following types: big sagebrush, mountain
brush, pinyon-juniper, quaking aspen openings, and subalpine herblands.
Commercial seed may be dried fruits or cleaned seed.  Seeds have a
pronounced dormancy; acid treatments break down the seedcoat.
Stratification should be employed for spring planting.  Maximum storage
period for mountain snowberry seeds is 10 years [<a href="#54">54</a>].  Cultivated
seedlings can reach 30 inches (76 cm) within 5 years [<a href="#38">38</a>].

Mountain snowberry is a native, deciduous, montane shrub.  It is 
low growing, erect and sometimes trailing, with spreading to arching branches [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].
Although averaging 2 to 4 feet (0.6-1.2 m) in height, plants on good sites can grow up to 5 feet (1.5 m), while those on poor sites are barely a foot (0.3 m) tall. Fruits are white, berrylike drupes containing 2 nutlets, each of which contains a seed [<a href="#33">33</a>]. The genus <i>Symphoricarpos</i> is widely described as rhizomatous [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>], but rhizomatous growth generally is less well developed in mountain snowberry than in most snowberry species [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>].

Mountain snowberry reproduces vegetatively and by seed. Individual plants produce basal sprouts from a root crown; perennating buds are usually located approximately 0.8 to 1.2 inches (2-3 cm) below the ground surface [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>]. Layering has also been observed in mountain snowberry [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>]. Herbarium specimens from a ponderosa pine woodland in Musselshell County, Montana, have short, distinct rhizomes [<a href="#57">57</a>]. <br><br>
Since no abscission layer is formed on the pedicle, fruits may persist on shrubs for up to 2 seasons before falling to the ground.  Seed dormancy is broken by stratification in the soil; ripening and development of the embryo occur during 1 or 2 winters. Seeds do not remain viable and are not stored in the soil for extended periods.  Birds and mammals are probably the main dispersal agents. Germination begins in the early spring as soon as the soil thaws. Mountain snowberry germinates best on bare soil in partial shade [<a href="#52">52</a>].

all successional stages [<a href="#30">30</a>]. Mountain snowberry is rarely found in 
dense shade [<a href="#60">60</a>].  Within forested communities mountain snowberry grows 
under open canopies and along the edges of parks, dry meadows, and other 
openings.

Mountain snowberry initiates growth early in the spring.  Basal shoots
have been observed growing in the soil before total snowmelt [<a href="#65">65</a>].  The
carbohydrate reserve cycle for mountain snowberry has been studied in
the mountain-brush zone in Utah [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].  In general, reserves are at
a maximum at full flower, and this maximum is maintained as plants enter
dormancy in the fall.  Reserves are approximately 25% depleted
before the end of dormancy (stem bud swelling) due to the sprouting of
basal crown buds below the snow and litter layers.  The seasonal low is
reached when leaves are 1/2 to 3/4ths mature and leaf buds
still remain at the apex of the stems.  At this time reserves are
approximately 40% lower than the summer high in all perennial
plant parts.  From June until mid-August carbon reserves are replenished
in all plant parts.  Stem growth and limited flower production and set
are all accomplished during this time.<br><br>

There is a seasonal change in the aboveground and belowground
distribution of carbon reserves.  Generally carbohydrate reserve
quantities are greater in the aboveground biomass than in the
belowground biomass.  This balance shifts at the point of maximum
reserve depletion (late May or early June) [<a href="#23">23</a>].<br><br>

It is unclear from the literature what part burning season plays in mountain snowberry's highly variable response to fire. On most sites plants survive low severity fires and sprout within the first year [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].<br><br>

Fifteen years after a September prescribed burn in big sagebrush/grass habitat in Idaho, mountain snowberry production was nearly equal on light-severity and severely burned sites. Production was greatest on moderate-severity and unburned sites. Postfire production (lbs/acre, air-dry) was [<a href="#4">4</a>]:

Koniak [<a href="#30">30</a>] found that in singeleaf pinyon-Utah juniper (<i>Pinus monophylla-Juniperus osteosperma</i>) woodlands of California and Nevada, occurrence of mountain snowberry was significantly higher on 1-year-old August burns than on adjacent unburned woodlands.
In Nevada mountain big sagebrush, mountain snowberry plants regained 75% of prefire plant height within 4 years of late summer fires [<a href="#68">68</a>]. <br><br>
Mountain snowberry was severely damaged in Wyoming, however, following a late August prescribed burn in a quaking aspen forest. Twelve years after the burn, mountain snowberry was only producing about half the biomass of that being produced prior to the burn. Snowberry biomass production (air-dry, kg/ha) was as follows 3 and 12 years after different burn severities [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>]:</p>

Snowberry species are capable of producing firebrand material.  When 
large mountain snowberry plants are located near fire control lines, they may cause 
spot fires [<a href="#42">42</a>].<br><br>

Elk browsed mountain snowberry more on burned than  unburned quaking aspen forests. Postfire browsing may slow the shrub's recovery time [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>]. <br><br>
