<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of pignut hickory is Carya glabra
(P.Mill.) Sweet.  It is a member of the walnut family Juglandaceae.
Three varieties are commonly recognized [<a href="#25">25</a>]:

      Carya glabra var. glabra
      Carya glabra var. hirsuta (Ashe) Ashe
      Carya glabra var. megacarpa (Sarg.) Sarg.

The variety hirsuta, or alternately a fourth variety identified as Carya
glabra var. odorata (Marsh.) Little, is frequently considered synonymous
C. ovalis, red hickory [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  The taxonomic relationship between C.
glabra and C. ovalis is particularly difficult [<a href="#32">32</a>], and many
taxonomists prefer to treat these sympatric taxa as a complex [<a href="#51">51</a>].  A
few authorities delineate red hickory as a separate species, C. ovalis
(Wang.) Sarg. [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Principal differences are in the morphology of
husks or fruit; distinctions between the two entities become apparent
only during the fall [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  Many intermediates have been reported;
some authorities treat C. ovalis as an interspecific hybrid between C.
glabra and C. ovata [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].

C. leiodermis Sarg., swamp hickory, is now placed in synonymy with C.
glabra [<a href="#51">51</a>].  Pignut hickory hybridizes with butternut hickory (C.
cordiformis) [<a href="#54">54</a>].  Demaree hickory, C. X demareei Palmer, is a hybrid
product of pignut hickory and butternut hickory.

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carya glabra
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Pignut hickory grows from eastern Maine westward to southern Michigan,
Illinois, and southeastern Iowa [<a href="#17">17</a>].  It extends southward to eastern
Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, and eastward to central Florida [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].
It is common but not abundant throughout much of eastern North America
[<a href="#51">51</a>].  Pignut hickory reaches greatest abundance in the Ohio River Basin
and is the most common hickory of the Appalachian Mountains [<a href="#51">51</a>].  The
varieties glabra and megacarpa occur sympatrically throughout most of
eastern North America south to Louisiana; the variety hirsuta occurs
throughout much of the Southeast [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carya glabra
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Pignut hickory wood is heavy, hard, strong, tough, and elastic [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].
Early uses included broomhandles, skis, wagon wheels and, early
automobile parts [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  Sporting goods, agricultural implements, and
tool handles are made from the wood of pignut hickory [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].
Specialty products include shuttle blocks, mallets, and mauls [<a href="#51">51</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Browse:  White-tailed deer occasionally browse pignut hickory, and small
mammals may eat the leaves [<a href="#51">51</a>].

Nuts:  Pignut hickory nuts provide food for the fox squirrel in many
areas [<a href="#33">33</a>] and are preferred by the gray squirrel during fall and winter
in parts of New York [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Hickory nuts may comprise up to 10 to 25
percent of squirrel diets in some locations [<a href="#51">51</a>].  The eastern chipmunk
relies on hickory nuts for 5 to 10 percent of its diet [<a href="#51">51</a>].  Hickory
nuts are also eaten by the black bear, gray fox, raccoon, red squirrel,
pocket mouse, woodrat, and rabbits [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  Hickory nuts are utilized
by black bears at lower elevations in parts of New England during the
fall; the abundance of such mast crops can affect black bear
reproductive success during the following year [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Value to fur and
game mammals is good [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Hickory nuts are eaten by many birds including the woodduck, ring-necked
pheasant, northern bobwhite, wild turkey, common crow, bluejay,
white-breasted nuthatch, red-bellied woodpecker, and yellow-bellied
sapsucker [<a href="#37">37</a>].  The value of hickory nuts to upland game birds and
songbirds is fair [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Pignut hickory nuts are highly palatable; browse appears to be of low
palatability.


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Browse:  The nutrient content of pignut hickory browse varies
seasonally.  Mean foliar ash content has been reported as 12.75 percent
in the spring and 11.61 percent during the fall [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Nuts:  Pignut hickory nuts are high in protein and fats [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Crude fat
content may reach 70 to 80 percent in some species of hickory [<a href="#51">51</a>].
Nuts are moderate to low in phosphorus, and calcium and very low in
crude fiber [<a href="#51">51</a>].  The nuts provide a relatively low rate of energy
uptake for gray squirrels.


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Pignut hickory presumably provides cover for a variety of birds and
mammals.  Many hickories are used as den trees by several species of
squirrels [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Pignut hickory may have potential value for use on some types of
disturbed sites.  It recolonizes abandoned strip mines in Maryland and
West Virginia [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Pignut hickory can be readily propagated through seed.  Cleaned seed
averages 200 per pound (440/kg) [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Seed may be planted during the
fall or stratified and planted in the spring.  Pignut hickory is
difficult to transplant or to propagate by cuttings [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Nuts of pignut hickory are large and edible [401 and in some areas are
grown commercially, although they are of minor importance when compared
to shagbark hickory nuts [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Pignut hickory is used as a shade tree throughout much of its range
[<a href="#51">51</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Insects/disease:  Some diseases cause premature nut drop [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Insect
and disease damage may be particularly severe and can result in the
death of large tracts of timber during drought years [<a href="#51">51</a>].

Damage:  Pignut hickory is windfirm and resists ice damage.

Mechanical treatment:  Hickories commonly produce epicormic branches or
water sprouts after pruning [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Chemical control:  Pignut hickory is resistant to most herbicides [<a href="#39">39</a>],
but good results have been obtained with Garlon [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].

Silviculture:  Following timber harvest, most hickory regeneration
develops from advance regeneration [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Some advance regeneration may
be mechanically damaged during logging operations, but plants typically
sprout readily and many quickly overtop older residual stems.  New
sprouts generally grow rapidly and develop a straight bole and rapid
growth.  Sprouts are considered the most desirable hickory regeneration
in new stands.  Hickory regeneration following various types of timber
harvest was as follows in an Indiana oak-hickory stand [<a href="#48">48</a>]:

                        clearcut          shelterwood       med. partial
                        (percent of total regeneration)

new seedlings            2                 2                 2
adv. regeneration       30                77                73
new sprouts             56                21                24
stump sprouts           12                 0                 1

Average early (fifth year) height growth of hickories was greater in
clearcut (11.0 feet [3.4 m]) stands than in selection (2.0 feet [0.6 m])
or shelterwood (3.2 feet [1.0 m]) treatments.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carya glabra
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Pignut hickory is a slow-growing deciduous tree which reaches 65 to 98
feet (20-30 m) in height and 11 to 39 inches (30-100 cm) in diameter
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  On extremely favorable sites, individuals may reach 131
feet (40 m) in height [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Pignut hickory is characterized by a narrow
oblong crown and somewhat pendulous branches [<a href="#54">54</a>].  The gray bark is
shallowly ridged and furrowed [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Plants generally possess a
pronounced taproot but few laterals [<a href="#51">51</a>].

Pignut hickory is monoecious [<a href="#51">51</a>].  Pistillate flowers are borne in two-
to five-flowered spikes [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>], which develop on the shoots of the
current year [<a href="#51">51</a>].  Slender, staminate catkins averaging 2 to 3.1 inch
(5-8 cm) in length are borne from the axils of leaves on the previous
season or from the inner buds of terminal scales on the current year's
growth [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  The fruit of pignut hickory is a hard, pear-shaped
nut [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  The nut is thick-shelled and approximately 0.6 to 1.4
inches (1.5-3.5 cm) in length [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  The husk splits about halfway to
the base [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  The small kernel is sweet to bitter [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].

Characteristics which distinguish varieties of pignut hickory are as
follows [<a href="#54">54</a>]:

      var. megacarpa - larger leaves and fruit.
      var. hirsuta - obovoid fruit; lower leaflets; densely pubescent.
      var. glabra - usually five leaflets; husk indehiscent or splitting
                    to the middle.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (megaphanerophyte)
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (mesophanerophyte)
   Burned or Clipped State:  Chamaephyte
   Burned or Clipped State:  Hemicryptophyte
   Burned or Clipped State:  Cryptophyte (geophyte)


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Pignut hickory regenerates through seed and by vegetative means.

Seed:  Pignut hickory begins producing seed at approximately 30 years of
age; maximum seed production generally occurs between 75 and 200 years
of age [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  Maximum age of seed production is approximately 300
years [<a href="#51">51</a>].  Good seed crops occur at 1- or 2-year intervals, but may be
reduced by frost, insects, and seed-eating birds and mammals.  Seed is
dispersed by gravity and by birds and mammals [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].  Mammals such as
squirrels and chipmunks are typically more effective dispersal agents
than birds [<a href="#57">57</a>].

Germination:  Seeds of pignut hickory exhibit embryo dormancy that can
be broken by stratification at 33 to 40 degrees F (1-4 deg C) for 30 to
150 days [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Seeds rarely remain viable in the forest floor for more
than one winter [<a href="#51">51</a>].  Early seedling growth is typically slow.

Vegetative regeneration:  Pignut hickory sprouts from the root or stump
after plants are cut or top-killed by fire.  Smalley [<a href="#51">51</a>] reported that
sprouting "is not as prolific as in other deciduous tree species but
sprouts that are produced are vigorous and grow rapidly in height."
Sprouts may be killed by drought, frost, fire, or herbivory, but roots
often survive and sprout from dormant buds located near the root collar
or lower part of the stem [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Smaller diameter pignut hickories
typically sprout more frequently than do larger trees.  Sprouts that
originate at or below the ground level tend to be less subject to decay
than those that originate higher on the trees [<a href="#51">51</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Pignut hickory grows in mesic to xeric mixed woodlands, bottomland
woodlands, wet hammocks, on stable dunes, and rocky hillsides
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  It is a common component of southern mixed hardwood
forests, flatwoods, and eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana)
[<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  It is also common but rarely abundant in oak-hickory
forests [<a href="#51">51</a>].

Plant associates:  Various oaks, including post oak (Quercus stellata),
southern red oak (Q. falcata), black oak (Q. velutinus), northern red
oak, white oak, chestnut oak (Q. prinus), and blackjack oak (Q.
marilandica), are common overstory associates [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. Shortleaf pine
(Pinus echinata), loblolly pine (P. taeda), bald cypress (Taxodium
distichum), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and water tupelo (Nyssa
aquatica) also grow with pignut hickory [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Southern magnolia
(Magnolia grandiflora), cabbage palmetto (Sabal palmetto), and redbay
(Persea borbonia) are particularly common overstory associates in the
South [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>], whereas sugar maple (Acer saccharum), red maple (A.
rubrum), black birch (Betula lenta), and yellow birch (B.
alleghaniensis) frequently grow with pignut hickory in the northern
portion of its range [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].

Understory associates of pignut hickory are both numerous and diverse
and vary according to site and location [<a href="#51">51</a>].  In portions of the South,
flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum),
muscadine grape (Vitus rotundifolia), blueberries (Vaccinium spp.),
rhododendron (Rhododendron spp.), and common greenbrier (Smilax
rotundifolia) are common associates [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Climate:  Pignut hickory occurs in a humid climatic regime [<a href="#51">51</a>].

Soils:  Pignut hickory grows best on light, well-drained, loamy soils
[<a href="#41">41</a>].  Soil fertility is variable [<a href="#51">51</a>].  It occurs on soils derived from
a variety of metamorphic and sedimentary parent materials including
limestone, granitic-basic and mica schist-phyllite, glacial till, and
shale [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].

Elevation:  Generalized elevational ranges by geographic location are as
follows:

Elevation                     Location                Authority

> 2,952 feet (> 900 m)        s Appalachians          Duncan and Duncan 1988
< 2,500-3,000 feet (763-915 m)Great Smoky Mtns.       Whittaker 1954
up to 4,850 ft (1,480 m)      Great Smoky Mtns        Smalley 1991


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Pignut hickory is tolerant of shade in the Southeast, but relatively
intolerant in the northeastern portion of its range [<a href="#51">51</a>].  It grows as a
common codominant in climax communities of the North Carolina Plain [<a href="#43">43</a>]
and occurs in climax hammock communities of Florida [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  In parts
of Florida, early seral pine-oak-hickory forests are replaced by mature
oak-hickory stands [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Species such as southern magnolia, beech,
cabbage palmetto, and redbay may ultimately assume prominence, but
long-lived dominants such as pignut hickory commonly persist in climax
stands [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Pignut hickory grows in climax white oak-hickory forests of
southwestern Ohio, in old-growth oak-hickory forests of southern
Michigan, and in low-elevation climax stands in parts of the southern
Appalachians [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].

Heavy-seeded species such as pignut hickory are generally slow to invade
new areas [<a href="#18">18</a>].  However, pignut hickory, along with various oaks
(northern red oak, black oak, white oak), may replace early seral gray
birch (Betula populifolia)-eastern redcedar stands in oldfield
communitites of New York [<a href="#47">47</a>].  More shade-tolerant species such as red
maple (Acer rubrum) may ultimately replace oak and hickory.  In some
portions of the Appalachian Highlands, hickory may ultimately replace
chestnut killed by chestnut blight [<a href="#51">51</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Across most of its range, pignut hickory flowers in April or May [<a href="#2">2</a>].
Staminate flowers typically develop before the pistillate flowers [<a href="#51">51</a>].
Fruit ripens during September or October as the husk splits part way to
the base [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Seed dispersal occurs from September through December
[<a href="#51">51</a>].  Flowering and fruit ripening dates by geographic location are as
follows:

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carya glabra
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Periodic fires favor oaks over less fire-resistant species such as
hickories [<a href="#23">23</a>].  In the Northeast, reduced fire frequencies may have
resulted in the conversion of oak-hickory forests to mixed mesophytic
stands [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Fire suppression may have favored both hickories and beech
throughout much of the Southeast.  In the Great Smoky Mountains, fire
suppression since the 1940's has allowed pignut hickory to reach
fire-resistant sizes [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Pignut hickory commonly sprouts from the root crown or stem base after
aboveground foliage is killed by fire.  Seedling establishment may also
occur as birds and mammals transport seed from off-site.

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carya glabra
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Pignut hickory is readily damaged by fire [<a href="#51">51</a>], but the specific effects
of fire vary with topography, slope, aspect, and season of burn [<a href="#34">34</a>].
Seedlings are often top-killed by fire [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>], while larger trees with
thicker bark tend to be somewhat more resistant to fire.  Ward and
Stephens [<a href="#56">56</a>] reported that postfire mortality of hickory saplings was
much greater than for sawtimber.  Fires which occur when hickories are
dormant tend to be less damaging [<a href="#34">34</a>].

The tight, solid bark of hickories tends to be more severely scarred by
fire than the rough or corky bark of other species [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Once
fire-scarred, trees often succumb to rot or fungi.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Hickories often sprout from the base after plants are top-killed by fire
[<a href="#35">35</a>].  Seedlings commonly sprout from dormant buds located on the root
collar or lower part of the stem [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Postfire increases in stem
density have been reported, but recovery may be relatively slow [<a href="#56">56</a>].
Some seedling establishment may also occur.

Origin of postfire ingrowth was reported as follows after a late summer
wildfire in a mixed hardwood stand of Connecticut [<a href="#56">56</a>]:

                  sprout                  nonsprout
                  (# of sprouts per ha)

burned              4                       9
unburned          105                     162

Stems of sprout origin accounted for 31 percent of the total on unburned
sites and 39 percent on burned plots [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Postfire increases in stem
numbers are often described as "long-term."  Fifty-five years after a
summer wildfire, Ward and Stephens [<a href="#56">56</a>] reported greater "relative and
absolute levels" of hickories on burned than on unburned plots.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Wildlife considerations:  Scattered surviving hickories often develop
large crowns and produce good nut crops.  These trees may be
particularly valuable for wildlife [<a href="#35">35</a>].

Mortality:  Equations developed for black oak may be used to predict
fire-caused mortality in pignut hickory [<a href="#34">34</a>].
