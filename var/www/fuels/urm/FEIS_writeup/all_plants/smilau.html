<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Laurelleaf greenbrier grows along the Gulf and southeastern Atlantic
coastal plains of the United States.  Its range extends from central New
Jersey, south to southern Florida, and west to eastern Texas.  Inland,
its range extends north from the Gulf Coast to Arkansas, and west from
the Atlantic Coast to eastern Tennessee.  Laurelleaf greenbriar also
grows in Cuba and the Bahamas [<a href="#11">11</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Black bears and a variety of bird species feed on laurelleaf greenbrier
fruit; however, it was refused by captive marsh rabbits [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  The
pocosins and woodlands where laurelleaf greenbrier grows are important
to a variety of Southeastern wildlife including the white-tailed deer,
bobcat, gray squirrel, Eastern diamond-back rattlesnake, American
alligator, pine barrens tree frog, and the endangered red-cockaded
woodpecker [<a href="#23">23</a>].
  


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Laurelleaf greenbrier may be propagated by its tuberous rhizomes [<a href="#25">25</a>]
and once established, grows with unusual vigor [<a href="#19">19</a>].  It is potentially
valuable for rehabilitation prescriptions calling for quick
establishment of dense cover.


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
As a member of pocosin plant communities, laurelleaf greenbrier helps
provide essential habitat for the following endangered plants:  white
wickey (Kalmia cuneata), arrowleaf shieldwort (Peltandra sagittaefolia),
spring-flowering golden rod (Solidago verna), and rough-leaf loostrife
(Lysimachia asperulaefolia) [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Laurelleaf greenbrier is a silvicultural pest.  On cut-over sites it
inhibits southern white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides) regeneration by
climbing cedar seedlings and causing physical damage from the
accumulated weight of several vines [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Drainage and fire caused an
increase in laureleaf greenbrier in the Everglades Mariscus-Myrica-Ilex
type [<a href="#16">16</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Smilax laurifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Laurelleaf greenbrier is a monocotyledonous, woody vine native to the
southeastern United States.  Its stems are armed with abundant to
occasional, stout prickles.  It frequently climbs overstory vegetation.
Dead stems persist and help to form dense tangled thickets on sites
where laurelleaf greenbrier grows [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].

Underground, the stems of laurelleaf greenbrier form thick, heavy,
tuberous rhizomes.  The rhizomes have reddish surfaces and are massive.
They support vigorous sprouts, capable of averaging 2.5 inches (7 cm)
of growth per day during the growing season [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].

Laurelleaf greenbrier leaves are evergreen, rounded, and leathery.
Short, twisted petioles hold the leaves erect from the stems.
Laurelleaf greenbrier flowers are small regular and borne in axillary
umbels. The fruit is a berry which is shiney-black at maturity.  The
fruits ripen the second season after fruit-set and often persist into or
through their second winter.  Berry production is prodigious
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Laureleaf greenbrier regenerates vegetatively by sprouting from its
tuberous rhizomes [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  It also regenerates sexually although the
details have not been described.  The nature of the fruit, its use by
wildlife (see IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE), and records of
seedling germination in black bear scat [<a href="#3">3</a>] indicate that the seeds are
dispersed by animals.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Laurelleaf greenbrier grows in shrub-tree bogs, cypress (Taxodium
spp.)-gum (Nyssa spp.) depressions, along marshy stream banks [<a href="#11">11</a>], and
in Louisiana pitcher-plant (Sarracenia spp.) bogs [<a href="#1">1</a>].  It is abundant
in all age classes in cypress heads, especially along the margins [<a href="#21">21</a>];
and is a dominant in pocosin communities [<a href="#23">23</a>].  In Everglades National
Park, laurelleaf greenbrier is common in hammock understories and
occasional in sawgrass (Cladium spp.) swamps [<a href="#7">7</a>].  It is characteristic
of Okefenokee Swamp understories [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>], and is common on burned or open
areas in the Great Dismal Swamp [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>], and mesic sites in North
Carolina's Green Swamp [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Typical laurelleaf greenbrier soils are mucky, peaty, acidic organics
(Histosols).  They are often poorly drained [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Water regimes are
saturated; sites are frequently or seasonally flooded [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Laurelleaf greenbrier is "almost always present on pond pine (Pinus
serotina) sites" [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Other common overstory associates include
cypress, swamp blackgum (N. sylvatica), white bay (Magnolia virginiana),
loblolly bay (Gordonia lasianthus), sweet bay (Persea borbonia), red
maple (Acer rubrum), Cassena (Ilex cassine), titi (Cyrilla racemiflora),
and southern white cedar [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Understory associates include
hurrahbush (Lyonia lucida), leucothoe (Leucothoe racemosa) sweetspire
(Itea virginica), poor-man's soap (Clethra alnifolia), coral greenbrier
(S. walteri), and honeycup (Zenobia pulverulenta) [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Laurelleaf greenbrier is an early-seral species in the successional
trend toward mature lowland forests and is a severe competitor of tree
seedlings [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Although a common understory species, laurelleaf
greenbier apparently grows better in full sunlight.  Overstory removal
releases it to form dense thickets [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Laurelleaf greenbrier shows its most pronounced growth between April and
June [<a href="#19">19</a>].  It flowers between July and August [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>] and its berries
ripen during August and September of their second growing season [<a href="#25">25</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Smilax laurifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Laurelleaf greenbier probably survives fire by sprouting from persistant
rhizomes.  Animal-assisted seed dispersal and seedling establishment are
probably of secondary importance.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Smilax laurifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Most fires probably top-kill laurelleaf greenbrier.  Presumably, its
rhizomes may be killed by fires severe enough to consume or sufficiently
heat the soil's organic layer.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Laurelleaf greenbrier's well-developed rhizomes, capacity for vigorous
growth [<a href="#19">19</a>], and early seral nature [<a href="#3">3</a>] suggest that it responds to fire
with quick and vigorous sprouting.  It was among the first to flower
after a fire in a North Carolina pine-wiregrass (Aristida spp.) type
[<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Heat values of fuels are basic to predicting the potential heat released
during a fire.  Laurelleaf greenbrier foliage yeilds 227,000 calories
per pound (5,000 cal/g) and is 2.9 percent ash [<a href="#12">12</a>].
