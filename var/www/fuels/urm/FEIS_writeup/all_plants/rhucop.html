<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name for flameleaf sumac is Rhus
copallinum L. [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Varieties:  The typical variety, R. copallinum L.
var. copallinum, is generally replaced in central Texas by the prairie
flame-leaf sumac, R.  copallinum L. var. lanceolate Gray, which has
narrower and more falcate leaves, larger clusters of fruit, and a more
treelike rounded form.  White flame-leaf sumac or southern sumac, R.
copallinum L. var. leucantha (Jacq.) DC., is a variety with white flowers
found near New Braunfels, Texas.  Winged sumac or dwarf sumac, R.
copallinum L. var. latifolia Engl. is a variety with 5 to 13 broader
oblong to narrow-ovate leaflets, but some authors have relegated it to
the status of a synonym of the species [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  This paper focuses on
the typical variety.

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rhus copallinum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Flameleaf sumac is considered a poor to moderately important browse for
white-tailed deer [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  In the Ozark Mountains of Missouri, the twigs
are browsed extensively by white-tailed deer during the winter months
when other more desirable browse is scarce [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Mature berries of
flameleaf sumac are eaten by grouse, wild turkey, and songbirds [20,
37].  The bark and twigs are eaten by rabbits, especially during the
winter months [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The seeds and fruits of flameleaf sumac are generally low in crude
protein, crude fat, and calcium but high in tannin [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The thickets of flameleaf sumac provide environmental protection for a
variety of birds and mammals throughout its range [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Flameleaf sumac is tolerant to drought conditions.  In a study conducted
on the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway in Tennessee, flameleaf sumac
showed the greatest and most consistent increase of any shrub during
the drought of 1987 [<a href="#17">17</a>]. 

Flameleaf sumac can be propagated by seed or by root cuttings [<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The bark and leaves of flameleaf sumac contain tannin and are used in
the tanning industry.  The crushed fruit of this species was added to
drinking water by Native Americans to make it more palatable [<a href="#40">40</a>].

Because of the attractive colorful features of the leaves and flowers,
flameleaf sumac is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Flameleaf sumac often competes with pine and other hardwoods [<a href="#4">4</a>].
Streamline basal application of the herbicide Garlon 4 has been reported
as having a greater than 80 percent average control of flameleaf sumac
in northern Georgia and eastern Alabama [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Flameleaf sumac is sensitive to ozone damage [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rhus copallinum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Flameleaf sumac is a deciduous, fast-growing, short-lived, clonal shrub
to small tree reaching heights of 20 to 30 feet (6-10 m) [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  In
the open, the plant has an irregular, bushy crown with long slender,
alternate leaves on the branches.  The dioecious flowers are borne in
panicles clustered at the end of the branches.  The red fruit is a small
drupe containing a single nutlet.  The fruits form dense clusters and
remain on the plant through the winter [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Flameleaf sumac regenerates vegetatively by sprouting from the roots and
root crown [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  It also regenerates sexually, but details have not
been described [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  The seeds are dispersed by animals [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Flameleaf sumac can be found in open woodlands, fields, and along fence
rows but grows best on low bottomlands with well-drained, neutral to
slightly acidic soils [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  It can also be found on poorly
drained soils, but its growth there is very slow.

Common associates of flameleaf sumac include sweetgum (Liquidambar
styraciflua), American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), persimmon
(Diospyros virginiana), redbay (Persea borbonia), dwarf huckleberry
(Gaylussacia dumosa), wax-myrtle (Myrica cerifera), fetterbush (Lyonia
lucida), blueberry (Vaccinium spp.), and titi (Cyrilla racemiflora)
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Flameleaf sumac is an early-pioneer species that grows best in full
sunlight [<a href="#36">36</a>].  It is considered a fire climax species that rapidly
declines 3 to 4 years following fire [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Flameleaf sumac shows its most pronounced growth between April and May.
It flowers between July and August.  The fruit ripens during September
and October, and persists through the winter [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rhus copallinum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Flameleaf sumac is well adapted to fire.  Fire enhances germination of
the plant by scarifying the seed [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Following top-kill by fire,
flameleaf sumac will sprout from the root crown [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Birds and mammals
may transport some seed to burned sites.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by animals or water; postfire yr 1&2
   secondary colonizer; on-site germinating seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rhus copallinum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire generally kills aboveground portions of the plant.



<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Fire stimulates root and root collar sprouting of flameleaf sumac when
aboveground portions are killed [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Flameleaf sumac shows dramatic
increases in stem production following fire [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  The plant
increased from 50 to 88 percent of the total plant density on annual
burned plots in an oak forest in eastern Tennessee [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fire exclusion greatly reduces density and cover of flameleaf sumac
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].
