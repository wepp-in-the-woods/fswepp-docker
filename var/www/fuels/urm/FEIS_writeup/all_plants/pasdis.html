<b>ABBREVIATION : </b>
PASDIS

<b>SYNONYMS : </b>
   Paspalum vaginatum Sw.
   Paspalum paspalodes (Michx.) Scribn.


<b>SCS PLANT CODE : </b>
   PADI6
   PAVA


<b>COMMON NAMES : </b>
   knotgrass

   salt jointgrass
   turfgrass


<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currrently accepted scientific name for knotgrass is Paspalum
distichum L. (Gramineae) [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Although many authorities distinguish the
closely related species P. vaginatum, Godfrey and Wooten [<a href="#11">11</a>] consider
this distinction unwarranted.  Paspalum vaginatum and P. distichum will
be treated as a single species for the purpose of this report.

Knotgrass is common throughout the southeastern states; it occurs as far
north as Massachusetts and south into Mexico and South America.  It is
also narrowly distributed throughout the Southwest and continues north
through California to coastal Oregon and Washington, and central Idaho
[<a href="#9">9</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Paspalum distichum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Knotgrass is a valuable duck food in the marshes of Louisiana [<a href="#3">3</a>].  It
is also considered a good forage grass in Arizona [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Knotgrass is sometimes used to revegetate eroded marshes in Louisiana
[<a href="#14">14</a>].  It is also used to rehabilitate overgrazed ranges in Arizona.
Results of this project have not yet been released [<a href="#22">22</a>].  In germination
tests, seeds were incubated at 82 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit (28-35 deg
C).  Fourteen percent germinated in the dark, while 40 percent
germinated with 16 hours of light.  Ripening can be sped up with dry
storage at 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 deg C).  Scarification with acid
can increase germination [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Knotgrass increases in response to grazing [<a href="#3">3</a>].  It is useful as a soil
binder along streams but can sometimes be troublesome, as it chokes out
irrigation ditches [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Paspalum distichum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Knotgrass is a native, perennial, rhizomatous graminoid [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Its culms
are 7 to 20 inches (0.2-0.6 m) high and are sometimes pubescent [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].
Usually two racemes are found at the end of the stem.  Leaf blades are
flat and from 2 to 6 inches (5-15 cm) long.  Rhizomes form dense,
extensive mats [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Regeneration occurs mostly from the spreading and sprouting of rhizomes.
Creeping stems root at the nodes and give rise to flowering stems [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Knotgrass is found along fresh and brackish marshes, coastal salt
marshes, ponds, ditches, shorelines, beaches, and dunes; and in
freshwater wetlands of the semiarid grasslands of the Southwest
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Some associates include sea purslane (Sesuvium
portulacastrum), beach dropseed (Sporobolus virginicus), Mexican beach
peanut (Okenia hypogaea), railroad vine (Ipomoea pes-caprae), sea
lavender (Argusia gnaphalodes), beachberry (Scaevola plumieri), bay
cedar (Suriana maritima), cordgrass (Spartina spp.), muhly grass
(Muhlenbergia spp.), sedge (Carex spp.), horsetail (Equisetum spp.),
spikerush (Eleocharis spp.), rush (Juncus spp.), Olney bulrush (Scirpus
olneyi), slender wheatgrass (Elymus trachycaulus ssp. trachycaulus), and
johnsongrass (Sorghum halpense) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Knotgrass replaces marshbay cordgrass (Spartina patens) and Olney
bulrush in Gulf Coast marshes where grazing has reduced these species.
Knotgrass is then replaced by "annuals and unpalatable forbs" [<a href="#1">1</a>].
Along the southern Florida coast south of Cape Canaveral, knotgrass
along with pink-flowered railroad vine may recolonize the upper beach
from the foredune after storm erosion [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Knotgrass flowers and produces fruit between June and November [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Paspalum distichum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Rhizomes generally enable knotgrass to survive fire.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Paspalum distichum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire probably topkills knotgrass.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Knotgrass sprouts from rhizomes following fire [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Prescribed fires were conducted annually in northern Florida on sites
where Paspalum species were present in the understory.  Some plots were
burned annually, some every second winter, some every third, some every
fourth, etc. through 12 winters.  Annual and biennial burning maintained
the highest grass covers; cover declined sharply starting with fires
every third year [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fire can be used to reduce litter and increase plant vigor and
production in grasses.  Fire can also be used to maintain open
grasslands by preventing establishment of woody vegetation [<a href="#21">21</a>].
