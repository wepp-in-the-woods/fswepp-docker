<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Richardson needlegrass is found in intermontane valley grasslands and
meadows [<a href="#24">24</a>].  It is also common in bottomlands, on rocky or wooded
slopes, and on hillsides in mature pine (Pinus spp.) forests [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].
In British Columbia, Richardson needlegrass commonly occurs on warm, dry
sites scattered througout major valleys of the sub-boreal zone [<a href="#25">25</a>].

Published classifications describing Richardson needlegrass as a
codominant in community types are listed below:

Grasslands of the North Fork Valley, Glacier National Park, Montana [<a href="#16">16</a>].
Fescue grasslands of western Canada [<a href="#19">19</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Achnatherum richardsonii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Richardson needlegrass is an important forage species for livestock on
the northern Great Plains [<a href="#15">15</a>].  It is also utilized by deer, bighorn
sheep, and elk [<a href="#7">7</a>].  At lower elevations in western Montana, cattle
graze Richardson needlegrass from late spring until early fall.  At
higher elevations, grazing is limited to the summer months [<a href="#7">7</a>].
Needlegrasses (Achnatherum spp.) rank high as forage grasses on the western
ranges because of their abundance, wide distribution, long growing
period, and capacity to cure well on the ground [<a href="#32">32</a>].

At maturity, the long, sharp awns of needlegrasses become dangerous to
grazing animals and can cause injuries to the eyes, ears, and skin [<a href="#32">32</a>].
Reports of livestock injuries caused by Richardson needlegrass, however,
are not documented in the available literature.
  


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability of Richardson needlegrass varies with phenological
development.  Palatability is highest in the spring and early summer
when plants are young and succulent.  Richardson needlegrass is less
palatable at maturity, when it becomes coarse and wiry [<a href="#31">31</a>].  In
Montana, the palatability of Richardson needlegrass is rated as fair for
deer, fair to good for elk, and good for sheep and cattle [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The nutritional value of Richardson needlegrass during five major stages
of growth are as follows (values are percentage of dry weight with the
exception of carotene which is in mg/kg) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>]:

<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fescue (Festuca spp.) grasslands are an important grazing resource in
much of the West, and Richardson needlegrass is an important component
of these grasslands.  Richardson needlegrass decreases with overgrazing
[<a href="#19">19</a>].  On lightly to moderately disturbed sites, Richardson needlegrass
increases.  On more severely disturbed sites, Richardson needlegrass
decreases.  Richardson needlegrass increases on moist disturbed sites
[<a href="#19">19</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Achnatherum richardsonii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Richardson needlegrass is a native, perennial, cool-season bunchgrass.
This fine-stemmed, tufted grass grows from 16 to 40 inches (40-100 cm)
tall [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  The inflorescence is open and diffuse [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Culms are
glabrous or slightly hairy.  Blades are typically involute and
subfiliform and reach heights of about 6 to 10 inches (15-25 cm) [<a href="#14">14</a>].
The seeds of Richardson needlegrass are hard, slender, and cylindrical,
and have a sharp, pointed base (callus) and long, twisted awns [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Richardson needlegrass is a shallow-rooted species; the abundance of
roots decreases as soil depth increases.  Clay accumulation restricts
root penetration of Richardson needlegrass [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Richardson needlegrass
becomes dormant following depletion of surface soil moisture during the
latter part of the growing season [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Richardson needlegrass reproduces sexually.  The twisted awns of the
seeds expand and contract with variations in temperature and moisture,
drilling them into the soil [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  Strong winds may transport seeds a
considerable distance, especially when awns are twisted together in
clumps.  Animals also carry seeds as the awns become trapped in their
fur [<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Richardson needlegrass is common on hillsides and dry plains, in open
grassland or sagebrush benches, and in bottomlands, swales, and wooded
slopes [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].  It is also found on moraines and gravel outwash
associated with streams [<a href="#3">3</a>].  In Montana, Richardson needlegrass is
found on mountain slopes on both sides of the Continental Divide at
elevations of 3,000 to 7,000 feet (900-2,100 m) [<a href="#21">21</a>].  In north-central
Colorado, it is found in mesic sites at 8,000 to 8,600 feet (2,400-2,580
m) [<a href="#13">13</a>].  In Wyoming, Richardson needlegrass is commonly found at
elevations of 7,000 to 8,500 feet (2,134-2,591 m) and occasionally at
elevations of 9,000 feet (2,743 m) [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Soils:  Richardson needlegrass is common on slightly acidic to neutral
soil (pH 6.6-7.3) [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Soil textures vary from fine sandy loam to
clayey loam.  Cation exchange capacity is moderately high, but soils are
considered of low fertility because of low levels of nitrogen and
phosphorus [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Climax Species

Richardson needlegrass is a climax codominant on sites in Glacier
National Park and on fescue grasslands of western Canada [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  It
occurs in the rough fescue prairie association, a climax community type.
However, the equilibrium between prairie and associated forest
vegetation is not always clear.  Woody species such as willows (Salix
spp.) and poplars (Populus spp.) are tending to invade the fescue
prairie of Alberta, though the effects of fire, mowing, and limited
grazing may serve to counteract this tendency.  It has been suggested
that white spruce (Picea glauca) may be considered as the theoretical
climax for much of the fescue grassland or black soil region of Alberta;
however, natural burning tends to prevent this cimax from being realized
[<a href="#39">39</a>].
 


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Most needlegrasses begin vegetative growth in the early spring, usually
before associated grasses green up, and continue growing throughout the
summer if enough moisture is available [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Needlegrasses flower
from July to September [<a href="#31">31</a>].  No specific information on the seasonal
development of Richardson needlegrass was found.

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Achnatherum richardsonii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Perennial needlegrasses are among the least fire resistant of the
bunchgrasses [<a href="#35">35</a>].  No specific information on adaptations of Richardson
needlegrass to fire was found.

Season of burn and plant size contribute to needlegrasses' ability to
survive fire.  Needlegrasses tend to be more susceptible to fire when
burned during midsummer.  Plants with smaller crown diameters more often
survive fire than do larger plants.  Successive years' accumulation of
dead culm and leaves make older needlegrasses highly susceptible to
burning.  Needlegrasses may often survive low-intensity fires, as heat
is not transferred below the soil surface [<a href="#37">37</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Achnatherum richardsonii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Specific fire effects probably depend largely on season of burn,
phenology, and fire intensity and severity.  Generally, needlegrasses
(Achnatherum spp.) are top-killed by fire.  Occasionally, a few culms may
survive along the periphery of the crown.  When fire severity is
moderate to high, heat may be transferred below the soil surface,
damaging roots and killing the plant.  Needlegrasses often exhibit
subsurface charring following fire [<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Production of most needlegrasses is initially reduced by fire; the
degree of reduction appears dependent on species and season of burn
[<a href="#11">11</a>].  In southwestern Montana, however, production of Richardson
needlegrass in a rough fescue habitat type with a heavy preburn canopy
of mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata var. vaseyana) increased
from 4 pounds per acre (1.8 kg/ha) to 306 pounds per acre (137.7 kg/ha)
2 years after a spring prescribed fire.  Basal area and biomass of most
needlegrasses are also often reduced following fire, with basal area
commonly being reduced by as much as 50 percent [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Small needlegrass
plants with a lower ratio of dead to living plant material and less fuel
volume generally respond more favorably to fire than do larger plants
[<a href="#37">37</a>].  Richardson needlegrass is nonrhizomatous; therefore postfire
regeneration is through seed or sprouting by surviving plants [<a href="#10">10</a>].
 


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Elimination of large scale fires has enabled coniferous forests to
encroach into grassland habitats.  Fire policy in Glacier National
Park before 1972 favored the development of coniferous forests at the
expense of fescue grasslands [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Fire policies should assure the
preservation of vegetation types such as the fescue grassland, of which
Richardson needlegrass is an important component [<a href="#16">16</a>].
