<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of Arizona white oak is Quercus
arizonica Sarg.  It is a member of the oak family (Fagaceae) [<a href="#34">34</a>].  No
infrataxa are recognized.  Where distributions overlap, Arizona white
oak hybridizes with gray oak (Q. grisea), Gambel oak (Q. gambelii), and
Mohr shin oak (Q. mohriana) [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Arizona white oak is found in diverse communities along elevation or
moisture gradients from savannas, semidesert grasslands, and interior
chaparral [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>] to Madrean evergreen woodland and pine-oak (Pinus
spp.-Quercus spp.) communities [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Arizona white oak is codominant
with Emory oak (Q. emoryi) and gray oak in the encinal mixed woodland
series and Madrean evergreen woodland series [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Arizona
white oak habitat series occur in savannas of New Mexico [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Arizona
white oak is an indicator species in dry Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
menziesii), Chihuahua pine (Pinus leiophylla var. chihuahuana),
ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa), and Apache pine (P. engelmanii) habitat
and community types [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>].  Arizona white oak is dominant or
codominant in open and closed-canopy pinyon-juniper (Juniperus spp.)
woodlands [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  Occasionally, Arizona white oak is an important
understory species in pinyon-juniper stands [<a href="#58">58</a>] and Mexican pinyon (P.
cembroides) forests [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Isolated Arizona white oak occur infrequently
in riparian woodland associations, such as Arizona walnut (Juglans
major) and Arizona sycamore (Platanus wrightii) community types with
permanent or semipermanent streams [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>].  Arizona white oak
occurs on edges of interior chaparral of Arizona in communities such as
the Arizona white oak-yellowleaf silktassel (Garrya flavescens)-Emory
oak association [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>].  Some of the publications in which
Arizona white oak is listed as a dominant or indicator species are:

(1)  Forest and woodland habitat types (plant associations) of Arizona
       south of the Mogollon Rim and southwestern New Mexico [<a href="#3">3</a>]
(2)  Forest habitat types south of the Mogollon Rim, Arizona and New
       Mexico [<a href="#18">18</a>]

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus arizonica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Arizona white oak is used for fuel and infrequently for furniture
[<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  The wood is close grained, heavy, hard, and strong [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].
Trees are seldom straight enough or large enough to be of commercial
value [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Arizona white oak acorns are consumed by cattle and wildlife [<a href="#32">32</a>];
however, acorns of other species are used in preference to Arizona white
oak acorns [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Arizona white oak acorns comprised 2 percent of the
food volume in white-tailed deer stomach contents collected in late fall
in south-central Arizona [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Arizona white oak was one of the most
common trees browsed by white-tailed deer in oak-grasslands and mountain
foothills of Arizona [<a href="#67">67</a>].  In southeastern Arizona, Arizona white oak
is used extensively by neomigratory birds for foraging during the
breeding season [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Diverse amphibians, reptiles, and mammals have
been recorded in the woodland communites where Arizona white oak occurs
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Arizona white oak is highly palatable to white-tailed and mule deer in
all seasons [<a href="#79">79</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Young Arizona white oak twigs and leaves are rated as poor forage for
wildlife [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
White-tailed deer utilize mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus spp.)-
pinyon-Arizona white oak habitats for cover [<a href="#67">67</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
No direct reference to Arizona white oak acorn consumption by humans was
found in the literature.  Arizona white oak belongs to the white oak
subgenus (Lepidobalanus).  Edible acorns are a characteristic of the
group [<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Arizona white oak stands have been managed under pinyon-juniper
silvicultural systems [<a href="#28">28</a>].  On a fuelwood management area in the
Huachuca Mountains of Arizona, three areas in oak woodland were cut at
different times and intensities to assess harvest effects.  Arizona
white oak was codominant with Emory oak.  Harvest at two intensities (50
and 80%) occurred 7, 15, and 20 years prior to assessment.  Structural
changes to the overstory, such as trees being shrublike due to prolific
stump sprouting, still persisted after 20 years [<a href="#65">65</a>].

Volume equations are available for estimating biomass of Arizona white
oak [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Volume, growth, and mortality estimates and simulation
models of the oak woodlands that include Arizona white oak are discussed
in the literature [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Multivariate equations are available for
predicting Arizona white oak regeneration after harvest [<a href="#50">50</a>].

Cattle graze on most of the Arizona encinal woodlands where Arizona
white oak occurs [<a href="#47">47</a>].  Preferential grazing may favor Arizona white oak
establishment [<a href="#49">49</a>].  However, poor oak recruitment during the late
1960's in Arizona was attributed to the effects of livestock grazing and
summer drought [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Current recruitment was not found in the
literature.  Burning and subsequent treatment with herbicides prevented
Arizona white oak from establishing in a game management area on the
Tonto National Forest in Arizona [<a href="#72">72</a>].

Szaro and King [<a href="#74">74</a>] developed sampling methods for classification
of the Arizona riparian plant communities in which Arizona white oak
occurs.

Arizona white oak is susceptible to the wood decay fungus, Inonotus
andersonii [<a href="#23">23</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus arizonica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Arizona white oak is a native shrub or medium-sized tree [<a href="#21">21</a>].  As a
tree, it reaches up to 60 feet (18 m) tall with a diameter up to 3.3
feet (1 m) and has an irregularly spreading crown with stout branches
[<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].  The bark on older trees may be up to 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick
[<a href="#21">21</a>].  The thick leaves are evergreen or nearly evergreen and about 3.2
inches (8 cm) long [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  Pistillate catkins have two to six
flowers.  The solitary or paired acorns are 0.3 to 0.8 inch (0.8-2 cm)
long [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Mature Arizona white oak grows slowly, averaging about 0.1 inch per year
(0.24 cm/yr) in diameter; seedlings also grow slowly [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  Once
topgrowth is removed, Arizona white oak stumps sprout.  In southeastern
Arizona following top removal by cutting, Arizona white oak regeneration
consisted primarily of stump sprouts with low seedling survival [<a href="#65">65</a>].
Following harvest of oak woodlands in southern Arizona, a higher
percentage of Arizona white oak stumps than Emory oak stumps failed to
sprout.  Arizona white oak sprouts also grew more slowly than Emory oak
sprouts [<a href="#50">50</a>].
  
Acorn production in Arizona white oak is highly variable.  Large acorn
crops, up to 32,600 acorns per tree, alternate with several years of low
acorn production [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  Arizona white oak can lose 1 to 65 percent of
acorns produced to vertebrates and 1 to 50 percent to invertebrates
[<a href="#49">49</a>].  While postdispersal acorn loss from the soil surface can be high,
68 percent of the acorns escaped predation in a 1978 Arizona oak
woodlands study.  Arizona white oak acorns had 17 to 73 percent
germination during a study in Arizona.  The acorns have no dormancy.
Most Arizona white oak acorn germination occurs within 30 days of
dropping off of the tree; the acorns are viable for about 60 days.
Germination of Arizona white oak acorns is strongly positively
correlated with moisture during the rainy season [<a href="#56">56</a>].  During field
trials, germination of the acorns at 3 or 6 inches (7.5-15 cm) below the
soil surface (73%) exceeded germination rates on the litter or soil
surface (17%) [<a href="#56">56</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Arizona white oak is widespread and occurs in arroyos, canyons,
foothills, bajadas, and on rocky slopes [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>].  It occurs on flat
benches and ridges or steep sideslopes with westerly to northerly
exposures [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>].  Arizona white oak is found from 3,445 to 7,218
feet (1,050-2,200 m) in elevation [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>].

Arizona white oak occurs in semiarid to arid climates with a bimodal
precipitation regime, mild winters, and hot summers [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Soils
may be shallow to deep and moderate to very fine textured, consisting of
old alluvium from mixed sedimentary, igneous, or granitic rocks
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>].  Rock cover may be more than 15 percent [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Soils also
may be cobbly loams that are deep and well-drained with low
water-holding capacity [<a href="#56">56</a>].

Arizona white oak sites are often low in productivity due to semiarid
climate and shallow, rocky, or poorly developed soils.  Arizona white
oak frequency varies within oak woodlands.  In oak woodlands of Arizona,
Arizona white oak increase from 10 percent frequency at about 5,000 feet
(1,524 m) elevation to 45 percent frequency at about 6,000 feet (1,829
m).  It decreases in frequency above 6,562 feet (2,000 m) [<a href="#49">49</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Arizona white oak is a seral species or climax understory species in
pinyon-juniper woodlands and pine-oak forests [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  Following
cabling or fire in pinyon-juniper woodlands, Arizona white oak and other
oaks begin to establish after about 4 years, during the grass and forb
stages [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  Arizona white oak is a climax species in Madrean
evergreen oak and encinal woodlands.  It is a minor climax species in
Chihuahuan pine forests [<a href="#38">38</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Arizona white oak flowers as new leaves emerge.  Acorns mature during
the fall (September to November) of the same year [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].  Leaves
may drop in late winter or just before new leaves emerge in the spring
[<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus arizonica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Arizona white oak sprouts from the root crown or stump following fire
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

Madrean evergreen forests and woodlands are usually bordered by desert
grassland below and coniferous forest above [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Historically, fires
probably occurred every 10 to 20 years in oak woodlands adjacent to
semidesert grasslands [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>].  Mean fire return intervals for pine
communities above oak woodlands have been estimated at every 7 years
[<a href="#49">49</a>].  Historical fires in oak-pine woodlands in the Chiricahua National
Monument in Arizona occurred every 1 to 38 years [<a href="#71">71</a>].  In Arizona, low-
intensity surface fires occurred very frequently in a ponderosa
pine/Arizona white oak habitat type; fire scars formed in 67 of the
years between 1770 and 1870 [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>].  Burned ponderosa pine snags in
evergreen oak woodlands in Arizona suggest localized severe fires [<a href="#55">55</a>].

Fire regimes have been estimated for different oak cover types.  Mexican
(Madrean) oak-pine woodland is probably a fire tolerant, fire-maintained
community.  

Arizona white oak is common at higher elevations than Emory oak in open
oak woodlands.  Fire frequency is important in determining the structure
of these communities.

Interior chaparral is scattered throughout the oak-pine woodlands [<a href="#70">70</a>].
Arizona white oak replaces pringle manzanita (Arctostaphylos pringlei)
in interior chaparral stands that have not recently burned [<a href="#57">57</a>].
Arizona white oak and Emory oak dominate many communities that have not
burned at least since 1910 [<a href="#13">13</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus arizonica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Small (1 to 3 inches [2.5-7.5 cm]) Arizona white oak are top-killed by
fire.  Large-sized trees usually survive fires of low severity [<a href="#7">7</a>].
Arizona white oak foliage is highly flammable [<a href="#64">64</a>].  Surviving stumps
sprout vigorously [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  The acorns probably are killed by fire.
Acorns covered by an insulating layer of soil may survive low-severity
fires.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Fires move quickly through oak woodlands that have a continuous grass
understory.  Arizona white oak root crowns are usually not damaged by
these fires [<a href="#4">4</a>].  In a Madrean evergreen woodland in Arizona with an
understory of grasses and herbs, a prescribed fire burned cool and was
of short duration.  Scattered mature Arizona white oak were unaffected
by the fire.  Arizona white oak and other oak seedling densities did not
differ between burned sites and controls during the first 2 postfire
seasons [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].  In Box Canyon of the Santa Rita Mountains in Arizona, a
person-caused fire in 1959 moved rapidly over dry grasses in a
droughtstressed oak-juniper woodland.  Drought stress may have
influenced tree response.  In diameter classes from 1 to 9 inches
(2.5-23 cm), 13 percent of Arizona white oak died on the burned sites,
while only 5 percent died on the controls [<a href="#33">33</a>].



<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Arizona white oak foliage can be ignited by low-intensity fires with
flame lengths up to 2 feet (6.7 m).  It should be included in fuel
moisture sampling programs.  In the Chiricahua National Monument,
Arizona, where Arizona white oak can make up a significant portion of
the understory fuels, Arizona white oak sampled on 10 and 11 November
1987 had a mean moisture content of 121 percent.  Live fuel moisture
sampling methods are discussed in the literature [<a href="#64">64</a>].

Broadcast understory burning in southwestern ponderosa pine forests,
where shrubby Arizona white oak and silverleaf oak (Q. hypoleucoides)
occurred, reduced the threat of severe crown fires [<a href="#29">29</a>].

The open oak woodland can carry fire.  Oaks usually survive the quick,
low intensity fires of open oak woodlands.  However, modern fires in
closed-canopy oak woodlands are more likely to be high-intensity, stand
replacement fires [<a href="#49">49</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE CASE STUDIES</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus arizonica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>CASE NAME : </b>
Lyle Canyon Prescribed Fire, Arizona (Arizona white oak)


<b>REFERENCE : </b>
Bock, J. H.; Bock, C. E. 1987 [<a href="#8">8</a>]


<b>SEASON/SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION : </b>
spring fire/low- to moderate-severity


<b>STUDY LOCATION : </b>
The study was conducted at the National Audubon Appleton-Whittel
Research Sanctuary in foothills on the west side of the Huachuca
Mountains of Arizona.  The research focused on two areas:  a grassland
and a Madrean evergreen woodland.  This case study presents only the
Madrean evergreen woodland results since Arizona white oak did not occur
in the grassland.  Study plots were located in Lyle Canyon, which is
leased by the Sanctuary from the Coronado National Forest.


<b>PREFIRE VEGETATIVE COMMUNITY : </b>
Lyle Canyon is covered by a Madrean evergreen oak woodland.  The
overstory consisted of Arizona white oak and Emory oak.  The burn
treatment study plots had a total of 15 Arizona white oak and 20 Emory
oak; control plots had a total of 10 Arizona white oak and 20 Emory oak.
Common understory shrubs were wait-a-minute bush (Mimosa biuncifera),
velvet-pod mimosa (M. dysocarpa), and yerba de pasmo (Baccharis
pteronioides).  Grasses and forbs most commonly present were sideoats
grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), plains lovegrass (Eragrostis
intermedia), annual goldeneye (Viguiera annua), and Arizona poppy
(Kallstroemia parviflora).


<b>TARGET SPECIES PHENOLOGICAL STATE : </b>
Phenological stages of plants were not specifically mentioned.  At the
time of burning in May, Arizona white oak would be past flowering, and
fruits would be developing.


<b>SITE DESCRIPTION : </b>
The study site was located in a steep-sided canyon at 4,922 feet (1,500
m) elevation.  Spring months are dry and warm in the semiarid climate.
The average annual precipitation is 16.9 inches (430 mm) and occurs
bimodally.  No information was given on specific topography, slope, or
soils.


<b>FIRE DESCRIPTION : </b>
A total of 10 plots, 65.6 by 98.4 feet (20x30 m), were assigned either
to burn or control treatments.  Plots were paired for physiognomy and
vegetation.  Twenty quadrats, 7.9 by 19.7 inches (20x50 cm), were
located in each plot for a total of 200 quadrats.  The fire burned
between 10 a.m. and 12 m. on 25 May 1984.  Air temperature was from 90
to 92 degrees Fahrenheit (32-33 deg C).  The relative humidity ranged
from 16 to 18 percent.  Winds were variable and gusted from 5 to 10 mph
(8.1-16.1 km/h).  Dead fine fuel moistures were between 5 and 6 percent.

Fires moved slowly (1.6 to 4.9 feet per minute [0.5-1.5 m/min]) with
flame lengths of 0.7 to 1.6 feet (0.2-0.5 m) in four of the five burn
plots.  This was a heat release of 2.3 to 16.8 Btu per second per foot
(8-58 kw/m).  The fire moved rapidly (98.4 feet per minute [30 m/min])
with a heat release of 75.2 Btu per second per foot (260 kw/m) over the
remaining burn plot.


<b>FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES : </b>
Mature Arizona white oak were not affected by the fire [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Postfire
vegetation was sampled during two growing seasons in 1984 and 1985.
There was no significant (P>0.05) difference in numbers of Arizona white
oak seedlings on the burn plots compared to the controls. 


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS : </b>
Fire is a part of the historic Madrean evergreen woodland [<a href="#83">83</a>].  This
prescribed fire did not have any lasting effects on woody vegetation in
the study area.  Burning had little detectable effect on the seedlings
of Arizona white oak.  This is probably due to short duration and low
heat released by the fires.  The authors noted that Arizona white oak
were killed by fire in nearby O'Donnell Canyon during 1974 on the
Appleton-Whittell Sanctuary.
