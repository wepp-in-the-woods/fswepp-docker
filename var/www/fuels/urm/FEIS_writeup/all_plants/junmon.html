The currently accepted scientific name of oneseed juniper is <i>Juniperus monosperma</i> 
(Engelm.) Sarg. (Cupressaceae) [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>]. </p>

<p>
Reports of hybridization with Pinchot juniper (<i>J. pinchotii</i>) have been 
refuted by use of numerous chemical and morphologic characters. The two species 
have nonoverlapping pollination seasons [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].</p>

<p>
Because research focused specifically on oneseed juniper is not abundant, 
some information in this report is drawn from studies and reviews that pertain to
multispecies Southwestern juniper or pinyon (<i>Pinus</i> spp.)-juniper 
(<i>Juniperus</i> spp.) woodlands. In this report "oneseed juniper" is used 
where the study discussed focused on that species. "Juniper" or "pinyon-juniper" 
describes studies broader in scope, but where oneseed juniper was usually 
identified as component. When the pinyon species was identified it is included.

Oneseed juniper is common in the desert grassland and pinyon-juniper ranges 
throughout New Mexico and in southeastern and north-central Arizona. This species 
also occurs in southern Colorado, western Texas and western Oklahoma [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>].
Occurrence of oneseed juniper in Mexico is unclear because it is very similar 
morphologically to other species, especially Pinchot juniper. According to
Adams [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>], who conducted chemosystematic studies and reviewed taxonomic 
literature: "The one-seeded juniper group in Mexico is very complex."
<p>The <a href="http://hua.huh.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/Flora/flora.pl?FLORA_ID=12395">Flora
of North America</a> also provides distribution information on oneseed juniper
for North America.

<br />

Oneseed juniper is a native, long-lived, evergreen tree with often shrubby form, 10 to 40 feet
(3-12 m) high with several curved limbs arising near the base [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>].

<p>
Oneseed juniper produces small, "berry-like", glaucous, globular
staminate cones, and subglobose ovulate cones [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>]. Mature cones are
dark blue to purple or brownish, and succulent, or at least somewhat
fleshy [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>]. Seeds are generally 1 per fruit, more rarely 2,
reddish-brown and ovoid to globose [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>]. Juniper seeds are described as having
a semipermeable and thick seed coat with a dormant embryo [<a href="#41">41</a>]. The cones are often referred 
to as "berries" in the literature.</p>

<p>
Mature oneseed junipers have both tap and lateral root systems. The taproots in
1 study ranged from 18 inches (46 cm) to more than 12 
feet (3.7 m) in length. Of 500 trees examined, 347 had well-developed taproots.
Lateral roots were widespread, commonly being 2.5 to 3 times
as long as the tree was tall. Most lateral roots were in the surface 3 feet (1
m) of the soil, most of those concentrated below the surface 6 inches (15 cm) [<a href="#64">64</a>].
The deep root system of mature oneseed junipers is adapted for growth on dry sites [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>]. 
Foxx and Tierney [<a href="#43">43</a>] reported rooting depths ranging from 16 to 197 feet (5-60 m).  </p>


<p>
Oneseed juniper is a slow-growing species. Lymbery and Pieper [<a href="#80">80</a>]
reported an increase in height of approximately 6.3 inches (16 cm) per
decade, with a corresponding increase in stem diameter of 0.5 inch (1.2
cm). Growth rate tends to vary according to site characteristics,
however. On a hilly site in southwestern Texas, a oneseed juniper 35
years of age was 14 feet (4.3 m) in height with a diameter of 0.5 inch
(1.3 cm) [<a href="#23">23</a>].</p>

Oneseed juniper has the ability to stop active growth when moisture is limited but can resume 
growth when moisture availability improves [<a href="#53">53</a>]. This growth pattern may represent an important
adaptation allowing junipers to survive on harsh, arid sites. Although
small trees may be killed by drought, mature oneseed junipers are 
resistant to drought, especially in comparison to Colorado pinyon [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>].

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Breeding system:</b></font>  

Oneseed juniper is dioecious with seed persisting on the plant for 1 to 2 years
[<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].  


<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Pollination:</b></font>   

No information</p>


<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed production:</b></font>  

Trees first produce seed at 10 to 30 years of age, although
maximum seed production generally does not occur until 50 to 200 years
of age [<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>]. Trees as short as 18 inches (46 cm) in height can
produce seed [<a href="#64">64</a>]. Oneseed juniper typically produces large seed crops
at 2- to 5-year intervals [<a href="#66">66</a>].</p>


<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed dispersal:</b></font>  

Dispersal of oneseed juniper seeds may occur through water, gravity, or by any
of a number of birds and mammals [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>]. Animal dispersal may be
particularly important, as digestive processes may enhance germination [<a href="#13">13</a>]. Most seed 
cones occur on the outer edges of trees where they are most visible and accessible to 
birds [<a href="#110">110</a>]. The brightly-colored, highly-visible cones persist on the trees for much 
of the year, providing a continually available food source for animals [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>]. On some sites 
in New Mexico, as much as 95% of juniper reproduction could be attributed to bird dispersal [,30].
Domestic sheep and cattle may also aid in seed dispersal [<a href="#64">64</a>].</p> 


<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed banking:</b></font> 

According to Johnsen [<a href="#64">64</a>], "Since the seed is not harmed by long periods of dry storage, 
drought probably does not affect seed viability. Viable seed in the soil may endure prolonged 
drought and still germinate when conditions become favorable."</p>


<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Germination:</b></font> 
Please refer to the section in this report titled
&quot;<a href="management_considerations.html#Value For Rehabilitation Of Disturbed Sites">Value For Rehabilitation Of Disturbed Sites</a>&quot;, 
under the MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS heading, for detailed information 
about germination experiments with this species. </p> 


<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Seedling establishment/growth:</b> </font>
Seedling establishment of oneseed juniper is often very poor even when good 
germination occurs [<a href="#114">114</a>]. The growth rate has been characterized as slow with medium 
vigor. Researchers in some areas have found that only approximately 3% of juniper seeds 
develop to the seedling stage. Shade may be important for good early growth of oneseed
juniper [<a href="#60">60</a>]. Emergence appears to be somewhat greater under trees or shrubs
than in interspaces where humidity and temperature fluctuations are more
extreme [<a href="#64">64</a>]. In some areas, small junipers are particularly numerous
under the canopy of pinyon or other trees [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>]. Most seedlings
occur some distance from the parent tree, although most seeds are
located beneath the source tree [<a href="#110">110</a>]. Seedlings seldom establish
beneath mature junipers, and an autopathic effect from litter is
suspected [<a href="#115">115</a>].</p>


<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Asexual regeneration:</b></font> 
Although oneseed juniper is usually regarded as a nonsprouter [<a href="#135">135</a>], limited sprouting, 
mostly from older trees, has been observed [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. Approximately 10% of living 
oneseed junipers sprouted from the base following an Arizona fire [<a href="#129">129</a>].

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SITE CHARACTERISTICS">
SITE CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />


Oneseed juniper occupies xeric sites in semiarid
climatic zones [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>]. A typical Arizona site occupied by oneseed juniper
receives 10 to 15 inches (250-380 mm) of precipitation annually, and has
an average growing season of approximately 120 days [<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>]. Unlike several
related species, the distribution of oneseed juniper does not appear to
be limited by temperature inversions [<a href="#59">59</a>].


<p>
Oneseed juniper grows on dry, rocky, open flats, and slopes [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  It
commonly occurs in canyons or on middle-elevation foothills [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>].  In
many areas this juniper occurs in a zone below ponderosa pine (<i>P. ponderosa</i>)
or alligator juniper, but above oak (<i>Quercus</i> spp.)-mountain-mahogany (<i>Cercocarpus</i>
spp.) shrublands [<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>].  </p>


<p>
Because soil moisture is limited on many oneseed juniper sites,
competition with others species may significantly influence the
occurrence of this tree on a particular site. Grasses can compete
effectively with oneseed juniper seedlings for moisture and can limit
its distribution in some areas [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#135">135</a>]. Many oaks also compete
for soil moisture, although oneseed juniper appears to be capable of
outcompeting them on shallow soils [<a href="#115">115</a>]. Where oneseed juniper occurs with Colorado pinyon,
junipers show much more adaptation to drought stress than do the pines [<a href="#107">107</a>]. These 
observations were based on tissue water potentials and metabolic activity during the hottest 
part of the day. </p>


<p>
Oneseed juniper grows on a variety of soil textures including gravelly,
rocky, or sandy soils [<a href="#50">50</a>]. Parent materials include basalt, limestone,
and sandstone [<a href="#38">38</a>]. Soil characteristics, combined with temperature, moisture 
and topography influence the upper and lower elevational extent of oneseed 
juniper [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>]. Elevational ranges of oneseed juniper reported in the literature are:</p>


<p>
Arizona 3,000 to 7,000 feet (914-2,130 m) [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>]<br>
Colorado 4,000 to 7,600 feet (1,220-2,315 m) [<a href="#52">52</a>]<br>
New Mexico > 5,000 to 7,500 feet (1,525-2,285 m) [<a href="#125">125</a>]

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SUCCESSIONAL STATUS">
SUCCESSIONAL STATUS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Populations of oneseed juniper have been classified as climax [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>], seral [<a href="#44">44</a>], 
late seral [<a href="#27">27</a>], and postclimax [<a href="#64">64</a>]. Schott and Pieper [<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>] examined secondary 
succession in pinyon-juniper several decades following cabling and concluded that 
re-established stands of pinyon and oneseed juniper were climax. Johnsen [<a href="#64">64</a>] concluded 
that within northern Arizona grasslands are numerous postclimax oneseed juniper stands with 
soil and microclimate conditions different from adjacent grasslands. The oneseed 
junipers maintain themselves on these areas but are not invading the surrounding grassland.  
Francis [<a href="#44">44</a>] described 4 seral phyto-edaphic community types in northwestern
New Mexico where oneseed juniper is a codominant indicator species.

<p>
According to Gottfried [<a href="#48">48</a>] junipers are the 1st to return in secondary succession but 
are often followed and replaced by pinyon. "Habitat type affects the successional pathway 
following a disturbance. Succession on a site is influenced by the 
severity and size of the disturbance, and by the composition, longevity, and density of 
any surviving plants and propagules within the disturbed area and the characteristics
of plant communities in adjacent undisturbed areas. Climatic conditions also influence 
the nature and speed of succession." </p>


<p>
The subsection of this report titled &quot;
<a href="management_considerations.html#Other management Considerations">
Other Management Considerations</a>&quot; in MANAGEMENT 
CONSIDERATIONS describes the analysis of a drought-induced ecotone shift of 
oneseed junipers into a declining ponderosa pine forest in Arizona.</p>   


<p>
New Mexico studies comparing plant growth in zones extending out from the boles of 
oneseed juniper and pinyon pine showed differences between the zones and also between the 
two tree species [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>]. Grasses and other plants were consistently sparser beneath the 
tree canopies. The author's review of possible explanations includes allelopathy, 
shade, precipitation interception by the canopy, and litter cover forming a physical 
barrier to germinating plants. Other explanations offered to explain the reduced

Flowering generally occurs in March or April [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>], but can occur as early as 
January or as late as June, depending on geographic location [<a href="#41">41</a>]. Fruit matures in
1 season, ripening from August through November [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>]. Seed may remain on the tree 
for 1 to 2 years [<a href="#66">66</a>]. Lymbery and Pieper [<a href="#80">80</a>] reported that in the northern 
Sacramento Mountains, flowering occurred from March to April, fruit ripening

<br />

Oneseed juniper is susceptible to fire [<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#135">135</a>]. Fire mortality
is generally high for both young and old trees [<a href="#68">68</a>], although the
medium-thick bark of older trees may afford some protection [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>]. 
A history of heavy grazing may also reduce flammability of mature oneseed 
juniper stands by reducing fine fuels [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>].  

<p>
In some areas, juniper is protected from fire by site factors. For
example, junipers frequently grow on rocky breaks or escarpments
where fire frequency is low. Wright [<a href="#135">135</a>] reported that nonsprouting juniper
species often occupy isolated topographic breaks which may be surrounded by 
grasslands that are more susceptible to fire.</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font> 
Postfire reestablishment is primarily through seed and is relatively
slow [<a href="#63">63</a>]. Most establishment is from seed dispersed from off-site by
birds and mammals, but some establishment may occur from seeds buried
on-site and protected from the heat of fire by overlying soil layers.
Establishment may be relatively poor even when good germination occurs,
and growth is typically very slow [<a href="#115">115</a>].</p>

Oneseed juniper is usually regarded as a nonsprouter [<a href="#135">135</a>], but older
trees have been known to sprout infrequently after fire [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. This
mode of regeneration appears to be relatively unimportant, however.</p>


<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font> 
Past fire regimes in southwestern pinyon-juniper woodlands were mixed,
having both surface and crown fires, and are a reflection of variable intensity and 
frequency depending on site productivity [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>]. "Productive sites could sustain 
patchy fires at intervals of 10 to 50 years, and could have attained densities 
sufficient to carry crown fires at intervals of 200 to 300 years. In open stands, 
where grass cover was continuous, fire intervals might have been 10 years or less, 
and probably maintained grasslands and savannas [<a href="#48">48</a>].&quot;</p>


<p>
According to a 1962 review of oneseed juniper by Johnsen [<a href="#64">64</a>] (and references therein), 
fires were reported to have been widespread and destructive before the juniper woodlands 
were heavily used by settlers. A 1904 publication cited by Johnsen reported that 5% 
of the junipers on the Coconino National Forest had been struck and killed by lightning.  
Johnsen indicated that "lightning strikes are still common, but fires started in this 
way are usually confined to the tree struck, for only in the very dry hot periods 
with strong winds in the late spring will a fire
carry through even a dense juniper stand".</p>


<p>The following table provides some fire regime intervals for communities

<br />

Surface fires kill oneseed juniper trees less than 4 feet (1.2 m) tall,
but have less of an impact on older, larger trees that have thicker bark
and high crown base heights that exceed flame lengths [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>]. Fast
moving surface fires in the Southwest often do not burn near trunks of
larger trees because the litter layer does not ignite [<a href="#98">98</a>].

<p>
Average mortality following a low-severity June wildfire in oak-juniper
woodlands of Arizona was 76% [<a href="#68">68</a>]. Researchers observed 92% mortality after 
a stand of small, bushy oneseed juniper were burned [<a href="#17">17</a>]. Springfield [<a href="#118">118</a>] 
noted 70 to 100% of oneseed junipers less than 4 feet (1.2 m) in height were 
killed by fire. Mortality ranging from 30 to 100% has been reported in trees
5 to 6 feet (1.5-1.8 m) in height.</p>

<p>
Researchers have found that 100% juniper mortality results when 60%
of the crown is scorched [<a href="#61">61</a>]. Temperatures lethal to oneseed
juniper tissue are also related to the degree of desiccation, and
thus season of burn may also influence the amount of damage the plant
sustains. Laboratory experiments have shown that temperatures lethal to oneseed
juniper ranged from 140 degrees Fahrenheit to 176 degrees Fahrenheit 
(61.8<sup>o</sup> to 80<sup>o</sup>C). Lethal temperatures
tend to be lowest during late spring and summer [<a href="#58">58</a>].

PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:</a>

<br />

Regeneration of oneseed juniper is usually from seed when
aboveground vegetation has been killed or seriously damaged by fire. Older 
oneseed junipers can occasionally sprout from the base after fire. In a 
southern Arizona burn, 10% of oneseed junipers resprouted. In
contrast 42% of alligator juniper resprouted [<a href="#68">68</a>]. However, in most cases, 
sprouting appears to be a relatively unimportant mode of regeneration.

<p>
The length of time required for postfire recovery of oneseed juniper has
not been well documented. Oneseed juniper did not become prominent after a
severe wildfire in Utah until postfire year 40. This species did not regain 
dominance on this site until 70 years after the fire [<a href="#129">129</a>]. Evidence
suggests that factors such as soil type and preburn community
composition may significantly influence the length of time required for recovery
[<a href="#114">114</a>]. Seedling establishment may be favored in the shade of
dead vegetation, including other oneseed junipers [<a href="#24">24</a>]. Once established,
oneseed juniper can bear seed as early as 10 years of age on some sites
[<a href="#114">114</a>].

FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>

<br />

Historically, periodic fire is believed to have played an important role in
maintaining juniper savannas [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>]. Mueggler [<a href="#93">93</a>] reported that a 
fire-free period of 85 to 90 years was required for formation of a "well-developed"
juniper woodland. Recent decades of fire suppression have probably contributed to
encroachment of juniper into grasslands [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>].

<p>
In some instances, forage production has increased after oneseed
juniper and other species were removed by fire. On 1 &quot;notable&quot;
Colorado pinyon-juniper site, Aro [<a href="#11">11</a>] reported
increased forage production from 100 pounds per acre (45 kg/ha) before treatment
to 500 pounds per acre (227 kg/ha) following fire. However, in other instances
little long-term increase in forage production has been noted. According to
Payson and others [<a href="#98">98</a>], most of the control operations failed to meet
managers' objectives.</p>


<p>
Individual tree burning was used on some pinyon-juniper woodlands
[<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>]. Mechanical methods, such as chaining and cabling in pinyon-juniper
woodlands, were often followed by the piling and burning of slash. Burning
these high fuel concentrations generated high heat levels that damaged soil and
site productivity. Surface soils in many of these piled areas were
degraded and remained free of vegetation 20 years later [<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>].</p>

<p>  
Oneseed juniper does not survive in grasslands where fires occur frequently [<a href="#135">135</a>].
Broadcast burns may effectively control oneseed juniper if the species is
well represented, weather conditions are favorable, and sufficient
fuels are present. Dense stands (400 or more/ac (990/ha)) with a flammable 
understory are most suitable for broadcast burning [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. In areas with a 
past history of heavy grazing where little fuels remain and few residual grasses 
occur, burning may be difficult and ineffective. Burns tend to be most successful when
carried out in June when temperatures are high and humidity low
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>]. Unfortunately, risk of escape may be great during this time
period [<a href="#11">11</a>], and the window for burning very narrow [<a href="#104">104</a>].</p>


<p>
Currently, prescribed fire in pinyon-juniper woodlands is used to reduce
accumulations of slash from fuelwood harvesting or to reduce or eliminate tree
cover to increase range productivity and biodiversity. Prescribed burning 
to dispose of slash is less desirable in partially harvested stands because 
residual trees are damaged and advance regeneration is killed. Established, 
smaller trees are particularly important for the next rotation because of the 
difficulty of achieving adequate regeneration of these relatively slow growing trees. 
Payson and others [<a href="#98">98</a>] provide recommendations relevant to fire management in 
pinyon-juniper ecosystems.

Galleta and black grama dominated the preburn community. Oneseed juniper had been 
steadily invading the area during the past century and by 1956, numbered approximately 
60 trees per acre (148 trees/ha). Other common preburn species included needlegrass 
(<i>Stipa</i> spp.) and threeawn (<i>Aristida</i> spp.), blue grama, Russian-thistle 
(<i>Salsola kali</i>), freckled milkvetch (<i>Astragalus lentiginosus</i>), broom snakeweed

On the 3 burns, 380 oneseed junipers were examined along randomly located 
compass lines. Mortality of trees less than 4 feet (1.2 m) tall ranged from 
70 to 100% and 30 to 40% in  trees 5 to 6 feet tall (1.5-1.8 m). The March 
and June burns caused the death of 60 to 90% of the oneseed junipers 8 to
10 feet (2.4-3.1 m) tall. Mortality data for this height group in the January 
burn was not presented. The authors attributed much of the mortality in the 
taller oneseed junipers to the accumulation of flammable debris around the 
base of the trees. When the fires moved with the prevailing winds,
Russian-thistle ignited and tree mortality was relatively high (60-90%).
When fires moved against the prevailing winds, flammable understory
debris did not ignite and few (&lt; 10%) large oneseed junipers were killed.&nbsp;

The objective of the prescribed burns was to test grass fires as a means of 
controlling juniper encroachment into grasslands. The amount of flammable 
material present at a given site and wind conditions greatly influenced mortality 
in larger junipers. Mortality was relatively high when winds ignited Russian-thistle 
and other debris accumulated beneath the crowns. A high percentage of smaller oneseed 
junipers (&lt; 4 feet (1.2 m)) can also be killed by fire. The authors concluded that 
grass fires at frequent intervals killed oneseed junipers less than 4 feet (1.2 m) 
tall. Larger trees were much more resistant to fire except where significant
flammable material was present beneath the crown.

The preburn community was a blue grama-pinyon-juniper community. Oneseed juniper 
and pinyon pine were common on rocky ridges, and grasses under the trees were 
sparse. Other common but scattered species included:
winterfat (<i>Krascheninnikovia lanata</i>), fourwing saltbush (<i>Atriplex
canescens</i>), skunkbush sumac (<i>Rhus trilobata</i>), Apache-plume 
(<i>Fallugia paradoxa</i>), and algerita (<i>Mahonia trifoliata</i>).

The fire was a 935 acre (378 ha) wildfire that started at 1:45 p.m. on April 10th. 
It was controlled approximately 3 hours later. The fire did not move through the 
crowns of the trees. Other conditions were as follows:

<p>
Relative humidity: low<br>
Wind: warm, dry, from the south, (speed not recorded)<br>
Soil, litter, and grass fuel: very dry<br>

The total number of oneseed junipers in the burn was 120. All those less than 
4 feet (1.2 m) tall were killed by fire. The foliage of many of the smaller trees 
extended close to the ground and ignited readily. Larger junipers were found to be 
somewhat more resistant to surface fire. Many trees did not show
the extent of fire damage until 1 or 2 years after the fire. After 2 years,
approximately 24% of oneseed junipers had died (while only 13.5% of the pinyon 
pines were killed). At that time some of the larger trees that had been defoliated 
by fire were surviving. Thirteen % of oneseed junipers were unharmed by the fire.

<br />

The broad objective of data collection following the wildfire was to examine 
the effects of fire on the grama-pinyon-juniper vegetation type. Reduction in 
herbage caused by the fire was 30% in October of the same year. Litter production 
was also reduced following the fire. Small cholla cacti (<i>Opuntia</i>  spp.) 
were also killed by the fire. The findings suggest that low
severity surface fires may be effective in reducing numbers of small (&lt; 4 feet [1.2 m]) 
oneseed junipers and cholla cacti. Larger oneseed junipers and cacti are somewhat 
resistant to such fires. Fine fuels tended to be sparse under 
the large junipers, and the authors conclued that more juniper and pinyon 
would have been killed if more grass fuel had been present.

<br />

The relatively small stature and multiple stems of oneseed juniper limit
its usefulness as a timber species. The wood is described
as strong and long-grained [<a href="#51">51</a>].

<span class="subframeName">

<br />

Pinyon-juniper woodlands provide good habitat for mule deer, bighorn
sheep, bison, wild horses, pronghorns, coyotes, bobcats, badgers,
porcupines, rabbits, mice, voles, woodrats, squirrels, and numerous
birds [<a href="#34">34</a>]. The foliage and berries of oneseed juniper provide food for
many species of birds and mammals.  

<p>
<b>Browse:</b> Deer utilize the foliage of oneseed juniper [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>].
Mahgoub and others [<a href="#82">82</a>] observed heavy utilization in parts of
south-central New Mexico where juniper can represent up to 20% of
the annual diet of mule deer. Oneseed juniper foliage is reported to be
a major mule deer food item from January through March in parts of
southeastern New Mexico [<a href="#108">108</a>]. Pronghorns also browse oneseed juniper,
and in some areas, winter use may be heavy [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>]. Bighorn
sheep and elk may consume small amounts of juniper browse [<a href="#108">108</a>]. The foliage 
of oneseed juniper is of little value to domestic livestock. Domestic sheep 
and goats utilize this species to a limited extent [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  </p>



<p>
<b>Fruit:</b> The succulent, berrylike cones of oneseed juniper serve as an abundant and
readily available food source for a wide range of wildlife species. The
bright cones tend to remain on the tree and can provide food
year-round [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>], but become dry and leathery by the 2nd winter [<a href="#109">109</a>].</p>  

<p>
It is estimated that avian population densities may be
70% greater during years with abundant juniper "berry" crops
(generally every 2 to 5 years) [<a href="#13">13</a>]. Studies with captive birds have
revealed that an average Townsend's solitaire can consume approximately
240 "berries" per day, or 36,000 to 84,000 per winter [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>]. In some
areas at least 97% of the Townsend's solitaire's winter diet may
be made up of oneseed juniper "berries" [<a href="#109">109</a>]. Robins also consume large
numbers of the berrylike cones. An individual bird can eat 220 "berries" per
day or 33,000 per winter. Birds and mammals serve as important dispersal agents for 
seeds of oneseed juniper. Many bird species disperse seed up to 6.3 miles (10 km)
or more from the seed source. Sheep and domestic cattle can also facilitate 
dispersal of oneseed juniper [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>]. Salomonson [<a href="#110">110</a>] reported the following 
animals as juniper seed consumers and dispersers:</p>

<p><span class="subframeName"><a name="VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES">
VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES:</a></span>
<br />

Oneseed juniper is rated as having low overall value for short-term
rehabilitation but high value for long-term rehabilitation [<a href="#28">28</a>]. It was not widely 
used in the past for rehabilitation projects because of
unreliable seed germination. Fertilizers, wood chips, straw mulch, plastic mesh 
protection against rodents, and drip irrigation can all contribute to
increased survival on disturbed sites. Oneseed juniper has been
successfully planted on surface coal and uranium mines in
the Southwest. Improved techniques have resulted in survival rates
as high as 99% [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].

<p>
In a New Mexico study of planted seed, drip irrigation was  more effective
than mulch, while triple-superphosphate aided growth more than
slow-release fertilizers. On these sites, July planting dates
produced best results at higher elevations, whereas August plantings
were most successful on low elevation sites [<a href="#40">40</a>]. </p>

<p>
Transplanting containerized seedlings onto disturbed sites has also been
a successful technique [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>]. In New Mexico, survival is best when trees
are planted after the June drought but before the ground freezes. Survival of 
transplants is heavily dependent on moisture availability. Mulch aids in water 
conservation and can enhance survival on dry sites. Drip irrigation may be necessary 
on the most arid sites. Researchers suggested that fertilizer may improve 
survival on some sites particularly when combined with irrigation [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>]. 
In another New Mexico study of rehabilitation of surface-mined land, survival 
of transplanted containerized seedlings was improved by wood chip mulch and 
animal protection using rigid mesh. In this study, fertilizer provided no 
benefit and decreased oneseed juniper survival where seeded grasses were 
able to outcompete. Competition from weeds also reduced juniper growth and 
survival [<a href="#39">39</a>].</p>

<p>
Germinating juniper seeds is difficult. Seeds may require a period of
afterripening [<a href="#41">41</a>]. Pack [<a href="#97">97</a>] found that high temperatures, alternating 
temperatures, freezing and thawing, removal of the seed coat, application 
of hydrogen peroxide, dilute acids, carbon dioxide, or light had little influence 
on germination of juniper seeds. Cold stratification may improve germination 
in oneseed juniper [<a href="#66">66</a>]. Fischer and others [<a href="#41">41</a>] found that germination improved 
when seeds were leached 48 hours with hydrogen peroxide, or treated with ethephon 
or hydrogen peroxide plus gibberellic acid followed by cold stratification .</p>

<p>
Experiments suggest that exposure to sunlight may have relatively little effect on
germination. Johnsen [<a href="#64">64</a>] observed average germination of 44% for seeds grown 
in the dark, and 52% for seeds exposed to sunlight. Soil moisture may be an important 
factor influencing germination. Germination appears to be best in moist but not saturated
soil. Seeds of oneseed juniper do not germinate well on the soil
surface which is subject to rapid desiccation. Juniper seeds appear to be 
resistant to drought when buried in the soil [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>]. Buried seeds can often retain 
viability and germinate when moisture conditions become favorable. Approximately 
54% of oneseed juniper seed stored for 21 years germinated [<a href="#63">63</a>]. 

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="UTILIZATION">
UTILIZATION:</a>
</span>
<br />

Oneseed juniper is used locally for fuel, fenceposts, poles, and 
Christmas trees [<a href="#100">100</a>]. Native Americans relied on oneseed juniper for many 
purposes. Wood was used for bows and arrows by the Kiowa, Comanche,
Cheyenne, and Apache [<a href="#51">51</a>]. The "berries" were eaten whole or ground into flour 
for bread [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>]. Prayer sticks were made from wood, and dye, fibrous mats, 
and saddles were fashioned from the bark [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>]. Parts of the tree were also 
used as building materials and for medicinal purposes [<a href="#64">64</a>]. Foliage was used as 
domestic sheep food during extreme winters [<a href="#31">31</a>]. Oneseed junipers were used by 
settlers for fenceposts, fuel, and mine timbers. Oneseed juniper has also been used 
in the production of cellulose and chemical products [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>]. Springfield [<a href="#118">118</a>] noted 
that many species of juniper may have potential value for the production of charcoal, 
pulp, particleboard, chip products, fiber, or in certain chemicals. Oneseed
juniper was first cultivated in 1900 [<a href="#66">66</a>].

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />


In parts of the Southwest, juniper species including oneseed juniper
have encroached into adjacent grasslands, or increased in stand density
[<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>]. Explanations include fire suppression, a decrease in 
light fuels from overgrazing, reduction of grass competitiveness by overgrazing, 
spread of seed by livestock, and climatic change [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>]. Past management 
efforts focused on halting the juniper invasion through mechanical or chemical means.


<p>
<b>Mechanical control:</b> A number of methods of mechanical removal were tried
with limited success. Cabling, chaining, bulldozing, and various
means of hand removal were used in attempts to convert pinyon-juniper
woodlands to grasslands. Neither the single chaining nor double chaining method
effectively eliminated trees less than 10 feet (3.1 m) in height. In treatment areas 
heavily stocked with young trees, reinvasion may be rapid [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>].</p>


<p>
<b>Chemical control:</b>  
The foliage of junipers tends to be resistant to
herbicides, and leaves have little surface area for absorption [<a href="#65">65</a>], 
though juniper can be killed with chemicals. See Springfield [<a href="#118">118</a>] and Johnsen 
[<a href="#65">65</a>] for details. </p>


<p>
<b>Production:</b> 
Herbage production values are variable in pinyon-juniper
woodlands. Springfield [<a href="#118">118</a>] reported an inverse relationship between
tree canopy and average herbage production:</p>

<p>
<b>Fertilization:</b> 
The diameter of oneseed juniper was found to be largely
unaffected by the addition of nitrogen fertilizer in a New Mexico study,
although growth of lateral branches and apex was enhanced [<a href="#108">108</a>].</p>


<p>
In a 1998 study in northern New Mexico, Allen and Breshears [<a href="#4">4</a>] concluded that
the ecotone between a semiarid ponderosa pine forest and Colorado pinyon-oneseed 
juniper woodland shifted extensively (1.2 miles (2 km)) and rapidly 
(within &lt; 5 years) through drought-induced ponderosa pine mortality
and associated expansion of the pinyon-juniper population. The Bandelier Wilderness 
site was chosen in part for its minimal history of human disturbance and extensively 
documented fire history. They used a Geographic Information System and a series of 
aerial photographs taken from 1935 to 1975. Their analysis showed that the shift coincided 
with the culmination of a 1950s drought, which was one of the most severe of the 
past 500 years. The shift has persisted for at least 40 years. The authors acknowledge 
that fire suppression since the 1800s allowed the Colorado pinyon and oneseed juniper 
to become more densely established in proximity to the ponderosa pines prior to 
the 1950s drought. They also note that the shift was amplified by bark beetle mortality 
in the ponderosa pine and more efficient water use in pinyon and juniper. They assert 
drought was the driving factor in the shift, in part because widespread 
ponderosa pine mortality ceased when the drought broke.</p>
 

<p>
A number of other studies and reviews have examined the relatively recent changes 
in stand density or areal extent of juniper or pinyon-juniper
woodlands [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>]. Evidence and arguments are presented for
both expansion and reduction of the woodlands. The studies do not focus on 
oneseed juniper specifically, but provide relevant perspectives.</p>

<p>
In a recent discussion of the problem of pinyon-juniper expansion, 
Lanner [<a href="#78">78</a>] provided the following perspective:
"Despite the decades old alarm occasioned by juniper encroachment into rangelands, 
very little research has been undertaken to establish its cause or causes...
The lumping of pinyon pines with junipers, despite their very different 
biologies, is a further confusing factor in understanding the behavior of 
these coniferous woodlands in which the species may occur together, or singly...
At present woodland eradication in the pinyon-juniper zone is nearly an abandoned 
practice, partly because it is controversial, but mainly because it is almost always a 
prohibitively expensive way to grow grass."
