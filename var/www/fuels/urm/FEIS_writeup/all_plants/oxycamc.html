<pre><center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Oxytropis campestris var. columbiana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Columbia River crazyweed is endemic to the Columbia River basin in
northeastern Washington but also occurs in northwestern Montana where it
is found in the Flathead Lake region and along the North Fork of the
Flathead River (Glacier National Park) [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Occurrence in Glacier National Park:  Big Prairie along Inside Road, and
Lone Pine Prairie along Mud Creek [<a href="#10">10</a>].

The species, Oxytropis campestris, is more or less circumboreal; montane
to submontane in the Pacific Northwest.  It occurs transcontinentally in
Canada, south in the Rocky Mountains to Colorado and west to the Olympic
Mountains [<a href="#7">7</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Oxytropis species often contain toxic alkaloids which cause "loco"
disease.  The species is moderately tolerant of grazing, but it is
generally avoided [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Yellow locoweed (Oxytropis campestris) has been recommended for use in
revegetation of subalpine sites.  At 2,350 feet (757 m) in Alaska,
containerized seedlings showed 80 percent and 100 percent survival after
one growing season with and without added topsoil [<a href="#3">3</a>].  The seed is
easily collected but requires a lengthy dormancy and has a low
germination rate (10%) [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Yellow locoweed is an excellent soil
builder and has high erosion control capabilities.  It fixes nitrogen
and is very competitive on preferred sites.  In northern areas
(Alberta), it is resistant to northern diseases [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Columbia River crazyweed is threatened by agriculutral, recreational,
residential, and dam development, and by invasion of woody species and
exotic weeds onto grasslands.

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Oxytropis campestris var. columbiana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Columbia River crazyweed is a native perennial forb with a heavy taproot
and branched rootstocks.  It has tufted basal leaves and grows 4 to 12
inches (10-30 cm) tall.  The odd-pinnate leaves are 3 to 8 inches (8-20
cm) long.  The flowers are zygomorphic and have a white corolla and a
strongly purple-spotted keel.  The pod is 0.5 to 1.5 inches (1-3 cm)
long.  There is a high root to shoot ratio [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  The plant may
fix nitrogen, but this has not been reported in the literature [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Columbia River crazyweed reproduces by seed produced by pollination and
fertilization [<a href="#15">15</a>].  It is pollinated by bumblebee species with long
tongues.  No fruit was produced on flowers that were enclosed, but there
was 96 percent fruit set on flowers under open pollination [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Columbia River crazyweed grows on rocky, gravelly, open or partially
shaded areas in valleys.  It has been reported at 2,900 to 3,500 feet
(880-1,050 m) in northwestern Montana [<a href="#14">14</a>].  

Yellow locoweed (Oxytropis campestris) grows best in sandy loam to clay
loam soils.  It is tolerant of moderately saline soils and low nutrient
conditons but does not tolerate water-saturated soils such as heavy
clay.  It is drought tolerant but not at all tolerant of excessive shade
[<a href="#15">15</a>].  Yellow locoweed grows in dry meadows and on debris accumulations,
talus and scree slopes, boulder fell fields, and in areas with little
soil and sparse vegetative cover [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Yellow locoweed (O. campestris) was a pioneer on alkaline glacial
outwash in Alsaka and in Alberta on a coal mine spoil exposed to severe
wind and drought [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Columbia River crazyweed flowers from late June to early August [<a href="#1">1</a>].

plants in crazyweed habitats [<a href="#10">10</a>].
