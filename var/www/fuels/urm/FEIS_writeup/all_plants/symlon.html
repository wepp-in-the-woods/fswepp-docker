<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Symphoricarpos longiflorus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Longflower snowberry occurs throughout Nevada and adjacent southeastern
Oregon, south to southern California and northern Baja, and eastward to
eastern Utah, northwestern Colorado, New Mexico, and western Texas.  In
Utah, this species is found primarily south of the 40th parallel, except
along the Green River where it extends north into Daggett County; in
Nevada it is found everywhere except the northeast corner [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Symphoricarpos longiflorus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Longflower snowberry is an important forage species on the xeric sites
it occupies and is utilized by both big game and livestock.  Over much
of its range, it is often the first browse species to leaf out.  Plants
are easily accessible due to their low growth form and are moderately
tolerant to grazing pressure [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  The seeds are eaten by a number
of species of birds, especially grouse, pheasant, and quail.  The Rocky
Mountain pika and various ground squirrels and chipmunks also eat the
seeds [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability of longflower snowberry is highest in the early spring and
declines throughout the summer and fall.  This species is usually more
palatable in the Intermountain region than on more southern or western
ranges [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Palatability of longflower snowberry to livestock and
wildlife species in Utah has been rated as follows [<a href="#5">5</a>]:

.NS 
Cattle               Fair 
Sheep                Good   
Horses               Fair 
Elk                  Fair 
Mule deer            Good 
Small mammals        Good 
Small nongame birds  Good 
Upland game birds    Fair 
Waterfowl            Poor 



<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Longflower snowberry has been rated as fair in both energy and protein
value [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The degree to which longflower snowberry provides environmental
protection during one or more seasons for wildlife species in Utah is as
follows [<a href="#5">5</a>]:

Elk                   Poor 
Mule deer             Poor 
Small mammals         Good 
Small nongame birds   Fair 
Upland game birds     Fair 
Waterfowl             Poor 


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Longflower snowberry is a very useful shrub for establishing cover on
raw and severe sites.  It grows well in areas where few other species
are adapted, but it does not have a wide range of adaptability [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].

Once established longflower snowberry is very persistent.  Sites can be
revegetated using wildlings or transplants.  Transplants are easily
obtained by pulling up small rooted portions of plants in the early
spring before leaf growth has begun.  Propagation via stem cuttings has
also been successful [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Direct seeding is generally recommended in
the fall or winter in the following types:  big sagebrush, blackbrush,
pinyon-juniper, and aspen.  Commercial seed may be dried or cleaned.
Seeds have a pronounced domancy; acid treatments break down the seed
coat.  Stratification should be employed for spring planting [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Snowberries are highly regarded for the beauty of their foliage and
fruits; many species are widely grown as ornamentals [<a href="#20">20</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Symphoricarpos longiflorus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Longflower snowberry is a low, spreading, deciduous shrub with somewhat
drooping branchlets [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Heights range from 3.3 to 5 feet (1-1.5 m).
Persistent, smaller branches tend to give plants a thorny appearance
[<a href="#4">4</a>].  This species exhibits wide ecotypic variation in leaf and twig
pubescence [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Longflower snowberry is monoecious.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Information concerning regenerative processes in longflower snowberry is
scant.  Morphologically similar mountain snowberry regenerates via
rhizomes, basal sprouts, stolons, and seed [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Although many
members of the Symphoricarpos genus are highly rhizomatous, the extent
to which this habit is developed in longflower snowberry is unclear.

The general pattern for seed production in the Symphoricarpos genus has
been described by Pelton [<a href="#14">14</a>] for western snowberry (S. occidentalis)
and apparently also applies to longflower snowberry [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Fruits are
white, berrylike drupes containing two, seedlike nutlets which ripen in
the fall.  Since no abscision layer is formed on the pedicle, fruits can
persist on shrubs for up to two seasons before falling to the ground.
Nutlets have a double dormancy which delays germination and
establishment [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Seed coat restrictions are eliminated through
storage in warm, moist soil; afterripening and development of the embryo
occur during one or two winters in the soil.  Seeds do not remain viable
for extended periods in nature.  Birds or mammals are probably the main
dispersal agents; field mice scatter seeds, and plants are widely
distributed from their caches.  Germination begins in the early spring
as soon as the soil thaws.  First-year seedlings are quite sensitive to
drought.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Longflower snowberry typically occurs on open, rocky slopes and washes
at elevations ranging between 4,500 and 7,500 feet (1,372 and 2,287 m).
It occurs on sites more xeric than those occupied by mountain snowberry
[<a href="#17">17</a>].  Longflower snowberry is usually a component of pinyon-juniper
communities [<a href="#15">15</a>] but extends down into the sagebrush-grassland and cold
desert on sites receiving 8 to 9 inches (20-23 cm) minimum annual
precipitation.  In the mountain brush and ponderosa pine zones, the
ranges of longflower snowberry and mountain snowberry sometimes overlap
[<a href="#4">4</a>].

Elevational ranges for some western states are listed below [<a href="#4">4</a>].

	From  5,000 to 5,000 feet (1,524-1,524 m) in CO
              5,000 to 7,400 feet (1,524-2,256 m) in UT



<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Longflower snowberry is present in nonforested and forested climax
communities throughout its range.  Self-perpetuating stands are
indicative of climax conditions [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Flowering generally occurs from May through July [<a href="#5">5</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Symphoricarpos longiflorus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Information concerning the fire ecology of longflower snowberry is
scant; however, resprouting has been documented following burning in
Nevada [<a href="#10">10</a>].  As a genus, snowberries are moderately resistent to fire
mortality.  Most species resprout via basal buds or rhizomes [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].
Although plant response is variable, postfire recovery rates are
moderately rapid on most sites.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Small shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Rhizomatous shrub, rhizome in soil
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Symphoricarpos longiflorus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire usually completely top-kills longflower snowberry.  It is probably
moderately resistant to fire mortality due to perennating buds located
on root crowns and rhizomes.  Survival may be highly variable, however,
and appears to be significantly influenced by fire intensity and
severity [18.25].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Fire response of longflower snowberry has not been well documented.
Following a spring burn in a sagebrush-grassland community in Nevada,
all reexamined plants sprouted; however, sprout origin and vigor were
not discussed [<a href="#10">10</a>].  (For fire response information on a morphologically
similar species, see the FEIS write-up on mountain snowberry).
