Native to Europe [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>] and Asia [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>], garlic mustard occurs in northern Europe from England across
Scandinavia to the western areas of the former Soviet
Union, and south to Italy [<a href="#56">56</a>]. It was 1st reported in the North America in 1868 on
Long Island, New York [<a href="#50">50</a>], and has since established throughout much of the
Northeast and Midwest. Garlic mustard can be found in Canada from southern Ontario east into the St.
Lawrence Valley in Quebec [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>], as
well as around Victoria, British Columbia [<a href="#15">15</a>]. In the United States it is established
and invasive in deciduous woodlands and
disturbed areas from northern New England west to eastern North Dakota, and
south to eastern Oklahoma and
South Carolina [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>]. Occurrences of garlic mustard have also been recorded
in Utah, eastern Colorado, and around Portland, Oregon, Seattle, Washington, and
Juneau, Alaska [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>].

In the eastern U.S., garlic mustard occurs in the understory of a variety deciduous
forests and woodlands. It is rarely reported as being associated
with&nbsp;conifers, although Cavers and others [<a href="#15">15</a>] state that 7 of 37 tree and shrub species found growing over garlic mustard in eastern Canada
were coniferous.
While not intended as an exhaustive or definitive list, the following are
specific examples of communities in which garlic mustard has been found.<p><u>Oak savanna/eastern
prairie</u>: In
northern Illinois
prairie and savanna remnants, garlic mustard is an important herb layer species in areas
with greater relative shade. Associated herbs include rue anemone (<i>Thalictrum thalictroides</i>), broadleaf enchanter's
nightshade (<i>Circaea lutetiana</i>), starry false lily-of-the-valley (<i>Maianthemum
stellatum</i>), jumpseed (<i>Polygonum virginianum</i>), Atlantic camas (<i>Camassia
schilloides</i>), spotted geranium (<i>Geranium maculatum</i>), and avens (<i>Geum</i>
spp.) [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Garlic mustard was present
along the fringes of a white oak-northern red oak (<i>Quercus alba-Q.
rubra</i>) savanna in northern
Illinois [<a href="#29">29</a>].

<p><u>Xeric upland eastern deciduous forest</u>: Garlic mustard is
present in black oak (<i>Q. velutina</i>)-dominated sand forest in central Illinois, especially in
disturbed areas, and along nearby shaded roadsides. Herbaceous associates
at 1 site included hog peanut (<i>Amphicarpa bracteat</i>a), lambsquarters (<i>Chenopodium
album</i>),
broadleaf enchanter's nightshade, white snakeroot (<i>Ageratina altissima</i>), licorice
bedstraw (<i>Galium circaezans</i>), beggarslice (<i>Hackelia virginiana</i>), Carolina
leaf-flower (<i>Phyllanthus caroliniensis</i>), and feathery false lily-of-the-valley
(<i>Maianthemum racemosum</i>) [<a href="#54">54</a>].</p>


<p><u>Mesic upland eastern deciduous forest</u>:<br>
Northeast - Garlic mustard occurs in upland oak-hickory
(<i>Quercus-Carya</i> spp.) forest in New
Jersey [<a href="#14">14</a>], and was present in the herb layer of a sugar
maple (<i>Acer saccharum</i>)-dominated stand in southwestern Vermont, along with
jewelweed (<i>Impatiens capensis</i>), ladyfern (<i>Athyrium filix-femina</i>), intermediate
wood fern (<i>Dryopteris intermedia</i>), Christmas fern (<i>Polystichum
acrostichoides</i>), Canadian white violet (<i>Viola canadensis</i>), Jack-in-the-pulpit (<i>Arisaema triphyllum</i>), and rosy sedge (<i>Carex rosea</i>) [<a href="#90">90</a>].&nbsp;</p>


<p>
Midwest - In southwestern Ohio it
is found under sugar
maple, white oak, northern red
oak, American elm (<i>Ulmus americana</i>), and hickory (<i>Carya</i> spp.), along with herbaceous associates cutleaf
toothwort (<i>Cardamine concatenata</i>), stickywilly (<i>Galium aparine</i>), Virginia
springbeauty (<i>Claytonia virginica</i>), toadshade (<i>Trillium sessile</i>),
Jack-in-the-pulpit, mayapple (<i>Podophyllum peltatum</i>), Clayton's sweetroot
(<i>Osmorhiza claytonii</i>), downy yellow violet (<i>Viola pubescens</i>), and touch-me-not
(<i>Impatiens</i> spp.) [<a href="#19">19</a>].&nbsp; In west-central
Ohio, garlic mustard is associated with sugar maple, American beech (<i>Fagus grandifolia</i>),
hickories, oaks, and slippery elm
(<i>Ulmus rubra</i>). Herbaceous associates include toadshade, wild blue phlox (<i>Phlox divaricata</i>), running strawberry
bush (<i>Euonymus obovata</i>),
common periwinkle (<i>Vinca minor</i>), white panicle aster (<i>Symphyotrichum
lanceolatum</i>), whiteflower leafcup (<i>Polymnia canadensis</i>) , wild leek (<i>Allium
tricoccum</i>), Adam-and-Eve (<i>Aplectrum hyemale</i>), and goldenrod (<i>Solidago</i>
spp.) [<a href="#24">24</a>].&nbsp;</p>


<p> In central Indiana
native forest remnants in a rural agricultural matrix, garlic mustard occurred
across the field-forest ecotone, from open areas into the forest interior.
Dominant overstory species were sugar maple and American beech at some sites; other sites also included American basswood (<i>Tilia americana</i>), white ash, and several oak and hickory
species [<a href="#12">12</a>]. Garlic mustard is listed as an understory associate in
several sugar maple-basswood and sugar maple-basswood-white ash habitat types in
southern Wisconsin. Common ground flora for these similar habitat types include
broadleaf enchanter's nightshade, feathery false lily-of-the-valley, spotted
geranium (<i>Geranium maculatum</i>), white avens (<i>Geum canadense</i>),
mayapple, Jack-in-the-pulpit, whip-poor-will flower (<i>Trillium
cernuum</i>), American lopseed (<i>Phryma leptostachya</i>),
riverbank grape (<i>Vitis riparia</i>), Clayton's sweetroot, pointedleaf tick
trefoil
(<i>Desmodium glutinosum</i>), rattlesnake fern (<i>Botrychium virgianum</i>),
Maryland sanicle (<i>Sanicula marilandica</i>), bloodroot (<i>Sanguinaria
canadensis</i>), blue cohosh (<i>Caulophyllum thalictroides</i>), early meadow-rue
(<i>Thalictrum dioicum</i>), Shawnee salad (<i>Hydrophyllum virginianum</i>),
bristly greenbrier (<i>Smilax tamnoides</i>), sharplobe hepatica (<i>Hepatica
nobilis</i>), and Canadian woodnettle (<i>Laportea canadensis</i>) [<a href="#36">36</a>].&nbsp;</p>


<p> Garlic mustard was invasive in the herb layer of a
northern Illinois mesic upland white oak forest, with additional herbaceous layer
components consisting of cutleaf toothwort (<i>Cardamine concatenata</i>), snow
trillium (<i>Trillium grandiflorum</i>), bloody butcher (<i>Trillium recurvatum</i>),
dogtooth violet (<i>Erythronium americanum</i>), Shawnee salad, wild
leek, rock polypody (<i>Polypodium virginianum</i>), mayapple, and whip-poor-will flower
[<a href="#30">30</a>], and was abundant in a northern Illinois dry-mesic forest
with a white
oak and black oak overstory [<a href="#49">49</a>]. Another northern Illinois location mentioning the
presence of garlic mustard included a forested site dominated by a slippery elm, white oak
and white ash overstory and nodding wakerobin (<i>Trillium flexipes</i>), bloody butcher, spotted geranium
and feathery false lily-of-the-valley in the herb layer, as well as a sugar maple, white ash, white oak
forest with a variety of herbaceous spring ephemerals [<a href="#53">53</a>]. Also in
northern Illinois, a large population of garlic mustard was found in a white oak-northern red
oak-black walnut (<i>Juglans nigra</i>) woodland with a native herbaceous layer of broadleaf
enchanter's nightshade, Jack-in-the-pulpit, stickywilly, and
spotted geranium [<a href="#67">67</a>].</p>


<p> Garlic mustard, Virginia creeper (<i>Parthenocissus
quinquefolia</i>), and wild grape (<i>Vitis vulpina</i>) are common in the understory of
a northern Kentucky hardwood
forest dominated by white ash (<i>Fraxinus americana</i>), black locust (<i>Robinia
pseudoacacia</i>), and American elm [<a href="#39">39</a>].
Another Kentucky forest with an overstory of sugar maple and white ash is
dominated by garlic mustard in the herb layer. Downy yellow violet, stickywilly, wild blue phlox, Virginia creeper,
Canadian wildginger (<i>Asarum canadense</i>), Virginia springbeauty, mayapple, common
chickweed (<i>Stellaria media</i>),
largeleaf waterleaf (<i>Hydrophyllum macrophyllum</i>), nodding fescue (<i>Festuca
subverticillata</i>), bleeding heart (<i>Dicentra</i> spp.), and sedge (<i>Carex</i>
spp.) are associated herbs [<a href="#41">41</a>].&nbsp;</p>


<p><u>Lowland eastern deciduous forest</u>:<br>
Northeast - Garlic mustard is mentioned as an understory herb in a willow-box
elder (<i>Salix</i> spp.-<i>Acer negundo</i>), silver maple (<i>A. saccharinum</i>) habitat type on Long Island,
New York
[<a href="#28">28</a>], and was
reported as occurring
under a dense canopy of silver maple and ash species in a floodplain forest along
the Raritan River in New Jersey [<a href="#14">14</a>]. Garlic
mustard was prevalent in the herb layer of a Maryland Potomac River floodplain
forest dominated by American sycamore (<i>Platanus occidentalis</i>), common
hackberry (<i>Celtis occidentalis</i>), and box elder.&nbsp;Common herb
layer associates at this location included bluntleaf waterleaf (<i>Hydrophyllum
canadense</i>), and Canadian
woodnettle, along with the exotic ground ivy (<i>Glecoma
hederacea</i> L.) [<a href="#60">60</a>]. A study
conducted on 2 upper Allegheny River islands in northwestern Pennsylvania
found garlic mustard frequently occurring under a dominant overstory of silver
maple and American sycamore, along with groundlayer associates common blue
violet (<i>Viola sororia</i>), white
avens, Canadian clearweed (<i>Pilea pumila</i>), fringed loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia
ciliata</i>), creeping jenny (<i>Lysimachia nummularia</i>), white snakeroot (<i>Ageratina
altissima</i>),
narrowleaf bittercress (<i>Cardamine impatiens</i>), sensitive fern (<i>Onoclea
sensibilis</i>), reed canarygrass (<i>Phalaris arundinacea</i>), whitegrass (<i>Leersia
virginica</i>), and
hairyfruit sedge (<i>Carex trichocarpa</i>) [<a href="#85">85</a>].&nbsp;


<p> Midwest - Trimbur [<a href="#74">74</a>] studied garlic
mustard from 4 floodplain sites in central Ohio. Common overstory associates
for these sites were: i) boxelder, sugar maple, and American sycamore; ii) elm,
boxelder, eastern cottonwood (<i>Populus deltoides</i>), and American sycamore; iii) elm, maple, swamp
white oak (<i>Quercus bicolor</i>); and iv) ash&nbsp; cherry (<i>Prunus</i>  spp.), elm, Ohio
buckeye (<i>Aesculus glabra</i>), honey-locust (<i>Gleditsia triacanthos</i>), and black locust. Common herbaceous species for the same
sites were: i) violet (<i>viola</i> spp.), stinging nettle (<i>Urtica dioica</i>), white avens, common
cowparsnip (<i>Heracleum maximum</i>),
jewelweed, and Maryland sanicle; ii) Canadian wildginger,
common cowparsnip, Canadian woodnettle, Maryland sanicle, pale touch-me-not, and
Canadian honewort (<i>Cryptotaenia canadensis</i>); iii) sweetroot spp., white avens, Canadian wildginger, fragrant
bedstraw (<i>Galium triflorum</i>), whiteflower leafcup (<i>Polymnia
canadensis</i>), and poison-ivy (<i>Toxicodendron radicans</i>); and iv) sweetroot spp., white avens, jewelweed, and Maryland
sanicle. Garlic
mustard was found in a southwestern Ohio floodplain under sugar
maple, black walnut and white ash, along with Canadian wildginger, cutleaf
toothwort, clustered blacksnakeroot (<i>Sanicula odorata</i>), feathery-false-lily-of-the-valley,
longstyle sweetroot (<i>Osmorhiza longistylis</i>), jumpseed (<i>Polygonum
virginianum</i>), wild leek, nodding wakerobin, Canadian clearweed,
limestone bittercress (<i>Cardamine douglassii</i>), Canadian woodnettle, smooth Solomon's
seal (<i>Polygonatum biflorum</i>), and touch-me-not [<a href="#19">19</a>]. Garlic mustard was also found in the understory of a young red
maple (<i>Acer rubrum</i>)-silver maple stand in
lowland forest in west central Ohio along with herb layer associates jewelweed,
Greek valerian (<i>Polemonium reptans</i>), nightcaps (<i>Anemone quinquefolia</i>), violet, meadow parsnip, sanicle, and
sweetroot [<a href="#24">24</a>]. Garlic mustard was a
common understory component in ravine bottoms in a northern Kentucky hardwood
forest dominated by sugar maple, white ash, American sycamore, and box elder. Additional
herb layer components included common chickweed, Canadian clearweed, trumpet
creeper (<i>Campsis radicans</i>), mayapple, hairy wildrye (<i>Elymus villosus</i>)
and Canadian wildginger [<a href="#41">41</a>]. Garlic mustard was present in a black maple (<i>Acer nigrum</i>)-American
basswood-black walnut-dominated forest
with a rich herbaceous cover in
the floodplain of the Pecatonica River in northern Illinois [<a href="#53">53</a>].

Use of garlic mustard
as a forage species by white-tailed deer is unclear [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>]. White-tailed deer
may avoid grazing garlic mustard in
favor of native herbaceous plants, although this has not been empirically
tested [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>]. It is likely that white-tailed deer graze a variety of understory herb species in areas typically susceptible
to garlic mustard invasion, and can have a dramatic negative impact on
some native herb populations [<a href="#1">1</a>]. Deer grazing of native herbaceous plants may enhance garlic mustard at the expense of native species by
providing small-scale soil disturbance and by reducing interspecific competition.
White-tailed deer may provide small-scale
disturbances suitable for garlic mustard colonization within forested areas by trampling and exposing
soil. In addition, selective herbivory may enhance garlic mustard at the expense
of the preferred native species [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].

<p>Garlic mustard may be deleterious
to some species of butterfly. Adults of several butterfly species lay eggs on garlic mustard instead of their
native plant hosts.
Because larval development on garlic mustard is often fatally inhibited, this
can result in garlic mustard acting as a population sink for these butterfly
species, a particularly perilous problem for rare species such as the West
Virginia white butterfly (<i>Pieris virginiensis</i>) [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].

<a name="IMPACTS AND CONTROL">
IMPACTS AND CONTROL:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT">Impacts</font>: The control of garlic mustard may be desirable to
mitigate displacement of native herbaceous species, especially in relatively
undisturbed deciduous forests of the eastern and midwestern United States and southern
Ontario [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>]. In forested natural
areas, garlic mustard has the potential to dominate the herb layer [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>]. Invasion of mature eastern deciduous forests by
garlic mustard is notable because these habitats were thought to be relatively
resistant to nonindigenous plant invasion, particularly by herbaceous species [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>]. From the results of
a greenhouse study examining the competitive potential of garlic mustard,
Meekins and McCarthy [<a href="#45">45</a>] postulated that competition for light within dense
garlic mustard stands might inhibit oak regeneration in the understory of
eastern deciduous woodlands. However, this same study failed to show
greater levels of interspecific competition among garlic mustard, jewelweed, and box elder, 2 potential understory associates. McCarthy [<a href="#43">43</a>] demonstrated
that removal of garlic mustard from a deciduous forest understory resulted in increased
richness and abundance of understory species,
especially annuals and woody perennials. Garlic mustard may be particularly detrimental to
native spring ephemerals in eastern deciduous forest understories [<a href="#15">15</a>]. McCarthy [<a href="#43">43</a>] failed to demonstrate a link between the
magnitude of garlic mustard infestation and native species diversity. Removal
experiments, while providing some insight into possible effects of nonindigenous
plant invaders, may be inherently limited in their ability to reflect impacts of
invasives on preinvasion communities [<a href="#84">84</a>].&nbsp;Limited
and conflicting evidence surrounding the assumption that garlic mustard infestation necessarily results in reduced
richness and cover of native herbaceous species points out the critical need for
more research in this area.

<p>The allelopathic potential of garlic mustard has received some study, with
mixed results. McCarthy and Hanson [<a href="#44">44</a>] found little evidence of allelopathic
effects of garlic mustard on several plant species studied.&nbsp;They attributed
the success of garlic mustard invasiveness strictly to its competitive
abilities. Other evidence indicates at least the
possibility for allelopathic interference between garlic mustard
and neighboring
herbaceous plants, as well as the possibility for toxicity against mycorrhizal
fungi [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. Roberts and Anderson [<a href="#64">64</a>] found a significant negative correlation
(r<sup>2 </sup>= 0.29; P&lt; 0.05) between garlic mustard density
in the field and the mycorrhizal inoculum potential of the soil. McCarthy [<a href="#43">43</a>] found garlic mustard inhibited
establishment of seedlings of other species, yet no quantitative relationship
could be discerned between garlic mustard biomass and native species diversity.
This finding suggests that the mere presence of garlic mustard depresses native diversity, perhaps an allelopathic effect.
Further research is needed to a) determine what mechanisms, if any, are
responsible for garlic mustard allelopathy, and b) sort out the relative
effects of allelopathy vs. resource competition in interactions between garlic
mustard and native plants.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Control:</font> The biology of garlic mustard presents significant challenges to its control
because it simultaneously possesses characteristics of native forest herbs such
as shade tolerance and relatively large seeds, as well as characteristics often
ascribed to weeds such as xenogamy and autogamy, and high seed production and germination under a range of environmental
conditions. It is also not impacted by its native herbivores and parasites [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>]. While garlic mustard invades relatively undisturbed woodlands,
invasion may be expedited by natural and anthropogenic disturbance that removes
competing native vegetation. Once garlic
mustard becomes established, further dispersal and perpetuation within a
particular habitat may require little to no further disturbance [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].</p>

<p>
Deciduous forest
fragments that are isolated in an otherwise predominantly agricultural landscape
may be more resistant to garlic mustard invasion, due to limited seed sources and inhibitive
dispersal distances [<a href="#12">12</a>]. However, in areas with large
populations of white-tailed deer, even these insular forest remnants may become
colonized by garlic mustard.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
As with most invasive plants, deterrence is the
most effective strategy against garlic mustard. This includes annual monitoring
and removal of all invading plants prior to seed production. Garlic mustard is
prolific partly because of its ability to self-pollinate. A single individual
can produce large numbers of genetically
similar but interfertile progeny, which in turn may colonize even small, local
microsite disturbances, leading to a potential garlic mustard outbreak. Allaying invasion may
require reducing habitat perturbation in susceptible areas and promoting
the health of native plant communities [<a href="#3">3</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
Garlic mustard population densities may oscillate widely from
year to year [<a href="#55">55</a>]. Its biennial nature and its seed banking propensity can lead
to occasions in which dense stands of garlic mustard appear where none were
apparent the year before, and then seemingly disappear the following year only
to reappear yet again in subsequent seasons. Further, in years where rosettes
are apparently sparse and may evade detection, those monitoring such sites may
easily but falsely conclude that garlic mustard is absent. In previously
infested areas or areas of suspected susceptibility, careful annual monitoring
may be the only way to ensure that garlic mustard is indeed absent from the
site. 
</p>

<p>Once garlic mustard appears within an area,
management activities should focus on preventing seed production. While
most seeds of garlic mustard tend to germinate during the 1st or 2nd spring
following their production, a small number of seeds remain
within the seed bank and may germinate over the next several years. Because garlic mustard
seed banks may remain viable for up to 6 years, long-term control for a particular stand
requires vigilant attention for several consecutive seasons [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].
Even after successful management leads to the apparent absence of garlic
mustard, continued periodic monitoring is prudent. A method for destroying
seeds of garlic mustard in the soil that would not harm seeds of other species
has not been determined [<a href="#7">7</a>]. 
</p>

<p>Because of the biennial
life-history strategy of garlic mustard, eradication treatments conducted during spring,
after seedlings have germinated and before adults can produce viable seed, have
the advantage of affecting 2 generations simultaneously [<a href="#49">49</a>]. Ideally, this
maximizes the kill of new germinants and seedlings, as well as prevents seed
production in adults. Since natural mortality is greatest at the seedling stage garlic mustard may be most vulnerable to control
efforts during this time [<a href="#20">20</a>]. One potential downside to this strategy is that delaying treatment
too late into spring risks unwanted effects on native spring emergents.
</p>

<p>An alternative approach
is to delay management activities until after the 1st growing season to take
advantage of significant natural mortality of rosettes. First year garlic
mustard mortality at a site in northern Illinois was estimated at greater than 95%
between April and November [<a href="#51">51</a>]. This strategy may be especially
prudent when the control method requires intensive labor, such as cutting or
hand-pulling plants, if minimizing quantities of applied chemicals is desired,
or simply if costs of more intensive management activities are prohibitive.
</p>

<p>
Control of garlic mustard has been tested using
several different methods. Since
a single control method is rarely 100% effective, a combination of more than 1 may often be a useful
strategy. Regardless of
methodology, treatments for eradication of garlic mustard must be applied over
the entire area of infestation to prevent seed production.
</p>

<p>Manual or Mechanical Removal: Pulling entire plants may be an effective
method for control of garlic mustard. Care should
be taken to remove as much of the root system as possible, to reduce resprouting
potential. Pulling can cause soil disturbance and redistribute
seeds stored within the upper soil horizons. This problem may be mitigated by
thoroughly tamping disturbed soil after pulling. Generally speaking, cutting
results in fewer disturbances than pulling. However, pulling may be done at any
time during the plant lifecycle, while cutting must be performed during the 2nd growing season while the flowering stem is elongating. Due to the labor-intensive nature of cutting and pulling plants,
these
practices may only be practical in small or lightly infested areas, especially
where burning or herbicide application is inadvisable [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].
Hand removal may be most useful for preventing establishment of new garlic
mustard colonies in previously uninfested areas [<a href="#43">43</a>].</p>

<p> Control may be accomplished by cutting flowering stems, i.e. using sickles,
clippers, or string trimmers, prior to seed
production and dissemination. Cutting as close to
ground level as possible appears to be most effective. Nuzzo [<a href="#49">49</a>] found that
cutting at ground level killed 99% of plants and resulted in virtually no seed
production, while cutting at 4 inches (10 cm) resulted in 71% mortality and 98% lower total
seed production. Mortality was 6% in control plants during the 3-month study period. Cutting
plants prior to full flowering or the onset of seed development may result in
production of additional flowering stems from buds located on the root crown [<a href="#55">55</a>]. However, waiting until after plants have finished flowering risks
dissemination of viable seed. Cut or pulled plant material should
consequently be removed from the site and destroyed whenever possible to
minimize the risk of inadvertently distributing viable seed [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>]. 
</p>

<p>Mowing may be similar
in effect to cutting, but with more possible negative consequences. Mowing of flowering
plants may result in regrowth of new flowering shoots, although this response
reportedly diminishes as the season progresses [<a href="#15">15</a>]. While mowing may be convenient in large, relatively open areas of
infestation such as roadsides, this practice may be more problematic than
cutting, as described above. Mowing may promote seed dispersal and is more
likely to be indiscriminate regarding which plant species are destroyed. Mowing equipment may also create more disturbed
habitat that is likely to be recolonized by garlic mustard [<a href="#55">55</a>]. 
</p>

<p>Prescribed Fire: In areas with a
fire-tolerant native flora, frequent prescribed burning may deter garlic mustard
invasion by both directly killing invading plants, and perhaps in some areas by
enhancing growth of native herbaceous competitors and thereby reducing habitat
for garlic mustard colonization [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>]. For more information about
using prescribed fire as a management tool to control garlic mustard, please see
the Fire Management Considerations section of the Fire
Effects section of this summary.
</p>

<p>Chemical Control: Chemical control of invasive plants such as garlic mustard
can be effective, particularly against large areas of infestation or dense
monotypic colonies, and especially when considered within the context of an
integrated management plan [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>]. This report briefly examines the
effectiveness of selected chemicals for controlling garlic mustard, some issues
involved in the timing of application, and potential effects on native plant
communities. Use of herbicides in natural areas should be cautiously considered,
and appropriate education and training should be sought before proceeding.
Particular caution should be exercised with the use of Bentazon or Acifluorfen.
Bentazon is very soluble in water and does not bind to soil well, leading to
potential groundwater contamination problems. Acifluorfen is toxic to fish, is
moderately persistent in soil and kills native grasses and herbs, and can cause
serious eye injury [<a href="#79">79</a>]. For further information regarding the use of herbicides
in natural areas for control
of this and other invasive plant species, see
the <a href="https://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/handbook.html">Weed Control Methods Handbook</a>
[<a href="#76">76</a>].</p>

<p>The effectiveness of 2,4-D against garlic mustard is questionable [<a href="#55">55</a>]. Use of 2,4-D in mixtures with
other chemicals may improve its effectiveness, but scant evidence is available [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].
</p>

<p>Application of 1% and 2% glyphosate during the dormant season significantly
(p &lt; 0.05) reduced adult garlic mustard cover and density in mesic
and dry-mesic upland forest and mesic floodplain forest in northern Illinois,
but also damaged other species that were green at the time, especially sedges
and white avens [<a href="#53">53</a>]. Treatment with foliar
applied glyphosate also significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced adult densities of
garlic mustard, regardless of spring
or fall application, in northern Illinois oak woodland. Seedling frequency in
these same plots was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) reduced by spring application [<a href="#49">49</a>].
</p>

<p>Dormant-season application of bentazon was less effective at controlling
garlic mustard in northern Illinois mesic deciduous forest, but showed none of the
nontarget kill associated with glyphosate.
At these same sites, application of acifluorfen during dormant season was highly effective against
garlic mustard, but also killed most
native herbaceous vegetation, which was mainly dormant at the time of application
[<a href="#53">53</a>].
</p>

<p>Use of
systemic, nonselective herbicides during the growing season may not be practical
in some areas due to deleterious effects on native ground-layer competitors. In
these cases, dormant season application may be preferable in order to maintain viable
populations of native competitors [<a href="#49">49</a>]. Nuzzo [<a href="#49">49</a>] found no
difference in effect between single herbicide application and twice applied
treatment to the same generation of plants (spring and fall of the same
year, fall and the following spring, or 2 consecutive springs). It was
suggested that management efforts focus on single applications to successive
generations of plants. Fall herbicide
application may be a prudent option when risk of negatively affecting native
spring-emergent herbs exists. Higher garlic
mustard rosette densities in fall may require higher volumes of applied herbicide to be
effective [<a href="#51">51</a>].
</p>

<p>Mid-summer application of bentazon reduced garlic mustard cover by 94-96% in previously dense stands of
garlic mustard rosettes in northern Illinois. Similar applications of acifluoren
were less effective, but still significantly reduced garlic mustard cover by
30-46%. Mortality in control plots over the same period was 15%, and
not statistically significant. Chemical control activities conducted during the
growing season, as above, might be justified when target species densities
overwhelm the native flora [<a href="#52">52</a>]. 
</p>

Biological Control: Biological control
methods for garlic mustard are not yet developed, but investigations are under
way. Several insects that are associated with garlic mustard in its native
European habitats are being tested to examine their potential effectiveness as
control agents [<a href="#55">55</a>]. Fungal pathogens may also have some potential use
against garlic mustard. For instance, <span class="subframeContent">garlic mustard has
shown susceptibility to a fusarium root rot (<i>Fusarium solani</i>) [<a href="#16">16</a>].

GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Garlic mustard is an established, cool-season, monocarpic, taprooted, herbaceous biennial
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>] or occasional winter
annual [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>]. The common name is derived from the scent of garlic, which is
noticeably exuded by its aboveground plant parts, especially foliage [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].<p>Seedlings develop into rosettes
0.8-4 inches (2-10 cm) in diameter during the 1st growing season. Mature plants produce erect flowering stems up to
4.13 feet (1.25 m) high [<a href="#15">15</a>]. Each rosette usually produces a single flowering stem, although
 multiple stems from a single rosette occur occasionally [<a href="#41">41</a>]. Flowers are borne in racemes, with fully expanded
corollas 0.12-0.48 inches (3-12 mm) across [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>]. Average plant biomass is quite variable within
a habitat, between habitats, or between generations within the same habitat, and
is strongly influenced by light. Plants grown under higher irradiance levels
 typically produce greater biomass per plant [<a href="#3">3</a>].

<p>Seeds are produced in pods (siliques) up to 6 inches (15 cm) in length [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. Fully
developed siliques typically contain 12-19 seeds, and the number of siliques per
plant can vary greatly from 1 to more than 200 [<a href="#74">74</a>]. Seeds are oblong to nearly cylindrical [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>] and about 0.12
inch (3 mm) long
[<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].</p>

<font face="Bell MT">
Pollination:</font> 
Garlic mustard is capable of self-pollinization, as well as cross-fertilization
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>]: both seem equivalent
in effectiveness. Self-pollination often takes place before flowers open [<a href="#3">3</a>], although variation in this ability may exist between
populations [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>]. Cross-pollination has been observed to occur via generalist insect
pollinators, providing a high likelihood of pollination wherever garlic mustard
occurs [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].

<p><font face="Bell MT">
Seed production:</font> 
Because a large percentage of flowers typically set fruit, and most ovules
develop seeds, garlic mustard is a prodigious seed producer [<a href="#17">17</a>]. Seed production varies between and within sites and between years, but under shaded,
moist (apparently favorable) conditions, dense stands may produce &gt; 100,000 seeds/m<sup>2</sup> [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>]. Seed production in Ohio ranged from
165 to 868
seeds/plant, depending on habitat and population density [<a href="#74">74</a>]. The
number of seeds per silique
in a southern Ontario study varied from 6 to
22 with an average of 16. The number of siliques varied greatly, from 1 or 2
on small plants to up to 150 per plant [<a href="#15">15</a>]. Seed production in several states
was as follows:</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT">
Seed dispersal: </font>In forested areas, garlic mustard is typically
1st seen along trails
and streams, and can quickly spread via seeds throughout the forest within a few
generations [<a href="#7">7</a>]. Seeds generally fall within a few meters of the plant [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>], and may be ballistically
dispelled from siliques [<a href="#49">49</a>]. Wind dispersal is doubtful. Seeds stick together
when damp and adhere readily to small soil clusters [<a href="#15">15</a>]. Seed dispersal rates may accelerate along river corridors
[<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>], although there are conflicting reports regarding the ability of
seeds to float [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>]. Humans may also spread seeds. Garlic mustard often invades natural areas along roads and trails,
purportedly via seed transport on muddy boots or pant cuffs. Seed dispersal may
also be facilitated by roadside mowing, as well as on mud-encrusted automobile
tires [<a href="#50">50</a>]. Animals, especially white-tailed deer, may promote
seed
dispersal and spread of garlic mustard. Deer are thought to provide an important
seed dispersal vector
over short distances by transporting seeds in their fur, although this has not been
tested as of this writing [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>]. Foraging deer may create microsite disturbances
favorable to garlic mustard dispersal by mixing mineral soil and garlic mustard
seeds [<a href="#49">49</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
Germination:</font>
Seeds of garlic mustard require cold stratification before they can germinate,
with 1 season's overwintering usually sufficient to break dormancy at
most North American locations [<a href="#7">7</a>]. An additional year of
dormancy was reportedly required prior to germination in southern Ontario [<a href="#15">15</a>], and this lengthier dormancy period may be required in
other northern locations [<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>]. Germination often occurs in early spring and can occur at temperatures approaching
32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 �C) [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>].
Low-temperature germination is ecologically important because garlic mustard
seedlings incur a competitive advantage by being the 1st germinants of the
season [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].&nbsp;
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
Seed banking:</font>    Garlic mustard produces small but potentially
important seed banks. Seed viability has been shown to drop
off substantially after the 1st growing season following stratification,
indicating seed banks of garlic mustard are relatively short lived [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>]. In a study of garlic mustard seed biology, roughly
88% of seeds that germinated did so during the 1st spring following
production [<a href="#7">7</a>]. In a study comparing garlic mustard populations from
contrasting habitats in New Jersey, 3 out of 4 populations were found to
maintain a seed bank. The 4th population was located in a seasonal floodplain
where flooding actions were thought to either remove the seedbank or produce a
patchy distribution that was difficult to sample [<a href="#14">14</a>].</p>

<p>
A small percentage of seeds may remain viable for 4-6 years [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>]. Because
garlic mustard is a prodigious seed producer, elimination of a single season's
crop may not suffice to eradicate the species from an area because germination
and survival of only a few individuals in subsequent years may quickly lead to
repopulation at or near previous levels [<a href="#7">7</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
Seedling establishment/growth: </font>Garlic mustard seedlings emerge in early
spring, just
before or simultaneous with germination of native spring ephemerals [<a href="#49">49</a>]. They establish
during periods of relatively high light availability in the forest understory prior to canopy
leaf-out, typically with reduced interspecific competition
and drought potential [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].&nbsp;Greatest mortality
rates occur in spring during the seedling stage [<a href="#15">15</a>]. Seedling mortality
can vary substantially, often depending on moisture availability [<a href="#14">14</a>]. Initial
seedling density may be very high (20,000 seedlings/m<sup>2</sup>) [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>]. In
reports where natural spring seedling densities were approximately 3,100 to 5,600/m<sup>2</sup>, only about 1% to 16% survived
to produce flowers the following year [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].
Two consecutive cohorts retained similar numbers of mature flowering plants during their
2nd spring, despite having initial seedling densities differing by more than
100% [<a href="#3">3</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
Asexual regeneration:</font> Garlic mustard spreads exclusively by seeds, with
no reports of vegetative reproduction [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].</p>



<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SITE CHARACTERISTICS">
SITE CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Garlic mustard has a wide tolerance of
environmental conditions for growth and reproduction,&nbsp;including
moisture regimes ranging from periodically flooded areas to dry sand forest [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>], light environments ranging from open fields to
shaded forest interior [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>], and a
range of various soil characteristics including texture [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>], nutrient
level [<a href="#14">14</a>], organic matter content [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>], and pH [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>]. It is apparently
not found on acid soils in Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, or the Canadian Shield region [<a href="#15">15</a>], and is absent
from undrained peat and muck soils [<a href="#49">49</a>]. 

Garlic mustard may be less competitive in areas with low soil pH,
as evidenced by an experiment demonstrating a significant positive correlation
(r = 0.98; p &lt; 0.001) between plant dry weight and soil pH. This has been hypothesized as a contributing
factor in the limited colonization of garlic mustard in the southern third of
Illinois, where soils are more acidic than in the more heavily colonized central
and northern sections of the state [<a href="#4">4</a>]. Inhibition
of garlic mustard by
acidic soils may explain its apparent absence
from conifer-dominated communities [<a href="#66">66</a>].

<p>
Garlic mustard
 appears to favor shaded sites [<a href="#50">50</a>], and is often found in
dense groups of nearly pure stands, sometimes covering large areas, particularly
under moist shaded conditions such as mature eastern deciduous woodlands. In
drier or more open areas plants increase allocation to fruit
production, perhaps in response to observed declines in seed weight, seed germination, and
seedling survivorship [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>]. While biomass
production may be greatest under full sun [<a href="#15">15</a>], and garlic
mustard plants
can also be found under dense shade, they are most commonly found in woodland
understories with partial shade and are probably less invasive under extreme
conditions of light or shade [<a href="#49">49</a>]. Nuzzo [<a href="#50">50</a>] describes
typical habitat in Illinois as mesic upland or floodplain forest, usually shaded, and often
associated with some type of disturbance. Despite its apparent
affinity for moist shaded environments, garlic mustard
is not tolerant of growing season
inundation, which may limit its ability to invade wetland communities [<a href="#49">49</a>].

</p>

<p>
Most populations of garlic mustard appear to be connected to some form of
disturbance [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>]. Garlic mustard is often
associated with anthropogenic disturbance such as trails, roads, or
railroads [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>], and less commonly, in farm fields and gardens [<a href="#50">50</a>]. Garlic mustard is
sometimes linked to naturally disturbed habitats such as floodplains and
riverbanks, where the combination of flooding as a dispersal agent and moist,
shaded conditions may promote invasion [<a href="#46">46</a>]. Garlic mustard was invasive in relatively undisturbed woodlands in
central Illinois. Establishment was thought to occur where small-scale
anthropogenic and natural disturbance removed competing vegetation, such as areas browsed by white-tailed deer [<a href="#3">3</a>].&nbsp;Experiments
examining mechanisms that link disturbance and garlic mustard occurrence and
spread are scarce. One study showed that disturbance of soil in a young hardwood forest in northern Kentucky resulted in lowered garlic mustard
densities
compared to undisturbed plots [<a href="#39">39</a>]. An experiment in a southwestern Ohio
deciduous forest examined the effects of small-scale litter disturbance on
garlic mustard invasiveness. There were no differences (p = 0.7184) in garlic
mustard germination, rosette survival, growth, or reproduction among total
litter removal, partial litter removal, and control treatments, indicating that
forest floor disturbance alone may not be a prerequisite for invasion [<a href="#46">46</a>]. More
research is needed to help understand factors that influence garlic mustard
invasiveness and habitat invasibility, particularly for the role of
disturbance.&nbsp;In particular, questions involving which life history traits
are affected by disturbance seem most appropriate. Experiments that separate disturbance-mediated dispersal from other interactions between
disturbance and garlic mustard invasiveness might provide important insights
leading to more effective management prescriptions.

<br />


Garlic mustard occurs in communities that represent a wide range
of successional stages, from prairie openings to understories of mature,
shade-tolerant eastern hardwood forests. While garlic mustard colonizes a variety of sites, it is
often mentioned with particular concern to invasiveness in the herb layer of mature eastern
deciduous forests, since these communities were thought to be somewhat
resistant to invasion by nonindigenous plants (see &quot;Impacts and Control&quot; in the
&quot;Management Considerations&quot;
section of this summary). In some areas of eastern deciduous forest, dense garlic mustard stands may
inhibit recruitment of woody seedlings, perhaps altering successional
trajectories [<a href="#45">45</a>].


<p>
The ability of garlic mustard to invade and compete in habitats with light
environments ranging from partial to deep shade may be due to its
ability to acclimate to variation in irradiance [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>]. Despite substantial plasticity
in photosynthetic response to variation in irradiance, photosynthetic rates of
garlic mustard at high light levels lag behind those of species typically found
in unshaded environments, inhibiting the competitiveness of garlic mustard under
these conditions [<a href="#20">20</a>]. Nevertheless, the ability of the
species to acclimate to a wide range of light environments almost certainly
contributes to its ubiquitous and invasive nature [<a href="#2">2</a>].
</p>


<p>Garlic mustard is often mentioned in association with oak savannah
communities which, when viewed from the context of fire as the determinant of
successional trajectory, represent a transitional state between grassland and
forest. For example, garlic mustard was present mainly in areas of
lower ambient light levels
in a northern Illinois oak savanna remnant, invading where reduced fire
frequency resulted in increased tree canopy cover [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Because the
presence of garlic mustard may inhibit the ability of a forest understory to carry
 surface fire [<a href="#49">49</a>], invasion of garlic mustard could potentially
 accelerate succession in these oak savannas by further suppressing fire.
</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT">
SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Garlic mustard seedlings almost always emerge in early spring. In shaded areas growth is rapid
until deciduous trees form leaves, after which growth slows. Garlic
mustard growing in more open areas may continue steady production of new leaves
into summer [<a href="#74">74</a>]. Germination usually
occurs in February or March, depending on conditions and location [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>]. There are
reports of germination being triggered by the 1st warm rains of the season
[<a href="#49">49</a>].

<p>Seedlings develop into rosettes early during the 1st
growing season. In central Illinois, garlic mustard leaf area increased into early June, then
declined
slightly or remained nearly constant until the following spring [<a href="#3">3</a>]. Rosettes overwinter and
may retain considerable green leaf tissue. They are capable of winter growth during periods of 
above-freezing temperatures
and no snow cover [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>], although some leaf tissue
may be destroyed by
extended periods of subfreezing temperatures [<a href="#3">3</a>].
Anderson and others [<a href="#3">3</a>] observed that new leaf growth was initiated
when temperatures warmed to greater than 37-41 degrees Fahrenheit (3-5 �C) for several hours per
day. Substantial winter mortality
is possible. Nearly 80% mortality was recorded from November 1989 to May 1990 in
a northern Illinois dry-mesic upland forest [<a href="#51">51</a>]. Fall and winter growth varies
by season and location, but by late winter rosettes have leaf primordia
surrounding 1 or more terminal flowerbuds [<a href="#74">74</a>].
</p>

<p>Garlic mustard plants that
survive winter undergo rapid bolt growth early in the 2nd spring (March in many areas) 
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>]. Reinitiation of growth
during this period includes increases in leaf production and elongation of flowering
stems, and all surviving plants bolt [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].
In central Illinois, plants bolted in March, growing quickly to a maximum
leaf area by late April or early May. Stem growth was also rapid during this
period, elongating at an average rate of 0.76 inch/day (1.9 cm/day) between April 18 and May 13.
Following this period of rapid growth, leaf area quickly declined. Nearly
all 2-year-old plants were devoid of green leaves by early July [<a href="#3">3</a>]. The fact
that bolting occurs very early in spring may contribute to garlic mustard's
competitive ability by limiting light and space resources that might otherwise
be available to native herbs [<a href="#45">45</a>].</p>

<p>Flowering occurs in spring of
the 2nd season, usually from early April to early June, depending upon location and season [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>]. In central
Illinois lower flowerbuds appeared in early April, and reached the maximum number per plant about 2
weeks later. Flowering,
and the presence of green fruit, peaked around mid-May. Fruit dehiscence began in late May or early June, and by
late June no green fruits remained [<a href="#3">3</a>].
Damage to terminal flowerbuds can initiate flower
production via axillary buds, sometimes occurring well into summer, but these
late-season blooms rarely produce viable fruit [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].
</p>

Typically, seeds are ripe and begin to shed
by mid-June and continue to drop throughout summer and into autumn. Seeds have
mostly all dropped by early November [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>]. Once mature plants have produced fruit they
senesce and die
[<a href="#74">74</a>].
Some variability exists regarding the timing of senescence, which is
probably related to environmental conditions such as irradiance levels or
moisture availability [<a href="#3">3</a>].

<br />


<font face="Bell MT">Fire Adaptations:</font>  Although garlic mustard plants are readily top-killed when exposed to fire,
they may ultimately survive by sprouting from the root crown [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>]. Ecological conditions that permit sprouting are
not well understood and it is unclear to what extent resprouted plants are
capable of producing viable seed (see Fire Effects section of this summary).

<p>At the population level, garlic mustard may be adapted to perpetuate itself in
mixed-severity or low-severity surface fire regimes, although this has not been
quantified. Even though individual plants may be killed by fire, postfire
conditions may be favorable for rapid population expansion because of increases
in the area of disturbed habitat and, depending on the extant community,
temporary reductions in interspecific competition. Additionally, garlic mustard
seed banks may facilitate rapid recolonization of disturbed areas [<a href="#14">14</a>]. For example,
3 consecutive years of prescribed burning in a central Illinois black oak forest,
which were described as &quot;hot and fast&quot; with flame lengths to
4 ft. (1.2 m), failed to eradicate garlic mustard populations. This was attributable, in
part, to the protection afforded a small number of plants by refugia such
as the lee of a downed log or an area of damp litter [<a href="#54">54</a>]. The
ability of individual plants to escape mortality will depend upon fire
severity and the heterogeneity of the fire landscape.
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Fire Regimes:</font> Garlic mustard may be found within
understory surface, stand-replacement, mixed-severity fire, and nonfire regimes [<a href="#13">13</a>]. Because garlic mustard has become
established only relatively recently in most areas in North America, and because natural
fire regimes have been substantially altered in many of these areas, predicting
the response of garlic mustard to any particular fire regime is speculative.
In some areas colonized by garlic mustard, estimated mean fire return intervals
may be longer than the time in which garlic mustard has
been present. As natural areas and preserve managers reintroduce fire
into locations where natural and anthropogenic fire has been suppressed in
recent times, the response of this and many other species may become better
understood. Those who intend to reintroduce fire where it has been absent for a
substantial period are encouraged to plan and implement research and monitoring programs and
share their findings.</p>

Garlic mustard is often top-killed
when exposed to fire. A prescribed burn in the understory of a northern Illinois hardwood forest
removed all aboveground garlic mustard biomass [<a href="#30">30</a>]. Prescribed burns in a central Illinois
black oak forest conducted both in the fall
and in mid-spring removed nearly all garlic mustard rosettes [<a href="#54">54</a>].
Although there was no immediate postfire survey of plants mentioned in the
article, Luken and Shea [<a href="#41">41</a>] suggest that garlic mustard &quot;plants are readily killed
by mid-intensity dormant season fires&quot;. Emergent seedlings may also be killed by
fire [<a href="#54">54</a>].

It has been suggested that dense stands of garlic mustard may be able
to resist low-severity fire, such that &quot;abundant
green garlic mustard plants&quot;...may &quot;literally extinguish fires&quot;
[<a href="#49">49</a>], but detailed descriptions of the direct effects of fire on garlic
mustard plants (or visa versa) are scarce. Such observations may be confounded
by the inherently patchy nature of mixed-severity fire regimes in many eastern
deciduous forests where garlic mustard may commonly be found. For more information see the

Garlic mustard has at least some ability to sprout from the root crown following damage
by fire.
By excavating charred rosettes, Nuzzo and others [<a href="#54">54</a>] found that adult plants resprouted
from adventitious buds on the root crown located just below the soil surface following a mid-spring
burn.&nbsp;In a northern Illinois oak woodland, garlic mustard reportedly resprouted several weeks following complete
top removal by
a prescribed
fire conducted in late March [<a href="#30">30</a>]. Repeated fall burning (2-3 annual burns) did not reduce abundance or relative
importance of garlic mustard in an eastern mesophytic forest understory in
Kentucky [<a href="#41">41</a>]. 

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE">
DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE:</a>
</span>
<br />

There is some indication that garlic mustard is capable of sprouting following
fire, but several questions remain. To what extent is postfire sprouting in
garlic mustard influenced by fire severity? What, if any, physiological
conditions promote or constrain postfire root crown sprouting? To what extent are
resprouting plants successful at producing seed? 

<p>Nuzzo and others [<a href="#53">53</a>] reported that a fall burn in a
central Illinois black oak forest removed 79% of the litter
layer, and very few adult garlic mustard plants were encountered in these plots
the following spring.
Conversely, many garlic mustard plants resprouted following a mid-spring burn at
the same site that resulted in removal of only 32%
of the litter layer. Spring burn plots retained a damp 0.4- to 0.8-inch (1-2 cm) layer of litter which
seems to have protected the root
crowns of top-killed plants, fostering survival via sprouting of multiple
secondary shoots from adventitious buds located just below the soil surface [<a href="#54">54</a>]. 
</p>



<p>Hintz [<a href="#30">30</a>] conducted a late-March prescribed burn in a mesic upland oak-hickory
forest in northern Illinois. Garlic mustard established following the fire,
although it is unclear whether these were sprouting burned plants or new spring
seedlings. The burn was conducted
near the time when seedling emergence might be expected, leaving some question
as to which life-cycle stage was observed to be &quot;sprouting&quot;. There is reference to &quot;very
little&quot; garlic mustard producing seed that summer, intimating that at least
some adult plants were present both prior to and after the fire.
</p>


<p>Luken and Shea [<a href="#41">41</a>] conducted a prescribed fire experiment in a northern
Kentucky mesic deciduous forest in which they showed that garlic mustard plants
could be removed by a
fall burn. Yet it was also apparent from this experiment that populations can persist following even
repeated burns. Garlic mustard remained the dominant species in the herb layer
of both burned and unburned plots through 3 seasons of fall burning,
and beyond. The authors proposed 3 possible explanations. First, persistence of individual garlic mustard plants
immediately following fire may result from the patchy nature of many understory
or mixed-severity burns. Under such
conditions some extant plants may escape damage, and because of its ability to
self-pollinate [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>], the survival of a single plant may be sufficient to perpetuate a
population. Second, the data of Luken and Shea [<a href="#41">41</a>] showed that burning resulted in higher densities
of flowering stems compared with control plots. They speculated this as being due to either resprouting or
release from competition. No observations of sprouting were reported. Third, even if all plants are killed, the existing
seed bank may remain viable for several years [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>], requiring subsequent annual burns to
completely eradicate the population. 
</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Control of invasive garlic mustard populations using prescribed fire, especially
as a single management tool, appears to be
difficult. Some temporary control is likely, but difficulties sustaining
long-term control are confounded by a) the patchiness of understory
and mixed-severity fires,
b) the
biennial nature of the species, c) the moderately persistent seed bank, and d)
garlic mustard's propensity for rapid population increase (see section on Biological and
Ecological characteristics) [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].

<p>It may be possible to substantially diminish the number of individuals in a
garlic mustard population with repeated burn treatments. But
prescribed burning, especially during the growing season, could actually increase the relative importance of garlic mustard [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>]. A prescribed burn
conducted in May in a northern Illinois dry-mesic upland deciduous forest effectively reduced cover of garlic mustard,
from a pre-burn 29.4% cover to 2.3% cover, postfire year 1. But May burning also damaged the native
forb community, where total stem density of major herbs and small shrubs was
reduced by 32% and average number of species per plot was reduced by 35%,
postfire year 1. Although native plants subsequently showed gradual recovery,
these effects were detectable for 3 years, most notably for Jack-in-the-pulpit
and stickywilly. Garlic mustard recovery was more rapid. Within three years
following burning garlic mustard had rebounded to 17.3% cover compared with a
pre-burn level of 29.4% [<a href="#67">67</a>]. 
</p>

<p>Dormant-season burns, while less likely to have
negative effects on indigenous flora, also appear to be less effective at
killing garlic mustard rosettes. After 3 years following a March
prescribed burn at the above location, both garlic mustard and native herb cover
had returned to approximate pre-burn levels [<a href="#67">67</a>]. 
</p>

<p>It has been suggested that a narrow window of time
exists during early spring in some areas and in some years, during which garlic
mustard may be more effectively controlled by fire without damaging native
plants. This hypothesis remains untested as of this writing [<a href="#67">67</a>].
Also, spring burns may increase seedling survival. Fires of insufficient
severity may spare a sizable fraction of seedlings protected by the unburned
portion of the litter layer. Additionally, a spring burn timed too early may
permit survival of garlic mustard seedlings that germinate after treatment. In addition to greater initial seedling survival, removal of
a portion of the litter layer may also provide a more favorable environment
for growth and development of garlic mustard rosettes [<a href="#54">54</a>]. 
</p>


<p>Apparently not all fires are equally effective at top-killing garlic
mustard. The effectiveness of prescribed spring and fall burn treatments in reducing garlic
mustard populations in an oak (<i>Quercus</i> spp.)-dominated dry-mesic upland forest in northern Illinois was
directly related to fire &quot;intensity&quot;. &quot;Low-intensity&quot; burns, with flame lengths up
to 1.2 inches (3 cm), were patchy and frequently extinguished within plots. These
&quot;low intensity&quot; burns had little to no effect on garlic mustard plants,
whether seedlings or adults, regardless of season of burning. It was
suggested that abundant green garlic mustard plants frequently extinguished the
&quot;low intensity&quot; fires. &quot;Mid-intensity&quot;
burns, with flame lengths up to 3 inches (15 cm), burned through most of the plots and
significantly reduced the presence of garlic mustard. Adult plant
densities were reduced by both spring and fall burns, as well as repeated fires,
although single spring burns were most effective [<a href="#49">49</a>]. 
</p>

 In areas with long
fire-return intervals where favorable conditions for conducting effective prescribed burns may be rare to nonexistent, especially repeated
annual burns, or where fire-sensitive native species exist, prescribed fire may be unsuitable as a management tool.
Nevertheless, in areas with a fire-tolerant native flora,
frequent prescribed burning may deter garlic mustard invasion by both directly killing
invading plants, and perhaps in some areas by enhancing growth of native
herbaceous competitors and thereby reducing habitat for garlic mustard colonization
[<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>]. It is highly likely that managers who use fire to control garlic mustard may
need to augment burn treatments with 1 or more additional control methods, such as
pulling or herbicide use to achieve acceptable levels of control (see Management Considerations section for more
information on other control methods).
