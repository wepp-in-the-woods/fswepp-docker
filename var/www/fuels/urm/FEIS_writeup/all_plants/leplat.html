<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lepidium latifolium
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Perennial pepperweed is an introduced forb of Eurasian origin that has
established in disjunct locations throughout the United States
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  It is found along the east coast from Massachusetts to Long
Island, New York.  It is also found in the central Great Plains, the
Intermountain region, the Pacific Northwest, California, and Mexico
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Perennial pepperweed may also occur in eastern and
western Canada [<a href="#24">24</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Perennial pepperweed occurs along beaches and tidal shores in California
and in riparian habitats of the Intermountain region [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

Perennial pepperweed is found in basin big sagebrush (Artemisia
tridentata ssp. tridentata) communities of the Piceance Basin of
Colorado.  Plant associates in these communities include twisted moss
(Tortula ruralis) and desert goosefoot (Chenopodium pratericola) [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Perennial pepperweed occurs in indigobush (Amorpha fruticosa var.
angustifolia) communities east of the Cascades in Oregon and Washington.
Plant associates in these communities include sagebrush (Artemisia
spp.), knapweed (Centaurea spp.), reed canarygrass (Phalaris
arundinaceae), and willow (Salix spp.) [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Perennial pepperweed was
found in a marshy floodplain at Diamond Pond, Oregon.  Stands of
European and native weeds dominated the community.  Stinging nettle
(Urtica dioica) and perennial pepperweed were predominant with some
Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), small-flowered willow-weed (Epilobium
minutum), short-rayed aster (Aster frondosus), and western goldenrod
(Solidago occidentalis) present [<a href="#28">28</a>].

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Perennial pepperweed has been used by natives of the Canary Islands for
over 2,000 years.  The roots, leaves, and seeds of perennial pepperweed
have yielded sulphurated essences.  The seeds contain mirosin, and the
leaves contain several sterols and polyphenols.  The leaves of perennial
pepperweed have been used in traditional medicines as a diuretic,
stomach tonic, and for preventing renal lithiasis [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Perennial pepperweed is classified as a noxious weed in California,
Montana, North Dakota, Utah, and the Pacific Northwest [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].
It is a serious weed in pastures of California and in meadows and
riparian habitats of the Intermountain region [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Control is
difficult because of its perennial root system and deep-seated rhizomes
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  In Australia, continuous topping and/or cultivation was
effective in controlling perennial pepperweed.  Treatment must be done
frequently and the plant must not be allowed to produce seeds if control
is to be successful [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Periodic mowing and spring burning have
reduced perennial pepperweed density in Utah [<a href="#14">14</a>].

There seems to be no inherent dormancy system, such as a hard seedcoat,
present in the seeds of perennial pepperweed; therefore, buried seeds of
perennial pepperweed may not be a prolonged source of reinfestation once
a population is controlled.  However, more research must be done to
determine the fate of deeply buried seeds that do not receive the
diurnal temperature fluctuations that seem to be necessary for
germination [<a href="#15">15</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lepidium latifolium
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Perennial pepperweed is a perennial herb that forms dense colonies by
adventitious shoots from roots and deep-seated rhizomes [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].
It grows from 1.6 to 6.6 feet (0.5-2 m) tall [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Leaves are 4
to 12 inches (10-30 cm) long and 2 to 3.2 inches (5-8 cm) wide
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  The fruit is a silicle 0.08 to 0.1 inch (2-2.5 mm)
long, with two seeds [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Perennial pepperweed has an extensive
root system [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].



<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Vegetative:  Perennial pepperweed spreads vigorously by sprouting from
roots and rhizomes [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Plants reproduce mainly by rhizomes
[<a href="#25">25</a>], but can be aggressive colonizers of disturbed areas [<a href="#14">14</a>].  

Sexual:  Perennial pepperweed reproduces by seed.  It produces abundant
highly germinable seeds [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Seeds are wingless; thus wind dispersal
is negligible [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Perennial pepperweed seeds have high rates of
germination, often with widely fluctuating diurnal temperature regimes.
Seeds were collected from a perennial pepperweed infestation growing in
a swampy meadow at Reno, Nevada, and from two locations along the Susan
River in California.  A total of 55 constant- and
alternating-temperature regimes were used to test germination of
perennial pepperweed seeds.  No significant (P=0.01) differences in the
overall mean germination of seeds were observed between the Reno samples
(1982 and 1983) and the Susan River samples (1983).  Also, no
significant (P=0.01) differences in mean germination of perennial
pepperweed seeds tested 1, 6, and 12 months after harvest were observed;
thus, seeds can be stored for at least 1 year.  The three alternating
temperature regimes that produced optimum germination for pooled
populations of perennial pepperweed seeds were 41/95, 50/104, and 59/104
degrees Fahrenheit (5/35, 10/40, and 15/40 deg C, respectively), with
germination rates of 92, 96, and 93 percent, respectively.  These
temperature regimes probably occur naturally for seeds not deeply
buried.  Seeds apparently have no inherent dormancy [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Perennial pepperweed is common in fields, waste places, meadows, borrow
ditches, and along roadsides [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  It also invades irrigated
pastures, cropland, and native meadows [<a href="#15">15</a>].  It is most often found in
open, unshaded areas on disturbed, and often saline soils [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].
It is locally common in riparian areas, marshy floodplains, valley
bottoms, and seasonally wet areas [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  

Perennial pepperweed is found from 5,500 to 8,000 feet (1,650-2,400 m)
in Colorado, 4,125 to 9,042 feet (1,250-2,740 m) in Oregon, 4,125 to
7,953 feet (1,250-2,410 m) in Utah, and at less than 6,270 feet (1900 m)
in California [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Perennial pepperweed is an aggressive colonizer of riparian habitats.
It establishes rapidly and can eliminate competing vegetation.
Infestations of riparian areas provide ready sources of seed for
invasion of adjacent meadows, irrigated pastures, croplands, and river
systems [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Perennial pepperweed is not aggressive in its native
habitat, possibly because of natural predation [<a href="#14">14</a>].  


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Perennial pepperweed flowering dates for several states are as follows:

California         June-Aug     [<a href="#17">17</a>]
Colorado           June-Aug     [<a href="#9">9</a>]
Connecticut        Aug          [<a href="#20">20</a>]
Massachusetts      Aug          [<a href="#20">20</a>]
Nebraska           June-Aug     [<a href="#9">9</a>]
Oregon             June-Aug     [<a href="#27">27</a>]
