<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Menziesia is an understory dominant on moist, wooded north- and
east-facing slopes of the montane to upper subalpine zones.  Overstory
components mostly include subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), Pacific
silver fir (A. amabilis), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), mountain
hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), western hemlock (T. heterophylla), and
Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Menziesia's associates
generally include blue huckleberry (Vaccinium globulare), smooth
woodrush (Luzula hitchcockii), and on higher sites, white rhododendron
(Rhododendron albiflorum) [<a href="#33">33</a>].  In Alaska, menziesia is a common
understory shrub in the coastal spruce-hemlock forest, often under a
dense canopy.  It also grows in the southern part of the boreal forest
in white spruce (Picea glauca) and white spruce-paper birch (Betula
papyrifera) stands [<a href="#53">53</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Menziesia ferruginea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Menziesia's value to wildlife is primarily as food.  In Idaho and
Montana, elk used menziesia in considerable amounts in July, and to a
lesser extent in October.  Elk rarely eat menziesia when it occurs with
more palatable browse species.  Menziesia filled a browse requirement
during July when elk were primarily on an herbaceous diet in western
Montana and Idaho [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  Mule deer use menziesia moderately in summer
and fall in the western states [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Menziesia accounted for over 15
percent of the summer moose diet in the spruce-fir cover types of
Jackson Hole, Wyoming [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Alaskan spruce grouse use small amounts of
menziesia capsules in their October diet [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Following a burn
treatment in western Montana, menziesia came back as an important source
of fruits and seeds used by rodents such as deer mice, chipmunks, and
voles [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability of menziesia is generally rated poor.  This shrub
provides fair summer browse for deer and elk [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Menziesia's
palatability was considered very low for moose in Jackson Hole, Wyoming
[<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Nutrient value of menziesia is considered poor to medium [<a href="#20">20</a>].
Menziesia contains toxic resinoids that are known to cause livestock
losses when leaves and roots are eaten [<a href="#43">43</a>].

Mean values of percent composition of macro- and micronutrients for
menziesia are as follows [<a href="#22">22</a>]:

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Menziesia provides shelter and cover for a variety of wildlife species.
Dense thickets provide good cover for many small birds and mammals.


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Menziesia is a desirable ornamental due its crimson-orange autumn
foliage [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Menziesia is mostly threatened by logging activities.  Following
clearcutting of Pacific silver fir and mountain hemlock, menziesia
exhibits a difficult time regenerating [<a href="#6">6</a>].  In northwestern Montana,
menziesia decreased considerably from its high abundance following a
clearcut in an old-growth stand [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Soil layers restricting root
growth and high water tables are common enough that compaction or
erosion-causing activities should be carefully controlled [<a href="#6">6</a>].

There appears to be little destruction of mature menziesia plants in
spruce-fir forests when selective logging is done during the winter [<a href="#9">9</a>].
If menziesia is a major component of the mature forest understory, it
will continue to dominate the postharvest plant community [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Mechanical site preparation:  Coates [<a href="#8">8</a>] found that recovery of
menziesia on Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir sites after clipping and
mechanical scarification was very limited and confined to the production
of new shoots from buds on old stems rather than from basal sprouts or
suckers.  Two seasons after cutting, new shoots had not reached the
height of precut stems, and did not overtop spruce or pine seedlings
planted at the time of cutting.

Menziesia control by Esteron brush killer was best achieved when this
herbicide was mixed with diesel and sprayed by helicopter from 150 to
200 feet (46-61 m) high [<a href="#40">40</a>].  After 2 years, Tordon 101 and Banvel 720
killed 100 percent of menziesia when sprayed on leaf foliage [<a href="#39">39</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Menziesia ferruginea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Menziesia is an erect, decidous shrub 3.3 to 6.6 feet (1-2 m) tall.
Ovate-elliptic to elliptic-obovate leaves are 1.5 to 2.5 inches (4-6 cm)
long and exude a skunky oder when crushed.  Menziesia has scaly bark on
older branches, while the young twigs are covered with fine hair [<a href="#20">20</a>].
The fruits are oval capsules containing many seeds 0.20 to 0.28 inch
(5-7 mm) long.  The leaves and stems of this shrub are sticky to the
touch [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

Menziesia decreases in height with increasing elevation.  This would
imply that menziesia's height is generally at its maximum on western
hemlock sites, and at its minimum on mountain hemlock and subalpine fir
sites [<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Seed production and dispersal:  Numerous small seeds are produced in
capsules which dehisce naturally at maturity.  Seeds are wind or gravity
dispersed.

Vegetative Reproduction:  Menziesia resprouts from root crowns and
adventitious stem buds after destruction of aboveground parts.  When
covered with ash from Mt. St. Helen's, menziesia produced adventitious
roots [<a href="#3">3</a>].  This plant also appears to be capable of layering.  Layering
is an effective means of growth and expansion at high elevations where
heavy snowpacks press menziesia branches close to the ground [<a href="#10">10</a>].  On
steep slopes, menziesia tends to grow downhill with the tips of its
branches ascending [<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Menziesia is a common shade-tolerant shrub, found predominantly on
steep, northerly exposures with abundant moisture [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].
Menziesia generally occurs from 3,300 to 7,500 feet (1,000-2,300 m) in
elevation on 15 to 60 percent slopes [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Absence from extreme
northern distributions may imply a limitation to cold temperatures.
Menziesia may be restricted to areas with adequate snow cover, which
protects plants from winter desiccation [<a href="#25">25</a>].  In Oregon, menziesia is
typically found on high-elevation sites where frequent frost, heavy
snowpacks, and short growing seasons are common [<a href="#6">6</a>].

The presence of menziesia has been reported as being a particularly good
indicator of site potential [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Menziesia often grows under dense
canopies, in openings, and on cut-over forest land, especially on
well-drained slopes [<a href="#53">53</a>].  Mueggler [<a href="#42">42</a>] found the distribution of
menziesia in cedar-hemlock stands to be positively associated with low
soil potassium content, and high organic matter content (5.6 to 8.0
percent).

Soils:  Soil depth usually ranges from 17 to 70 inches (43-178 cm).
Soils are generally derived from loam to sandy-loam pumice layers to a
depth of 15 to 30 inches (38-76 cm) [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  In central Idaho, soil
acidity ranges from pH 5.1 to 6.2; litter depth can average at least 3.5
inches (9 cm) [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].  Effective rooting depth in Oregon is
approximately 46 inches (117 cm) [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Menziesia is most always associated with cold, wet habitat types.
Menziesia is very shade tolerant.  It can persist in heavily shaded
forests where light levels are typically 5 percent of full sunlight.
Alaback [<a href="#1">1</a>] reported that menziesia decreased in biomass productivity in
Alaskan spruce-hemlock forests over 30 years of age.  Menziesia biomass
was lowest in stands 31 to 130 years old, but after this period
increased.  In western Montana, burning increased menziesia fourfold
from immature stands (less than 90 years) to old stands (greater than
150 years) [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Phenology:  Menziesia flowers from late May through July; capsules
mature in July and August [<a href="#53">53</a>].  Leaves expand rapidly in early June at
the time flowers open and begin to senesce in mid-August and September
at high elevations in southern British Columbia [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Menziesia has
been found to live at least 30 years in northern forests [<a href="#1">1</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Menziesia ferruginea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Menziesia is a fire-sensitive species [<a href="#51">51</a>].  It responds to fire by
sprouting from the root crown [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Since menziesia is indicative of
cool, moist sites, fire plays a minor role in its development.  Barrett
and Arno [<a href="#4">4</a>] found that the subalpine fir/menziesia cover type in the
Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, Idaho, had a mean fire interval of 174 to
181 years, achieving lethal/nonuniform fire behavior.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Menziesia ferruginea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Menziesia is very susceptible to fire-kill.  Moderate to severe fires
reduce survival and slow redevelopment [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Wildfires apparently
removed menziesia totally from experimental plots in Washington and
Oregon for up to 16 years [<a href="#58">58</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
In western Montana, Stickney [<a href="#51">51</a>] found that postburn survival of
menziesia was poor; menziesia was very slow to redevelop after fire,
especially in areas that had been intensley burned.  The average percent
cover of menziesia doubled from unburned plots to lightly burned plots,
and tripled from moderately burned plots in western Montana [<a href="#48">48</a>].
Another study found menziesia to increase its density of aboveground
parts the first year after burning [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Model projections predict that
menziesia will reach a height of 2.4 feet (.73 m) 2 years after a burn,
and that the average height of menziesia will peak at 5.1 to 5.6 feet
(1.5-1.7 m) 20 to 25 years after burning [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Mueggler [<a href="#42">42</a>], however,
found no significant difference in cover and frequency between burned
and unburned sites in northern Idaho.
