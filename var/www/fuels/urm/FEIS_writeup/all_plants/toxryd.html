<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Western poison-ivy is a seral species in a variety of plant communities
throughout its range.  In the northern Great Plains, it occurs as an
understory species in the ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and ponderosa
pine-common juniper (P. ponderosa-Juniperus scopulorum) upland forest
series.  Woodland series with western poison ivy present in the
understory include bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), green ash (Fraxinus
pennsylvanica), green ash-American elm (Ulmus americana), bur oak-green
ash, and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides).

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Although contact with western poison-ivy often causes a debilitating
rash in humans, wildlife and livestock can browse this species without
any ill effects [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Plants, however, are only sparsely browsed by
either livestock or wildlife.


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
In general, western poison-ivy is of low palatability to the majority of
wildlife and livestock.  Livestock occasionally browse plants on western
rangelands [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Since fruits remain on the plant throughout the
winter, quail often eat western poison-ivy fruits during periods of snow
cover in the Great Plains [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Fruits are also a fall food item of wild
turkeys in portions of south-central South Dakota [<a href="#14">14</a>].

The palatability of western poison-ivy in several western states is
rated as follows [<a href="#4">4</a>]:

<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
A milky oil in the phloem of western poison-ivy may cause blistering of
human skin within a few hours of contact [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Plants must somehow be
damaged in order for the oil to be emitted.  Skin rashes can result
from contact with either the liquid oil or its dried, blackened residue.
Secondary objects such as hand tools can also transmit the poison [<a href="#22">22</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Toxicodendron rydbergii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Western poison-ivy is a native, rhizomatous, low shrub [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].
Throughout much of its distribution, western poison-ivy assumes a
subshrub growth form, typically less than 3 feet (0.9 m) tall [<a href="#7">7</a>].  In
Utah, plants are rarely more than 12 inches (30 cm) in height [<a href="#21">21</a>].
However, under favorable site conditions where plants have remained
relatively undisturbed for several decades, individuals sometimes reach
heights of 10 feet (3 m) or more [<a href="#7">7</a>].  This species exhibits a
nonclimbing habit, differentiating it from eastern poison-ivy
(Toxicodendron radicans), which produces arerial roots [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Stems are
somewhat woody, simple or sparsely branched, arising from much branched
rhizomes.  Long-stalked leaves are borne alternately near the summit of
the stem and are divided into three coarse-toothed leaftlets [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Western poison-ivy regenerates both sexually and vegetatively [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].

Sexual reproduction:  Numerous, monecious flowers are produced in small,
rather dense axillary clusters.  Birds and mammals disperse the fruits.
Unconsumed fruits are retained on the plant through winter and are
deposited beneath parent plant in spring [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Since plants readily
invade disturbed areas [<a href="#7">7</a>], bare mineral soil appears to be conducive to
germination and establishment.

Vegetative reproduction:  Vegetative expansion via rhizome initiation is
a major mode of reproduction in established plants [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Leafy shoots
are produced via basal stem nodes located along much branched rhizomes;
on some sites, rhizomes may extend up to 7 feet (several meters) beyond
the parent plant [<a href="#19">19</a>].  As a result of this extensive network of
rhizomes, western poison-ivy frequently forms thickets under favorable
site conditions.  These thickets may represent a single clone or several
individuals [<a href="#7">7</a>]. 


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Western poison-ivy exhibits a wide ecological amplitude and occurs on a
variety of habitats ranging from riverbottoms to subalpine sites [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].
Western poison-ivy is considered a ubiquitous weed throughout much of
its distribution and easily invades disturbed areas such as roadsides,
talus slopes, lakeshores, floodplains, fencerows, logging units, sand
dunes, and railroad rights-of-way [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Plants rarely dominate
large areas but may become locally abundant in mesic sites with moderate
amounts of sunlight such as rills, ravines, edges of waterfalls,
creekbanks, streambottoms, river terraces, and floodplains [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  It
occurs on a variety of soils.  Plants are frequently found on alluvial
deposits of floodplains and river terraces [<a href="#7">7</a>]; this species has also
been reported growing in both sandy and calcareous soils in the Great
Plains [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Throughout the western portion of its distribution, western poison-ivy
is usually associated with riparian communities [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  In the northern
Great Plains it is a common understory component of gallery forests and
floodplain communities along the Little Missouri River and its major
tributaries [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Plants occur to a lesser extent on forested upland
sites throughout this region [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Tree associates in the Great
Plains include water birch (Betula occidentalis), paper birch (B.
papyrifera), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), eastern cottonwood
(Populus deltoides), eastern hophornbeam (Ostyra virginiana), green ash,
American elm, ponderosa pine, and common juniper.  Shrub associates
include western snowberry (Symphoricarpos occidentalis), chokecherry
(Prunus virginana), bur oak, Oregon-grape (Mahonia repens), western
hazelnut (Corylus cornuta), fragrant sumac (Rhus aromatica), and Wood's
rose (Rosa woodsii).  Herbaceous associates include Canada wildrye
(Elymus canadensis) and wild sarsaparilla (Aralia nudicaulis).  Ranging
from the foothills through the ponderosa pine belt in the Rocky
Mountains, this species is also able to occupy more xeric sites
including orchards, open woods, dry rocky hillsides, and canyon bottoms
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].

In the eastern United States plants usually inhabit more open areas
within hardwood forests where sugar maple (Acer saccharum), yellow birch
(Betula alligheniensis), beech (Fagus grandifolia), basswood (Tilia
americana), and hop hornbeam (Ostyra spp.) comprise the overstory.
Other overstory dominates on many sites in the Northeast include hemlock
(Tsuga canadensis), eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), balsam fir
(Abies balsamea), and red spruce (Picea rubens).  In the East western
poison-ivy typically occupies mesic sites but is also commonly found on
rocky fields, pastures, talus slopes, precipices, gypsum cliffs, and
slatey ledges [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Elevational ranges for several western states are as follows
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>]:

    from 4,500 to 8,500 feet (1,372-2,591 m) in CO
         2,000 to 4,000 feet (610-1,220 m) in MT
         1,968 to 2,722 feet (600-830 m) in ND
         3,500 to 6,525 feet (1,067-1,989 m) in SD
         3,690 to 7,413 feet (1,125-2,260 m) in UT
         3,700 to 7,200 feet (974-2,195 m) in WY.


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Western poison ivy is a ruderal species and is a common early seral
component of numerous riparian communities throughout its widespread
distribution [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Plants rapidly invade disturbed sites where
competition has been reduced.  They are well adapted to the continued
disturbances characteristic of floodplains and lakeshores [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Although
this species establishes during early seral stages, its persistence on a
site is somewhat unclear.  On floodplain sites along the Little Missouri
River in North Dakota, highest cover (18%) of western poison-ivy
occurred on the most recent alluvial deposits.  Within these cottonwood
(Populus deltoides) communties, western poison-ivy cover gradually
declined as the overstory canopy began to close; on climax sites
described as a green ash/western snowberry habitat type, it was still
present but cover was substantially reduced (4.4%) [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Detailed information concerning the seasonal development of western
poison-ivy is not available.  On the Great Plains plants sometimes bloom
twice within one season; first in May or June and again in August or
September [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Fruits are usually well developed by fall and often
persist on the plant through the winter [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Dittberner and Olson [<a href="#4">4</a>]
list the following anthesis data for several western states:

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Toxicodendron rydbergii

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Limited data from ponderosa pine sites in the southern Black Hills of
South Dakota indicates that this species is generally well adapted to
disturbance by fire [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Plants resprout via an extensive rhizome
system following cool fires.  Postfire regeneration may also involve
seedling establishment from off-site seeds which are dispersed by birds
and mammals [<a href="#22">22</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Toxicodendron rydbergii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Information concerning the effect of fire on western poison-ivy has not
been widely documented.  Although aerial portions are readily killed by
burning, the presence of rhizomes suggests that this species is somewhat
resistant to fire mortality.  Western poison-ivy may be damaged by
severe fire.  In a ponderosa pine stand in South Dakota, western
poison-ivy was not a component of the postburn community 5 years after
an intense crown fire; unfortunately no prefire data were taken for this
site [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Although rhizome depth has not been reported for western
poison-ivy, these data suggest that rhizomes may be located within the
top inch (2.5 cm) of soil where perennating buds are more susceptible to
damage from downward heat pulses generated by severe fires [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Following fire western poison-ivy resprouts via surviving perennating
buds located along much-branched rhizomes [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Review of the literature
revealed only one study dealing with fire response of western
poison-ivy.  Bock and Bock [<a href="#3">3</a>] found that western poison-ivy regained
prefire densities by the first postfire growing season following spring
and fall prescribed, cool, surface fires in the pine-grassland ecotone
of the southern Black Hills.  Apparently burning did not initiate
vigorous sprouting in this species; no significant increase in stem
density was recorded during two postfire growing seasons.  Compared with
prefire measurements, average plant heights following fire were shorter;
however, prefire and postfire crown widths were not significantly
different [<a href="#2">2</a>].
