<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Kalmia latifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Mountain-laurel wood is used to a limited extent for small craft
specialties.  The root burls of mountain-laurel are used occasionally
for making pipes, handles, and burned as fuel for woodstoves [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
The foliage of mountain-laurel is a winter forage for white-tailed deer
but it may be toxic if deer are forced to rely on it exclusively or
forage on it in large quantities [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  Mountain-laurel is a primary
winter food for ruffed grouse [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].

Mountain-laurel is considered toxic to most livestock.  Kingsbury lists
the following percentages of lethal doses of mountain-laurel leaves to
animal body weight [<a href="#20">20</a>].

sheep   > 0.6%
cattle  > 0.4%
goats   > 0.4%

Mountain-laurel is a primary winter food for ruffed grouse [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Mountain-laurel is listed as slightly palatable to white-tailed deer.
Deer typically browse mountain-laurel only in small quantities when more
palatable forage is not available [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Mountain-laurel is extensively cultivated as an ornamental in the
eastern United States. Mountain-laurel can also be useful for watershed
protection and erosion control on steep slopes [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Mountain-laurel presents problems for timber management on millions of
acres in the southern Appalachians.  Dense woody thickets that develop
after timber harvest can reduce growth of tree seedlings to the point
that regeneration fails [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Except in areas where watershed, erosion
control, or aesthetic values are a consideration, control or eradication
of mountain-laurel is desirable [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Basal treatment of mountain-laurel with the herbicide Picloram killed 85
percent of live stems in the Appalachian highlands of North Carolina
[<a href="#26">26</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Kalmia latifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Mountain-laurel is a broad-leaved evergreen shrub that is 10 to 30 feet
(3-9 m) tall at maturity [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  The crooked, irregular branches are
characteristically contorted, forming dense thickets.  The shiny
evergreen leaves are simple, alternate, and mostly crowded at the branch
tips.  The flowers are borne in panicled corymbs at the ends of leafy
branchlets.  The fruit is an oblong capsule, 0.5 to 1 inch (1.2-2.5 cm)
long. The bark is reddish brown to dark gray, and thin [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].



<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State: Phanerophyte (microphanerophyte)
   Undisturbed State: Phanerophyte (nanophanerophyte)
   Burned or Clipped State: Cryptophyte (geophyte)


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Mountain-laurel regenerates both sexually and asexually.  The small
seeds are disseminated a short distance by wind, but their preference
for short moss seedbeds or moist mineral soil restricts seedling
production to relatively small areas.  Mountain-laurel regenerates
mostly by sprouting from the root collar, by rhizomes, and by layering
[<a href="#19">19</a>].

Pollination: The pollination mechanism of mountain-laurel is
particularly interesting.  The tension in the filaments of the flower is
released when the tongue of a bee is inserted in the crevis between the
ovary and stamens.  The stamens change position causing the pollen to be
thrown onto the head of the bee where it is carried to the stigma of the
next flower visited [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Mountain-laurel occupies dry to mesic sites on upper rocky slopes and
mountainous areas [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].  It is often abundant in the higher elevation
(to 5,000 feet [1,400 m]) ridgetop pine forest of the southern
Appalachians but can also be found in some lower elevation wet forests
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].  Common trees associates include table mountain pine (Pinus
pungens), pitch pine (P. rigida), Virginia pine (P. virginia), white
pine (P. strobus), and red maple (Acer rubrum) [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Understory
associates include rosebay rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum), witherod
(Viburnum cassinoides), bullbrier (Smilax rotundifolia), and red elder
(Sambucus pubens) [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Site descriptions indicate that mountain-laurel is a shade-intolerant
species [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Presence of mountain-laurel decreases as the tree canopy
increases, indicating that it is mid to late seral species [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Mountain-laurel develops flowers from March to July, depending on
latitude and altitude.  The fruit ripens in September and October of the
same year [<a href="#3">3</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Kalmia latifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Mountain-laurel is moderately well adapted to fire.  The species
typically survives fire by sprouting from the root crown [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex
   survivor species; on-site surviving rhizomes

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Kalmia latifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
A light to moderate fire typically top-kills mountain-laurel.  Severe
fires may completely kill mountain-laurel [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Mountain-laurel typically survives fire by sprouting from the root crown
or rhizomes after aboveground portions are killed [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Depending on the overstory, periodic cool fires or a single severe fire
can be a used in controlling mountain-laurel [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Fire, combined
with herbicides, is recommended as the most effective long-term control
of mountain-laurel [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].
