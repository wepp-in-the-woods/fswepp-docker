<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Aster laevis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Smooth aster is widely distributed in the United States and Canada from
the Atlantic Coast to the eastern slopes of the Cascade Range, south to
New Mexico, Texas, and Georgia [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  In eastern North America
var. laevis is the most common.  This variety intergrades in the Great
Plains with var. geyeri.  Var. geyeri's distribution continues through
the mountain states to Yukon Territory and British Columbia, eastern
Washington and Oregon, south through Utah to New Mexico and Texas [<a href="#19">19</a>].
It is cultivated in Hawaii [<a href="#54">54</a>].  Var. coccinnus occurs in Georgia,
North Carolina, Tennesee, and Virginia [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Var. guadalupensis occurs
in the Guadalupe Mountains of Texas [<a href="#21">21</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Smooth aster is a component of many types of plant associations, most
notably of mixed prairie types such as needlegrass (Stipa comata, S.
spartea)-blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) and wheatgrass (Elymus
lanceolatus, Pascopyrum smithii)-junegrass (Koelaria cristata) types
[<a href="#10">10</a>].

Smooth aster is an understory dominant or a component in a number of
quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) community types, including a quaking
aspen-Missouri gooseberry (Ribes missouriense)-roughleaf ricegrass
(Oryzopsis asperifolia)-smooth aster community type [<a href="#39">39</a>].  It also
occurs as an understory dominant in a quaking aspen-Bigelow ligularia
(Ligularia bigelovii) community type [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Smooth aster is a leading
dominant in a smooth aster-western yarrow (Achillea millefolium v.
lanulosa) plant association found in openings in quaking aspen parklands
[<a href="#29">29</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Aster laevis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
White-tailed deer will graze smooth aster, selecting it over other
available forbs [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Smooth aster is palatable to white-tailed deer and livestock [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].
It is likely that it is palatable to other species as well, but
documentation is not available.


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Smooth aster has high nutritional value, decreasing with maturation.
Nutritional values for aerial portions are as follows [<a href="#7">7</a>]:

              digestible protein (%)  cellulose (%)  digestibility(%)

leaf stage       11.6                    27.2           77.1
heading           5.9                    28.8           55.2
seed ripening     5.2                    31.2           61.8


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Direct seeding of smooth aster was successful in establishing plants
along highway margins for prairie restoration [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Smooth aster is
recommended in seedings and plantings for rehabilitation or restoration
of native mixed-grass and tallgrass prairies [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In a study of prairie regeneration in which herbicides were applied to
control quackgrass (Agropyron repens), smooth aster failed to establish
in plantings treated with either glyphosate or dichlobenil [<a href="#49">49</a>].
Picloram, tebuthiuron, and hexazinone all suppressed growth of smooth
aster, either alone or in combination.  Applied alone, 2,4,D-E did not
suppress smooth aster growth [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Grazing by deer does not appear to affect survival of established plants
or seedlings, as long as only the stem tips are removed.  Most plants
damaged by deer responded with vigorous growth the following season
[<a href="#14">14</a>].  Weaver and Hansen [<a href="#47">47</a>] classify smooth aster as a decreaser under
grazing.

Plants grown under nursery conditions had excellent rates of survival
when planted in the field.  Nursery stock was planted at a rate of 3.5
ounces of seed per 100 square feet (11 gm/sq m), and resulted in a
harvest of 9.5 pounds of seed per 100 square feet (0.5 kg/sq m) [<a href="#46">46</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Aster laevis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Smooth aster is a moderately tall (12 to 40 inches [30 -100 cm]) native
perennial forb, with a stout rhizome and branching caudex.  There are
one to several erect stems.  The fruit is a one-seeded achene
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Smooth aster reproduces well from seed.  Seeds do not require either
scarification or stratification [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Greenhouse germination trials
showed that, without stratification, initial germination occurs at 7
days, and peak germination occurs at 20 days [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Seed banking is not
apparent; soil samples collected in August (probably before seed
release) contained no germinable smooth aster seeds [<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Smooth aster occurs on a wide variety of sites, including moist, sandy
soil in woods, dry woods, and open areas, and mesic and dry-mesic
prairies [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Cover and frequency of smooth aster is highest on
sites with high light intensities, though it occurs on more shaded sites
as well [<a href="#41">41</a>].  It usually sustains higher populations on wetter, more
poorly drained glacial till soils in eastern Illinois and western
Indiana [<a href="#6">6</a>].  In Michigan, however, Beaufait [<a href="#4">4</a>] reported that although
smooth aster occurs on mesic and transitional sites, it is more likely
to be encountered on the more xeric sites.

Elevation occurrence data from selected western states is as follows
[<a href="#12">12</a>]:

               feet             meters
Utah        5,700 - 8,600    1,737 - 2,621
Colorado    5,000 - 9,300    1,524 - 2,835
Wyoming     3,700 - 7,600    1,128 - 2,316
Montana     2,300 - 6,000      701 - 1,829


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Thirty years after study plots had been retired from heavy grazing,
smooth aster was found only on the edges of the sites nearest
undisturbed native prairie [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Smooth aster is found on roadsides and
other previously disturbed areas but is probably not an initial
colonizer.

Smooth aster is probably not tolerant of deep shade but will tolerate
light or intermittent shade.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Smooth aster blooms from August to October [<a href="#11">11</a>].  The lowermost leaves
are early deciduous; the remaining leaves are dropped after frost
top-kills the plant [<a href="#19">19</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Aster laevis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Smooth aster sprouts from the rhizome after being top-killed by fire.
It occurs in a number of plant associations that have frequent fire
regimes.  Presumably, it is adapted to fire, though no specific
information is available in the literature.

In general, forbs are more adversely affected by fires that occur later
in the spring.  Usually cover is reduced, while overall composition
remains little affected.  Forbs are much less affected by dormant-season
fires than by spring fires [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Aster laevis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire top-kills smooth aster.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Most reports on the effects of fire in communities occupied by smooth
aster are inconclusive as to its response [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  The number of leaves
per individual plant increased following a late spring prescribed fire,
with no change in the number of flowers or fruit per individual for
either the early spring or late spring prescribed fires [<a href="#27">27</a>].
Prescribed spring fires had variable effects on flowering in smooth
aster, depending on habitat.  Flowering was inhibited on dry-mesic
prairie site on an undisturbed south-facing slope and on a highly
disturbed, level, mesic prairie site.  Flowering was stimulated on
sloping and level mesic undisturbed prairie sites [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Three years
after a wildfire in jack pine (Pinus banksiana) stands, smooth aster was
an important component of the regenerating plots.  These sites had
standing dead trees, which indicates that there was probably a
substantial loss of crown shading [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Smooth aster was listed as a decreaser under an annual early spring
burning regime, and also after a spring wildfire [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Scheiner [<a href="#37">37</a>]
reported the presence of smooth aster on sites that had recently
undergone prescribed burns, as well as on older postfire seral sites.
