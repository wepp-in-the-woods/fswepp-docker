<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pediocactus papyracanthus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Grama-grass cactus is found in the southern portion of Navajo County,
Arizona, and from southeast Rio Arriba County and McKinley County to
Grant and Dona Ana counties in New Mexico [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>].  Additional populations
have been located in Hudspeth County, Texas [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  Grama-grass cactus
is inconspicuous and probably irregular in occurrence; it may be more
widespread than presently known [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Grama-grass cactus grows in pinyon-juniper woodlands and in desert
grasslands and is almost always associated with grama (Bouteloua spp.),
especially blue grama (B. gracilis) [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  It may also be associated
with dropseed (Sporobolus spp.) [<a href="#11">11</a>].

<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In New Mexico, populations of grama-grass cactus are in decline, some
severely so.  However, its highly inconspicuous nature makes it a
difficult species to study.  Grama-grass cactus is affected by
disturbances such as urban development, grazing, recreational use of
land, and cactus collection.  It was once common on grassy outwash fans
at the western edge of the Sandia Mountains, but that entire area is now
consumed by the eastern expansion of the city of Albuquerque.  Both
grama-grass cactus and its habitat are destroyed by heavy off-road
vehicle traffic.  Grama-grass cactus populations have often been quickly
depleted by cactus collectors.  Fairly tall grama-grass cactus plants
may be common in ungrazed areas, but under moderate grazing intensities
pplants are often trampled and taller plants are less frequent.  Soil
compaction due to grazing is also a problem since most grama-grass
cactus seedlings are found on loose soil.  Light grazing may open the
grass cover and facilitate seedling establishment, whereas more intense
grazing reduces grass cover and exposes grama-grass cactus to increased
predation by small herbivores.  Also, the loss of grass cover results in
increased erosion of topsoil and accelerates the loss of potential sites
for seedling establishment [<a href="#11">11</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pediocactus papyracanthus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Grama-grass cactus is a native stem succulent with solitary stems 1 to 3
inches (2.5-7.5 cm) tall and 0.4 to 0.8 inch (1-2 cm) in diameter.  It
has no ribs and tubercles are elongate.  Areoles are 0.04 to 0.06 inch
(0.1-0.15 cm) in diameter and generally 0.12 inch (0.3 cm) apart.  The
spines are dense, often obscuring the surface of the stem.  The central
spines are up to 1.2 inches (3 cm) long and strongly flattened.  Radial
spines lie parallel to the stem surface and are up to 0.12 inch (0.3 cm)
long.  Flowers are found on new growth of the current season and are
therefore near the apex of the stem.  The fruit is green, often changing
to tan, and is dry at maturity.  The fruits are dehiscent along a dorsal
slit and around the circumscissile apex [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Grama-grass cactus has
fibrous roots that are 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm) long [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Stem succulents


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Grama-grass cactus is restricted to fine, sandy clay loams and red sandy
soils of open flats at 5,000 to 7,200 feet (1,500-2,200 m) elevation
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>].  It is often found on highly erodable sites [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Grama-grass
cactus grows in or near fairy rings of blue grama, and is inconspicuous
because its spines resemble dried blue grama leaves [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pediocactus papyracanthus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Specific information concerning adaptations that grama-grass cactus may
have for survival following fire is not available in the literature.
Its small stature and the fact that it often occurs in or near clumps of
grama may make it particularly vulnerable to destruction by fire.  Grama
grass cactus may survive fire mainly in refugia.  

Thomas [<a href="#14">14</a>] cited references suggesting that fire intervals in desert
grasslands may be 3 to 40 years.

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pediocactus papyracanthus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
The imediate effect of fire on grama-grass cactus is unknown [<a href="#15">15</a>].
Grama-grass cactus is probably killed by even light fires.

Succulents in general rarely actually burn, but spines may ignite and
flames are then carried to the apex.  The cactus body may scorch and
blister without pyrolysis.  The primary cause of mortality is death of
the photosynthetic tissue and underlying phloem and cambium.  Cacti may
appear completely scorched with no green tissue visible, yet may survive
fire.  However, fire can cause delayed mortality in small succulents
such as grama-grass cactus.  Removal of spines by fire also increases
subsequent herbivory [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Some succulents survive fire in refugia or
if the litter surrounding them is sparse [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].
