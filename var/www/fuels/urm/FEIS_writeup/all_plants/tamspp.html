The currently accepted scientific name for the genus tamarisk is <i>Tamarix </i>
L. (Tamaricaceae) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#161">161</a>]. This review summarizes information on 4 species 
of tamarisk:

<i> Tamarix parviflora </i>DC [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>,<a href="#138">138</a>,<a href="#202">202</a>,<a href="#256">256</a>,<a href="#257">257</a>,<a href="#259">259</a>,<a href="#263">263</a>] small-flowered tamarisk <br>

<i>Tamarix ramosissima</i> Ledeb [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>,<a href="#138">138</a>,<a href="#146">146</a>,<a href="#256">256</a>,<a href="#257">257</a>,<a href="#259">259</a>] saltcedar 
</p>

<p>
&quot;There is probably not another genus of plants as well known as the tamarisks in 
which the species are so poorly understood or separated on more obscure 
characters&quot; [<a href="#161">161</a>]. The distinction between <i>T. gallica, T. ramossisima</i> and <i>
T. chinensis</i> is based on differences in morphology of the nectary disk and staminal 
filaments that are often difficult to separate, as the traits are not clearly or unequivocally 
expressed [<a href="#3">3</a>]. Baum [<a href="#20">20</a>] had difficulty separating some specimens as either <i>T. ramosissima</i> 
or <i>T. chinensis </i>and indicated that mixed, naturalized populations of <i>T. ramosissima</i> 
and <i>T. chinensis</i> need to be studied for possible hybridization [<a href="#20">20</a>]. Each species 
has a distinct distribution in Eurasia, but they may have hybridized in southwestern 
United States [<a href="#212">212</a>]. Allred [<a href="#3">3</a>] presents evidence of DNA data that support the merger of 
<i>T. chinensis</i> and <i>T. ramosissima</i>.</p>

<p>
For the purposes of this review, the common name tamarisk will be used when discussing 
characteristics common to all 4 species, or when it is unclear which of the species was 
studied. When referring to individual species, the common names listed above will be used 
to represent the respective currently accepted scientific name. The common name saltcedar 
will refer to either <i>T. chinensis</i> or <i>T. ramosissima</i>.

The family Tamaricaceae consists of 4 genera and about 100 species, none of 
which are native to North America [<a href="#171">171</a>]. The genus <i>Tamarix</i> 
occurs naturally from western Europe and the Mediterranean to North Africa, 
northeastern China, India, and Japan [<a href="#21">21</a>], generally within dry, saline 
habitats in the subtropical and temperate zones [<a href="#171">171</a>]. <i>Tamarix</i> is the only 
genus that occurs in North America [<a href="#138">138</a>], with 8 or 9 species, depending on the author. 

<p>
The history of the introduction and spread of tamarisk into North America is well documented 
[<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#195">195</a>]. Some have suggested that tamarisk was first introduced by the Spaniards 
although there is little evidence to support this [<a href="#239">239</a>], and it was not 
identified in the western U.S. until the 1800s when it was introduced for sale 
as an ornamental shrub and a windbreak species. It was available in New York 
City in 1823, in Philadelphia in 1828, and in several nurseries along the 
eastern seaboard during the 1930s. Tamarisk was listed for sale by nurseries in 
California as early as 1856 [<a href="#124">124</a>]. The U.S. Department of Agriculture began 
growing several species of tamarisk in the Department Arboretum around 1868, and 
released saltcedar for cultivation in 1870 [<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#239">239</a>]. French tamarisk became 
well established on Galveston Island, Texas, by 1877. In the early 1900s, tamarisk was 
recommended for ornamental purposes, windbreaks, shade for poultry and small 
stock, and for fuel. According to Horton [<a href="#124">124</a>] early herbarium specimens 
indicate that 3 species of deciduous tamarisk were introduced to North America 
prior to 1920, the descriptions of which correspond to small-flowered tamarisk, 
saltcedar, and French tamarisk. By 1903 French tamarisk was common along 
roadsides and in waste places in the southern states, and was well established 
in much of the area by 1916. Another species, probably saltcedar, was &quot;common in 
river bottoms&quot; in Arizona by 1901 [<a href="#124">124</a>]. </p>

<p>
From the 1920s to the 1960s tamarisk spread rapidly, from an estimated 10,000 
acres (4000 ha) in 1920 to over 1.2 million acres (500,000 ha) 
in the mid-1960s [<a href="#195">195</a>]. This rapid increase was due primarily to 
regulation of streamflows following construction of large dams and water 
diversion projects in the western U.S. [<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>]. Once 
established along the major drainages, tamarisk successfully invaded outlying 
ephemeral water courses, isolated marshes, and springs via its windblown seeds 
and possibly due to occasional plantings [<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#212">212</a>]. As recently as 1964 tamarisk was 
recommended as a windbreak species for the central Great Plains [<a href="#191">191</a>]. </p>

<p>
Since its escape from cultivation, saltcedar has spread primarily in the 
southwestern U.S., Texas and Mexico, although its distribution extends to many 
other parts of North America. It is especially pervasive in Arizona, New 
Mexico, western Texas, Nevada, and Utah but is also widespread in southern 
California, the Rocky Mountain states, the western Plains states, and parts of 
Oregon and Idaho. It occurs throughout broad regions of northwestern Mexico 
[<a href="#260">260</a>,<a href="#266">266</a>], and is spreading along the Gulf of Mexico into the coastal prairie [<a href="#101">101</a>]. 
Tamarisk is a problem in many natural areas and state and national parks and monuments 
in the western U.S. [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>].</p>

<p> 
Small-flowered tamarisk originates in southern Europe and Asia Minor from 
Yugoslavia to Turkey [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#171">171</a>]. Small-flowered tamarisk 
is now common in California and Arizona, and occurs sporadically in 
Nevada, Utah, Colorado,  Missouri, North Carolina, 
British Columbia, Ontario, and Nova Scotia [<a href="#20">20</a>]. Small-flowered tamarisk 
is rarely encountered in New Mexico. It is of limited occurrence in the 
Albuquerque and Las Cruces areas, mostly in ornamental situations, 
and while it may escape, it is hardly invasive [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>]. Small-flowered tamarisk is 
found on beaches in Florida, but it is rare [<a href="#263">263</a>]. It is also found in 
Massachusetts, Connecticut [<a href="#202">202</a>], and Oregon [<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#138">138</a>]. In the Great Plains, 
small-flowered tamarisk sometimes escapes 
from cultivation to waste places and along river flood plains. It is widely scattered 
in Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>]. Gleason and Cronquist [<a href="#96">96</a>] recognize 
small-flowered tamarisk in the northeastern U.S. where it occasionally 
escapes cultivation, although it is uncommon in this area.</p>

<p> 
French tamarisk is not common in New Mexico [<a href="#3">3</a>]. In California, French tamarisk 
occurs in the Central Valley, the Bay Area, and along the central and 
south coasts [<a href="#156">156</a>].</p>

<p> 
<i>T. ramosissima</i> is native to the Ukraine and Iraq east through China 
and Tibet to Korea [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#171">171</a>]. It is now commonly 
cultivated and invasive in Arizona and California, with specimens also found in Nevada, 
Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Arkansas, New York, and 
Manitoba [<a href="#20">20</a>]. </p>


<p> 
<i>T. chinensis</i> is native to Mongolia and China to Japan. 
It is now common in Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas, with specimens from California, 
Nevada, Colorado, Arkansas, North Carolina, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, 
and Quebec [<a href="#20">20</a>].</p>


<p>
The following biogeographic classification systems are presented to demonstrate where 
tamarisk might be found or is likely to be invasive, based on reported occurrence and 
biological tolerance to factors likely to limit its distribution. Precise distribution 
information is limited, especially for small-flowered tamarisk and French tamarisk. 
Therefore, these lists are speculative and not exhaustive, as some tamarisk species 
may be invasive in other types.

Tamarisk species are most widespread along riparian areas of the southwestern 
United States, and the most common and invasive species in this area is 
saltcedar.

<p>
In the southwestern United States, tamarisk occurs in every major 
watershed, in a variety of community types, many of them dominated by cottonwood 
(<i>Populus</i> spp.) and willow (<i>Salix</i> spp.). Much of the early 
literature refers to Fremont cottonwood (<i>Populus fremontii</i>) as the 
dominant cottonwood on southwestern rivers, although it is now recognized that 
Fremont cottonwood dominates primarily in the Gila, San Francisco and Mimbres 
River watersheds in New Mexico, and watersheds south of the Mogollon Rim in 
Arizona. Rio Grande cottonwood&nbsp; (<i>Populus 
deltoides</i> ssp. <i>wislizeni</i>) dominates vegetation in the Rio Grande, 
San Juan, and Colorado drainages; and plains cottonwood (<i>Populus 
deltoides</i> ssp. <i>monilifera</i>) is found in drainages of the Canadian and Pecos 
Rivers, and extends northward through the eastern prairie states to the Great 
Lakes region [<a href="#172">172</a>]. In the following plant community descriptions, cottonwood species names are 
given as they were presented by the author cited, or referred only as 
'cottonwood' when the species designation is in question.</p>

<p>
According to Szaro [<a href="#235">235</a>], saltcedar is found in communities dominated by green ash (<i>Fraxinus 
pennsylvanica</i>), Arizona sycamore (<i>Platanus wrightii</i>), Fremont 
cottonwood, and Goodding willow (<i>Salix 
gooddingii</i>),  in Arizona and New Mexico. 
On these sites saltcedar does not contribute more than 7% of total tree density or 0.6% of total basal 
area. Any site where saltcedar tree density and basal area combined is greater 
than 60% is identified as a saltcedar community type [<a href="#235">235</a>]. </p>

<p>
In Arizona, Horton and Campbell [<a href="#122">122</a>] describe 4 floodplain zones, separated 
by growth characteristics of saltcedar. Zone 1 has a very shallow water table 
(0 to 4 feet (0-1.2 m)), dwarfed and multi-stemmed saltcedar and vigorous 
Bermuda grass (<i>Cynodon dactylon</i>) or saltgrass (<i>Distichlis spicata</i>) 
cover. Zone 2 has a shallow water table (4 to 8 feet (1.2-2.4 m)) and, during summer rainy 
periods, many grasses establish. Zone 3 has a medium water table (8 to 20 feet (2.4-6 
m)) and heavy stands of saltcedar. Zone 4 has a deep water table (below 20 feet (6 m)) 
and scattered, widely spaced individuals of saltcedar [<a href="#122">122</a>]. </p>

<p>
Saltcedar is a dominant riparian tree along the Colorado river where it 
occupied terraces and tributaries prior to dam construction, and was the 1st species to invade 
the newly-stabilized postdam riparian zone in the Grand Canyon. It commonly 
co-occurs with Fremont cottonwood, sandbar willow (<i>S. exigua</i>), Goodding willow 
and arrowweed (<i>Pluchea</i> <i>sericea</i>), but it is more tolerant of harsh environmental 
extremes than native species [<a href="#219">219</a>] (<a href="https://www.cpluhna.nau.edu/Biota/tamarisk.htm">Land 
use history of the Colorado Plateau</a>). Cottonwood communities along the Colorado River, for example, have decreased from over 
5,000 acres (2,000 ha) in the 1600s to less than 500 acres (200 ha) in 1998 
[<a href="#30">30</a>]. Saltcedar has almost completely replaced the native forest that 
historically dominated the riparian corridor from the Grand Canyon to the delta 
on the Gulf of California. It is by far the most abundant plant in the Colorado 
River delta, accounting for 40% of total ground cover [<a href="#265">265</a>]. </p>

<p>
Anderson and others [<a href="#5">5</a>] described saltcedar communities along the lower 
Colorado River with saltcedar constituting 95-100% of the total trees. A review 
by Anderson and others [<a href="#5">5</a>] describes 3 saltcedar associations on the lower 
Colorado River: 1) saltcedar, 2) tamarisk-mesquite (<i>Prosopis</i> spp.), and 3) 
tamarisk/Russian-thistle (<i>Salsola </i>ssp.)-Johnsongrass (<i>Sorghum</i> <i>
halepense</i>). In the saltcedar community, saltcedar constitutes 95-100% of the 
total trees. This community is further subdivided into 6 structural types, 
based on distribution and density of foliage at varying heights [<a href="#5">5</a>].</p>

<p>
At the southern end of its distribution in the United States, saltcedar has 
dominated low areas bordering the channel of the Gila River since the 1940s, a 
drainage historically dominated by Fremont cottonwood, Goodding willow, velvet 
mesquite (<i>P. velutina</i>) and mule's fat (<i>Baccharis salicifolia</i>) [<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#242">242</a>]. 
Along the lower Gila River in Arizona, more than 50% of the 
area covered by floodplain plant communities was dominated by saltcedar by 
1970. Saltcedar dominated communities are often monotypic, though arrowweed and 
screwbean mesquite (<i>P. pubescens</i>) are common associates, and big 
saltbrush (<i>Atriplex lentiformis</i>) may occur in saline areas [<a href="#106">106</a>]. 
Much of the Gila River channel in the Gila River Indian Reservation, Arizona, is dominated 
by saltcedar communities. Two riparian habitats there became re-established from sewage 
effluent and irrigation tailings including an upper terrace marsh with mesquite, elderberry 
(<i>Sambucus</i> spp.), and saltcedar [<a href="#190">190</a>]. </p>

<p>
Much of the Salt River through the Tempe and Phoenix area is characterized by 
scattered individuals of saltcedar [<a href="#122">122</a>]. Along the Verde River, nearly pure 
stands of Fremont cottonwood have occasional specimens of velvet ash (<i>F. velutina</i>), 
Goodding willow, and scattered shrubs including saltcedar [<a href="#50">50</a>]. Saltcedar also occurs along 
the shore of the San Carlos reservoir and the San Pedro River in southern Arizona where 
upland vegetation is characterized by whitethorn acacia (<i>Acacia constricta</i>), catclaw acacia 
(<i>A. greggii</i>), creosotebush (<i>Larrea tridentata</i>), crucifixion thorn (<i>Canotia holacantha</i>), and 
yellow paloverde (<i>Cercidium microphyllum</i>) [<a href="#254">254</a>]. Saltcedar also codominates with camelthorn 
(<i>Alhagi</i> <i>maurorum</i>) at several sites at Wupatki National Monument in north-central Arizona [<a href="#53">53</a>].</p>

<p>
In New Mexico saltcedar occurs in floodplains, arroyos, alkali sinks, and 
playas. Much of the native vegetation in floodplain ecosystems is dominated by 
cottonwood and willow [<a href="#70">70</a>]. In lowland river valleys in southwestern watersheds 
of the Gila River basin, saltcedar is well represented in Fremont 
cottonwood-Goodding willow/sandbar willow community types 
[<a href="#172">172</a>]. In the Pecos River basin, saltcedar occurs in community types indicated by plains cottonwood, Goodding willow, peachleaf willow (<i>Salix 
amygdaloides</i>), sandbar willow, Emory's baccharis (<span class="search"><i>Baccharis</i>
<i>emoryi</i></span>), alkali sacaton (<i>Sporobolus airoides</i>), baltic rush 
(<i>Juncus balticus</i>), saltgrass (<i>Distichlis spicata</i>) and/or 
threesquare bulrush (<i>Scirpus pungens</i>). In the Rio Grande River basin, 
saltcedar occurs in communities dominated by Rio Grande cottonwood, Goodding 
willow, stretchberry (<i>Forestiera pubescens</i> var. <i>pubescens</i>), 
Russian-olive (<i>Elaeagnus 
angustifolia</i>), sandbar willow, alkali sacaton, yerba mansa (<i>Anemopsis 
californica</i>), false quackgrass (<i>Elymus pseudorepens</i>), smooth 
horsetail (<i>Equisetum laevigatum</i>), and/or threesquare bulrush. In the San 
Juan River basin, saltcedar may be found in communities dominated by Rio Grande 
cottonwood, stretchberry, Russian-olive, redtop (<i>Agrostis gigantea</i>), 
sandbar willow, and/or threesquare bulrush. Saltcedar occurs in sandbar 
willow/gravel bar communities in the Canadian River watershed, and in plains 
cottonwood/New Mexico bluestem (<i>Schizachyrium neomexicanum</i>) communities 
in the Tularosa basin [<a href="#172">172</a>].</p>

<p>
Saltcedar is named as a dominant or codominant in 
several community types occurring in New Mexico river basins [<a href="#172">172</a>]. One of the most widespread communities on large river 
corridors with low gradients is the plains cottonwood/saltcedar community type. 
This type appears to be related to seriously altered hydrologic regimes. 
Cottonwood regeneration is lacking in this type, and saltcedar becomes 
established as a tall-shrub layer beneath the canopy of Rio Grande or plains 
cottonwood, although it is more prolific in open areas. Several shrubs and 
grasses are possible in this type. See Muldavin and others [<a href="#172">172</a>] for more 
detailed community descriptions. Saltcedar  codominates with plains or Rio 
Grande cottonwood and Russian-olive in the San Juan River 
basin. In the Pecos  River basin, saltcedar may be codominant with plains 
cottonwood, alkali-sacaton, saltgrass, and/or buffalograss (<i>Buchloe 
dactyloides</i>). According to Loope and others [<a href="#153">153</a>], saltcedar communities are 
also dominant in areas along the Pecos river that were formerly dominated by 
plains and desert grasslands. In Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, saltcedar occurs in the wash area with 
rubber rabbitbrush (<i>Chrysothamnus nauseosus</i>), sandbar willow, black 
greasewood,  cottonwood, fourwing saltbush, and big sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i>) [<a href="#63">63</a>].</p>

<p>
Saltcedar-dominated communities are common along the Rio Grande River, where 
codominants include Rio Grande cottonwood, Russian-olive, sandbar willow, false 
quackgrass, alkali-sacaton, saltgrass, and redtop [<a href="#172">172</a>]. Other species 
associated with saltcedar include screwbean mesquite, seepweed (<i>Suaeda</i> spp.), arrowweed, 
skunkbush sumac (<i>Rhus trilobata</i>), and Goodding willow [<a href="#47">47</a>]. According to Campbell and Dick-Peddie [<a href="#47">47</a>], when  cottonwood forms a dense overstory, saltcedar does not occur in the understory, 
but is found in adjacent disturbed sites. Since the time of that writing, 
several cottonwood-dominated riparian communities have been described with 
saltcedar occurring at varying densities in the subcanopy (e.g. [<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#172">172</a>]).
At the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge on the Rio Grande River, saltcedar occurs as a 
community dominant and in dense subcanopy zones under Rio Grande cottonwood, along with Goodding willow, mule's fat, stretchberry, desert 
false indigo (<i>Amorpha fruticosa</i>) and Russian-olive [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. Durkin and 
others [<a href="#77">77</a>] describe several community types in the upper and middle Rio Grande 
watershed in which saltcedar is dominant or codominant, including Rio Grande 
cottonwood-saltcedar, Russian-olive-saltcedar, and saltcedar-sandbar willow community types. In the southern portion of the Rio Grande, tamarisk often 
occurs in dense, monotypic stands [<a href="#47">47</a>].</p>

<p>
Saltcedar is a common dominant of alkali sink vegetation, along with iodinebush 
(<i>Allenrolfea occidentalis</i>), TransPecos false clapdaisy (<i>Pseudoclappia arenaria</i>), 
seepweed, saltgrass, alkali lovegrass (<i>Eragrostis obtusiflora</i>), and various forbs. 
Fourwing saltbush (<i>Atriplex canescens</i>) and black greasewood (<i>Sarcobatus vermiculatus</i>) 
may also codominate [<a href="#70">70</a>].  The saltcedar/iodinebush community type occurs in the Tularosa basin in stabilized gypsum 
dunes, gypsic flats, and playas [<a href="#172">172</a>]. </p>

<p>
Along the Arkansas River in Colorado, saltcedar is a major component of a mixed 
community type including various combinations of plains cottonwood and sandbar 
willow, 
and other species including boxelder (<i>Acer negundo</i>), Russian-olive, green ash, and 
American elm (<i>Ulmus americana</i>) [<a href="#151">151</a>]. </p>

<p>
Near Utah Lake, Utah, saltcedar dominates lowland woody communities 
composed of peachleaf willow (<i>S. amygdaloides</i>), sandbar willow, 
saltgrass, Russian-olive, foxtail barley (<i>Hordeum jubatum</i>), Fremont 
cottonwood, whorl-leaf watermilfoil (<i>Myriophyllum verticillatum</i>), and 
common cocklebur (<i>Xanthium strumarium</i>) [<a href="#33">33</a>]. Only xeric species 
or halophytes can tolerate the understory environment of saltcedar, and 
saltgrass is the most common understory component on sites with saltcedar [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>]. 
Other common species are annual rabbitsfoot grass (<i>Polypogon</i>
<i>monspeliensis</i>), Nuttall's alkaligrass (<i>Puccinellia 
airoides</i>), spear saltbush (<i>Atriplex patula</i>), summer-cypress (<i>Kochia scoparia</i>) and 
mountain pepperweed (<i>Lepidium montanum</i>) [<a href="#49">49</a>]. In much of the Utah Lake 
area saltcedar forms almost pure stands, and it is the most widespread 
introduced species around the lake. Eight of the 13 prevalent species in 
saltcedar communities are nonnative [<a href="#36">36</a>]. In Zion National Park, Utah, saltcedar occurs 
in big sagebrush communities [<a href="#109">109</a>], and is a common pioneering 
species on disturbed riparian edges and gravel bars, along with sandbar willow 
[<a href="#108">108</a>]. </p>

<p>
On the Platte Preserves in Nebraska, saltcedar occurs in eastern saline marsh 
and meadow communities [<a href="#193">193</a>]. Along the Arkansas River in Kansas, 
cottonwood-willow communities covered 10,439 acres (4,225 ha), 
cottonwood-saltcedar-willow communities covered 8,204 acres (3,320 ha), and saltcedar 
communities covered 4,199 acres (1,699 ha) as of 1970 [<a href="#94">94</a>]. In western 
Oklahoma, a saltcedar shrubland association is common along streams and the margins 
of lakes and reservoirs and is associated with eastern annual saltmarsh aster (<i>Symphyotrichum</i>
<i>subulatum</i>), Great Plains false willow (<i>Baccharis salicina</i>), 
saltgrass, switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>), eastern cottonwood (<i>Populus deltoides</i>), and 
sandbar willow [<a href="#113">113</a>]. Ungar [<a href="#246">246</a>] describes a community dominated by saltcedar on Oklahoma 
prairie &quot;salt pans&quot; with verrucose seapurslane (<i>Sesuvium verrucosum</i>), 
Pursh seepweed (<i>Suaeda</i> <i>calceoliformis</i>), alkali sacaton, bushy knotweed 
(<i>Polygonum ramosissimum</i>), and plains bluegrass (<i>Poa arida</i>). On the sand 
flats of the lower levels of the floodplain of the south Canadian River in central Oklahoma 
tamarisk occurs with eastern cottonwood, sandbar willow, chufa flatsedge 
(<i>Cyperus esculentus</i>), common cocklebur, and hairy crabgrass 
(<i>Digitaria sanguinalis</i>) [<a href="#252">252</a>].</p>

<p>
In Galveston Bay, Texas, tamarisk occurs in coastal tallgrass prairie [<a href="#194">194</a>].</p>

<p>
In Wyoming, saltcedar occurs in several riparian habitat types. Common 
associates include eastern cottonwood, Russian-olive, peachleaf willow, Rocky 
Mountain juniper (<i>Juniperus scopulorum</i>), sagebrush (<i>Artemisia</i> 
spp.), rabbitbrush (<i>Chrysothamnus</i> spp.), sandbar willow, snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos</i> 
spp.), rose (<i>Rosa</i> spp.), sumac (<i>Rhus</i> spp.), currant (<i>Ribes</i> 
spp.), clematis (<i>Clematis</i> spp.), silver buffaloberry (<i>Shepherdia argentea</i>), 
common juniper (<i>J. communis</i>), western wheatgrass (<i>Pascopyrum 
smithii</i>), and Japanese brome (<i>Bromus japonicus</i>) [<a href="#179">179</a>]. Akashi [<a href="#2">2</a>] 
describes both pure saltcedar stands, and communities where saltcedar is codominant 
with skunkbush sumac or sandbar willow along the Bighorn River in Wyoming. Saltcedar 
may also be found in the understory and edges of eastern cottonwood communities [<a href="#2">2</a>].  </p>

<p>
Saltcedar is located on over 250 miles of rivers through several counties in 
southeastern Montana [<a href="#105">105</a>], including the Yellowstone River and some of its major 
tributaries, the Missouri River north of Lewistown, along the shoreline of the 
Fort Peck Reservoir and some of its tributaries [<a href="#107">107</a>], and along the Bighorn and 
Powder rivers. These areas are currently at the northern edge of tamarisk's 
western North American range [<a href="#149">149</a>], where it occurs on sites dominated by 
eastern cottonwood, sandbar willow, silver buffaloberry, and western snowberry 
(<i>Symphoricarpos occidentalis</i>) [<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#201">201</a>]. In Montana, Hansen and others [<a href="#107">107</a>] 
describe a saltcedar community type that is incidental at low elevations on floodplains of the major 
rivers and streams in central and eastern Montana. Saltcedar is also found in 
Russian-olive, peachleaf willow, eastern cottonwood, sandbar willow, silver 
sagebrush (<i>A. cana</i>), western wheatgrass, and prairie cordgrass (<i>Spartina pectinata</i>) 
communities. Adjacent drier communities include black cottonwood 
(<i>Populus balsamifera</i> ssp. <i>trichocarpa</i>), narrowleaf cottonwood 
(<i>P. angustifolia</i>), eastern cottonwood, Geyer willow (<i>Salix geyeriana</i>), and Kentucky 
bluegrass (<i>Poa pratensis</i>) types. Upland communities are dominated by shrubs and 
grasses such as big sagebrush, silver sagebrush, black greasewood, western wheatgrass, 
and needle-and-thread grass (<i>Hesperostipa comata</i>) [<a href="#107">107</a>]. </p>

<p>
In palm oases characterized by California palm (<i>Washingtonia filifera</i>) 
in the Colorado Desert of California, saltcedar  occurs in the 
&quot;oasis-proper&quot; zone along with species such as California palm, 
Leopold's rush (<i>Juncus acutus</i> ssp. <i>leopoldii</i>), saltgrass, and 
alkali sacaton [<a href="#249">249</a>]. Within the Mohave River drainage in California, temporal 
riparian zones form on dry lake playas during years of high precipitation and can exist for 
several years. Saltcedar  can establish on these sites along with salt heliotrope (<i>Heliotropium 
curassavicum</i>) and verrucose seapurslane. Once the surface water is gone, the 
vegetation slowly reverts to the alkali sink community [<a href="#61">61</a>].</p>

<p>
Tamarisk is listed as a dominant or codominant species in the following 
community and habitat type classifications:</p>

identification are available (e.g. [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>]).

<p>
Allred [<a href="#3">3</a>] distinguishes 4 species of tamarisk in New Mexico: athel 
tamarisk (<i>T. aphylla</i>), small-flowered tamarisk, 
saltcedar, and French tamarisk. Of these, only athel 
tamarisk can be separated by traits readily observable in the field (i.e. leaves 
conspicuously sheathing the stems and not scale-like, branchlets drooping, and 
foliage not deciduous). Athel tamarisk is not included in this 
review. The other species are similar in most traits, differing slightly in 
floral and leaf morphology [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#156">156</a>].</p>

<p>
Tamarisk are shrubs or shrub-like trees with numerous large basal branches, 
reaching 13 to 26 feet (4-8 m) in height, but usually less than 20 feet (6 m). 
Leaves are scale-like, 1.5 to 3.5 mm long, with salt-secreting 
glands. The foliage is deciduous. Flowering branches are racemes and are mostly 
primary or secondary branches. The inflorescence is a panicle of several small, 
perfect flowers, subtended by a small bract. Panicle branches of small-flowered 
tamarisk are 0.4 to 0.8 inches (1-2 cm) long and 3 to 5 mm 
wide and flowers have 4 sepals and 4 petals. Panicle branches of French 
tamarisk and saltcedar are 0.8 to 3 inches (2-8 cm) long and 3 to 5 mm wide, 
and flowers have 5 sepals and 5 petals. Petals of all species may 
be persistent or deciduous after anthesis. French tamarisk differs from 
saltcedar primarily in nectary disk morphology [<a href="#3">3</a>]. Tamarisk fruit is a capsule, 
bearing many tiny seeds (&lt;0.5 mm in diameter and &lt;0.5 mm long) with apical 
pappi [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>,<a href="#171">171</a>]. The weight of a mature tamarisk seed is about 0.00001 gram [<a href="#165">165</a>].</p>

<p>
Tamarisk has a deep, extensive root system that extends to the water table, 
and is also capable of extracting water from unsaturated soil layers (a 
facultative phreatophyte). Tamarisk has a primary root that grows with little 
branching until it reaches the water table, at which point secondary root 
branching is profuse ([<a href="#36">36</a>] and references therein). For example, a plant that 
was 15 inches (38 cm) tall had a well-developed primary root about 30 inches 
(76 cm) deep, and a branch root that extended laterally 96 inches (244 cm). In 
areas where mature plants are spaced 25 feet (7.6 m) or more apart, their roots 
may be intermixed and occupy the entire area. The location of the water table 
during root formation influences the morphology of the root 
system. In areas with shallow water tables, more extensive lateral development was 
observed. When the water table rose above the surface, adventitious roots appeared 
along the stem [<a href="#165">165</a>]. Mature tamarisk plants are able to reproduce from 
adventitious roots, even after the aboveground portion of the plant has been 
removed [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>]. Sala [<a href="#197">197</a>] noted that &quot;underground lateral roots&quot; are 
actually rhizomes in saltcedar.</p>

<p>
As a facultative phreatophyte and halophyte, tamarisk has a 
competitive advantage over native, obligate phreatophytes (e.g. cottonwood and 
willow) in areas where salinities are elevated or water tables depressed, 
conditions characteristic of disturbed riparian environments 
[<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>,<a href="#170">170</a>,<a href="#181">181</a>,<a href="#211">211</a>,<a href="#212">212</a>]. Saltcedar can obtain water at lower plant water potential 
and has higher water use efficiency than native riparian trees in both mature 
and postfire communities [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>]. When tamarisk has contact with groundwater, 
stomatal control of water loss may be slight, but under droughty conditions, 
tamarisk can exert effective stomatal control of water loss [<a href="#212">212</a>,<a href="#213">213</a>]. Even 
when the water supply is interrupted or reduced, tamarisk 
maintains relatively high transpiration rates, greater resistance to cavitation, 
and lower turgor loss thresholds than other riparian species [<a href="#181">181</a>]. The ability 
of tamarisk to closely regulate photosynthesis and leaf 
conductance during drought increases its survivability and competitive 
ability in arid and semiarid rangelands [<a href="#170">170</a>]. </p>


<p>
Tamarisk accumulates salt in special glands in its leaves, and then excretes 
it onto the leaf surface. Foliage of saltcedar is often covered with a bloom of 
salt [<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#171">171</a>]. These salts accumulate in the surface layer of soil when plants 
drop their leaves [<a href="#171">171</a>]. As surface soils become more saline over time, 
particularly along regulated rivers that are no longer subjected to annual 
flooding and scouring, germination and establishment of many native species 
become impaired [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#212">212</a>]. </p>


<p>
Tamarisk can tolerate an extreme range of environmental conditions, and 
Brotherson and von Winkel [<a href="#36">36</a>] suggest a general purpose genotype in saltcedar 
that gives it the capability to &quot;exploit a wide 
spectrum of habitats.&quot; Phenotypic plasticity, ecotypic differentiation and high 
genetic variation suggest a high invasive potential. Sexton and others [<a href="#201">201</a>] 
found no genetic differences between regions for most functional 
traits sampled in saltcedar. An exception was a regional genetic divergence 
(likely a result of multiple introductions) for root biomass investment in cold 
environments, indicating ecotypic differentiation and perhaps local adaptation 
in seedlings. In general, seedlings from the northern edge of tamarisk's range were 
shorter regardless of temperature and invested more in roots when grown at low 
temperature. A relative increase in root investment in cold climates allows increased 
belowground storage of reserves while minimizing heat transfer to the environment. Gas 
exchange in saltcedar seedlings also decreased in response to decreasing 
temperatures; however no genetic variation was detected. Their results show 
plasticity for all morphological and gas exchange traits sampled in saltcedar 
[<a href="#201">201</a>]. </p>

<p>
Saltcedar can be long lived. In New Mexico, individual shrubs 75 to 100 years old 
have not yet shown signs of deteriorating due to age [<a href="#121">121</a>].

Mature tamarisk plants reproduce vegetatively by adventitious roots, or by seed. Stevens 
[<a href="#220">220</a>] states that assertions concerning the pollination strategy, out-crossing 
requirements, and genetic variability of saltcedar are untested.

<p>
<b><font face="Bell MT">Breeding system:</font></b> 
Tamarisk flowers are bisexual [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#171">171</a>]. It has been stated by some that saltcedar 
has a self-compatible breeding system [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#201">201</a>], but preliminary tests suggest this is unlikely [<a href="#220">220</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Pollination:</b></font> 
Brotherson and von Winkel [<a href="#36">36</a>] suggest that tamarisk is cross-pollinated by wind. 
However, experiments by Stevens [<a href="#220">220</a>] in which tamarisk racemes were bagged to 
prevent insects from reaching the flowers demonstrated conclusively that 
virtually no seed development occurred without insect visitation. Wind 
pollination and selfing are under investigation; however, 
preliminary tests suggest that wind-pollination is unlikely [<a href="#220">220</a>].</p>

<p>
<b><font face="Bell MT">Seed production:</font></b> 
Tamarisk plants may flower in their 1st year of growth [<a href="#254">254</a>] but most begin to reproduce in their 
3rd year or later [<a href="#220">220</a>]. Saltcedar flowers occur in dense panicles on young 
tissues at or near the end of vegetative stems. Studies of tamarisk by Merkel 
and Hopkins [<a href="#165">165</a>] in Kansas found racemes to average 1.5 to 2 inches (3.8-5 cm) 
long and contain about 20 flowers per inch (2.5 cm) of raceme. The average number of 
ovules in the ovaries examined was 22, all of which were often fertilized and 
developed into seeds. Stevens [<a href="#220">220</a>] found each flower capable of producing about 
8 to 20+ minute seeds. Because saltcedar reproduces sexually throughout most of 
the growing season, a small plant can produce a substantial seed crop, and a 
large plant may bear several hundred thousand seeds in a single growing season 
[<a href="#165">165</a>]. Stevens [<a href="#219">219</a>] states that mature saltcedar plants are capable of producing 
2.5 x 10<sup>8</sup> seeds per year [<a href="#219">219</a>]. Warren and Turner [<a href="#254">254</a>] 
used seed traps to estimate the number of viable seeds reaching the soil surface 
in stands of varying density. They found that about 100 seeds per square inch 
(17/cm<sup>2</sup>) reached the soil surface in a dense saltcedar stand over 1 
growing season; and that more than 4 seeds per square inch per day (0.64 
seeds/cm<sup>2</sup>/day) might settle on the soil surface during the peak of 
seed production [<a href="#254">254</a>]. Saltcedar can produce seed throughout the growing season. 
High stress induced by fire, drought, herbicides, or cutting can increase flowering 
and seed production in saltcedar [<a href="#107">107</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed dispersal:</b></font> 
Saltcedar seeds have small hairs on the apex of the seed coat and are readily dispersed 
by wind (mean fall rate in still air = 0.187 m/sec), and can also be dispersed by water [<a href="#165">165</a>,<a href="#220">220</a>]. </p> 

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed banking:</b></font> 
Tamarisk seeds are short-lived and do not form a persistent seed bank [<a href="#219">219</a>]. Saltcedar seeds 
produced during the summer remain viable for up to 45 days under ideal field 
conditions (ambient humidity and full shade), or for as few as 24 days when 
exposed to full sunlight and dry conditions. Winter field longevity under ideal 
conditions is approximately 130 days. Seed mortality is generally due to 
desiccation [<a href="#220">220</a>]. If seeds are not germinated during the summer that they are 
dispersed, almost none germinate the following spring [<a href="#107">107</a>]. </p>

<p>
Viability of tamarisk seed collected in Kansas decreased with storage, especially 
12 to 16 weeks after collection [<a href="#165">165</a>]. Saltcedar seed collected along the Salt River 
in Arizona in spring and early summer and stored in the laboratory lost its viability in 6 to 
17 weeks. Longevity differed by collection date, with seed collected in the late summer 
and fall remaining viable over the winter. Viability of saltcedar seeds was prolonged by cold 
storage at 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 <font face="Times New Roman">�</font>C). Saltcedar 
seed stored in the greenhouse, where daily temperatures rose almost daily to 100 degrees 
Fahrenheit (<font face="Times New Roman">38 �</font>C), lost its viability much 
sooner than seed stored in the laboratory, suggesting that seeds do not remain 
viable for long under field conditions characteristic of Arizona deserts [<a href="#120">120</a>]. Saltcedar 
seeds went from 65% viability 2 days after dispersal, to 40% viability 14 days after 
dispersal [<a href="#252">252</a>]. </p>

<p>
<b><font face="Bell MT">Germination:</font></b> 
Tamarisk seeds have no dormancy or after-ripening requirements [<a href="#220">220</a>]. Germination requires 
direct contact with water or extremely high humidity, and is very rapid (&lt;24 
hours) [<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>,<a href="#220">220</a>]. Seeds require a moist, fine-grained (silt or smaller particle 
size) substrate for germination, such as is found in southwestern riparian habitats 
after flood waters subside [<a href="#220">220</a>]. Tamarisk seeds germinate equally well in light or dark 
[<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#220">220</a>]. Those germinating in dark were etiolated; when placed in light, they became 
green in several hours [<a href="#120">120</a>]. Seed produced in August had the highest germination percentage 
(51.4%) and in those produced in June had the lowest (19.0%) [<a href="#165">165</a>]. Germination is 
not greatly affected by high salinity under experimental conditions [<a href="#204">204</a>], and was not 
reduced in a strong solution of soil leachates from tamarisk or sandbar willow [<a href="#220">220</a>]. </p> 

<p>
Stevens [<a href="#220">220</a>] describes the germination process as follows: At 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20
<font face="Times New Roman">�</font>C), imbibition lasts for 
about 2 hours, during which time the seed swells to about twice its normal size. 
The hypocotyl may begin to emerge at 2 hours, and the seed becomes 
photosynthetic within 5 to 10 hours. Germination &quot;root hairs&quot; emerge by hour 10 
and the seed coat (with the pappus still attached) is shed between hours 10 and 
20. Tap root emergence begins after hour 20. Thus tamarisk germination is 
usually completed in less than a day [<a href="#220">220</a>]. Horton and others [<a href="#120">120</a>] describe it as follows: 
in 5 to 8 hours after moistening, the embryo has usually swollen enough to break the seed coat. 
By 24 hours the seedling is free from the seed coat, the hypocotyl has turned 
downward, and a corona of root hairs has developed around the radicle to anchor 
the seedling. As the stem straightens, the cotyledons separate [<a href="#120">120</a>].</p> 

<p>
<a name="Seedling establishment/growth:"><font face="Bell MT">
<b>Seedling establishment/growth:</b></font></a>
Receding spring and summer flows leave saturated soils that are ideal for tamarisk, 
cottonwood, and willow germination and seedling establishment. However, saltcedar 
produces seeds over a much longer period and can establish throughout the summer during low flow 
regimes when seeds of the other species are not present [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#227">227</a>]. Saltcedar 
seedling establishment and survival in these low landscape positions is 
facilitated by 3 or 4 sequential low flow years, after which they appear able to 
survive very large floods [<a href="#59">59</a>]. </p>

<p>
Tamarisk seedlings are sensitive to drying, and survival is dependent upon 
saturated soils during the first 2 to 4 weeks of growth [<a href="#120">120</a>]. However, even as 
seedlings, tamarisk is more desiccation tolerant than sandbar willow seedlings 
[<a href="#220">220</a>]. Tamarisk seedlings can be submerged for several days (most survived even 
after 24 days), but 4-6 weeks of submergence killed the majority of tamarisk 
seedlings in one study. Also, when seedlings are small they are easily detached 
from soil and float away if there is any appreciable current [<a href="#120">120</a>]. </p>

<p>
Tamarisk seedlings grow more slowly than many associated riparian species 
[<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#220">220</a>]. At 8 weeks old, tamarisk seedling shoot length averaged 4.6 inches 
(11.7 cm) and root length averaged 6 inches (15.6 cm) [<a href="#120">120</a>]. In controlled growth 
rate experiments, total biomass accumulation rate was 0.25 mg/day, and stem elongation 
rate was 2 to 5 mm/day during the 1st month of growth. Nutrient and water addition experiments 
demonstrated that water availability regulated biomass accumulation rate, while 
nutrient availability  regulated root:shoot allocation patterns [<a href="#220">220</a>]. While often 
grazed, tamarisk seedling are less sought after than cottonwood and willow seedlings [<a href="#107">107</a>], 
and selective browsing by livestock at 1 site in the Sonoran Desert reduced the natural 
height advantage of the native tree species and favored saltcedar [<a href="#227">227</a>].</p>

<p>
Self-thinning occurs rapidly among young tamarisk, 
with densities of more than 8,000 seedlings/m<sup>2</sup> immediately following 
germination, to several hundred plants/m<sup>2</sup> by the 3rd year, 
to &quot;several&quot; plants/m<sup>2</sup> 
by year 15, to less than 1 plant/m<sup>2</sup> by year 30. Tamarisk seedlings 
grown in equal density with sandbar willow seedlings had reduced growth of more 
than 80% compared to tamarisk grown separately [<a href="#220">220</a>].</p>

<p>
Mature plants grow apically and may also produce numerous lateral shoots 
[<a href="#220">220</a>]. Under favorable growing conditions, saltcedar shoots reportedly grow to 
heights of 10 to 13 feet (3-4 m) in 1 growing season [<a href="#69">69</a>]. Growth rates vary between sites. 
Saltcedar required 7.68 years for a 0.39 inch (1 cm) increase in stem diameter 
in Utah, and 2.36 years for a similar increase in Arizona [<a href="#34">34</a>]. </p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Asexual regeneration:</b></font> 
Tamarisk sprouts from the root crown following fire or other disturbance 
(flood, herbicides) that kills or injures aboveground portions of the plant 
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#211">211</a>]. All of the aboveground portions of saltcedar develop adventitious 
roots and form new shrubs if kept in warm, moist soil [<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>]. This allows tamarisk to 
produce new plants vegetatively from stems torn from the parent plants and 
buried by sediment during floods. If stem cuttings are allowed to dry, even for 
as little as 1 day, their sprouting capability is reduced [<a href="#107">107</a>]. With 15% moisture loss, 
sprouting success drops rapidly, and no sprouting occurs after 45% 
moisture loss. Sprouting is delayed in winter. One cutting planted in November 
sprouted after 6 months of dormancy. Root cuttings did not sprout [<a href="#93">93</a>].

Tamarisk tolerates a wide range of environmental conditions. It has been 
suggested that this tolerance is a result of multiple species of tamarisk, 
with previously disjunct distributions across the Eurasian continent, hybridizing 
into a single species complex in North America [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#212">212</a>].

<p>
As a facultative phreatophyte, tamarisk is mostly found on lakeshores and in riparian 
floodplain habitats, on seasonally submerged sites, and in fine fluvial 
substrates [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#220">220</a>,<a href="#259">259</a>]. In the southwestern United States, it first established along major 
drainages and then invaded outlying ephemeral water courses, canyon bottoms, 
isolated marshes, wet pastures, springs, desert oases, and rangelands 
[<a href="#212">212</a>,<a href="#249">249</a>,<a href="#256">256</a>,<a href="#257">257</a>]. Saltcedar is widely distributed in these habitats in New Mexico 
while small-flowered tamarisk and French tamarisk are only rarely found there [<a href="#3">3</a>]. In northern Great 
Plains wetlands, saltcedar is found on stream banks, floodplains, ditches, 
alkaline or saline flats [<a href="#146">146</a>], and is found in river flood plains, salt 
marshes, and roadsides in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, western Nebraska, western 
South Dakota and western North Dakota [<a href="#103">103</a>]. In California, tamarisk is 
abundant where surface or subsurface water is available for most of the year, 
including stream banks, lake and pond margins, springs, canals, ditches, and 
some washes. Disturbed sites, including burned areas, are particularly favorable 
for tamarisk establishment. It survives and even thrives on saline soils where 
most native, woody riparian plants cannot [<a href="#153">153</a>,<a href="#156">156</a>]. 
Saltcedar is a seaside plant from Texas to southern North Carolina and is 
spreading in the coastal prairie along the Gulf of Mexico [<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>].</p>

<p>The extent to which tamarisk assumes dominance in 
these various habitats is a function of climate, and current and historical 
disturbance regimes. The influence of riparian flow regimes on water 
table depth, seasonal water availability, flooding, sedimentation and native 
plant community structure and composition is also an important determinant of 
relative tamarisk dominance [<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#212">212</a>]. </p>




<b>Elevation:</b> 
Tamarisk can grow from below sea level to more than 6,600 feet (2,000 m) 
elevation [<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>,<a href="#239">239</a>]. In Death Valley National Monument saltcedar is a potential 
invader of all streams, ponds, marshes and wet ground below 5,200 feet (1,585 m) [<a href="#153">153</a>]. 
In New Mexico saltcedar is found along water courses 3,000-6,500 feet (915-1,980 m) 
[<a href="#160">160</a>]. In Arizona, tamarisk is abundant along streams in most of the state below 
5,000 feet (1,525 m) [<a href="#139">139</a>], and, while it grows in the Southwest at elevation up 
to 11,000 feet (3350 m), it does not spread rapidly above 4,000 feet (1220 m) 
[<a href="#224">224</a>]. </p>

<p>
In California, small-flowered tamarisk is common in washes, slopes, sand dunes 
and roadsides &lt;2,600 feet (&lt;800 m) [<a href="#111">111</a>], and in Utah, small-flowered tamarisk 
is found along seeps and streams at 2,800 to 5,600 feet (850-1,710 m) [<a href="#259">259</a>].</p>

<p>
<b>Climate:</b> 
Saltcedar generally grows best in the warmer climate of the 
semiarid southwestern U.S., reaching its greatest extent along major lowland 
watercourses such as the Colorado and Rio Grande rivers and many of their 
tributaries such as the Pecos and Salt Rivers [<a href="#107">107</a>]. Tamarisk can also be found in 
palm oases in the Colorado Desert of California, where the average maximum July temperature 
is 107 degrees Fahrenheit (42 <font face="Times New Roman">�</font>C) and the 
average minimum January temperature is 39 degrees Fahrenheit (<font face="Times New Roman">4 
�</font>C). At the other extreme, near the northern edge of its North American 
range, tamarisk is found on sites along the Bighorn, Powder, and Yellowstone rivers in 
southeastern Montana [<a href="#149">149</a>,<a href="#249">249</a>]. In these areas, tamarisk routinely dies back to the ground 
and the oldest live stems are generally much younger than the entire plant. It may 
also be susceptible to sporadic, harsh, climate-driven events such 
as freezing, flooding, or ice scour at these extremes [<a href="#149">149</a>].  Hudson [<a href="#130">130</a>] found 
slower seedling growth, lower initial densities, later flowering, and shorter growing 
season for saltcedar in the cold, semiarid desert environment of Bighorn Lake in northern Wyoming, as 
compared to seedling studies in the Southwest. These results indicate that 
recruitment rates of saltcedar may be somewhat slower, and invasive potential less certain 
in colder environments [<a href="#130">130</a>]. Similarly, Stromberg 
[<a href="#224">224</a>] found tamarisk growth at 3,700 to 4,300 feet (1,130-1,300 m) in southern 
Arizona was substantially slower than at 330 feet (100 m). Sexton and others 
[<a href="#201">201</a>] also found that tamarisk seedlings from northern sites were smaller and 
invested more energy in roots when grown at low temperatures. Throughout its 
current distribution in both Canada and the U.S., saltcedar has not become a 
major problem along colder, high elevation streams, or along low elevation 
streams in northern Canada [<a href="#107">107</a>]. However, it has been suggested that the 
invasive potential of northern populations could increase if populations persist 
long enough to experience multiple episodes of selection [<a href="#201">201</a>].  </p>

<p>
<b>Disturbance:</b> 
Tamarisk communities are frequently  associated with past disturbances and/or 
changes in historic disturbance regimes. Engineering features on most western rivers for 
management of water and electric power have resulted in increased evaporation and 
associated salinity, changes in erosion and sedimentation rates, and other physicochemical 
changes [<a href="#135">135</a>]. In the central Rio Grande Valley, changes in both physical environment 
and native vegetation were well underway by the time tamarisk became widespread. 
Tamarisk occupied land made available by agricultural and urban development and  by 
upstream water development. There is no evidence that it actively displaced 
native species nor that it played an active role in changing the hydraulic or 
morphologic properties of the river [<a href="#84">84</a>].  </p>

<p>
A review by Dudley and others [<a href="#74">74</a>] presents several examples of saltcedar 
invasion in areas not severely altered by human activities:</p>

Along the relatively undisturbed Escalante River in southeastern Utah, Irvine 
and West [<a href="#134">134</a>] found saltcedar only in sections of the canyon where large 
boulders provided protection from the full force of floods, or on medium and 
high terraces susceptible to only occasional flooding. Saltcedar will likely 
increase in density on these sites if flood frequency and severity and average river flow 
are diminished by impoundments [<a href="#134">134</a>].</p>

<p>
Saltcedar often dominates sites downstream from large storage dams, 
presumably because it competes better in areas with placid waters and not so well 
under conditions of frequent or severe flooding [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#239">239</a>]. Saltcedar 
occurrence greatly increased as flood frequency and severity, and average river 
flow diminished on dammed waterways [<a href="#120">120</a>]. It may be unable to germinate or 
establish on terraces more than a few meters from the water edge (e.g. [<a href="#2">2</a>]), but 
can persist on these sites once established. Along the San Pedro River in 
Arizona, young saltcedar communities occurred in the lowest bottomlands while 
older communities were above the lowest bottomlands, often in striated patterns 
which represented former streamflow patterns [<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>]. Habitat along 
newly-formed bars and cut banks of terraces in canyon-bound river reaches 
apparently remain too prone to scour for establishment of many species, 
including saltcedar. Absence of saltcedar in canyon-bound 
segments of southwestern streams may be due to the erosive nature of such 
habitats [<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>]. </p>

<p>
<b>Water availability:</b> 
Saltcedar is less sensitive to changes in ground 
water availability than native riparian trees with which it is commonly associated. 
Greater tolerance of water stress can lead to saltcedar dominance on relatively 
dry riparian sites [<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#211">211</a>,<a href="#224">224</a>]. Saltcedar showed no change in water 
availability, leaf gas exchange, or canopy dieback with increasing groundwater 
depth at either the dam-regulated or the free-flowing rivers studied in Arizona. 
Both Fremont cottonwood and Goodding willow experienced decreased water 
availability and leaf gas exchange, and increased canopy dieback with increasing 
groundwater depth at these sites. This suggests a competitive advantage for 
saltcedar with increasing depth to ground water. Leaf gas exchange was lower and 
dieback was greater for saltcedar at the free-flowing river, but there was no 
saltcedar mortality at either river [<a href="#127">127</a>]. Similarly, in the middle basin of the 
San Pedro River, saltcedar dominates only 
drier sites where surface and ground water conditions no longer support 
cottonwood-willow forests [<a href="#224">224</a>]. Following a groundwater decline of 3.7 feet 
(1.1 m), 92 to 100% of Fremont cottonwood and Goodding willow saplings died, while 0 
to 13% of saltcedar saplings died. At sites with perennial or near-perennial streamflow, 
saltcedar is codominant with Fremont cottonwood. However, saltcedar has been 
declining in importance at these sites, perhaps due to recent occurrence of 
conditions that favor cottonwood establishment (e.g. frequent winter flooding, 
high rates of stream flow during spring, exclusion of livestock). In the upper 
basin of the San Pedro River, saltcedar has increased in relative abundance at 
sites that show evidence of groundwater decline. Saltcedar is relatively sparse 
in the upper basin, perhaps due to the combination of cooler temperatures and 
occurrence of perennial or near-perennial stream flows in most areas [<a href="#224">224</a>].</p>

<p>
Establishment of tamarisk is highly dependent on surface moisture 
conditions, and the height and fluctuations of the water table. Tamarisk requires 
moist soils for germination and seedling establishment and usually establishes on 
sites where surface soils are moist in the spring and early summer, and subsoils 
remain saturated throughout the growing season [<a href="#107">107</a>]. Saltcedar does not develop rapidly when 
the water table is less than 3 feet (~1 m). In New Mexico, areas flooded during 
the growing season have a higher density of tamarisk than areas which have an 
early spring flood and a limited supply of underground water throughout the 
growing season [<a href="#47">47</a>]. Once established, tamarisk can survive 
periods of both inundation and drought [<a href="#220">220</a>]. Inundation frequently occurs  for long 
periods of time (70-90 days) in areas where saltcedar occurs [<a href="#35">35</a>]. Mature saltcedar 
plants survived complete submergence for as long as 70 days, and under partial submergence plants 
survived up to 98 days [<a href="#254">254</a>]. Saltcedar can survive almost indefinitely in the 
absence of surface saturation of the soil [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#249">249</a>]. During complete drawdowns in marshes 
of the Great Salt Lake, salinity increases dramatically and inhibits germination 
of most species, with the exception of saltcedar, saltgrass, and saltmarsh 
bulrush (<i>Scirpus robustus</i>). Drawdowns of longer than 1 season appear to 
promote establishment of saltcedar [<a href="#210">210</a>].</p>

<p>
<b>Soils:</b> 
Saltcedar is able to tolerate wide variations in soil and mineral types [<a href="#36">36</a>]. Saltcedar 
can survive in salinities exceeding 50,000 ppm [<a href="#220">220</a>]. Tamarisk is well adapted to the 
saline and alkaline soils of the Great Basin [<a href="#171">171</a>,<a href="#249">249</a>]; the saline meadows around Utah Lake [<a href="#36">36</a>]; 
and the saline soils and open salt flats in the Great Salt Plains in Oklahoma and Kansas [<a href="#245">245</a>].</p>

<p>
Increased soil salinity and decreased soil moisture may favor saltcedar over 
native and other nonnative riparian species [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>,<a href="#248">248</a>]. In a comparison of sites 
infested and not infested with saltcedar and Russian-olive at Utah Lake, 
Carman and Brotherson [<a href="#49">49</a>] found that saltcedar usually occurs on soils with higher soluble salt 
concentrations than Russian-olive (700-15,000 ppm compared to 100-3500 ppm for 
Russian-olive). Two greenhouse experiments compared  effects of salt stress and water 
stress on saltcedar and 4 native species collected from the lower Colorado 
River, Mexico. At the control salinity level, Fremont cottonwood, Goodding willow, and mule's fat 
were able to extract water from the soil equal to that of 
saltcedar and arrowweed. Yet, at elevated salinity levels saltcedar and 
arrowweed exhibited a superior water-use ability in dry soils. Under flooded conditions all 
native riparian species outperformed saltcedar [<a href="#248">248</a>].</p>

<p>
Increased soil salinity and decreased soil moisture are now typical 
characteristics of many western river systems with altered hydrology caused by 
human activities [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>]. A review by Briggs and Cornelius 
[<a href="#30">30</a>] reports US EPA estimates of increased salinity 
concentrations in the Colorado River between 1944 and 1988 of 3%, 37%, and 12% 
caused by out-of-basin exports, irrigation, and reservoir evaporation, 
respectively. Without occasional overbank flooding to wash salts from 
streambanks, native species are unable to germinate and establish, and saltcedar 
maintains dominance [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#265">265</a>]. Saltcedar 
has replaced many native species partly because it is better adapted to 
conditions that are a result of artificial flow regimes created by impoundment 
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>,<a href="#254">254</a>]. </p>

<p>
Changes in nutrient concentrations in  surface waters are also brought about by 
the introduction of treated municipal effluent. Marler and others [<a href="#158">158</a>] investigated 
the growth response of Fremont cottonwood, Goodding willow, and saltcedar in laboratory 
experiments and found that all 3 species responded positively to increased levels of 
ammonium, nitrate and phosphate. The authors note this positive response is characteristic 
of species adapted to episodic disturbances, such as floods, where the ability to rapidly acquire 
available resources may ensure seedling survival to the next growing season. 
Saltcedar showed an increase in stem number, shoot biomass 
and total biomass at these higher nutrient concentrations while natives did not, 
suggesting that at these concentrations, saltcedar establishment may be favored. 
Concentrations below these levels may provide the greatest potential for 
re-establishment of cottonwood and willow [<a href="#158">158</a>].

<br />

Tamarisk is an early to late seral species. Seedlings establish as flood waters 
recede leaving moist deposits of bare soil along riparian corridors. Its small, 
wind- and water-dispersed seeds make it ideally suited as a pioneer species on 
these sites. Tamarisk is also early successional after fire [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#231">231</a>]. Its role in mid- 
to late seral communities is site specific and may depend  on climate as well as the 
composition of the plant community in which it occurs, and on disturbances subsequent to its 
establishment (including management practices, grazing, fire, and flooding). 
Under certain conditions (e.g. altered flow regimes, drought, lowered water table, 
grazing, fire) tamarisk has a competitive advantage and is likely to be a late 
successional dominant. 

<p>
Once a dense stand of tamarisk is established, there tends to be little regeneration of 
other species in the absence of disturbance, resulting in late-successional 
dominance by tamarisk [<a href="#121">121</a>]. In much of the Southwest, tamarisk stands have been 
maintained in a &quot;youthful thicket&quot; stage by burning, chemical treatment, or 
mechanical disturbance, and other seral species are not able to occupy these sites. 
Stands that have been allowed to age naturally are rare. If tamarisk is allowed 
to complete its life cycle it may provide an understanding of its role in the 
natural succession of riverbank vegetation [<a href="#84">84</a>]. </p>



<p>
Preliminary results and field observations indicate that mature tamarisk is 
highly susceptible to shading, with shaded plants having greatly altered leaf 
morphology and reduced reproductive effort [<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#220">220</a>]. Tamarisk has the advantage 
of producing seed over a longer portion of the growing season than native species and 
is able to establish later in the season when seeds of other species are not 
present. However, if cottonwood is present in the seedling establishment stage, 
there can be a gradual increase of cottonwood dominance [<a href="#121">121</a>]. When present 
and not grazed, cottonwood grows faster than tamarisk, eventually shading it and 
causing its decline [<a href="#149">149</a>]. This relationship can be observed along the Rio 
Grande south of Albuquerque, and along the San Pedro River in Arizona [<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>]. In 
central and northern New Mexico, Campbell and Dick-Peddie [<a href="#47">47</a>] 
observed that Fremont cottonwood assumes dominance over saltcedar if the 
cottonwood is left to mature without disturbance. Measurement 
of canopy cover, density, height and age of tamarisk and plains cottonwood in 
50 plots at 25 sites along rivers in southeastern Montana indicated that 
tamarisk commonly formed thickets on open, low terraces and along overflow channels 
but was less dense under cottonwood. Even when tamarisk occupied a site before cottonwood, 
it appeared unable to suppress cottonwood dominance. At 6 study sites, the authors observed 
vigorous cottonwood plants 3 to 5 years old growing up in dense stands of tamarisk 
10 to 23 years old [<a href="#149">149</a>]. Willow and seepwillow can also be competitive with 
tamarisk [<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>].</p>



<p>
Tamarisk is competitively superior to natives under dry, saline conditions 
[<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>,<a href="#211">211</a>,<a href="#224">224</a>,<a href="#248">248</a>]. In the southwestern states, saltcedar has interrupted 
normal successional pathways and is not only maintaining its land area, but is 
continuing to increase in dominance [<a href="#107">107</a>], often forming essentially monotypic 
stands [<a href="#108">108</a>]. Tamarisk is more drought tolerant and less palatable to grazing animals 
than the native species [<a href="#121">121</a>] and is expected to exhibit greatest differential success during 
drought years and in late successional communities [<a href="#54">54</a>]. As floodplains in the Mojave Desert 
region become more desiccated with age, saltcedar assumes greater dominance over native 
phreatophytes. Saltcedar further desiccates floodplains and lowers water tables through 
its ability to produce high density stands and high leaf area and its ability to maintain sap 
flows at high canopy level transpiration rates [<a href="#198">198</a>]. Additionally, because 
tamarisk foliage concentrates salts and creates saline litter, it has a further 
competitive advantage over most native species [<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#171">171</a>]. </p>


<p>
A review by Simberloff and VanHolle [<a href="#209">209</a>] indicates that in the Southwest, 
among the few species that thrive in a saltcedar subcanopy are 3 nonnative 
brome grasses (<i>Bromus </i>spp.). To further exacerbate saline conditions, 
a nonnative, honeydew-producing leafhopper found on tamarisk interacts with a 
fungus to change soil characteristics so that plant recruitment is virtually 
eliminated under a tamarisk canopy [<a href="#209">209</a>].  </p>



<p>
Akashi [<a href="#2">2</a>] notes that herbaceous growth is poor in saltcedar-currant shrublands 
and relatively rich in saltcedar-sandbar willow shrublands. In shrublands associated with 
saltcedar, nonnative plants, particularly hairy whitetop (<i>Cardaria pubescens</i>), 
Russian knapweed (<i>Acroptilon repens</i>), and Canada thistle (<i>Cirsium arvense</i>) 
are more common than in native shrublands and often 
dominate herbaceous cover. With reduced flooding and increasing aridity, 
saltcedar associated shrublands could give way to black greasewood [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Tamarisk seedlings establish shortly after seed dispersal if conditions for
germination and establishment are appropriate (see 
<a href="#Seedling establishment/growth:">Seedling establishment/growth</a>). 
Some authors report that tamarisk seedlings can flower and produce seed
in their 1st year [<a href="#254">254</a>], but most begin to reproduce in their 
3rd year or later [<a href="#107">107</a>]. Flowering can be in spring or summer or 
both. Some tamarisk plants can produce seed from May to October, and peak seed 
production and seedling establishment is typically during June, depending on 
location.</p>


<p>
During 15 years of observation, Stevens [<a href="#220">220</a>] reports that most 
saltcedar plants in northern Arizona produced 2 flushes of foliage, 1 in April 
and May, and the other in late July. At low elevations in northern Arizona, 
flowering commenced in late April about 1 month after bud-break and peaked from 
mid-May to early June. Saltcedar plants that were not water-stressed continued 
to bloom at low to moderate levels throughout the growing season, while 
water-stressed individuals ceased reproduction following the spring blooming 
period [<a href="#220">220</a>]. On the San Pedro River in southern Arizona, saltcedar 
flowered between late April and early October [<a href="#254">254</a>]. In 
Kansas, flowering in tamarisk started during late May and continued until late 
October with maximum anthesis in mid-August. Plants often supported all 
flowering stages, from buds to mature seeds, at one time [<a href="#165">165</a>].</p>


<p>
On the Salt River in Arizona, seasonal development in saltcedar is as 
follows: buds begin swelling in mid-February, racemes begin blooming on last season's 
wood in mid-March, achieve full bloom in early April and disperse seeds 
by mid-April. Terminal panicles on new shoots begin budding by mid-April, and 
are in full flower in early May, as other panicles begin to bud. This cycle continues 
until the last bloom in September [<a href="#119">119</a>]. The morphology of the flowering 
structure is different between spring and summer on the same plant. Those plants 
that flower in both seasons bear spring flowers composed of lateral racemes 
arising from old wood, and summer panicles (or sometimes racemes) form on young 
shoots of the current season [<a href="#123">123</a>]. </p>

<p>
Seed dispersal in tamarisk begins shortly after flowering. Horton and others 
[<a href="#120">120</a>] found most tamarisk seed was produced between April and July, and was produced 
intermittently until late September or October along the Salt River in southern Arizona. 
Along the Gila River in Arizona, the 1st seeds are released during the week of May 4 to May 11 and 
throughout the following 5 1/2 months ending in mid-October. The peak of seed 
production is in mid-June, with a 2nd, minor, peak in mid-August [<a href="#254">254</a>]. On sand 
flats on the lower levels of the floodplain of the south Canadian River 
in central Oklahoma tamarisk begins fruiting in late May, and continues to 
produce flowers and disperse seeds throughout the summer [<a href="#252">252</a>]. </p>



<p>
The phenology of tamarisk relative to co-occurring natives varies from site to site. 
On the San Pedro River in southern Arizona, Fremont cottonwood produced seed 
before saltcedar and willow began flowering [<a href="#254">254</a>]. On the sand flats of the 
lower levels of the floodplain of the south Canadian River in central Oklahoma, 
tamarisk reaches full verdure at the same time as cottonwood and willow (late 
March), but initiates flowering about 2 weeks later [<a href="#252">252</a>]. On the Upper Green River in Utah, 
cottonwood seed rain is nearly complete in early August, when saltcedar seed dispersal is at its peak. 
Saltcedar seed dispersal at this site continued until mid-September [<a href="#60">60</a>].</p>



<p>
Phenological observations along the Rio Grande valley indicate that 
development of tamarisk floral and vegetative parts is approximately 20 days later 
at Albuquerque than at El Paso [<a href="#47">47</a>]. 
Similarly, a study along the Bill Williams River in Arizona reported that seed 
dispersal began in late March at a downstream site and by early April at the 
upstream site. Seed dispersal continued into October [<a href="#203">203</a>].</p>



<p>
On sand flats of the south Canadian River in central Oklahoma, tamarisk 
seedling establishment began June 15 [<a href="#252">252</a>]. In western Utah initial 
growth of established plants began in early April [<a href="#27">27</a>].

<br />

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font> 
Tamarisk can form new plants by sprouting from the root crown and from stem segments 
[<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>]. Several authors provide evidence of tamarisk resprouting after fire 
and other disturbances such as mechanical removal, herbicide treatments, and flooding. 
Repeated disturbances may lead to the development of impenetrable thickets of tamarisk 
[<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>]. When plants burn under conditions of high fuel loads, fire tends to be more 
severe, top-killing more tamarisk plants in a stand and increasing the likelihood of killing 
the root crown of some individuals (e.g. [<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>]).

<p>
Saltcedar leaves are not highly flammable due to high moisture content, even 
though they contain volatile oils. Saltcedar flammability increases with the 
build-up of dead and senescent woody material within the plant. Dense stands of 
tamarisk can be highly flammable [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#231">231</a>]. While these fires are usually 
severe enough to kill the aboveground portion of tamarisk
plants, most plants can resprout from root crowns [<a href="#178">178</a>]. </p>

<p>Evidence for specialized adaptation to fire in tamarisk remains unclear, despite its
efficient postfire recovery [<a href="#43">43</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font> 
Information on  fire regimes in which tamarisk evolved is
lacking. Busch and Smith [<a href="#44">44</a>] cite research that suggests that
halophytic tamarisk species increase in abundance in burned areas 
previously dominated by common reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>), whereas 
successional pathways suggested for <i>T. dioica</i> in southwestern Nepal 
indicate replacement by other taxa after fire [<a href="#72">72</a>].</p>

<p>
There is little quantitative information on prehistoric frequency, seasonality, 
severity and spatial extent of fire in North American riparian ecosystems. Fire 
frequency probably varied with drought cycles, prevalence of lightning 
strikes, prevalence of burning by Native Americans, and fires in surrounding uplands. 
Fire was probably more frequent along rivers in grassland and savanna biomes  than 
those in deserts, chaparral shrublands, and conifer forests (see fire regime 
table below) [<a href="#244">244</a>].</p>

<p>
Fires in low- to mid-elevation southwestern riparian plant communities 
dominated by cottonwood, willow and/or mesquite are thought to have been 
infrequent [<a href="#44">44</a>]. Evidence used to support this supposition includes the high 
water content of most riparian forests; low fire frequency in much of the 
surrounding uplands (Sonoran and Mojave desert, and drier portions of Chihuahuan 
desert and Great Basin desert scrub); and suggestions that the dominant trees in 
these communities, notably Fremont and Rio Grande cottonwood, are not 
well-adapted to fire [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#244">244</a>]. There remains, however, 
considerable uncertainty as to the effects of fire on cottonwood [<a href="#80">80</a>], with 
limited and mixed experimental evidence (e.g. [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#230">230</a>]).</p>

<p>
Increases in fire size or frequency have been reported for the lower Colorado 
and Bill Williams [<a href="#42">42</a>], Gila [<a href="#242">242</a>], Rio Grande [<a href="#230">230</a>,<a href="#231">231</a>], and Owens [<a href="#32">32</a>] rivers 
in recent decades [<a href="#244">244</a>]. While  tamarisk may promote more frequent and severe 
wildfires in these areas, the role of fire in these ecosystems is still not well 
understood [<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#231">231</a>]. Fire appears to be less common in riparian ecosystems where 
tamarisk has not invaded [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#242">242</a>]. Increases in fire size and frequency are 
attributed to a number of factors including an increase in ignition sources, increased 
fire frequency in surrounding uplands, and increased abundance of fuels.  </p>

<p>
Ignition sources, including intentional burning by farmers and ranchers, and 
accidental ignition from campfires, children, cigarettes, equipment, railroads, 
and fireworks, have increased as population densities have increased in riparian 
areas [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#231">231</a>,<a href="#242">242</a>]. </p>

<p>
Fire frequency has increased in surrounding Sonoran and Mojave desert 
communities during the past century, primarily as a result of increases in fine 
fuels from nonnative annual grasses [<a href="#31">31</a>].</p>

<p>
Several interrelated factors have contributed to increased fuel loads in many 
riparian communities. Disturbance regimes in many southwestern riparian 
communities have been altered by factors including dams and diversions, 
groundwater pumping, agriculture, and urban development, all of which have 
contributed to reduced base flows, lowered water tables, less frequent 
inundation, and changes in the frequency, timing and severity of flooding 
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>]. The result is a drier floodplain environment where much of the 
native broad-leaved vegetation becomes senescent or dies, and is replaced by 
more drought-tolerant vegetation such as tamarisk [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#212">212</a>]. Natural flood regimes 
that once served to clear away live and dead vegetation and redistribute it in a 
patchy nature on the floodplain are suppressed, thus leading to increased 
build-up and continuity of fuels [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>]. Typical stand conditions on the 
Middle Rio Grande, for example, are now characterized by mature and over-mature 
Rio Grande cottonwood trees, with accumulation of dead wood and litter on the forest 
floor [<a href="#231">231</a>]. The organic matter that has accumulated on the floor of riparian 
forests along the middle Rio Grande now averages over 50,000 kg/ha in some areas 
[<a href="#169">169</a>]. </p>

<p>
The structure of saltcedar stands may be more conducive to repeated fire 
[<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#231">231</a>] than that of native vegetation. Saltcedar and Russian-olive can 
contribute to increased vertical canopy density, creating 
volatile fuel ladders, thereby increasing the likelihood and impacts of wildfire 
[<a href="#231">231</a>]. Tamarisk plants can have many stems and high rates of stem mortality, resulting 
in a dense accumulation of dead, dry branches. Large quantities of dead branches 
and leaf litter are caught in tamarisk branches above the ground surface, 
enhancing the crowns' flammability [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#244">244</a>]. Authors have suggested that fire hazard 
peaks in tamarisk stands at 10 to 20 years of age [<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#244">244</a>]. Anderson and others 
[<a href="#5">5</a>] observed that 21 of 25 tamarisk stands along the lower Colorado River had 
burned in the prior 15 years. This implies a disturbance interval that is insufficient 
for full maturation of cottonwood, willow and mesquite [<a href="#42">42</a>], or for tamarisk to mature 
and senesce.</p>

<p>
The spread of highly flammable, nonnative vegetation such as tamarisk, 
giant reed (<i>Arundo donax</i>), red brome (<i>Bromus madritensis</i>), and cheatgrass 
(<i>Bromus tectorum</i>) in these communities, &quot;is 
due partly to the same changes in flow regimes that render riparian areas more 
flammable, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of the nonnative 
species from the effects of the management factors that have enhanced their 
spread.&quot; Tamarisk is, nonetheless, a key factor in the flood-to-fire regime 
shift [<a href="#244">244</a>].</p>

<p>
With the combination of flood suppression, water stress, and invasion by 
tamarisk and other flammable, nonnative plants, fires have replaced floods 
as the primary disturbance factor in many southwestern riparian ecosystems. Many of 
the tree and shrub species in these biotic communities can resprout 
following top-kill that may result from flooding. They may have 
more resilience to floods than to fire because fires, especially those of high 
severity, may cause more damage to perennating tissues than floods. 
More research is needed in this area. Additionally, fires do not necessarily create 
opportunities for regeneration by seed. Cottonwood and willow are adapted to release 
seed at a particular time that corresponds to annual flood pulses - a time that does 
not necessarily correspond to a high likelihood of fire [<a href="#244">244</a>]. Tamarisk may be 
better adapted to persist in an environment of frequent fires than  native 
riparian trees [<a href="#43">43</a>].</p>

<p>
While cottonwood and willow species can resprout following fire (see FEIS 
summaries of individual species for more information), tamarisk may be better adapted 
to the postfire environment than native species, especially on dammed rivers. 
For example, stomatal conductance was greater in burned versus unburned tamarisk, 
and it had higher postfire water use efficiency relative to cottonwood and willow. 
The ability of tamarisk to tolerate high levels of soil salinity may also favor 
it in the postfire environment, as soil salinity tends to increase after fire. Tamarisk 
is likely to persist following fire and expand its 
dominance with repeated burning of low-elevation riparian plant communities [<a href="#44">44</a>]. 
Many sites along southwestern river systems are characterized by saltcedar
communities with halophytic, fire-tolerant shrubs (e.g. 
big saltbrush  and arrowweed) as codominants, with only senescent 
individuals of the historically dominant cottonwood and willow remaining. It has
been suggested that cottonwood is nearing localized extinction on many riverine 
systems of the desert Southwest [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#212">212</a>,<a href="#231">231</a>]. </p>

<p>
Busch [<a href="#43">43</a>] observed that cottonwood was virtually absent, willow persisted, 
and tamarisk was abundant in all communities of burned riparian vegetation  
studied along the lower Colorado River. Arrowweed had even 
larger increases in all communities and can be considered to share dominance of 
the study area's burned riparian vegetation with tamarisk [<a href="#43">43</a>]. Stuever and 
others [<a href="#231">231</a>] agree that fire may be an important contributor to cottonwood 
decline along the middle Rio Grande, but that further research on the response 
of Rio Grande cottonwood to wildland fire would provide important insight into 
the role of fire in stand structure and species composition. For example, after 
a mixed-severity wildfire at the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, 
Ellis [<a href="#80">80</a>] found that fire severity was related to flood history (i.e. the site 
that had been regularly flooded had low severity fire), and was important in 
determining postfire plant communities. Sprouting of native plants was higher at 
the site with lower fire severity [<a href="#80">80</a>].</p>

<p>
In summary, the likelihood of fire in southwestern riparian ecosystems is 
greatest with the combination of flood suppression, water stress, and tamarisk 
presence. The presence of tamarisk in southwestern riparian ecosystems may favor 
its own propagation by further altering the natural disturbance regime, thereby 
further decreasing the already limited extent of native cottonwoods [<a href="#81">81</a>]. 
Additionally, in the absence of flooding, regeneration of native trees is 
impeded, and organic matter accumulates, thus increasing chances for future 
fires that may further alter the species composition and structure of 
southwestern riparian forests and promote the spread of saltcedar and other fire 
tolerant species [<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>]. </p>

<p>
The cottonwood-willow habitats (now cottonwood-willow-tamarisk habitats) have 
undergone serious changes in disturbance regimes [<a href="#244">244</a>]. Tamarisk may or may not 
affect fire regimes in other communities in which it occurs. More research is 
needed in this area. </p>

several communities or ecosystems in which tamarisk may be found. If you are interested

IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Tamarisk is usually  top-killed by fire, and severe fire may also kill the root 
crown [<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>].

<p>
Tamarisk seeds withstand a dry heat of 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 <font face="Times New Roman">�</font>C) 
for 20 minutes; higher temperatures kill seeds within a few minutes [<a href="#120">120</a>].

<br><br>

<span class="subframeName">
<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT">
DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT:</a>
</span>
<br />

The immediate effect of fire on tamarisk depends on fire severity, which is 
largely a function of the quantity and quality of fuels present. Saltcedar 
leaves are not highly flammable due to high moisture content, even though they 
contain volatile oils. Saltcedar flammability increases with the build-up of 
dead and senescent woody material within the plant [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>]. When plants burn 
under conditions of high fuel loads, fire tends to be more severe, top-killing 
many plants and increasing the likelihood of killing the root crown of some individuals 
(e.g. [<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>]). </p>


<p>
In experimental burns in saltcedar in eastern New Mexico, plots burned 
 5 years before did not carry treatment fires as well as plots that were previously 
unburned [<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>]. Postfire canopy reduction on 
previously unburned sites ranges from 60 to 90%, while sites that were reburned 
after 5 years had 30 to 60% canopy reduction after burning. Areas where fire was reapplied 
after 5 years had variable saltcedar mortality, up to 31% [<a href="#116">116</a>]. 

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName"><a name="PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE">PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Tamarisk plants can sprout from the root crown and form new plants following 
top-kill [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>]. Thus, canopy cover of tamarisk can increase after fire, as 
observed by Busch [<a href="#43">43</a>] along the lower Colorado River floodplain. Similarly, a 
canopy fire at Lees Ferry, Arizona, killed 10% of mature tamarisk plants, and 
surviving plants produced shoots that exceeded 6 feet (1.8 m) in height within 5 
months [<a href="#220">220</a>]. Regrowth of surviving tamarisk plants after a July wildfire at Lake 
Meredith National Recreation Area, Texas, exceeded 6 feet (1.8 m) at the end of 
that growing season [<a href="#90">90</a>].

<p>
Flowering in tamarisk may increase after fire. Stress-induced flowering was 
observed in tamarisk at Lees Ferry in August following a canopy fire. 
Significantly fewer (p&lt;0.001) unburned saltcedar plants were blooming (10.9% of 
101 plants on adjacent, unburned control areas), while 69.4% of 144 burned plants were 
blooming heavily [<a href="#220">220</a>]. 

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE">
DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Saltcedar response to fire depends on timing of the fire (temperature and 
moisture conditions and phenological stage of saltcedar), fire severity, and postfire plant 
competition [<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>]. 

<p>
Timing of fire can affect tamarisk response due to its effects on fire 
severity, subsequent climatic conditions, or susceptible phenological stage. 
Under stressed conditions, as many as half of the shrubs may not survive 
burning [<a href="#121">121</a>]. Ongoing research in 
eastern New Mexico is being conducted to determine the best phenological stage 
to burn and reburn saltcedar to reduce density, canopy, and hazardous fuel 
load. Phenological stages at which treatments have been applied include: 
dormancy, leaf elongation, first bloom, full canopy, and leaf senescence [<a href="#116">116</a>]. 
A review by Grace and others [<a href="#101">101</a>] suggests that burning during the peak of summer 
has the strongest adverse effect on saltcedar, presumably due to ensuing water stress. 
Tamarisk mortality exceeded 60% 12 months following a July wildfire at Lake 
Meredith National Recreation Area, Texas [<a href="#90">90</a>]. </p>

<p>
Fire severity can affect how many plants in a stand are top-killed and how 
many suffer complete mortality. Severe fires kill all aboveground portions of 
trees, but may result in extensive and rapid growth from the root crown in 
saltcedar [<a href="#178">178</a>]. After fire in a riparian forest along the Rio Grande River in 
New Mexico, no saltcedar retained viable aboveground tissue and root suckers 
(suckers not within 30 cm of an existing stem) were nearly absent. Sprouting of 
saltcedar from existing root crowns (shoot suckers, within 30 cm of an existing stem) 
occurred in 53% of individuals at high severity (no leaf 
litter remaining in reference areas) burn sites 
and in 55% of individuals at low- (leaf litter burned in patches, not entirely 
consumed) and mixed-severity burn sites [<a href="#80">80</a>]. At 
Afton Canyon in southern California, fire mortality of tamarisk following 
prescribed fire appeared to be low within &quot;high intensity&quot; burn areas (around 10 to 
25%), and no mortality was observed in &quot;low and medium intensity&quot; burn areas 
[<a href="#155">155</a>].</p>

<p>
Plant community composition can affect the response of tamarisk to 
fire. On floodplains in Nepal, <i>T. dioica</i> is replaced by other taxa 
following fire [<a href="#72">72</a>], but a review by Busch [<a href="#43">43</a>] suggests 
that recently burned marshes in the Near East are frequently colonized by 
halophytes including <i>T. passerinoides</i>. In riparian areas in southwestern 
North America, tamarisk typically occurs with various species of cottonwood, 
willow and mesquite. Because postfire resprouting
can be vigorous in many of these woody taxa, prefire vegetation is an important 
determinant of postfire community structure. While cottonwood and willow 
species are able to resprout following disturbances such as fire (see FEIS 
summaries of individual species for more information), tamarisk may be better 
adapted to the postfire environment than native riparian species (see 
<a href="fire_ecology.html">Fire Ecology</a> for more 
information) [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#156">156</a>].</p>

<p>After fire on the lower Colorado River floodplain, tamarisk 
dominated in all community types, while cottonwood was nearly absent 
from all burned plots [<a href="#43">43</a>]. Hansen and others [<a href="#107">107</a>] cite 
evidence that saltcedar invasion along the Arkansas River floodplain was 
facilitated by an increase in frequency of wildfires, fueled by dense stands of 
saltcedar, that damaged or killed many cottonwoods and resulted in rapid 
regrowth of saltcedar from root sprouts [<a href="#107">107</a>]. Greater water use 
efficiency and higher hydraulic efficiency in burned tamarisk relative to 
Goodding willow and Fremont cottonwood may also facilitate the recovery of 
tamarisk following fire in low-elevation riparian habitats of the Southwest 
[<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>]. </p>

<p>
Short-term responses of riparian vegetation to a 
wildfire was monitored at 2 study sites at the Bosque del Apache National 
Wildlife Refuge in the Rio Grande Valley in New Mexico. Fire severity reflected 
the amount of organic debris present before the fire, which reflected flooding 
history at the 2 sites: fire severity was lower at the site with a more 
extensive flooding history and less debris. Resprouting was prevalent among 
cottonwoods at both burn sites including basal stem sprouts, root-crown sprouts, 
and root suckering. However, of the native Rio Grande cottonwoods in the area, 
only those located in an area that experienced lower fire severity 
(had been regularly flooded) retained viable aboveground tissue 2 years after 
the fire. Considering the fuel accumulations along the Middle Rio Grande Valley [<a href="#81">81</a>], it is 
likely that fire severity will continue to be high and the loss of mature 
cottonwoods may be extensive. Reducing current fuel load, either by restoring 
flooding or by mechanical removal, is needed to lessen the impact of fires on 
riparian forests along the Rio Grande [<a href="#80">80</a>].</p>

<p>
Arrowweed may have large increases after fire and thus share dominance with 
tamarisk in burned riparian vegetation [<a href="#43">43</a>].

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName"><a name="FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

As a management tool, fire can be used to either kill unwanted species or to 
simulate historic fire regimes and promote desired species. Historic fire 
regimes did not occur in the presence of many invasive plants that are currently 
widespread, and use of fire may not be a feasible or appropriate management 
action if desirable species are less fire tolerant than undesirable invasives. 
Several authors (e.g. [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>]) have suggested that fire facilitates invasion 
and dominance of tamarisk in riparian areas of western North America. In some locations, 
however, prescribed fire is being studied and used as a management tool (alone and in 
combination with other methods) for control of tamarisk species [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#155">155</a>,<a href="#184">184</a>].

<p>
Use of fire alone to control saltcedar is generally 
ineffective. Saltcedar is highly flammable only in dense stands with heavy fuels 
[<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>]. High water and salt content make saltcedar difficult to burn 
[<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>], and burning may only kill aboveground portions of the plant, leaving the root crown 
intact and able to produce vigorous sprouts [<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>].</p>


<p>
<b>Postfire colonization potential:</b> 
Tamarisk is early successional after fire [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#231">231</a>], and other disturbances. 
Several authors suggest that tamarisk invasion is facilitated by fire [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>], 
although experimental evidence is limited. Along the Bighorn River in northern 
Wyoming, Akashi [<a href="#2">2</a>] found that tamarisk often occupies areas where woodlands were 
previously burned. Hansen and others [<a href="#107">107</a>] cite evidence that saltcedar invasion 
along the Arkansas River floodplain was facilitated by an increase in wildfire frequency.</p>


<p>
<b>Fire prevention/suppression:</b> 
In some situations (e.g. sites where vegetation provides critical habitat for 
important wildlife species) it may be desirable to prevent fires by reducing fuel 
loads and/or ignition sources or to suppress fires that do occur. When a tamarisk 
stand burns under severe conditions, any wildlife value that it may have provided is 
lost until the community again reaches maturity. Fire risk may be reduced by restoring flood 
flows, groundwater, and base flows on some rivers; reintroducing beavers on some 
sites; excluding livestock; using agricultural practices that do not amplify 
the amount of salt and its delivery into rivers; and reducing fuel loads. </p>


<p>
Periodic burning of tamarisk stands at 5- to 7-year intervals has been suggested to 
eliminate the litter accumulation prior to the point where fuels loads result in fire that kills the 
entire aboveground portion of tamarisk plants. This would extend tamarisk productivity 
for dove nesting and other wildlife use values [<a href="#81">81</a>]. However, few, if any, experiments with 
fuel reduction in riparian habitats have been conducted, and there are no 
standard guidelines. Cautions and recommendations for fuel management in areas 
occupied by threatened or endangered species are provided in the
<a href="https://arizonaes.fws.gov/SWWFFINALRecPlan.htm">southwestern willow 
flycatcher recovery plan</a> [<a href="#244">244</a>].</p>


<p>
<b>Fire as a control agent:</b> 
In some areas, prescribed fire can be used to manage saltcedar by 
eliminating the closed canopy, slowing the rate of invasion, and allowing 
desirable vegetation to respond, thereby increasing diversity in monotypic 
saltcedar stands. Burning these communities under controlled conditions can also 
reduce the potential for costly wildfires that must be suppressed to avoid 
property loss [<a href="#186">186</a>]. Much current research on prescribed burning in tamarisk is 
conducted out of Texas Tech University. Abstracts summarizing the status of 
this research are available in
<a href="https://www.rw.ttu.edu/dept/Department/Highlights.htm">Research 
Highlights</a>, and more information may be available by contacting individual 
authors. Research includes studies of fire behavior and spotting potential of 
fires in saltcedar-dominated communities [<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>]; effects of season of burning 
on response of saltcedar to prescribed fire [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#184">184</a>]; response of herbaceous 
species to prescribed fires in saltcedar-dominated communities [<a href="#40">40</a>]; effectiveness of using 
herbicides in conjunction with prescribed burning on saltcedar control [<a href="#184">184</a>]; and 
tamarisk  response to wildfire followed by mechanical and chemical control 
efforts [<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>].</p>


<p>
Saltcedar stands can burn hot with erratic fire behavior and numerous firebrands 
transported downwind from the headfire [<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>,<a href="#231">231</a>]. Therefore, burning saltcedar requires 
experienced personnel and a prescribed fire set-up that provides poorly 
receptive fuels downwind from the headfire. A study along the Pecos River 
floodplain was initiated to define prescriptions for burning dense stands of 
saltcedar and for reapplying fire to saltcedar after 5 years. Headfires are being 
applied to saltcedar stands throughout the year to provide data on a range of 
temperatures, relative humidities, and wind speeds, as well as various fine fuel, 
10-hr fuel, and green shrub leaf moisture contents. Fire weather, fuel moisture, 
and fuel loading variables are measured before and during fires. Fire behavior 
(flame length, flame height, depth of burning bed, torching height, and rate of spread) 
and distance firebrands carried were monitored for each headfire [<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>]. Saltcedar in 
dense stands that have not burned in 25 to 30 years exhibit extreme fire behavior 
and crowning due to the closed canopy, regardless of time of year. They can have 
flame lengths exceeding 140 feet (43 m), 
resulting in consumption of a majority of the woody material. Stands reburned 
within 5 to 6 years show vastly different fire behavior, carrying fire only if 
there is adequate fine fuel load and continuity. Few trees torch during 
burning, though some trees are top-killed [<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>]. 
Similarly, at Afton Canyon in southern California, previously burned stands 
lacked sufficient fuels to carry a 2nd fire. Live fuel moisture, fuel 
loading, and live to dead vegetation ratios were  critical components 
that influenced combustibility and fire spread in tamarisk stands [<a href="#155">155</a>]; no specific 
critical levels were identified.</p>


<p>
Some authors (e.g. [<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>]) suggest that saltcedar 
stands are highly susceptible to fires due to  accumulation of organic debris 
in the absence of flooding, whether of native or nonnative origin. Flooding may help reduce 
the impact of fires by increasing decomposition and reducing the standing stock 
of forest floor organic matter at sites dominated by cottonwoods or saltcedar in 
the Middle Rio Grande Valley of central New Mexico [<a href="#80">80</a>]. </p>


<p>
Whether an area of saltcedar has been burned before or not, it has 
the ability to transport firebrands at least 500 feet (150 m) downwind. 
Therefore, according to Racher and others [<a href="#185">185</a>], blacklines should be at least 
700 feet (213 m) wide. Blackline burning should be under 
&quot;the 40-60 rule&quot;: headfires can be installed with temperatures 65 to 95 
degrees Fahrenheit (18 <font face="Times New Roman">�</font>C), relative 
humidity 25 to 40%, and wind speeds less than 15 mile/hour (24 km/hour). 
Managers should be prepared for extreme fire behavior in old, decadent stands [<a href="#185">185</a>]. </p>


<p>
Research to determine the best phenological stage to burn and reburn saltcedar 
to reduce density, canopy, and hazardous fuel load is ongoing in eastern New Mexico. 
Phenological stages at which treatments have been applied include: dormancy, 
leaf elongation, first bloom, full canopy, and leaf senescence [<a href="#116">116</a>]. Saltcedar density 
and canopy cover are measured before and after burning. Individual saltcedar trees 
will be monitored before and after burning to evaluate response during different 
phenologic states and environmental parameters [<a href="#40">40</a>]. </p>


<p>
According to Howard and others [<a href="#128">128</a>], burning at the Ouray National 
Wildlife Refuge along the Green River in Utah in July resulted in 64% mortality 
in tamarisk, compared with 9% mortality with September burns and 4% in October 
burns. They speculate that differences in response to timing of treatment in 
this case may be more attributable to heat yields due to differences in wind speed 
and fuel moisture contents, rather than to fuel loads [<a href="#128">128</a>]:</p>

<p>
Response of herbaceous species (or other natives) to prescribed fires in 
saltcedar-dominated communities is also being researched [<a href="#40">40</a>]. It 
is important to note that  research in Texas and eastern New Mexico is conducted in 
different ecosystems from those that occur along the Rio Grande and Colorado River basins. Site 
specific considerations must be made for the desired plant community and the response of those species 
to prescribed fire and other ecological constraints. In habitats such as the 
Gulf coastal prairie, for example, sites occupied by saltcedar are generally 
upland and part of a fire-dependent ecosystem. In this habitat, use of fire to control 
saltcedar appears to be appropriate, although preliminary observations  suggest 
that occasional fires are insufficient to result in population control 
[<a href="#101">101</a>].</p>


<p>
<b>Fire and herbicide:</b> 
Prescribed fire can also be used to thin dense 
tamarisk infestations prior to follow-up application of herbicide [<a href="#156">156</a>]. 
Experiments at the Ouray National Wildlife Refuge indicate that prescribed 
burning coupled with herbicide application in the spring, fall and winter are 
ineffective at controlling tamarisk, while prescribed burning coupled with 
herbicide application in July can be effective. Burning in late July prevented 64% 
of tamarisk plants from resprouting the following year, while spraying resprouts 
with 2,4-D one month after the July burn prevented 99% of the plants from resprouting. 
Burning and spraying with 2,4-D in September and October resulted in 12 and 5% 
mortality of tamarisk, respectively. Triclopyr ester as a stump 
treatment or as a basal bark spray also prevented resprouts by 99%, while triclopyr amine 
provided poor control [<a href="#128">128</a>]. Basal applications of imazapyr did not effectively 
control burned, resprouting saltcedar 1 growing 
season after treatment at Lake Meredith National Recreation Area, Texas [<a href="#89">89</a>].</p>



<p>
On the Afton Canyon Riparian Restoration Project in the lower Mojave River in southern California, 
both the cut stump/herbicide treatment (see 
<a href="management_considerations.html#Integrated management:">Integrated management</a>) and prescribed burning 
followed by herbicide application were used to control saltcedar [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#155">155</a>]. 
A 100 acre (40 ha) area, consisting of low to high density, young- to old-age class 
tamarisk was burned under prescription. Prior to the burn, firebreaks were 
manually constructed around 100 native trees to limit fire impacts to potential 
native seed sources and to serve secondarily as staging and/or escape areas for 
fire personnel. About 10 to 25% of the tamarisk were killed in &quot;high intensity&quot; 
burn areas. Tamarisk mortality was not observed in &quot;low to medium intensity&quot; burn 
areas. Tamarisk resprouting was first noted 2 weeks following the initial burn. 
Burnt tamarisk resprouts (average height &lt;1m) were treated with a foliar 
herbicide application during the following 3 months. Areas where fire did not 
carry within the treatment area, such as wet meadows and low density tamarisk 
stands, were treated with a cut stem-herbicide application. Approximately 20% of 
the initial fire treated area was burned again in November, 
1993, and an estimated 50% of this area was treated with the cut stem-herbicide 
treatment, as these moderately burned stands lacked sufficient fuels to carry a 
2nd fire. Another herbicide application on the 1993 burn area and a 3rd 
application on the initial burn area were completed in 1993 [<a href="#155">155</a>]. </p>



<p>
The Afton Canyon project is monitored using photoplot ground and canopy cover analyses and 
cross-sectional riparian plant frequency and cover trend analysis [<a href="#78">78</a>]. 
Project monitoring is conducted by an interdisciplinary team and is designed to 
assess riparian area and wetland functioning condition by analyzing the interaction 
among geology, soil, water and vegetation [<a href="#78">78</a>]. After the 1st year 
treatments, saltcedar ground and canopy coverage within all photoplots had been 
eliminated, although such results were not uniform across the treatment area. As 
of April 1997, no saltcedar re-establishment within photoplots had occurred, 
grass and forb production had begun to increase, and bare ground had begun to 
decrease [<a href="#78">78</a>]. </p>



<p>
Overall tamarisk mortality was estimated to be around 60%, while tamarisk mortality 
in high severity burn areas was approximately 70 to 100% following 
the 2nd herbicide application [<a href="#155">155</a>]. Portions of standing dead tamarisk 
remaining after burning were cut in order to foster native plant germination and to 
increase ground cover utilized by wildlife. Revegetation of saltcedar removal areas 
is primarily through natural revegetation, with some native 
tree pole plantings and native grass, shrub and tree seedings [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#155">155</a>]. Surface water 
levels in areas where 90 to 100% of tamarisk was 
removed have increased up to 12 inches (30 cm) in some areas [<a href="#155">155</a>].</p>



<p>
Factors complicating treatment included incomplete fire coverage, personnel 
limitations, high project costs (~$1,500-$3,000 per acre the 1st year), equipment 
failure, winter flooding (washing tamarisk seed and sprouting material into 
area); continued authorized livestock grazing impacts including hoof 
soil-punching that provides ideal tamarisk germination strata, and utilization 
of native vegetation; and unauthorized off-highway vehicle soil disturbance 
[<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#155">155</a>]. An effective strategy for dealing with upstream sources of saltcedar 
seed and vegetative propagules is needed. Terraces adjacent to central channels 
appear to hold their own against saltcedar reinfestation for a longer time 
interval if the initial saltcedar treatment is complete. Regardless, 
saltcedar site maintenance is required for some time following treatments [<a href="#78">78</a>].</p>



<p>
<b>Fire/mechanical control/herbicide:</b> 
A summer (July) wildfire at Lake Meredith National Recreation Area, Texas, 
provided an opportunity to investigate tamarisk response to wildfire and to 
mechanical and chemical control efforts following fire. Many tamarisk were 
&quot;completely consumed&quot; by the wildfire. Regrowth of 
surviving plants exceeded 6 ft (1.8 m) at the end of that growing season. About 
50 acres (20 ha) of the burned tamarisk were rollerchopped the following June. 
Triclopyr was applied in February and again in March as 
individual plant basal treatments to 100 fire-generated resprouts each month. 
Treatment efficacy was evaluated 12 months after treatment. Tamarisk mortality 
(i.e. no green growth and no buds after 12 months) was 60.6%. The combined effect of 
summer wildfire and rollerchopping was 85.1% mortality. The rollerchopping facilitated herbicide 
application and establishment of early seral species via soil disturbance. 
Herbicide applications resulted in 89.9 and 94.5% mortality from February and 
March treatments, respectively. Preliminary results indicate that dormant season 
individual plant treatment with 25% triclopyr following burning is an effective 
method for managing saltcedar infestations [<a href="#90">90</a>]. </p>


<p>
At the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, saltcedar stands were treated 
with an aerial application of imazapyr, followed by chaining of the defoliated 
stems and broadcast burning. Conditions during the burn in September, 1988, 
averaged 40% relative humidity, 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25
<font face="Times New Roman">�</font>C) air temperature, 5 mile/hour (8 km/hour) 
wind speed form the south, and fuel moisture content &lt;10%. The fire consumed 
over 90% of the woody debris. One year later, saltcedar resprouts were common 
over most of the burned area. The area was then rootplowed. 
Authors speculate that the abundance of resprouts was the result of incomplete 
herbicide activity and burning too soon after spraying. On another site in the 
same area, a broadcast burn was attempted without prior 
chaining but the burn was incomplete [<a href="#237">237</a>].</p>



<p>
Successful control of saltcedar is reported from Joshua Tree 
National Monument by cutting plants with chainsaws, axes, and pulaskis. The cut 
debris is piled on the stumps and burned, usually resulting in saltcedar 
mortality [<a href="#55">55</a>].

IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Livestock: Cattle and sheep tend to browse heavily on young tamarisk seedlings 
and mature plants if the stand is open [<a href="#107">107</a>]. More commonly, livestock tend to 
browse native plants (e.g. cottonwood and willow), giving tamarisk the 
competitive advantage in areas grazed by livestock [<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#226">226</a>]. In Arizona, 
tamarisk is seldom browsed by livestock, but is used by cattle for cover in 
river bottoms [<a href="#139">139</a>].

<p>
Wildlife: The species richness and diversity of wildlife in tamarisk differs 
from one location to another. Biogeographical considerations, specifically 
elevation and climatic gradients, may at least partially explain this phenomenon 
[<a href="#133">133</a>].</p>

<p>
Extensive stands of tamarisk may lack the plant diversity and food sources 
associated with some native riparian communities. In some cases, native 
communities may be more likely to support greater species diversity and numbers 
than tamarisk monocultures [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#237">237</a>], although this may not be true in all 
cases [<a href="#133">133</a>]. Tamarisk does affect habitat dynamics for a number of birds, 
mammals, insects, and aquatic species where it invades. </p>

<p>
Riparian floodplains in the southwestern U.S. support some of the 
highest concentrations of breeding bird species in temperate North America in 
both abundance and diversity [<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#234">234</a>]. Several authors suggest that replacement 
of native woody vegetation with nonnative, invasive species such as tamarisk may result in a 
reduction in avian diversity and species richness (e.g. [<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>]). The effect of 
saltcedar on avian species is dependent on the type of bird, density and growth 
characteristics of saltcedar (e.g. [<a href="#122">122</a>]), elevation and temperature [<a href="#133">133</a>], and overall structure of the 
community. Additionally, breeding bird densities, diversity and species richness differ from 
location to location, season to season, and year to year within the same 
vegetative association [<a href="#234">234</a>]. </p>

<p>
Several studies suggest that saltcedar communities do not 
support as high a density and/or diversity of native bird species as do native 
plant communities on the lower 
Colorado River [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>]. Along the Rio Grande in west Texas, 
saltcedar has a high total bird population in the breeding season consisting 
mostly of white-winged doves, but during the winter bird densities are very low 
[<a href="#82">82</a>]. Other studies have found a 
high degree of avian use of tamarisk along the middle Pecos River in 
Texas and New Mexico (e.g. [<a href="#133">133</a>,<a href="#152">152</a>]) and along the Rio Grande 
River (e.g. [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>]) for at least some bird species. Brown [<a href="#37">37</a>] found that 5 of 6 species of obligate 
riparian birds preferred saltcedar as a nest site over native riparian 
vegetation along the upper Colorado River in Grand Canyon National Park, and 
Brown and Trosset [<a href="#38">38</a>] conclude that &quot;the tamarisk community created by the 
operation of Glen Canyon Dam represents the ecological equivalent of native 
habitat for some riparian birds, and its presence has enhanced breeding habitat 
for these 11 species of birds.&quot; </p>

<p>
Saltcedar provides habitat for a number of bird species including (but not 
limited to) white-winged and mourning dove [<a href="#122">122</a>], Mississippi kite [<a href="#98">98</a>], 
black-throated sparrow [<a href="#253">253</a>], summer tanager [<a href="#5">5</a>], yellow-billed cuckoo, yellow-breasted chat, 
rufous-sided towhee [<a href="#152">152</a>], and the endangered southwestern willow flycatcher [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#177">177</a>]. According to Cohan and others [<a href="#56">56</a>], a large number of species that use 
saltcedar belong to genera of the Old World where saltcedar evolved. Among them, 
ground feeders, granivores, or species such as doves often showed a preference 
for or did not avoid saltcedar; frugivores do not use saltcedar; and very few 
insectivores used saltcedar, although palatable insects can be present in large 
numbers [<a href="#56">56</a>]. Other studies have found 
that tamarisk stands do provide habitat for several insectivorous birds (e.g. 
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#152">152</a>,<a href="#177">177</a>,<a href="#253">253</a>]). In the Bosque del Apache National 
Wildlife Refuge in the Middle Rio Grande Valley, timber gleaners such as the 
white-breasted nuthatch, were never detected in saltcedar and timber drillers 
and cavity nesters were rare in saltcedar [<a href="#79">79</a>]. Ellis [<a href="#79">79</a>] 
suggests that many species could successfully transition to saltcedar 
communities, while others (i.e. cavity nesters and timber gleaners) are more strongly tied to native vegetation. Similarly, at 
least 6 of the bird species studied on the lower Colorado River by Meents and 
others [<a href="#164">164</a>] may be threatened by the continuous decline or 
removal of native vegetation.</p>

<p>
The number and type of bird species supported by tamarisk communities 
depends, in part, on density of saltcedar and composition and structure of the 
community. For example, mixed communities containing saltcedar may support more 
bird species and have higher densities than saltcedar monocultures [<a href="#56">56</a>]. Tall, 
dense stands of saltcedar along the lower Colorado River are valuable for 
nesting doves and less common bird species, such as the summer tanager, that are 
normally restricted to cottonwood-willow communities [<a href="#5">5</a>]. Floodplain grassland 
areas on the middle Pecos River are low in bird abundance and species richness 
when compared to tamarisk habitat. These areas are, however, important to 
grassland birds, and removing tamarisk from the Pecos River would provide these 
species with additional habitat, while reducing habitat for other species, 
including yellow-billed cuckoo, yellow-breasted chat, and rufous-sided towhee 
[<a href="#152">152</a>]. Farley and others [<a href="#87">87</a>] suggest that most bird species in the central and 
southern Rio Grande Valley benefit from a mosaic of riparian woodlands 
containing mixtures of native tree and shrub species of different size classes. 
Breeding pairs of the southwestern willow flycatcher spend most of their time 
beneath the overstory canopy in willows or saltcedar in the Rio Grande Valley 
[<a href="#177">177</a>]. The southwestern willow flycatcher nests in native vegetation where 
available, but also nests in thickets dominated by tamarisk and Russian-olive 
[<a href="#244">244</a>,<a href="#264">264</a>]. In one study, the willow flycatcher was captured more frequently in 
saltcedar than in other habitats in the fall. Several other migrant species were 
captured more frequently in saltcedar than in other habitats, in spring, fall, 
or both seasons [<a href="#264">264</a>]. Some tamarisk stands mimic, to some degree, the riparian 
woodland structure once provided by willows, and tamarisk is used as a nesting 
substrate by the flycatcher. Flycatcher productivity in tamarisk-dominated sites 
has been variously found to be equal to or lower than in sites dominated by 
native willow species. From the standpoint of flycatcher productivity and 
survivorship, the suitability of nonnnative-dominated sites is not known [<a href="#244">244</a>]. 
See the final
<a href="https://arizonaes.fws.gov/SWWFFINALRecPlan.htm"> southwestern willow flycatcher
recovery plan</a> for 
more information. </p>

<p>
Vertebrate herbivores on tamarisk include beaver, while 
other rodents and/or lagomorphs may rarely consume young foliage [<a href="#220">220</a>]. Bank beavers 
will eat young shoots of saltcedar, but they prefer cottonwood and willow over 
saltcedar by about 9 to 1, thereby continually transforming a floodplain habitat 
to saltcedar dominance [<a href="#115">115</a>].  At Big Bend National Park, beaver eat willow saplings 
but not saltcedar, exacerbating the invasion. Beaver populations appear to be 
suffering from saltcedar invasion, and populations of other rodents also appear 
to be affected, some positively and 
others negatively [<a href="#26">26</a>]. Monotypic stands of saltcedar are little used by 
beaver or mule deer [<a href="#108">108</a>]. In Owens Valley, California, pocket gophers were found to 
cause damage and mortality to saltcedar plants in several stands by chewing 
through the roots [<a href="#157">157</a>]. Along the shoreline of Lake Powell, black-tailed jackrabbits use 
saltcedar as a major food source [<a href="#253">253</a>]. Both cottonwood and saltcedar 
communities provide important cover and forage for calving elk in the Cimarron 
National Grassland in Kansas [<a href="#24">24</a>].</p>

<p>
A survey of herpetofauna on a riparian island upstream from the Whitlow Ranch 
Dam in Arizona, dominated by Goodding willow and saltcedar, indicated many of the locally expected riparian species 
were absent. It is unclear whether biogeographical considerations and flooding 
patterns are responsible, or if structural and physical conditions of the new habitat are 
responsible [<a href="#236">236</a>]. Reptile abundance and diversity were greater on an unaltered, 
mature, gallery-type stand of cottonwood and willow than on an altered site 
dominated by honey mesquite (<i>Prosopis glandulosa</i>) and tamarisk in central 
Arizona [<a href="#136">136</a>]. </p>

<p>
Watts and others [<a href="#255">255</a>] provide a list of insects associated with 
saltcedar in New Mexico. Stevens [<a href="#220">220</a>] reports over 200 
species of invertebrate herbivores associated with tamarisk in the U.S., only 6 
of which are sufficiently common in northern Arizona to qualify as pests of this 
plant. Insect herbivory does not appear to affect tamarisk growth. Herbivory 
must exceed 75% of the foliage before reduction of apical growth rate occurs 
[<a href="#220">220</a>].</p>

<p>
Vegetated shorelines of the Colorado River, consisting mainly of nonnative 
saltcedar, had nearly twice the densities of subadult humpback chub compared to 
talus and debris fans. This may have important implications for humpback chub recovery and 
management of the Colorado River through Grand Canyon, where shorelines were not 
historically  vegetated, and saltcedar invasion has created a unique habitat [<a href="#57">57</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Palatability/nutritional value:</b></font> 
The scale-like leaves of tamarisk tend to be unpalatable to grazers [<a href="#218">218</a>]. 
The nutritional value of tamarisk is not known, although it is reported to have very low 
crude protein content [<a href="#115">115</a>]. </p>

<p>
<b><font face="Bell MT">Cover value:</font></b> 
Saltcedar provides some cover for livestock and wildlife (e.g.[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>]). Saltcedar 
provides nesting sites for many bird species (see above discussion for pertinent 
references).

Tamarisk honey is &quot;typically described as being amber in color 
with a strong disagreeable taste. It sometimes impairs the color and flavor 
of honey from other sources, if not extracted in a timely fashion. Still, 
to beekeepers in the arid Southwest whose bees are near tamarisk, the plant 
is of major importance, both for its nectar and for the pollen it supplies&quot; [<a href="#65">65</a>]. 
Saltcedar stands can be a refuge for honey bees, especially during the season that 
insecticides are applied to croplands. Management of saltcedar for honey production 
needs more research [<a href="#122">122</a>].

IMPACTS AND CONTROL:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Impacts:</b></font> Tamarisk is one of the most widely 
distributed and troublesome nonnative, invasive plants along water courses in the southwestern United States [<a href="#143">143</a>]. 
Saltcedar reduces recreational usage of parks, national wildlife refuges, and other 
riparian areas for camping, hunting and fishing, boating, bird watching and 
wildlife photography [<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>].

<p>
There are many environmental changes associated with tamarisk presence and 
proliferation in southwestern riparian areas, and there are debates over 
whether tamarisk is a consequence [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>] or a cause [<a href="#154">154</a>] 
of these changes. River impoundment, river diversions, groundwater pumping, 
agriculture, livestock grazing, and other human activities have altered 
flow regimes and natural channel dynamics in such a way that the regeneration 
of many native riparian plants has been reduced along  the major drainages 
in the Southwest [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>]. Cottonwood communities along the 
Colorado River, for example, have decreased from over 5,000 acres (2,000 ha) in 
the 1600s to less than 500 acres (200 ha) in 1998. Additionally, water in the 
lower Colorado River has become progressively more saline due to a variety of human-related 
activities, such as out-of-basin exports, irrigation, and reservoir 
evaporation [<a href="#30">30</a>]. A study by Everitt [<a href="#84">84</a>] indicates that spread of tamarisk on 
the central Rio Grande was opportunistic, driven by a chance coincidence of 
cultural, economic, and hydrogeomorphic events, following different paths on 
different reaches. He notes that changes in both the native vegetation and the 
physical environment were well underway by the time tamarisk 
became widespread [<a href="#84">84</a>].</p>

<p>
Saltcedar has replaced many native species partly because it is better 
adapted to the artificial flow regimes and saline conditions created by river 
impoundment and diversion [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#225">225</a>,<a href="#229">229</a>,<a href="#254">254</a>]. Howe and Knopf [<a href="#129">129</a>] suggest 
that the combination of paucity of cottonwood regeneration over the last 30 
years, rapid colonization during this century by Russian-olive and 
saltcedar, and current river channel management practices will lead to domination 
of the Rio Grande riparian woodland  by nonnative shrubs over the next 
50 to 100 years [<a href="#129">129</a>]. </p>

<p>
Regardless of cause or effect, tamarisk is usually associated with changes in 
geomorphology, hydrology, soil salinity, fire regimes, plant 
community composition, and native wildlife density and diversity [<a href="#156">156</a>]. It is 
also a matter of concern that tamarisk has been found in undisturbed areas such 
as high elevation streams [<a href="#74">74</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Geomorphology:</font> 
Several literature reviews indicate that tamarisk traps and stabilizes 
alluvial sediments,  reducing the width, depth, 
and water-holding capacity of river channels and increasing the frequency and 
severity of overbank flooding [<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#156">156</a>,<a href="#266">266</a>]. Examples of this occur on the Salt 
and Gila rivers near Phoenix, Arizona [<a href="#102">102</a>], and on the Brazos River in Texas, 
where this trend has continued over 40 years and has reduced the river's width by 
up to 71% in some places [<a href="#35">35</a>]. It has also been suggested that the 
dense roots and rhizomes of saltcedar rechannel stream flow and extend riparian 
zones as stream flow becomes more shallow and spread out [<a href="#197">197</a>]. </p>

<p>
A review by Cooper and others [<a href="#59">59</a>] suggests that tamarisk 
stems change the landscape properties of gravel and cobble islands and bars, as 
well as those of adjacent channels, by decreasing near-bed flow velocities and 
increasing the sheer stress required to remobilize the channel bed, while woody 
roots increase bed cohesiveness (resistance to mobilization). Processes of 
vertical sediment accretion, bar enlargement and subsequent channel narrowing 
are evident in both regulated and unregulated study areas along the Green 
and Yampa rivers [<a href="#59">59</a>].</p>

<p>
Everitt [<a href="#84">84</a>] observes that the tamarisk population explosion in the central 
Rio Grande in the 1930s came 15 years after large-scale regulation and depletion 
of flow and 10 years after channel-narrowing was well underway. In the Presidio 
Valley, between 1935 and 1942, tamarisk occupied a narrow fringe of riverbank, 
made available by the narrowing channel. These initial pioneers had reached 
maturity by 1942, when the only overbank flood in a decade spread 
their seeds across the valley to occupy farmland cleared of native vegetation 
and point bars and oxbows generated by channel migration. He states there is no 
evidence that the change in the species of riverbank vegetation had an effect on 
channel width, flood stage, or the process of channel narrowing [<a href="#84">84</a>].</p>

<p>Interactions between riparian vegetation and fluvial form and process in 
bedrock canyon systems are different from those of large perennial rivers in 
broad valleys. Hinchman-Birkeland [<a href="#25">25</a>] indicates that before tamarisk can 
become a significant geomorphic agent, it must have a period of low water discharge in 
which to establish strong root systems that can withstand flood flows. Before 
this critical mass of plant root density is reached, the vegetation is 
susceptible to removal by flood events. However, after this density is achieved, 
plants are capable of stabilizing sediment and affecting channel dimensions. 
Whether riparian plants ever achieve this density depends on frequency 
and severity of flood events and riparian 
plant community dynamics. A study along 2 reaches of the lower Little 
Colorado River Canyon in Arizona suggests that vegetation there has not yet 
reached this critical density, although tamarisk does appear to induce 
small-scale sedimentation on the order of individual plants or stands of plants 
in the perennial reach. This research offers only a preliminary basis for 
assessing biogeomorphic relationships on confined rivers, and indicates that 
vegetation patterns respond to, rather than influence, sandbar form in this 
canyon riparian system [<a href="#25">25</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Hydrology:</font><font face="Bell MT" size="4"> </font>
Several reviews and studies suggest that tamarisk has high 
transpiration rates and that tamarisk stands use more water than native vegetation, 
thus drawing down water tables, desiccating floodplains, and lowering flow rates of 
waterways [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#156">156</a>,<a href="#188">188</a>,<a href="#211">211</a>,<a href="#266">266</a>]. Dense infestations have dried 
up springs and pools in California and New Mexico, eliminating habitat for fish 
and other animals [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>,<a href="#188">188</a>]. A study in central Utah, bordering Utah Lake, suggests the longer a 
community is occupied by saltcedar, the more xeric the habitat becomes 
[<a href="#34">34</a>]. </p>

<p>
A review by Smith and others [<a href="#212">212</a>] suggests that some of the 
early evapotranspiration estimates for tamarisk may be suspect because they were 
conducted in open areas, rather than in characteristic dense vegetation, leading 
to potentially large overestimates due to advective water loss. Tamarisk has 
leaf-level transpiration rates that are comparable to native species (e.g. 
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>]), whereas sap-flow rates per unit sapwood area 
are higher than in natives, suggesting that tamarisk maintains higher leaf area 
than natives, probably due to its greater water stress tolerance. 
Tamarisk-dominated stands can have extremely high evapotranspiration rates when 
water tables are high but not necessarily when water tables are low or under 
droughty conditions [<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#211">211</a>,<a href="#213">213</a>]. Results presented by Sala and 
others [<a href="#198">198</a>] indicate that, at least under moderate to high water 
tables, important variables controlling stand water use by floodplain phreatophytes 
include stand density and leaf area index (LAI). Because tamarisk stands 
tend to extend beyond the boundaries of native phreatophytes and to develop 
higher LAI, water use by tamarisk on a regional scale might be substantially 
higher than for other riparian species [<a href="#198">198</a>]. Any attempt to 
characterize evapotranspiration of full stands of tamarisk will require a 
detailed spatial assessment of stand density and an evaluation of water 
availability relative to atmospheric water demand over time [<a href="#68">68</a>]. </p>

<p>
Saltcedar is able to maintain high leaf gas exchange rates under extremely 
hot, dry conditions (high vapor pressure deficit, high temperature and low soil 
water availability) relative to native species [<a href="#126">126</a>]. Saltcedar's ability to 
outcompete native plants in riparian ecosystems of the Southwest that are 
subject to large interannual fluctuations in water availability can be 
attributed to the following characteristics: high leaf gas exchange rates, 
growth when water is abundant, drought tolerance (resistance to cavitation), and 
maintenance of a viable canopy under dry conditions [<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#170">170</a>,<a href="#181">181</a>]. When riparian 
species on regulated rivers are exposed to seasonal water stress due to 
depression of floodplain water tables and elimination of annual floods, there is 
likely to be a community shift toward more stress-tolerant taxa such as 
tamarisk [<a href="#211">211</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT">Soil salinity:</font><font face="Bell MT" size="4"></font>
Tamarisk tends to be more salt tolerant than many of it's associated native 
species [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#204">204</a>,<a href="#248">248</a>]. Increased salinity inhibits growth and germination of many 
native riparian species [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>]. This confers a competitive advantage on tamarisk as 
riparian soils become more saline. Tamarisk species are implicated in the salinization 
of riparian soils via the deposition of salts excreted by their leaves 
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#156">156</a>,<a href="#171">171</a>,<a href="#204">204</a>,<a href="#251">251</a>]. Again, cause and effect are obscured as increased salinization of 
waterways, resulting from a number of human-related activities [<a href="#30">30</a>], is 1 
source of the salts that tamarisk then brings to the surface. Additionally, in the absence of 
annual flooding to wash away those salts, soil salinity continues to increase [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#248">248</a>,<a href="#251">251</a>]. 
Anderson [<a href="#9">9</a>] provides evidence from an area where soil salinity was similar under 
cottonwood and saltcedar and says that accumulation of salt in upper soil horizons is due almost entirely 
to the absence of flooding. </p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT">Fire regimes:</font><font face="Bell MT" size="4"></font>
Changes in the nature of disturbance from fire (frequency, intensity, and 
severity) have been affected both by tamarisk invasion and by other changes in 
the invaded communities [<a href="#44">44</a>]. Fire frequency and 
fire behavior in tamarisk-invaded communities are thought to be different than in uninvaded 
communities [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#231">231</a>,<a href="#242">242</a>]. Additionally, reduced flooding in riparian 
communities commonly results in excessive accumulations of debris, which in turn 
increase the frequency, intensity, and severity of fires. This 
has commonly been blamed on saltcedar, although saltcedar produces no more debris 
than cottonwood or willow. In the absence of flooding to remove debris, however, 
accumulation of this material increases to levels that may have a profound effect on 
the ecology of the system (see the <a href="fire_ecology.html">Fire Ecology</a> 
section of this report for a  discussion of the causes and consequences of fire 
in these systems) [<a href="#9">9</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT">Plant communities:</font> 
Many sites along Southwestern river systems are characterized by saltcedar
communities with halophytic, fire-tolerant shrubs (e.g. 
big saltbrush  and arrowweed) as codominants, with only senescent 
individuals of the historically dominant cottonwood and willow remaining. It has
been suggested these plants are nearing localized extinction on many riverine 
systems of the desert Southwest [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#212">212</a>,<a href="#231">231</a>]. Causes of these native population declines 
include invasion by tamarisk, although changes in flow regimes are also 
implicated.</p>

<p>
Several characteristics of tamarisk give it a competitive advantage in the 
communities it invades, including high seed production and viability, rapid 
germination and growth, vegetative reproduction, drought and salt tolerance. 
Under conditions imposed by river impoundment (e.g. increased salinity, reduced 
flooding, and water table declines), many native plant species cannot compete with tamarisk 
and may be displaced when it invades [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>]. In some areas, such as desert 
palm groves in California, the effect of tamarisk dominance on water supplies 
can be dramatic and may affect the ability of some plants to survive [<a href="#218">218</a>]. On many 
sites (upland ponds, streams, and washes may be  exceptions) native plants 
are lost because the sites have been so altered by human activities that they 
are, at best, only marginally suitable for natives. Saltcedar replaces some 
of the dominant native plant species that can no longer survive under these current 
conditions [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>]. Additional evidence of this comes from a large number of 
revegetation projects where native species fail to establish [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>]. </p>

<p>
Elimination of the annual flood pulse in the middle Rio Grande Valley has 
resulted in a dramatic reduction in germination and establishment of native 
cottonwoods and willows [<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#169">169</a>]. The extensive 
riparian forest along the middle Rio Grande in central New Mexico is largely an 
ecological legacy of past flooding, and these stands appear to be rapidly 
senescing. Further, because of flood control, no new stands of cottonwood are being 
established [<a href="#169">169</a>]. This stabilized river flow appears to instead 
favor establishment of salt cedar and Russian-olive [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#169">169</a>]. Under some conditions, 
riparian areas may be converted to an impenetrable saltcedar thicket in less 
than a decade [<a href="#107">107</a>].</p>

<p>
Depletion of water, a deeper, more narrow channel stabilized by reservoir 
releases, and invasion of tamarisk  have accompanied rapid loss of 
cottonwoods along the Arkansas River in eastern Colorado (loss of 31% in 31 
years). Losses are less along the South Platte River (9%) where only a few scattered 
tamarisk are present. Tamarisk invasion along the Arkansas River has been compounded 
by frequent wildfire within the floodplain in recent decades. These fires are 
fueled by dense stands of tamarisk and damage or kill many cottonwoods, 
including whole stands [<a href="#214">214</a>].</p>

<p>
Stromberg [<a href="#228">228</a>] compared the functional role of 
saltcedar to that of Fremont cottonwood along the San Pedro River in southern 
Arizona, by comparing 30 soil, geomorphological, and vegetation structural 
traits. Saltcedar was functionally equivalent to Fremont cottonwood for about 
half of those traits considered as indicators of riparian ecosystem function. 
According to Stromberg [<a href="#228">228</a>], the functional role of saltcedar is context-specific and 
variable among rivers. The author urges caution before 
undertaking regional control measures for saltcedar, especially on the ephemeral 
or intermittent reaches of the San Pedro River, where saltcedar can serve as an 
ecologically important functional analog to displaced native species that are no 
longer able to survive on these sites [<a href="#228">228</a>]. Where restoration of native vegetation is 
impossible or impractical, saltcedar may actually be a key element of the 
flora, standing in for natives and providing habitat for at least some native 
plants and animals [<a href="#9">9</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT">Wildlife:</font><font face="Bell MT" size="4"> </font>
The impact of tamarisk invasions upon wildlife species is 
variable, site specific, and often debated. (Also see the
<a href="#IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE">Importance to Livestock and 
Wildlife</a> section of this report). Anecdotal evidence and observations 
by managers suggest that several species may be affected by tamarisk invasion, 
although in some cases it is unclear whether impacts are caused by tamarisk 
itself, or by changes in the ecosystem as a whole.</p>

<p>
&quot;Although saltcedar provides habitat and nest sites for some 
wildlife (e.g. white-winged dove), most authors have concluded that it has 
little value to most native amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals&quot; [<a href="#154">154</a>]. 
Another review suggests that in some areas, tamarisk has reduced or eliminated 
water supplies for bighorn sheep, pupfish, and salamanders [<a href="#218">218</a>]. Saltcedar invasions 
may have negative impacts on threatened and endangered species such as Amargosa 
pupfish, warm springs pupfish, and speckled dace in Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge, 
Nevada; desert tortoise, and Nelson bighorn sheep, in Lake 
Mead National Recreation Area, Nevada [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#194">194</a>]; Attwater's prairie chicken 
at Galveston Bay, Texas [<a href="#194">194</a>]; Moapa dace in Moapa, Nevada [<a href="#193">193</a>]; and about 50 species 
in New Mexico preserves [<a href="#193">193</a>]. A review by Dudley and others [<a href="#74">74</a>] 
indicates that a fire in the Salton Sea National 
Wildlife Refuge that was fueled partly by saltcedar diminished cattail-bulrush 
(<i>Typha</i> spp.-<i>Scirpus</i> spp.) habitat for the endangered Yuma clapper rail. 
In Big Bend National Park, Texas, populations of rodents appear to be affected by tamarisk, some 
positively, others negatively [<a href="#26">26</a>]. Reptile abundance and 
diversity were greater on an unaltered, mature, gallery-type stand of cottonwood and 
willow than on an altered site dominated by honey mesquite (<i>Prosopis glandulosa</i>) and tamarisk 
[<a href="#136">136</a>]. The restriction of water flow in Queen Creek by 
Whitlow Ranch Dam in Arizona created a 37 acre (15 ha) riparian island upstream, 
behind the dam, that is dominated by Goodding willow and saltcedar. A survey of 
herpetofaunas in the area indicated many of the locally expected riparian species 
were absent, although it is unclear whether biogeographical considerations and flooding 
patterns are responsible, or if structural and physical conditions of the new habitat are 
responsible [<a href="#236">236</a>]. </p>

<p>
It is important to note that while there are discrepancies among studies in 
the extent to which migrant birds use habitats dominated by nonnative species 
such as tamarisk, several studies have found that tamarisk is used to some degree 
by several species (e.g. [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#152">152</a>,<a href="#177">177</a>,<a href="#264">264</a>]), and that discrepancies may be related to local 
differences among study sites or to differences in sampling techniques [<a href="#264">264</a>]. </p>

<p>
A review by Anderson [<a href="#9">9</a>] suggests that, while saltcedar thickets support 
somewhat impoverished animal communities in low-altitude areas, this is less 
true at higher altitudes. Additionally, saltcedar habitats east of the Colorado 
River support larger numbers of wildlife species. Along the Pecos River in New 
Mexico and the Rio Grande and in west Texas, the difference between species 
richness of typical native riparian birds in saltcedar and native riparian 
habitats were negligible and differences in densities were minor. Also, both 
biomass and diversity of insects in saltcedar stands are comparable to those 
in cottonwood and willows [<a href="#9">9</a>]. </p>

<p>Studies by Bailey and others [<a href="#13">13</a>] indicate that saltcedar effects on leaf 
litter quality were related to a 2-fold decrease in stream macroinvertebrate 
richness and a 4-fold decrease in overall macroinvertebrate 
abundance, as compared with Fremont cottonwood litter, and may also affect 
higher trophic levels in Wet Beaver Creek, Arizona. Saltcedar leaves had slower 
colonization by invertebrates during the first 84 days of immersion compared to 
Fremont cottonwood and sandbar willow leaves, suggesting that leaves from 
saltcedar contain tannins and/or phenolics that deter invertebrates [<a href="#182">182</a>]. </p>

<p>
Anderson [<a href="#9">9</a>] argues that while wildlife diversity and abundance in saltcedar 
communities along the lower Colorado River are generally lower than in areas dominated by 
native cottonwood and willow, this is an appropriate standard 
for comparison only if native tree species can be re-established after the removal of 
saltcedar. He suggests that after removal of saltcedar in these areas only 
occasionally has it been possible to return areas to native species and that 
far more often these areas remain bare or are reinvaded either by saltcedar or 
by vegetation dominated by arrowweed which has even lower value for wildlife [<a href="#6">6</a>]. </p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Control:</b></font> Tamarisk has been present in 
North America for almost 200 years, and has been invasive for 
nearly a century. Efforts to reduce its numbers and control its spread have been 
ongoing for decades, and it still occupies vast acreages and has substantial 
impacts in the areas it invades. Once tamarisk is well established it is very 
difficult and expensive to control, as any stress imposed by control methods 
(e.g. fire, herbicides, and cutting) increases flowering and seed production; 
and the entire root system must be killed in order to prevent resprouting. Monitoring, 
prevention, early detection and local eradication remain the most effective 
approach to controlling tamarisk [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>,<a href="#156">156</a>,<a href="#192">192</a>,<a href="#193">193</a>,<a href="#194">194</a>].</p>

<p>
Early detection and control of tamarisk are critical, as it achieves 
dominance rapidly under favorable conditions [<a href="#156">156</a>]. At Afton Canyon in the lower 
Mojave River in southern California, complete low level, infrared aerial 
photography of the canyon was completed to assist in determining removal area 
priorities, based on tamarisk seed sources and wildlife habitat value 
information [<a href="#155">155</a>]. The best time to locate saltcedar is in spring and summer when 
the flowers are conspicuous, and the best season for removal is late fall or 
winter when sap is flowing downwards and seed dispersal is not enhanced by 
removal activities [<a href="#232">232</a>]. Care must be taken to avoid 
soil damage during control efforts, by avoiding high water periods and being 
careful to avoid compaction on fine-textured soils [<a href="#107">107</a>]. When 
removing aerial plant portions, tamarisk stems should be left on the surface of 
the ground and never buried in moist soil [<a href="#93">93</a>]. When clearing riparian areas of 
vegetation, the possibilities of channel cutting and wind erosion must be considered 
[<a href="#122">122</a>]. </p>

<p>
Removing tamarisk, regardless of the method employed, must be followed with 
the development of an ecologically healthy plant community that is weed 
resistant and meets other land-use objectives such as wildlife habitat or 
recreation [<a href="#9">9</a>]. The southwestern willow flycatcher recovery plan provides an 
example of invasive species management with wildlife management as the primary 
objective [<a href="#244">244</a>]. </p>

<p>
Only a few examples exist where tamarisk was successfully removed and native 
vegetation re-established. These occur on small invasion sites (2.5-50 acres 
(1-20 ha)) with more or less discrete borders, and the longest time frame for 
success is about 10 years after control treatments [<a href="#18">18</a>]. In some cases where 
tamarisk has invaded, it might be worth concentrating efforts to remove tamarisk 
and restore refugia for rare species in  favorable situations, but doing this 
on a landscape scale may not be possible. On this larger scale, considering 
alternatives that include saltcedar in surrogate systems may be more appropriate [<a href="#9">9</a>]. 
Barrows [<a href="#18">18</a>] urges larger scale removal of tamarisk (e.g. with 
biocontrol) due to the prolific nature and large-scale seed dispersal of the 
plant. He also argues that &quot;there is nothing to suggest that these successes are 
scale-dependent anomalies. In fact, there is every reason to believe that they 
are indicative of what could be accomplished on a larger scale,&quot; although 
he cites no evidence for this conjecture [<a href="#18">18</a>].</p>

<p>
Many of the impacts attributed to tamarisk invasion are also causal factors 
that may have allowed tamarisk to establish and persist  [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>]. Hobbs and 
Humphries [<a href="#114">114</a>] advocate an integrated approach to the management of plant 
invasions that includes &quot;a focus on the invaded system and its management, 
rather than on the invader&quot; and &quot;identification of the causal factors enhancing 
ecosystem invasibility&quot; as an effective approach to controlling invasive 
species. This type of &quot;ecological control&quot; may involve manipulation of factors 
such as fire disturbance and water and sediment discharges in a way that 
provides a competitive edge to target native species over invasive species, with 
an emphasis on removing the ecological stressors that may be underlying the 
causes of invasion, rather than on direct control of invasive species [<a href="#114">114</a>]. </p>

<p>
In applying this approach to management of tamarisk, Levine and Stromberg 
[<a href="#150">150</a>] examine several descriptive field studies and controlled experiments that 
contrast response of tamarisk  and native riparian trees and shrubs to 
particular environmental factors. These studies provide the basis&nbsp;for 
identifying environmental factors that could be manipulated to restore 
conditions under which the natives are most competitive. There is evidence, for 
example, that cottonwood trees have increased in abundance at 
tamarisk-dominated sites in response to appropriately timed flood pulses, high 
ground water levels and soil moisture, and exclusion of livestock grazing 
[<a href="#149">149</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>,<a href="#203">203</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#224">224</a>,<a href="#226">226</a>]. </p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT">Flooding/Altered hydrology/Manipulation of water levels: </font>
Several authors have recommended manipulating dam releases and 
&quot;naturalizing&quot; flow regimes to favor native species over nonnatives 
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#203">203</a>,<a href="#226">226</a>]. Periodic dam releases to cause &quot;pulse flooding&quot; 
or &quot;overbank flooding&quot; can have several benefits. Flooding helps to 
eliminate large accumulations of litter in riparian forests, thus reducing the threat 
of fires in both native and nonnative dominated forests [<a href="#81">81</a>]. Flooding washes 
accumulated salts from the banks and deposits and moistens bare mineral soil. Timing 
flood flows or dam releases to coincide with native seed dispersal can also promote 
natural regeneration of these species [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#149">149</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>,<a href="#198">198</a>,<a href="#206">206</a>,<a href="#211">211</a>,<a href="#248">248</a>,<a href="#265">265</a>].

<p>
Timing flood flows later in the season and subjecting 
saltcedar to the scouring effects of floods and prolonged inundation may 
increase saltcedar mortality [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#226">226</a>,<a href="#265">265</a>], although buried root crowns or 
aboveground portions of branches and smaller stems will often sprout [<a href="#107">107</a>]. 
Saltcedar seedlings (around 5 weeks old) are more susceptible to 
summer flooding than are older plants [<a href="#216">216</a>]. Prolonged 
inundation (1 to 3 years) can kill most saltcedar [<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#156">156</a>] 
and French tamarisk plants [<a href="#261">261</a>]. Some studies suggest that saltcedar may be 
more tolerant of prolonged inundation than cottonwood and willow trees [<a href="#216">216</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#254">254</a>], 
especially in the fall [<a href="#95">95</a>]. Because of the high mortality of cottonwood in response 
to complete submergence, flooding saltcedar seedlings may not be 
desirable when submergence of cottonwood seedlings will also occur [<a href="#217">217</a>]. </p>

<p>
In order to design models or prescriptions for flood releases, research is 
needed to examine inundation, sedimentation, scour effects, drought tolerance, 
seed production phenology, root growth rates, and establishment requirements for 
each of the species in a particular system [<a href="#125">125</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>,<a href="#203">203</a>]. Research by Cooper and 
others [<a href="#59">59</a>] suggests that flow prescriptions to restore riparian ecosystems must also 
consider both the large and small scale geomorphic settings to be affected, as 
well as the multiple pathways of establishment for both native and undesirable 
nonnative species. Then the seasonal timing, magnitude, and interannual frequency 
of flows can be adjusted to match the desired outcomes [<a href="#59">59</a>].</p>

<p>
For example, cottonwood and willow are favored if germination sites are 
moistened only during spring, but become dry during summer when tamarisk 
continue to disperse seeds [<a href="#227">227</a>]. Levine and Stromberg [<a href="#150">150</a>] recommend, 
therefore, releasing winter or spring regeneration floods and limiting duration 
of summer flooding. Later, summer floods of long duration may increase 
inundation-related mortality of saltcedar seedlings, and those of large 
magnitude but short duration can scour or bury saltcedar seedlings [<a href="#150">150</a>].  </p>

<p>
Several studies have examined hydrograph components (e.g. timing and 
magnitude of flood peaks, rate of decline of recession, and magnitude 
of base flows) and their influence on establishment and survival of saltcedar 
and native tree species in areas such as the Bill Williams River in Arizona [<a href="#203">203</a>], the 
middle Rio Grande floodplain [<a href="#238">238</a>], Big Horn Lake, Wyoming [<a href="#130">130</a>], the upper Green 
River in Utah [<a href="#60">60</a>], the Hassayampa River in Arizona [<a href="#227">227</a>], and the Yampa 
and Green rivers [<a href="#59">59</a>]. This information is critical in 
efforts to prescribe reservoir releases designed to promote establishment of 
native riparian vegetation and to deter the spread of nonnative species.  </p>

<p>
Curtailment or modification of human activities that lower groundwater beyond the rooting 
depth of desired native riparian tree species may be worthwhile, because deep 
groundwater has greater negative physiological impacts on natives than on 
saltcedar [<a href="#127">127</a>]. It is also important to know the range of soil moisture over 
which native species have a competitive edge in order to manage for soil moisture 
levels and groundwater depths that favor growth and survivorship of native species 
during establishment periods. To favor native tree species on cattle-grazed rivers, 
recruitment zones should be protected year-round from livestock grazing during at least 
2 growing seasons to allow seedlings to grow above browse height [<a href="#226">226</a>]. </p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT">Prevention:</font> 
The most efficient and effective method of managing invasive species is to prevent 
their invasion and spread [<a href="#205">205</a>]. For example, costs for controlling and/or eradicating 
tamarisk infestations at Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge 
and Lake Mead National Recreation Area exceeded the costs of preventative 
maintenance by up to a factor of 100 [<a href="#51">51</a>].</p>

<p>
While the natural flood disturbance regime seems to promote native species 
and discourage tamarisk (see above), preservation of natural conditions in 
riparian areas in the Southwest is rarely a factor, as none currently exist, 
except for mountain reaches in Arizona and New Mexico where some canyons have 
retained natural flood regimes. The desirability of preserving these areas 
is great [<a href="#122">122</a>].</p>

<p>Other factors managers suggest as discouraging tamarisk invasion include 
eradication upstream [<a href="#192">192</a>], biological control, agency coordination [<a href="#193">193</a>], 
and fencing out cattle [<a href="#194">194</a>]. Efforts should be made to prevent site disturbances 
such as fire, increased soil salinity, ground disturbance [<a href="#156">156</a>,<a href="#193">193</a>,<a href="#194">194</a>], livestock 
grazing, dams, channelization, sedimentation [<a href="#193">193</a>,<a href="#194">194</a>], and flooding when tamarisk is 
dispersing seed [<a href="#192">192</a>]. When controlling other invasive species, managers should be 
aware of the potential for tamarisk invasion. For example, drainage of areas to 
control cattail  in Utah led to establishment of tamarisk [<a href="#176">176</a>]. </p>

<p>
Monitoring is essential to prevent establishment both before and after any control 
effort, as some saltcedar is capable of resprouting 
following treatment. In addition, tamarisk seedlings will continue to establish 
as long as saltcedar infestations persist upwind or upstream of the target area 
[<a href="#156">156</a>] and conditions for germination exist. If tamarisk seed sources are out of 
the manager's control or if hydrologic regimes are altered, an extended commitment 
of resources will be needed [<a href="#194">194</a>]. Saltcedar can be readily identified on 
conventional color video imagery in late November when its foliage turns a yellow-orange to 
orange-brown color prior to leaf drop. The integration of GPS with video imagery 
permits latitude/longitude coordinates of infestations to be recorded on each 
image; these coordinates can then be entered into a GIS to map saltcedar 
populations. This was done along the Colorado River in southwestern Arizona, the 
Rio Grande River in extreme west Texas, and the Pecos River in west-central 
Texas [<a href="#85">85</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><a name="Integrated management:">Integrated management:</a></font> 
Once established in large stands, tamarisk can rarely be 
controlled or eradicated with a single method, and many researchers and managers 
recommend combining physical, biological, chemical, and cultural control methods 
in some fashion. Removing tamarisk, regardless of the method employed, is 
useless without also developing an ecologically healthy plant community that is 
weed resistant and meets other land-use objectives such as wildlife habitat or 
recreation. Some researchers argue that current conditions of invaded 
riparian areas in the Southwest are no longer suitable for supporting native 
species, and removal of tamarisk will lead to dominance by other, less desirable 
species such as arrowweed [<a href="#9">9</a>]. In areas where establishment of a 
desirable plant community is possible (e.g. small-scale infestations, or areas 
where historic flow regimes can be mimicked to support native species), removal 
of tamarisk is best achieved by combining control methods.</p>

<p>At the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, both mechanical 
(bulldozing and rootplowing) and chemical (aerial herbicide application) methods 
are commonly employed for saltcedar control. Sprenger and others [<a href="#216">216</a>] compared 
these methods in combination with late summer flood treatments, and found 
mechanical treatment provided better control of saltcedar than 
chemical treatment and had better cottonwood recruitment. The flood treatment 
was effective in killing nearly 100% of saltcedar seedlings that were less than 
5 weeks old; however, 10-week-old saltcedar were not as 
susceptible to sustained flooding. Cottonwoods which were totally submerged 
during the 30 day flood period also suffered high rates of mortality. 
Mortality of partially submerged cottonwood and saltcedar was similar to 
unflooded controls [<a href="#216">216</a>].</p>

<p>
Taylor and McDaniel [<a href="#237">237</a>] present integrated management approaches including 
combinations of herbicide, burning, mechanical control treatment, and 
revegetation with native species and report success in controlling saltcedar and 
improving habitat for several species of birds, small mammals, reptiles, and 
amphibians in the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge. Saltcedar thickets 
are first removed using a combination of mechanical, chemical and prescribed fire 
techniques. The methods used depend on initial plant density. Mechanical 
control involves removal of aboveground stems followed by removal of underground 
root crown portions of the plants. Large scale herbicide and/or burning of saltcedar 
includes aerial application of glyphosate and imazapyr mixed with water and surfactant. 
Herbicide spraying is done in late flower (September). Prescribed burning is done in 
September, 2 to 3 years after herbicide application, to remove dead standing 
saltcedar stems [<a href="#162">162</a>]. They found that aerial applications of imazapyr were no more 
effective than bulldozing as an initial treatment in integrated management approaches 
[<a href="#237">237</a>]. Follow-up control is generally needed for at least a 2-year period to treat 
root sprouts either mechanically or chemically [<a href="#162">162</a>]. </p>

<p>
Taylor and McDaniel [<a href="#162">162</a>] followed saltcedar removal by revegetation with Fremont 
cottonwood, black willow (<i>Salix nigra</i>), and sandbar willow. Natural regeneration 
using irrigation water to flood areas using flood schedules to mimic the historic Rio 
Grande hydrograph, appears to be a more cost effective and preferable method 
of revegetation than planting and has resulted in a vegetative community 
dominated by robust native species and occasional saltcedar. By these methods, 
saltcedar plant densities have been reduced from pretreatment averages of about 
7000 plants/ha to about 50 plants/ha 4 to 6 years after treatments. Subsequent 
flooding for the maintenance of riparian communities is repeated at 5 to 7 year intervals 
[<a href="#162">162</a>].</p>

<p>
In a 25 acre (10 ha) wetland in the Coachella Valley Preserve in California 
that was heavily infested with saltcedar, a control project was initiated in 
1986. Native dominants in the area include California palm, sandbar willow, 
Fremont cottonwood, common reed, and honey and screwbean mesquite. A 7 acre (3 
ha) area with greater than 95% coverage of tamarisk was scraped with a 
bulldozer, since few natives were present. Where native species were abundant, 
hand cutting of individual saltcedar trees facilitated native plant retention.  
Each tamarisk tree was cut as near to the ground as was feasible with a chainsaw 
or pruning shears and immediately sprayed with herbicide from hand-held or back-pack 
sprayers. The debris was hauled to centralized piles in inconspicuous places. 
November through January was the most effective 
time to achieve first-time kills of tamarisk, probably because the plants are 
entering dormancy at that time and translocating resources into their roots. The 
herbicide was most effective when applied immediately after cutting. Waiting more 
than just a few minutes seemed to increase the likelihood of resprouts (also see [<a href="#110">110</a>]). 
Resprouts were treated with triclopyr. In 5 years, all of the tamarisk was eradicated from 
the palm oases and wetlands on the preserve. Because the area is surrounded by 
tamarisk, seeds blow in and perpetual vigilance and maintenance is required to 
pull seedlings before they become established; requiring about 1 or 2 
person-weeks. Natural and artificial seeding during relatively wet springs in 1991 and 
1992 resulted in some establishment of native species (except mesquite). Natives established 
more rapidly on hand-cleared sites than on bulldozed sites [<a href="#17">17</a>]. Nine years later, 
there was almost no sign that tamarisk was once dominant. Native vegetation has 
returned to acceptable levels and the piles of cut tamarisk, once 10-12 feet (3-4 m) high, 
are barely noticeable, having degraded to 4 foot (~1 m) piles. At Coachella Valley Preserve, 
removing tamarisk restored natural habitats and 
natural processes (such as the water flow) which are vitally important to the 
survival of many native plants and animals there [<a href="#159">159</a>]. The natural 
flood regime and native species are still intact in 
this preserve. On sites lacking native species, more extreme efforts are needed 
[<a href="#17">17</a>]. </p>

<p>The following table presents other success stories employing cutting and 
herbicide application on tamarisk:</p>

Cutting and herbicide application was less successful (21% kill 
rate) at Petrified Forest National Park, Arizona [<a href="#28">28</a>]. Given both past and present 
anthropogenic degradation on the Agua Fria River, active revegetation consisting 
of pole planting of Fremont cottonwood and various willow species was pursued. Each 
pole was hand-irrigated weekly with about 10 gallons (40 liters) of water through 
the months of June, July, and August, resulting in a 65% survival rate [<a href="#232">232</a>]. </p>

<p>
Imazapyr is popular for the cut stump method, but care must be taken as it 
can be highly mobile and persistent, and can affect a wide range of plants. 
Additionally, recent studies report that imazapyr can leak out of the roots of 
treated plants, and adversely affect surrounding native vegetation [<a href="#241">241</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT">Physical/mechanical:</font> 
Saltcedar is difficult to kill using only mechanical methods (e.g. cutting, mowing, 
chaining and bulldozing), as it is able to resprout vigorously from the root crown 
following removal of aerial plant portions [<a href="#92">92</a>]. Even when effective, mechanical 
control methods can be labor intensive and expensive [<a href="#193">193</a>,<a href="#194">194</a>]. Early response to small 
invasions can be successful [<a href="#192">192</a>], since seedlings and small plants can be uprooted by 
hand [<a href="#156">156</a>,<a href="#193">193</a>], and cutting and pulling are most effective in small, discrete 
areas [<a href="#194">194</a>]. Older plants have brittle stems, and are not easily drawn from the 
ground [<a href="#36">36</a>].</p>

<p>
Root plowing and cutting are effective ways of clearing heavy infestations 
initially, but these methods are successful only when combined with follow-up 
treatments [<a href="#156">156</a>,<a href="#193">193</a>]. Root plowing is reported to be one of the more successful 
mechanical control methods for tamarisk, and is most effective when the soil is 
relatively dry [<a href="#122">122</a>]. It is important to pile and/or burn aboveground 
vegetation to prevent resprouting of stems and shoots [<a href="#141">141</a>]. A 
root plow modified for deep subsurface placement of herbicides effectively 
controlled saltcedar on the Cimarron River floodplain in Kansas [<a href="#117">117</a>]. Because rootplowing 
tends to kill a large percentage of any grass cover mixed with the saltcedar, it 
may lead to serious wind erosion [<a href="#122">122</a>]. Additionally, any native plants on the site are 
likely to be killed.  </p>

<p>
Along the middle Rio Grande floodplain, saltcedar clearing (using a bulldozer with a 
front-mounted dirt blade, and stacking debris; followed by root plowing, raking, 
and stacking) in conjunction with peak river flows in late May or early June 
encouraged recruitment of native riparian plants [<a href="#238">238</a>]. Tamarisk plants were bulldozed 
and totally removed at a campground along Lake Mead, and numerous sprouts were found coming 
up in the 1st few months from roots that had not been completely removed. Impact from vehicle 
traffic and camping activities eventually killed all but about 24 plants which 
were 8 to 12 feet (2-4 m) tall 7 years after initial removal and used for shade [<a href="#41">41</a>]. 
Chaining with a bulldozer was effective for removing tamarisk on Santa Cruz Island, 
California [<a href="#194">194</a>]. </p>

<p>
Biweekly cutting of saltcedar at 12 inches (30 cm) above the ground did not kill 
plants. However, when all foliage was removed from the stump at 2-week 
intervals, 92% of the plants died the 1st season and the remainder died after retreatment 
the following year [<a href="#122">122</a>]. Mowing in August and September each year followed by 
inundation from October through April has provided some control at 
Bosque del Apache [<a href="#141">141</a>]. Mowing of small plants followed by grazing can reduce cover 
[<a href="#122">122</a>]. At Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, managers reduce saltcedar by cutting 
about 12 inches (30 cm) below the surface [<a href="#166">166</a>].</p>

<p>
Care must be taken when mechanically clearing when the ground is moist 
because buried plant parts can develop adventitious roots and form new shrubs 
[<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>].  </p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT">Biological:</font> 
A review by Dudley and others [<a href="#74">74</a>] indicates that 3 Eurasian insects are currently 
being researched as potential biological control agents for saltcedar. One 
insect, the tamarisk leaf beetle, was approved for release in 6 states (Texas, 
Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Nevada, and California). Concerns regarding use of 
biological control agents on saltcedar include 1) damage to nontarget plants of 
environmental or economic concern; 2) the ecological or economic benefits of 
saltcedar itself; 3) rapid and wholesale control of saltcedar leaving an open 
niche and inadequate time for native vegetation recovery to support wildlife in 
the interim; and 4) native vegetation can no longer recover or survive in many systems where saltcedar 
has invaded. Of particular concern is the role that saltcedar plays as nesting habitat for a 
substantial number of endangered southwestern willow flycatchers, and release of 
insects was postponed pending analysis of potential impacts on this species [<a href="#74">74</a>]. </p>

<p>
In early August of 1998 several tamarisk leaf beetles were released at 2 sites in California, 
and 2 sites in Nevada. Additional releases are planned for another site in California and sites in Texas, 
Colorado, Wyoming and Utah [<a href="#46">46</a>]. It is unclear what effects these 
releases have had on tamarisk populations.</p>

<p>
Dudley and others [<a href="#74">74</a>] also indicate that few native insects feed more than 
occasionally or sporadically on saltcedar and cause it little damage. Except for 
the Apache cicada in the Grand Canyon, the only insect that appears to have 
control potential is an introduced leafhopper, and this only in confined spaces. This 
insect may also provide benefits as a food source for several riparian birds, 
including the willow flycatcher. Four other Eurasian, saltcedar-specific arthropods have 
also been accidentally introduced, but have caused little or no damage [<a href="#74">74</a>].</p>

<p>
Cattle may graze large amounts of saltcedar sprout growth. In 
one study, cattle removed 40% of saltcedar foliage. All plants 
outside the fence areas were grazed. Within 1 
month, new growth was 4 feet (1.2 m) high in the fenced areas, and about 1 foot 
(0.3 m) high in grazed plots. After the 1st month, utilization was limited to the terminal 
ends of saltcedar stems, and 2 years later the stand was so dense that cattle 
would not enter the area [<a href="#92">92</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT">Chemical:</font> 
Tamarisk can be very difficult to kill with herbicides alone, and may require 
repeated treatments to be successful. The root systems are more extensively developed 
near the ground surface, due to repeated scouring and removal of limbs by floods. 
These roots can send up shoots where none existed at the time of initial treatment [<a href="#175">175</a>], and 
 stress caused by herbicide applications can increase flowering and seed production 
[<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#220">220</a>]. Herbicides commonly used to control saltcedar include imazapyr, triclopyr, and 
glyphosate [<a href="#156">156</a>].  </p>

<p>
Stevens and Walker [<a href="#221">221</a>] present results from a study using various herbicides to control 
saltcedar of different age classes with applications in various seasons following stem pruning. 
Chemicals tested include tebuthiuron, glyphosate, 2,4-D and 
dicamba, 2,4-D, and picloram. On young tamarisk, glyphosate was the least 
effective at all application dates, and picloram the most effective. Picloram 
was not equally effective as other chemicals when applied in the fall. 
Glyphosate was more effective on older plants than on younger plants, however 
2,4-D and 2,4-D combined with dicamba were most effective at controlling older 
plants [<a href="#221">221</a>].</p>

<p>
Caution must be used when applying herbicides, especially near water. Temple and others [<a href="#240">240</a>] 
found that phytoplankton primary production, midge density, and midge 
biomass were negatively correlated with tebuthiuron concentration during peak 
system productivity. Conversely, no trends were observed at any sample date 
between an omnivorous fish species and herbicide concentration [<a href="#240">240</a>]. </p>

<p>
The efficacy of herbicides is greatly enhanced when combined with other 
control methods and/or revegetation [<a href="#105">105</a>]. Heavy infestations of tamarisk may 
require stand thinning via prescribed burning or mechanical removal prior to 
herbicide application. A commonly used and effective treatment is to cut the shrub 
off near the ground and immediately apply herbicide to the cut stump. Resprouts are 
then treated with foliar applications of herbicide. This technique usually results in 
better than a 90% kill rate (e.g. [<a href="#155">155</a>]) (see <a href="#Integrated management:">Integrated 
management</a> for more details) [<a href="#156">156</a>]. </p>

<p>
Based on a number of research/extension field trials in New Mexico from 1987 
to 1998, Duncan and McDaniel [<a href="#75">75</a>] concluded that imazapyr 
applied alone or in combination with glyphosate controlled saltcedar 
to levels of 90% or greater, especially when applied in August or September. 
Herbicide activity may be reduced as saltcedar height and stem number 
increases [<a href="#75">75</a>]. Foliar applications of herbicides were 
also deemed successful at  Mad Island Marsh, and Galveston Bay, Texas [<a href="#194">194</a>].</p>

<p>
Winter is the best time for herbicide application in saltcedar, because 
plants are dormant and not translocating large quantities of water from the roots. 
Spring is the least desirable time due to the large upward flow of sap and the 
lack of translocation of the herbicides to the root system [<a href="#115">115</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT">Cultural: </font>
Mature saltcedar is highly susceptible to shading [<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#220">220</a>], 
and does not dominate in cottonwood stands when the cottonwood is left to 
develop into mature trees. In mature stands of cottonwood, saltcedar grows 
only in natural openings and along the outer edge of the stand [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>].</p>

<p>
Replacing saltcedar with native species may lessen or delay recolonization 
[<a href="#220">220</a>]. Unfortunately, conditions on sites where saltcedar dominates or has 
dominated tend to be unfavorable for establishment of native species. While 
some suggest that these conditions are caused by saltcedar infestation [<a href="#220">220</a>,<a href="#251">251</a>], 
others suggest that they are caused by the alteration of historic flow regimes. 
Dams, diversions, groundwater pumping and development have resulted in 
sites with reduced soil moisture, increased depth to the water table, and 
increased the accumulation of salt in the upper soil horizons. For these 
reasons much of the former riparian zone along major rivers such as the 
lower Colorado, Pecos, and Rio Grande is no longer suitable for 
germination and sapling survival of native species such as cottonwood, willow, 
honey mesquite and screwbean mesquite [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>]. A more practical approach may 
be to revegetate with salt-tolerant grasses [<a href="#251">251</a>]. Anderson 
[<a href="#9">9</a>] says that he is familiar with a few restoration 
projects on saltcedar dominated sites that have been successful in the short 
term but none that can claim long-term success (e.g. 20 years). </p>

<p>
At Bosque del Apache NWR, more than 15,000 native trees have been planted in 
previously saltcedar infested areas with good success, where salinity levels are 
low enough to permit establishment. Black willow will tolerate salinities up to 
2,500 ppm, whereas cottonwood must be confined to areas below 2,000 ppm. Plantings 
established since 1988 have survival rates exceeding 80% and growth after 18 to 24 
months exceeding 25 feet (8 m) on some sites [<a href="#48">48</a>]. Establishment of 
species such as Fremont cottonwood and Goodding willow is facilitated by deep 
tillage (to the water table) prior to planting [<a href="#8">8</a>].</p>

<p>
Monitoring efforts along the Virgin and Paria rivers and Kanab Creek in 
northern Arizona indicate that near the water zone, several native species such 
as willow, seepwillow and cottonwood can compete with tamarisk, and that 
arrowweed can increase in the drier floodplain rather than tamarisk and willow. 
When livestock are restricted to winter use and kept out of riparian areas 
during the growing seasons on a systematic basis, willows and other palatable 
woody species can grow and increase to their potential extent [<a href="#131">131</a>].
