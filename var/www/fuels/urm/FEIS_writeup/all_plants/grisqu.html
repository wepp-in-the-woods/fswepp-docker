<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Grindelia squarrosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Curlycup gumweed was eaten by sage grouse chicks aged 5 to 8 weeks in
central Montana.  It was used by 28 percent of chicks and made up 3
percent by volume of crop contents.  At ages 9 to 12 weeks it was used
by 39 percent of chicks and made up 4 percent of crop contents.  It was
not used by chicks younger than 5 weeks old [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Curlycup gumweed is unpalatable to cattle, sheep, and horses [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>],
though sheep will occasionally crop flower heads in the absence of other
forage [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Tannins, volatile oils, resins, bitter alkaloids, and
glucosides give curlycup gumweed an unpleasant taste [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The energy value and protein value of curlycup gumweed for livestock is
poor.  Its food value for several species of wildlife in some western
states is [<a href="#8">8</a>]:

                              MT       ND       UT

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Curlycup gumweed occurred in only trace amounts on unreclaimed and
reclaimed bentonite mine spoils in southeastern Montana.  It occurred in
greater abundance on adjacent grasslands [<a href="#30">30</a>].

Curlycup gumweed was used in a roadside reseeding project in southern
Wisconsin.  It showed a high ability to survive and grow under adverse
conditions.  Seedlings transplanted easily to the field and grew
rapidly.  Results for both direct seeding and seedling transplant were
excellent [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Native Americans used curlycup gumweed extracts to treat asthma,
bronchitis, colic, and skin rash [<a href="#17">17</a>].  The Pawnees boiled the flower
heads and leaves, and used the decoction for bathing saddle sores and
other skin irritations [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Today, medicinal uses include treatment of
bronchial spasm, whooping cough, asthma, and rashes caused by poison ivy
(Toxicodendron radicans) [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Curlycup gumweed extract is valuable as
a stimulant, sedative, astringent, purgative, emetic, diuretic,
antiseptic, and disinfectant [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Curlycup gumweed is used as an ornamental.  It produces flowers over a
long period, even when the soil is poor and dry [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Curlycup gumweed increases with grazing [<a href="#18">18</a>] and has a negative economic
impact on rangelands [<a href="#8">8</a>].  It forms dense, brushlike cover in rangelands
where there is much broken sod [<a href="#35">35</a>].  In the Central Great Plains, it is
not usually found on ranges of excellent or good condition, but is found
on ranges in fair condition [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Curlycup gumweed stems, leaves, and flowers produce a sticky exudate.
The coats of livestock can become gummed with it [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Curlycup gumweed is drought resistant due to deep roots and resinous
secretions [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Curlycup gumweed is a facultative selenium absorber [<a href="#1">1</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Grindelia squarrosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Curlycup gumweed is a warm-season [<a href="#17">17</a>] perennial or biennial native forb
[<a href="#8">8</a>].  It grows 0.33 to 3.3 feet (0.1-1 m), with one to several branched
stems [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  Flower heads are several to numerous.  The floral disk
is 0.6 to 2.75 inches (1.5-7 cm) wide.  The fruit is an achene [<a href="#14">14</a>].
Curlycup gumweed is taprooted, and develops a short, vertical rhizome.
The root system extends 6.5 feet (2 m) into the soil [<a href="#1">1</a>], with extensive
shallow root development [<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Curlycup gumweed is a biennial or short-lived perennial which reproduces
by seed [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Seeds have a pappus [<a href="#14">14</a>], and are dispersed by wind.

Curlycup gumweed seeds were stratified for 10 weeks with a cold, damp
regime.  When planted, germination time was 3 days [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Curlycup gumweed favors dry areas, but grows on moist soils that lack
other vegetation [<a href="#17">17</a>].  It is most common in dry prairies, waste places,
roadsides, railroads, depleted rangelands, and abandoned croplands.  It
often forms almost pure stands [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].

Curlycup gumweed growth is poor to fair on gravel, clay, and dense clay,
and good in sandy loam, loam, and clayey loam.  It makes fair growth on
saline soils, good growth on gentle and moderate slopes, and fair growth
on steep slopes.  Optimum soil depth is 10 to 20 inches (25-50 cm) [<a href="#8">8</a>].

In eastern North Dakota, curlycup gumweed occurred on saltflats and in
wet lowlands where salinity ranged up to 1.3 percent [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Curlycup gumweed occurs at the following elevations [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>]:

                   Elevation (feet)    Elevation (m)

          SD         3,600-5,000        1,097-1,524
          UT            5,000              1,524
          WY         3,600-8,600        1,097-2,621


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Curlycup gumweed is subdominant in climax prairie communities [<a href="#6">6</a>].  It
also occurs on disturbed sites [<a href="#14">14</a>].  It is highly drought resistant,
and may be abundant after dry periods [<a href="#17">17</a>].  However, by 1943 curlycup
gumweed in the mixed-grass prairie of Kansas showed only partial
recovery from the great drought of the 1930s [<a href="#7">7</a>].

In a black-tailed prairie dog town in a tallgrass prairie in
southwestern Oklahoma, prairie dogs of one colony progressively
retreated from the outside of the colony toward its center prior to
abandoning it.  Plant succession at this site was studied the summer
after the animals left.  Order of succession was apparent in concentric
rings of vegetation circumscribing a bare area at the center of the
colony.  Curlycup gumweed did not occur in the most recently abandoned
area, the colony center.  It did occur in longer-adandoned, surrounding
rings in association with annual threeawn (Aristida oligantha) and other
short grasses, forbs, and mid-sized grasses such as sideoats grama.  It
was not found in the undisturbed peripheral rings, which supported
climax tall grasses such as big bluestem [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Curlycup gumweed forms a rosette the first year.  The next summer, the
plant grows erect stems which branch considerably and produce many
flower heads [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

Curlycup gumweed flowering times are [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>]:

In North Dakota, curlycup gumweed began growth in May, and by the end of
May had attained 50 percent of its yearly growth [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Curlycup gumweed
attained maximum height in August.  The average length of flowering
period was 41 days; the median date when flowering was 95 percent
complete was September 4 [<a href="#4">4</a>].

However, no information was available concerning its sprouting
performance.

Curlycup gumweed seeds probably establishes on burned sites by
wind-dispersed seed.

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Curlycup gumweed is probably top-killed by fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Curlycup gumweed colonizes disturbed areas, and establishes or increases
after fire.

Curlycup gumweed was a trace species with 0.1 percent cover before a
natural range fire occurred in a cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum)-sand
dropseed (Sporobolus cryptandrus)-red threeawn (Aristida longiseta)
community during the summer of 1956.  It was not present the first
growing season following the fire, in 1957.  At the end of the next
growing season, its cover was 1.2 percent.  During the next
2 years it was present only in trace amounts [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Curlycup gumweed populations increased following a 1983 or 1984 wildfire
of unknown intensity and season in a 9,600 square foot (800 sq m) area
in central Utah [<a href="#21">21</a>].
