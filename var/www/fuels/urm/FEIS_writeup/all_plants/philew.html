<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Lewis' mockorange commonly occurs in open coniferous forests and at
forest edges [<a href="#34">34</a>], and is usually associated with other shrubs.  In dry
Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests on the western slope of the
Cascade Range in Oregon, Lewis' mockorange is positively (significant at
P<0.05) associated with beaked hazelnut (Corylus cornuta), oceanspray
(Holodiscus discolor), poison-oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), baldhip
rose (Rosa gymnocarpa), and hollyleaved barberry (Mahonia aquifolium).
It reaches its greatest importance in the Douglas-fir/hollyleaved
barberry/disporum (Disporum spp.) community type [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Lewis'
mockorange is positively (significant at P<0.05) associated with
ninebark (Physocarpus malvaceus) on talus slopes in western Montana [<a href="#25">25</a>].

Lewis' mockorange occurs in moist draws and riparian areas, especially
in drier regions of the Northwest.  In eastern Oregon, Lewis' mockorange
is associated with willows (Salix spp.), alders (Alnus spp.), and
hawthorns (Crataegus spp.) [<a href="#13">13</a>].  It occurs with red-osier dogwood
(Cornus sericea) and Saskatoon serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia) in
north-central Washington [<a href="#6">6</a>].  It occurs with Saskatoon serviceberry and
common chokecherry (Prunus virginiana) on rocky outcrops of the National
Bison Range in western Montana [<a href="#29">29</a>].  In Oregon white oak (Quercus
garryana) woodlands in northern California, Lewis' mockorange occurs
along stream channels with oceanspray, cluster rose (R. pisocarpa), pale
serviceberry (A. pallida), and Indian plum (Oemleria cerasiformis).  A
Lewis' mockorange/brittle bladderfern (Cystopteris fragilis) community
type has been described [<a href="#41">41</a>].

Lewis' mockorange occurs in seral shrubfields and chaparral communities.
In northern Idaho, Lewis' mockorange is a component of the tall shrub
union that follows logging and burning [<a href="#48">48</a>].  In southwestern Oregon,
Philadelphus lewisii ssp. californicus occurs in chaparral dominated by
wedgeleaf ceanothus (Ceanothus cuneatus).  Other shrubs present include
skunkbush sumac (Rhus trilobata), yerba santa (Eriodictylon
californicum), chaparral honeysuckle (Lonicera interrupta), Klamath plum
(P. subcordata), hollyleaf redberry (Rhamnus crocea ssp. ilicifolia),
and pale serviceberry [<a href="#7">7</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Philadelphus lewisii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Lewis' mockorange is of minor importance as a forage species for
livestock [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Sampson [<a href="#36">36</a>] considered it poor to useless browse for
cattle and horses.  However, Shaw [<a href="#37">37</a>] reports that in riparian areas in
eastern Oregon, Lewis' mockorange is heavily browsed in areas accessible
to cattle.

Lewis' mockorange is a moderately important winter forage species for
deer and elk in the northern Rocky Mountains.  In southern British
Columbia, Lewis' mockorange is of moderate importance as a winter forage
species for white-tailed deer and Rocky Mountain elk, and of low
importance to other wild ungulates [<a href="#4">4</a>].  In Montana, a 1957 study based
on rumen samples showed that Lewis' mockorange constituted 2 percent of
mule deer diets in the winter and a trace in the summer [<a href="#47">47</a>].  In
northern Idaho, use by white-tailed deer was moderate, although a few
individual plants were browsed heavily [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Lewis' mockorange seeds
are eaten by quail and squirrels [<a href="#46">46</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Although generally considered of low palatability, Lewis' mockorange is
browsed heavily at times [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  New sprouts of Lewis'
mockorange are very palatable [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  See FIRE MANAGEMENT for
discussion of Lewis' mockorange palatability following fire.


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Lewis' mockorange occurs in dense shrub habitats which probably provide
good cover for wildlife.  In north-central Washington, Lewis' mockorange
occurs in a riparian cover type which is preferred in both summer and
winter by mule deer for thermal and security cover [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Native Americans used the strong, hard branches of Lewis' mockorange for
bows, arrows, combs, tobacco pipes, cradles, and netting shuttles
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Lewis' mockorange is cultivated as an ornamental, but
Philadelphus coronarius, a European species, is the most commonly grown
mockorange in the Northwest [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Lewis' mockorange is the Idaho state
flower [<a href="#17">17</a>]; it is illegal to collect Lewis' mockorange in Idaho for
export or sale [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Lewis' mockorange is very sensitive to herbicide sprays [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Effects
of herbicides on Lewis' mockorange are described [<a href="#27">27</a>].

<pre>
<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Philadelphus lewisii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Lewis' mockorange is a native, deciduous, erect to spreading shrub that
grows 3 to 10 feet (1-3 m) tall.  The showy flowers occur in clusters of
three to fifteen.  The fruit is a four-chambered capsule about 0.24 to
0.39 inch (0.6-1 cm) long [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Seeds are about 0.08 inch (0.2 cm)
long.  Lewis' mockorange is extremely variable in both vegetative and
floral characteristics [<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Lewis' mockorange reproduces vegetatively and by seed.  

Seeds accumulate in the seedbank.  Sparsely distributed viable seeds
were collected from the top 2 inches (5 cm) of soil in forested sites in
central Idaho [<a href="#19">19</a>]

Stratification of Lewis' mockorange increases germination.  Seeds
stratified for 8 weeks at 41 degrees Fahrenheit (5 deg C) then placed in
a sand medium at 72 to 79 degrees Fahrenheit (22-26 deg C) had 64
percent germination.  The germination rate was less than 10 percent for
seeds stratified less than 8 weeks [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Germination was 52 percent
when stored at room temperature for 3 years and 39 percent when stored
at 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 deg C) [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Germination was low when seeds
were fully exposed to light or kept in complete darkness [<a href="#39">39</a>].

Fruit development was adversely affected by drought in northern Idaho.
Fruit partially developed, turned brown, and opened, but no viable seed
was produced [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Lewis' mockorange sprouts from the root crown [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Lewis' mockorange occurs on well-drained, moist sites [<a href="#46">46</a>].  It grows on
deep, rich alluvial loams to rocky or gravelly loams [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Lewis'
mockorange is commonly found on rocky sites, at the base of talus slopes
and cliffs, along streams, and in seasonally moist draws [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  It
is found at talus margins in the Columbia River Basin [<a href="#11">11</a>].  It occurs
at seeps, springs, and rocky wet areas in the Crooked River National
Grasslands in central Oregon [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Lewis' mockorange occurs from sea level up to 7,000 feet (2,100 m) in
the Cascade Range [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>]. Philadelphus lewisii ssp.  californicus grows
from 1,000 to 5,000 feet (300-1,500 m) elevation on rocky slopes and in
canyons in the Sierra Nevada [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Lewis' mockorange grows best on
northern and eastern exposures [<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Lewis' mockorange is tolerant of moderate shade [<a href="#43">43</a>].  It is an early to
mid-seral species [<a href="#38">38</a>] and is often present in seral shrub communities
following logging and burning [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Although normally scattered at low
densities [<a href="#43">43</a>], it sometimes occurs in dense, localized stands [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Flowering of Lewis' mockorange occurs from May through July.  Fruit
matures in late summer and seeds are dispersed in September or October
[<a href="#39">39</a>].  The following dates are general ranges drawn from several studies
in northern Idaho.  Specific times for several years are reported [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Philadelphus lewisii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Lewis' mockorange occurs in both forested environments which frequently
experience fire and on rocky scree slopes which may not burn at all.  In
western Montana, Lewis' mockorange occurs in Douglas-fir habitat types
which had historical fire frequencies of 5 to 45 years [<a href="#10">10</a>].  The
ability of Lewis' mockorange to sprout after top-kill by fire enables it
to persist in these forests.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tall shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Philadelphus lewisii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Lewis' mockorange is top-killed by fire, but the root crown usually
survives and produces sprouts [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Lewis' mockorange sprouts vigorously from the root crown following fire
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  After an April fire on a south-facing slope in
north-central Idaho, Lewis' mockorange increased to prefire densities by
the third postfire growing season [<a href="#22">22</a>].

The following two studies have investigated the sprouting response of
Lewis' mockorange to fire.

Seral brushfields within the grand fir (Abies grandis)/pachistima
(Pachistima myrsinites) habitat type in northern Idaho were burned in
either spring (late March - early April) or fall (October).
Temperatures during the fires ranged from 67 to 78 degrees Fahrenheit
(19-26 deg C), and relative humidities ranged from 25 to 48 percent.
Lewis' mockorange on sites burned in October did not sprout until the
following April.  Lewis' mockorange on the spring-burned sites sprouted
4 to 8 weeks after the fire.  Twenty completely top-killed Lewis'
mockorange (eleven on the fall burned sites and nine on the spring
burned sites) were measured at the end of the first postfire growing
season [<a href="#24">24</a>]:

Average postfire sprout height (ft)    2.4 (73 cm)      2.1 (64 cm)

A multiple regression equation is presented which relates the number of
postfire basal sprouts to prefire crown height, crown diameter, and
crown volume [<a href="#24">24</a>].

In another study in north-central Idaho, a brushfield was burned three
times at 5-year intervals (31 March 1965, 3 May 1970, and 14 May 1975).
Maximum air temperatures during the fires were 77, 81, and 88 degrees
Fahrenheit (25, 27, and 31 deg C), and relative humidities at 4:00 pm
were 35, 16, and 27 percent, respectively.  Leaves on shrubs and
succulent herbaceous growth depressed the fire in 1975.  A single Lewis'
mockorange was followed during the study.  The plant was dormant during
the first fire, but leaves were beginning to emerge at the time of the
second fire and were completely emerged at the time of the third fire.
With each successive fire, average sprout height decreased.  Reduced
growth following the second and third fires may have resulted from the
advanced phenological stage at the time of those fires.  Sprout height
and number were measured the first growing season following each fire.
Crown height and diameter were measured during the second postfire
growing season [<a href="#23">23</a>].

             No. basal sprouts          Average sprout height (ft)

<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Lewis' mockorange palatability increases following fire.  After a spring
fire in northern Idaho, utilization of Lewis' mockorange by Rocky
Mountain elk was significantly (p<0.05) greater on recently burned sites
than on adjacent unburned sites [<a href="#21">21</a>].

                     % of available twigs browsed

                    1st season         2nd season 
      
Control                 1.3                0.6 
Burn                   36.3               30.0

Allometric equations, which can be used to estimate fuel quantities,
have been developed for Lewis' mockorange.  The equations use basal stem
diameter to estimate foliage biomass and total biomass [<a href="#5">5</a>].
