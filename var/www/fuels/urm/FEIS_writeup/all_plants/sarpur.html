<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Sarracenia purpurea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Pitcher-plant occurs from Florida to Mississippi, north to Virginia and
Maryland, west to Iowa and north to Manitoba, Hudson Bay, and Labrador
[<a href="#18">18</a>].  Its range extends as far west as northeastern British Columbia
[<a href="#21">21</a>].  Populations are scattered throughout Georgia and southern South
Carolina but become more abundant from northern South Carolina to
Virginia and Maryland [<a href="#18">18</a>].  The break between the northern and southern
subspecies occurs in central New Jersey [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Sarracenia purpurea forma
heterophylla is found in one county in Michigan, in some eastern
Canadian bogs, and in Connecticut [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Pitcher-plants, although carnivorous, are also beneficial to several
insect species.  Ants, wasps, bees, butterflies, and moths are attracted
to pitcher-plant by its nectar.  Beetles and spiders visit the plants to
prey on other insects.  Spiders may spin a web inside the pitcher to
catch insects which fall inside [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Some flies live in the pitchers,
feeding on decomposing insects [<a href="#9">9</a>].  The larvae of a small, nonbiting
mosquito live only in the liquid held by pitcher-plant.  Unlike most
insects, these larvae are neither killed nor digested in the pitcher
fluid [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

Pitcher-plant obtains prey species that are quite different from that of
other Sarracenia species.  A large number of grasshoppers, crickets, and
snails are captured.  Microhabitat segregation exists among
Sarracenica species in the same bog and may influence the types of prey
obtained [<a href="#9">9</a>].

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Runoff from road-salt storage piles into an adjacent bog killed several
native bog species, which allowed the invasion of cattails (Typha
latifolia) and weedy annuals.  Several bog species, including
pitcher-plant, were successfully transplanted to damaged areas using
"living mats" from unimpacted areas of the bog.  Component species of
the mats included Sphagnum mosses, small cranberry (Vaccinium
oxycoccos), pitcher-plant, narrow-leaf sundew (Drosera intermedia), and
leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata augustifolia) [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The unique beauty and unusual mode of life of pitcher-plants make them
desirable as houseplants [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
The larvae of several moth species feed on or burrow in pitcher-plant,
sometimes infesting large areas and severely damaging the population
[<a href="#26">26</a>].

Collection of wild pitcher-plants for sale has resulted in localized
extinction in some areas.  A number of dealers currently specialize in
cultivating carnivorous plants, but collecting is still a problem, since
it is less costly [<a href="#8">8</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Sarracenia purpurea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Pitcher-plant is a native, perennial, carnivorous forb.  The evergreen
leaves are modified into pitchers and arranged in a rosette [<a href="#23">23</a>].  The
pitchers are curved and decumbent, measuring to 17.7 inches (45 cm) and
widening prominently toward the mouth.  The hood on the pitcher is
positioned vertically, resulting in the pitcher usually being full or
partly full of rainwater [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Leaf color varies from bright
yellow-green to dark purple and is most commonly a middle variation with
strong red venation.  Flower petals, sepals, and bracts are rose pink to
dark red [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Flowers are solitary, and terminate a scape arising from
the rhizome.  At anthesis the scape is recurved near the apex.  The
fruit is a capsule with laterally winged seeds [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Reproduction is typically by seeds but may also occur by fragmentation
of the rhizomes [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Bees are the main pollinators.  Though normally
polytropic, during the peak of Sarracenia flowering, the bees are
effectively monotropic, visiting only Sarracenia species, at least where
there are large stands of flowers [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Bare ground is vital for
seedling establishment [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Pitcher-plant characteristically occurs in bogs, savannas, and
flatwoods.  The very wettest parts of bogs are favored, often
restricting the species to the edges of bogs [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Pitcher-plant forms
dense, floating mats on the water at the edges of bog ponds and lakes
and across acid streams [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Along the Gulf Coast Sarracenia
species are often associated with Sphagnum, sundew (Drosera sp.),
butterwort (Pinguicula sp.), pipewort (Eriocaulon sp.), bladderwort
(Utricularia sp.), grass-pink (Calopogon sp.), burmannia (Burmannia
sp.), and other genera characteristic of acid sites [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Pitcher-plant is adapted to poor soils that are deficient in trace
elements such as molybdenum.  These elements may be obtained from the
captured insects and amphibians [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Soils are usually highly acidic
and unsuitable for many other plants.  Pitcher-plant, however, does not
require acidic soils for growth, and it occasionally occurs in alkaline
marl bogs around the Great Lakes [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Both ombrotrophic and
minerotrophic peat sites are occupied [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Plant succession on pitcher-plant bogs is toward a sedge-woody species
dominated community.  Fire, however, retards this succession and
pitcher-plant bogs are thought to be fire disclimaxes [<a href="#6">6</a>].
Pitcher-plant is successional to sphagnum in the bogs of Isle Royale,
Michigan [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Pitcher-plant begins flowering along the Gulf Coast in early to
mid-March.  Farther north, blooming occurs from late July to early
August [<a href="#18">18</a>].  The leaves, or pitchers, are produced each year from stems
arising from the rhizomes and remain evergreen unless unduly exposed
[<a href="#22">22</a>].  Individual rhizomes may live for 20 to 30 years [<a href="#18">18</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Sarracenia purpurea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fire is beneficial to pitcher-plant in many ways.  Periodic, moderate
fires are necessary to reduce the encroachment of competing plants and
stimulate growth by releasing nutrients bound up in organic matter [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Pitcher-plant survives fire by resprouting from underground rhizomes.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Sarracenia purpurea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Pitcher-plant is usually top-killed by fire.  Severe fires may burn into
the peat layer and destroy the rhizomes, thereby killing the plant
[<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].



<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Pitcher-plant resprouts from underground rhizomes following fire.  It is
well adapted to moderate fire in the South [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Moth larvae infestations may be controlled by burning the previous
year's pitcher-plant litter.  Highly infested stands are frequently
those protected from fire [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Fire suppression also leads to less
frequent, severe fires which damage species normally considered to be
fire tolerant.  Fire is a natural event in carnivorous plant habitats,
and this must be considered when managing these areas [<a href="#8">8</a>].

The season that fire occurs in may influence the floristic composition
of pitcher-plant bogs.  Historically, summer fires were frequent,
probably occurring as a result of lightning.  At present, most fires are
caused by man and occur during the winter.  Data on the effects of this
shift are lacking; however, winter fires would seem less effective in
opening space for seed germination of bog species [<a href="#9">9</a>].
