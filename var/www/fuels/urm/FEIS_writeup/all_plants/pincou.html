<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Coulter pine occurs in a variety of plant associations, but seldom forms
extensive pure stands [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Where they do occur, communities dominated
by Coulter pine intergrade with chaparral and lower montane coniferous
forest [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Coulter pine is named as a dominant species in the

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus coulteri
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Coulter pine wood is rarely used except as fuelwood and second-grade
lumber [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  It is light, weak, coarse-grained, and brittle [<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Females of the southern race of white-headed woodpeckers forage for
insects almost exclusively on lower main trunks of Coulter pine, while
male white-headed woodpeckers extensively use the cones [<a href="#33">33</a>].  The seeds
are also a dependable year-round food source for western gray squirrels
[<a href="#7">7</a>].  Black-tailed deer rarely browse even young trees [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Coulter pine is used as an ornamental [<a href="#23">23</a>].  The cones are used for
decoration and crafts [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Coulter pine seeds were eaten by Native Americans [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Coulter pine distribution has apparently decreased in recent years.
This may be due to past policies of fire suppression [<a href="#55">55</a>].  See the Fire
Effects frame for a discussion on this problem.

Annual grasses deplete moisture from the top layer of soil, which
decreases survival of young Coulter pine [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Mature Coulter pine,
however, are drought tolerant [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Coulter pine cone processing and tree planting methods are discussed in
the literature [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  A discussion of damaging agents can also be
found in the literature [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus coulteri
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Coulter pine is a native evergreen conifer that lives up to 100 years of
age [<a href="#23">23</a>].  It attains a height of 30 to 83 feet (9-25 m) and a d.b.h.
of 12 to 31 inches (30-80 cm) [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  The bark is thick and
roughly furrowed at maturity [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  The crown is pyramidal and may
be dense or open, depending upon the site [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Needles occur in
groups of three and are 6 to 12 inches (15-30 cm) long [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  The
massive, spiny cones are 9 to 15 inches (24-40 cm) long, occurring in
whorls of four [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Young trees first bear cones on the trunk.  As
trees mature, cones are also borne on strong branches [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Although geographically isolated, nine Coulter pine populations were
very similar in all of three morphological characteristics studies.
Oleoresins (volatile portion) were also similar [<a href="#55">55</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Coulter pine first bears cones at 10 to 15 years of age [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  The
interval between good seed crops is 3 to 6 years [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Cones may
persist up to 5 or 6 years [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Seed dispersal is limited due to
the large size of seed.  Seed viability is generally high.  Seedling
establishment is best on mineral soil in full sun.  Early growth is
rapid [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  (See the Fire Ecology frame for a discussion of the
role of fire in Coulter pine regeneration.)


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Coulter pine occurs in a mediterranean climate.  Winter rains are
infrequent, and the summer is dry with occasional summer thunderstorms
[<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  

Coulter pine is most frequent on steep south-facing slopes and ridges
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Soils may be poor to fertile, and are typically dry.
Coulter pine is an indicator of serpentine soils, but also occurs on a
variety of other substrates.  Soils range from loamy to gravelly or
rocky in texture [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  Coulter pine occurs between 500 to 7,000
feet (150-2,120 m) elevation [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Coulter pine occurs in both initial communities and later seres.  Stands
are often even-aged, establishing after fire [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Mature Coulter
pine is shade intolerant [<a href="#2">2</a>], but seedlings can grow in partial shade
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

At higher elevations of the Coast Ranges, Coulter pine sometimes
replaces blue oak (Quercus douglasii) [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Coulter pine cones open for pollination in May and June [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].
Cones ripen in August and September of the second year following
pollination [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Mature cones may open at or soon after
maturity, slowly over a several-year peroid, or only after fire,
depending upon ecotype.  Cones of nonserotinous ecotypes open and
disperse seed from October through Novermber [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus coulteri
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Coulter pine displays ecotypical variation in degree of cone serotiny.
Serotiny is prevalent in Coutler pine/chaparral, Coulter pine-canyon
live oak, and Coulter pine/Sargent cypress communities.  Cones of
Coulter pine in these communities typically do not open until heated by
fire.  Consequently, the bulk of Coulter pine regeneration in these
communities occurs after fire.  Coulter pine ecotypes associated with
coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), however, typically bear cones that
open at maturity or shortly thereafter [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Coulter pine seedling development is best in mineral soil in open areas
[<a href="#38">38</a>].  Such conditions are created by fire.

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus coulteri
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Large Coulter pine are resistant to all but severe surface fires.
Younger trees are apparently killed by moderate-severity surface or
crown fires [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  No data are available concerning the effect of
crown fire on large-diameter Coulter pine. 

A "hot" surface fire on Mt. Diablo killed nearly all Coulter pine,
including large trees.  In an area of the mountain where fire was less
severe, however, 9 of 52 Coulter pine survived.  Of these trees, all of
those greater than 16 inches (40 cm) in d.b.h. survived, and only one
tree less than 16 inches in d.b.h. survived.  Surviving trees had needle
scorch only on lower branches [<a href="#54">54</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Coulter pine readily establishes from seed on burned sites [<a href="#52">52</a>].
Persisting cones on surviving trees, and sometimes on those killed by
fire, provide a source of seed [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Seedling establishment is
usually greatest during the first postfire year [<a href="#7">7</a>].  The severe Marble
Cone Fire in the Santa Lucia Mountains destroyed Coulter pine stands.
At postfire year 1, a large number of Coulter pine seeds germinated.
Three seasons following the fire, Coulter pine seedling density ranged
from 18 to 4,213 per acre (7-1,685/ha).  The lower seedling densities
probably resulted from interference by annual ryegrass [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Vale [<a href="#54">54</a>] found that pine seedling density was much greater after the
Mt. Diablo fire than before it (newly-germinated pines could not be
identified by species).  Pine seedling numbers were greatest in areas
where fire was less intense.  In these areas, relative frequency of pine
seedlings was 100 percent; density was 2 seedlings per square meter.  In
areas where fire was severe, relative frequency was only 56 percent, and
density was one seedling per square meter.  Vale suggested that the
intense heat in the heavily burned areas may have destroyed seeds within
the cones of trees, but the less intense heat in the more lightly burned
areas may have opened cones without destroying seeds.  Pine seedlings
were disproportionately located on areas where mineral soil was exposed.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Intense fire may be responsible for reducing the distribution of Coulter
pine [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].  Fire intensity in chaparral, woodland, and forest
vegetation is probably greater since inititation of fire suppression
[<a href="#56">56</a>], and intense fire reduces Coulter pine populations.  Frequent,
moderate-severity surface fires, however, would probably benefit this
species.  The differential survival of large trees in less intensely
burned areas and enhanced reproduction on exposed mineral soil in such
areas both suggest that most Coulter pine evolved under a regime of
frequent, light- to moderate-severity surface fires [<a href="#54">54</a>].  Managers
should keep in mind, however, that Coulter pine in Coulter pine-coast
live oak communities may be harmed by fire [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Prescribed burning has been used in Coulter pine/manzanita stands to
reduce fuel loading [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  Severe fires or fires at too-frequent
intervals, however, convert such communities to mixed stands of
manzanita and ceanothus [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].

Frequent fire selects for Coulter pine over bigcone Douglas-fir in
canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis) communities [<a href="#38">38</a>].

Under long fire return intervals, Coulter pine invades oak savanna
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].
