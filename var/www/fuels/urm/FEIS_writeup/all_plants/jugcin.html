<b>SCS PLANT CODE : </b>

<b>COMMON NAMES : </b>
   butternut
   white walnut
   oilnut


<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name for butternut is Juglans cinerea
L. [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Butternut and black walnut (Juglans nigra) are very similiar,
but can be distinguished by certain morphological differences.
Butternut has a pad of small dense hairs extending crosswise along the
upper margin of the old leaf scars; in black walnut this pad is absent.
The underside leaflets of butternut are densely covered with stellate
hairs, while in black walnut leaflet hairs are almost inconspicuous
[<a href="#31">31</a>].

Recognized hybrids are as follows [<a href="#24">24</a>]:

        J. cinerea x J. regia = J. X quadrangulata
        J. cinerea x J. ailantifolia = J. X bixbi

Reports of crosses between butternut and black walnut have not been
substantiated [<a href="#24">24</a>].

<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juglans cinerea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Butternut is distributed from southeastern New Brunswick throughout the
New England States except for northern Maine and Cape Cod.  Its range
extends south to include northern New Jersey, western Maryland,
Virginia, and Tennessee.  Small isolated pockets occur in North
Carolina, northwestern South Carolina, northern Georgia, northern
Alabama, northern Mississippi, and Arkansas.  Westward it is found in
eastern Iowa and southeastern Minnesota.  Disjunct populations occur in
Wisconsin, Michigan, and northeast into Ontario and Quebec.  Throughout
most of its range, butternut is not a common tree and its frequency is
declining.  The ranges of butternut and black walnut overlap, but
butternut occurs farther north than and not as far south as black walnut
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].

Butternut is cultivated in Hawaii [<a href="#33">33</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juglans cinerea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Butternut is not an important lumber species.  The wood is soft and
suitable only for a few uses such as interior finishing, furniture,
cabinet work, and small household woodenware [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Butternut fruit provides food for squirrels and other rodents
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Butternut leaves are palatable to white-tailed deer [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Butternut has been recommended for planting on surface mined areas in
the Northeast [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Several cultivars have been selected for nut size and for ease of
cracking and extracting kernels.  Nuts are especially popular in New
England for making maple-butternut candy [<a href="#24">24</a>].

An iodinelike yellow dye can be extracted from the fruit husks and bark,
and the root bark provides a laxative [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Within its optimum range and on good sites, butternut is usually
considered a desirable component of forest stands.  It has been
classified as a "less desirable tree" in southern Appalachian coves
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].

The most serious disease of butternut is butternut decline or butternut
canker.  The causal organism of this disease is the fungus Sirococcus
clavigignenti-juglandocearum.  Symptoms include dying branches and
stems.  Spores develop on these dying branches and are spread by
rainwater to tree stems.  Stem cankers develop 1 to 3 years after
branches die.  Trees top-killed by stem-girdling cankers do not resprout
[<a href="#24">24</a>].  This disease is reported to have almost eliminated butternut from
North and South Carolina [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juglans cinerea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Butternut is a small to medium-sized tree averaging 40 to 60 feet (12-18
m) in height and 12 to 24 inches (30-60 cm) in d.b.h.  This tree has a
short trunk which is divided into a few ascending limbs with large
spreading, sparsely forked branches.  The smaller branches tend to bend
downwards and then turn up at the ends.  The crown is open, broad,
irregular in outline and rounded at the top.  The root system is
composed of a number of wide-spreading laterals that grow to a
considerable depth.  Usually a taproot develops in deep soils [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].
Butternut grows fast, especially as a seedling, but usually does not
live longer than 75 years [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Mesophanerophyte
   Microphanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Seed production and dispersal:  Commercial seed-bearing age begins at 20
years and is optimum from 30 to 60 years.  Good crops of seed can be
expected every 2 to 3 years.  A high percentage of seeds are sound, but
high seed losses occur due to consumption by birds, insects, and
rodents.  Natural pollination failures often occur due to the lack of
pollinated trees in immediate vicinity [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Upon ripening, seeds are
dispersed by gravity, squirrels, and other rodents. [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

Vegetative propagation:  Stumps of young butternut trees and saplings
can sprout [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Butternut is found most frequently in coves, on stream benches and
terraces, on slopes, in the tallus of rock ledges, and on other sites
with good drainage [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  It is found up to an elevation of 4,900
feet (1,500 m) in the Virginias [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  In addition to those indicated
in the SAF cover type slot (Distribution and occurence), common tree
associates include black walnut (Juglans nigra), hickory (Carya spp.),
and white ash (Fraxinus americana) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Although young trees can tolerate partial shade, butternut must be in
the overstory to thrive and is classified as intolerant to shade and
competition [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Like other members of the Junglandaceae family,
butternut produces a substance called juglone, a naphthoquinone that is
selectively toxic to associated vegetation.  Greatest concentrations of
juglone are in root tissue and fruit husks, with lesser amounts in the
leaves, catkins, buds, and inner bark [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Butternut flowers from April to June, depending on location.  The fruit
matures in September and October and usually remains on the tree until
after leaf fall [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juglans cinerea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Butternut is very susceptible to fire.  Aboveground portions are easily
killed by fire, and sprouting from the root crown or stump is rare
[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving deep underground stems
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by animals or water; postfire yr 1&2

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juglans cinerea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Butternut does not typically survive fires that destroy aboveground
plant parts [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Butternut does not typically sprout after fire [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Butternut grows well in mixed hardwood forests that have been protected
from fire [<a href="#22">22</a>].  A single hot fire or repeated cool fires can
effectively eliminate butternut in mixed hardwood stands [<a href="#32">32</a>].
