<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Sheathed cottonsedge has a circumboreal distribution.  In North America,
it is distributed from Alaska east to Labrador and south to Minnesota,
Wisconsin, Indiana, and Pennsylvania.  Eriophorum vaginatum ssp.
spissum occurs throughout this range.  The typical subspecies is
primarily distributed in Eurasia but overlaps with E. v. ssp. spissum in
Alaska and Alberta [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Sheathed cottonsedge-dominated tussock tundra vegetation types are
extensive in interior Alaksa; they are the most widespread types north
of the Brooks Range.  Sheathed cottonsedge vegetation types include
sheathed cottonsedge-ericaceous shrub, sheathed cottonsedge-willow, and
sheathed cottonsedge-mixed shrub [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].  Dryness and Grigal [<a href="#9">9</a>] list a
black spruce (Picea mariana)/sheathed cottonsedge woodland type also
occurring in interior Alaska.  Pure stands of sheathed cottonsedge are
relatively rare, although a few exist on arctic slopes.  Sheathed
cottonsedge is sometimes an understory species in Sitka alder (Alnus
viridis ssp. sinuata) communities [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].

Sheathed cottonsedge tussock tundra occurs at high elevations in the
Great Lakes and New England states.  Sheathed cottonsedge also grows in
open conifer swamps dominated by black spruce and/or tamarack (Larix
laricina) in the Lake States [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].

Publications listing sheathed cottonsedge as a dominant or indicator
species are as follows:

Vegetation types in northwestern Alaska and comparisons with
   communities in other Arctic regions [<a href="#21">21</a>]
Reconnaissance of vegetation and soils along the Dempster Highway,
   Yukon Territory:  I. Vegetation types [<a href="#50">50</a>].
A preliminary classification system for vegetation of Alaska [<a href="#57">57</a>]
The Alaska vegetation classification [<a href="#58">58</a>]

Shrub associates of sheathed cottonsedge in interior Alaska include bog
labrador tea (Ledum palustre), bog blueberry (Vaccinium uliginosum),
dwarf arctic birch (Betula nana), cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus),
leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata), greyleaf willow (Salix glauca
ssp. acutifolia), and diamondleaf willow (S. planifolia ssp. pulchra).
Ground cover associates include Bigelow sedge (Carex bigelowii), Carex
lugens, mosses (Polytrichum juniperinum and Aulacomnium turgidum), and
lichens (Cetraria nivalis, C. cucullata, Cladonia gracilis, and C.
mitis) [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Sheathed cottonsedge associates in the Lake States include leatherleaf,
bog rosemary (Andromeda glaucophylla), bog birch (Betula pumila), bog
laurel (Kalmia polifolia), few-seeded sedge (Carex oligosperma), and
sphagnum mosses [<a href="#60">60</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Sheathed cottonsedge is grazed by sheep, cattle, lemmings, ground
squirrels, caribou, and geese [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].  Caribou graze it year-round;
it may form a considerable portion of their diet in some areas [<a href="#1">1</a>].
Following a mid-summer fire, Klein [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>] found that fall-migrating
caribou of the Western Arctic Herd near Kotzebue Sound of Alaska
preferentially grazed postfire growth of sheathed cottonsedge.  Its
early spring growth makes it important early-season forage for caribou
on calving grounds [<a href="#65">65</a>].  Willow ptarmigan eat sheathed cottonsedge
flower buds [<a href="#43">43</a>].

Open muskeg-sheathed cottonsedge tussock areas in the Lake States are
preferred habitat of sharp-tailed grouse.  Waterfowl use these areas as
breeding grounds [<a href="#60">60</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The nutritional value (dry-matter basis) of sheathed cottonsedge
collected in August from the Reindeer Preserve near Inuvik, Northwest
Territories, was 10.3 percent protein, 1.3 percent crude fat, and 33.8
percent fiber [<a href="#48">48</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Sheathed cottonsedge has potential for restoration of disturbed sites
because of its success as a colonizer [<a href="#64">64</a>].  It was one one the first
species to colonize areas of the northeastern United States and
southeastern Canada that were mined for peat [<a href="#12">12</a>].  It also colonized
denuded areas of an oil well site in Oumalik, Alaska [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Seed
collection, storage, and germination information is available [<a href="#64">64</a>].

Sheathed cottonsedge was top-killed by an experimental oil spill in the
MacKenzie Delta of Alaska but grew back from rootstocks the following
year [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Rangeland:  Sheathed cottonsedge recovers rapidly following occasional
defoliation by herbivores.  Tieszen and Archer [<a href="#54">54</a>] found that new
leaves of defoliated plants grew at faster rates than those of intact
plants.  When defoliated plants were subjected to a second defoliation
treatment, however, growth was markedly depressed from that of control
plants.  Overstocked reindeer have greatly reduced sheathed cottonsedge
in Canada's Reindeer Grazing Preserve [<a href="#64">64</a>].

Heavy sheep grazing on a sheathed cottonsedge-Scotch heather (Calluna
vulgaris) bog in northern England resulted in complete dominance of the
community by sheathed cottonsedge [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Continued heavy sheep grazing,
however, has resulted in sheathed cottonsedge decline or death [<a href="#64">64</a>].

Soil:  The phosphatase activity of sheathed cottonsedge roots adds
phosphorus to nutrient-poor arctic soils [<a href="#39">39</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Eriophorum vaginatum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sheathed cottonsedge is a native, tussock-forming graminoid. Its culm
varies from 8 to 28 inches (20-70 cm) in length and is sheathed to half
its length.  The acaulescent leaves and scales are tightly compacted.
Sheathed cottonsedge foliage dies back each winter, but basal portions
of leaves and stems remain green [<a href="#14">14</a>].  The inflorescense is a densely
tufted cyme composed of multiflowered spikelets.  The fruit is an achene
[<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Roots are densely fibrous and die back to rootstocks each
winter [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  The roots hydrolyze and absorb organic phosphorus
compounds from the soil, providing up to 69 percent of the plant's
phosphorus requirement [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Sheathed cottonsedge does not form
mycorrhizal associations [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Sheathed cottonsedge tussocks are composed of 300 to 600 individual
tillers [<a href="#14">14</a>].  They are elevated above ground level.  Tussocks near
Toolik Lake, Alaska, averaged 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter.  Measuring
from tiller bases, they also averaged 8 inches above ground.  Roots
averaged 12 inches (30 cm) in length, extending 4 inches (10 cm) below
ground until reaching the permafrost layer [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Individual tillers
live less than 8 years; estimated age of mature tussocks ranges from 122
to 187 years [<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sheathed cottonsedge reproduces sexually by seed and vegetatively by
tillering [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Seeds are first produced at age 3 and are dispersed
by wind [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Flower and seed production increase with disturbance [<a href="#5">5</a>].
Sheathed cottonsedge often dominates northern seedbanks:  97 percent of
seed found at a site on Kuparuk Ridge of the Brooks Range was sheathed
cottonsedge and Bigelow sedge [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Peat-buried sheathed cottonsedge
seeds remain viable for long periods of time in cold arctic
environments.  Longevity of seed collected from peatbeds near Eagle
Creek, Alaska, was estimated to be at least 200 years [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Sheathed
cottonsedge seeds readily germinate after overwintering when exposed to
light and warm temperatures [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Live mosses or liverworts, dead
leaves, and dead peat are favorable seedbeds.  Seedling establishment is
best on disturbed sites; it is rare in mature tussock communities [<a href="#37">37</a>].
Seedling growth rate is largely controlled by nutrient availability and
is most rapid after fire has released nutrients into the soil [<a href="#7">7</a>].
Tallis [<a href="#53">53</a>] found that tussocks increase in number during dry years,
probably because of drought intolerance of Bigelow sedge seedlings.

Sheathed cottonsedge produces tillers at the rate of one to three per
year, with tillering increasing in response to disturbance.  Tillers die
after flowering but decompose slowly due to compaction and low
temperature [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sheathed cottonsedge occurs in a continental climate with extreme
seasonal variations in temperature [<a href="#4">4</a>].  It grows on plateaus and gently
sloping foothills of interior Alaska and alpine areas of the notheastern
United States [<a href="#30">30</a>].  It is found in tundra bogs, muskegs, and pockets of
boreal forest [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  In the Adirondack Mountains, it occurs at
elevations of 500 to 1,500 feet (1,600-5,000 m) [<a href="#33">33</a>].  In Alaska, it
occurs at 3,600 to 9,800 feet (1,100-3,000 m) [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Parent materials of sheathed cottonsedge-supporting soils include
polymictic conglomerate, lithic wacke, siltstone, and shale overlain by
frozen glacial till and sand or sandy loam.  Depth of thaw into mineral
soil is 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm).  Soils belong to the Inceptisol order.
Mineral soil is usually covered by an up to 16-inch-thick (40 cm)
horizon of poorly decomposed peat [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  The superficial surface
layer may be a hepatic, moss, or lichen mat [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Soils are well to
poorly drained, low in nutrients, and acidic [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  Soil pH ranges
from 3.0 to 5.1 in Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories [<a href="#50">50</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Speices

Sheathed cottonsedge colonizes disturbed sites including burns, frost
boils, and gravel pits [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  It increased in importance
wherever disturbance occurred in Yukon Territory [<a href="#63">63</a>].  Sheathed
cottonsedge tussock communities are stable for many decades, but are
eventually replaced in the absence of disturbance.  Sheathed cottonsedge
is replaced by Carex species near Fairbanks, Alaska, and by Scotch
heather on the Seward Peninsula [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  It is sometimes replaced by
black spruce below the northern tree limit [<a href="#29">29</a>].  In the Lake States, it
is replaced by tamarack (Larix laricina) and red pine (Pinus resinosa)
[<a href="#60">60</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Sheathed cottonsedge flower buds are formed the year prior to flowering
[<a href="#8">8</a>].  Sheathed cottonsedge begins growth earlier in spring than most
tundra plant species [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Early growth is rapid, with new root tissue
initiated first.  Kummero and others [<a href="#34">34</a>] reported that new root growth
began prior to snowmelt (early June) in the northern foothills of the
Brooks Range.  Sheathed cottonsedge phenological development near
Fairbanks, Alaska, was reported as follows [<a href="#41">41</a>]:

new leaves initiated:  June to early July
flowers:  June to mid-July
fruits:  July
seeds dispersed:  late July to mid-August
senescence:  late July to August

Sheathed cottonsedge in the Adirondack Mountains fruits from June 9 to
July 6, and seed is disseminated before late September [<a href="#33">33</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Eriophorum vaginatum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fire-free intervals in sheathed cottonsedge tussock tundra are not well
documented.  Fire on the Seward Peninsula appears to be frequent (11.9
lightning fires per 2,000 sq mi [5,000 sq km] per 23 yr).  Farther
northeast in the Noatak River Valley, fire frequency appears to be 7.3
fires per 2,000 square miles per 23 years [<a href="#45">45</a>].

Fire is important in maintaining the long-term growth and survival of
sheathed cottonsedge.  In the absence of fire, sheathed cottonsedge
tussock-shrub tundra undergoes a series of autogenic successional
changes.  These changes involve the accumulation of peat and burial or
submergence of tussocks by dwarf shrubs, mosses, and lichens.  This
results in raised permafrost levels, reduced frost action, and
senescence of tussocks.  Frost action prevents such changes by churning
soils, incorporating organics, and preventing the buildup of dwarf
shrubs, mosses, and lichens.  Frost action is renewed when enough
organics are burned so that thaw depth reaches into mineral soils
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].

Sheathed cottonsedge survives fire because its growing points are
insulated by tightly bunched dead and live tillers, stem sheaths, and
scales.  The elevated position of tussocks increases resistance to
ground fire [<a href="#62">62</a>].  Fire provides an opportunity for seedling
establishment.  Since sheathed cottonsedge has both shallowly and deeply
buried seed, some viable seed is available regardless of depth of burn
into the peat horizon [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  Burned peat is an ideal seedbed.  In a
comparison of sheathed cottonsedge seedling emergence on different
substrates, burned peat showed highest rates of emergence.  The study
also showed that sheathed cottonsedge seedling emergence is greater
where fire has melted soil ice and deepened the active soil layer.
Additionally, the study showed that fire releases nutrients and enriches
tundra soils [<a href="#62">62</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Eriophorum vaginatum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Light- to moderate-severity fire generally top-kills sheathed
cottonsedge [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  A survey of burns in the MacKenzie Delta of Alaska
showed that tundra and tundra-forest wildfires burned aboveground
portions of sheathed cottonsedge tussocks.  Protective sheaths and
scales were charred but meristematic tissue was unharmed [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Severe
fire may kill tussocks [<a href="#45">45</a>].

Vogl [<a href="#59">59</a>] reported that some sheathed cottonsedge tussocks were killed
during prescribed burning in north-central Wisconsin.




<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Sheathed cottonsedge sprouts from burned tillers and establishes from
seed following fire [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Flower and tiller production increase after
top-kill [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Near Mile 107, Elliot Highway, Alaska, tussock
tillers sprouted from the rootstock during the first postfire growing
season following a severe prescription fire.  Seedling density was 180
per square yard (198/sq m) at postfire year 1.  Sprouting tillers
flowered at postfire year 2.  Flowering was significantly (p>0.01)
greater in burned than in unburned tussocks [<a href="#62">62</a>].  Another study found
that plants in northwestern Alaska maintained increased flower
production for 9 years after wildfire [<a href="#45">45</a>].

Two years following precribed burning in north-central Wisconsin,
average frequency of sheathed cottonsedge was 27.5 percent in burned
areas and 35.0 percent in adjacent unburned areas [<a href="#59">59</a>].  

Aboveground average biomass of sheathed cottonsedge was 15 grams per
square meter one year after wildfire near Fairbanks (average biomass of
unburned areas was 17.8 g/sq m).  Biomass was 107 grams per square meter
at postfire year 13 (average biomass of unburned areas was 5.5 g/sq m) [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
A standing crop biomass of 400 grams per square meter or more was
reported for a sheathed cottonsedge-dwarf shrub heath in interior
Alaska [<a href="#2">2</a>].

The wind adjustment factor for predicting fire behavior in sheathed
cottonsedge tussock tundra in interior Alaska is 0.75.  This is
substantially higher than wind adjustment factors of other vegetation
types.  If a fire moves from black spruce forest onto tussock tundra, a
very rapid increase in rate of spread should be anticipated [<a href="#42">42</a>].

The relative fuel potentials of 12 tundra-forest ground species of the
MacKenzie Delta were evaluated from measured fuel characteristics by
simulating a test fire with the Rothermal fire behavior model.
Sheathed cottonsedge received the lowest flammability rating of all
species tested.  Other data regarding fuel characteristics of sheathed
cottonsedge were listed [<a href="#52">52</a>].

Some Scotch heather-sheathed cottonsedge bogs in northern England are
burned every 10 years in order to maximize the amount of sheathed
cottonsedge available as sheep forage [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

The nutritional value of sheathed cottonsedge foliage increases for the
first 1 to 2 years after fire [<a href="#29">29</a>].

<b>SEASON/SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION : </b>
summer/low to moderate severity


<b>STUDY LOCATION : </b>
The Imurak Lake area is located in the central part of the Seward
Peninsula of Alaska (65 deg 35 min N., 163 deg 20 min W.).  It is within
the Bering Land Bridge National Monument and is administered by the
National Park Service.  At the time of the fire, it was administered by
the Bureau of Land Management.  Study sites were on the southwest slope
of Nimrod Hill (Bendelben C-3 quadrangle on USGS topographical map)
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>PREFIRE VEGETATIVE COMMUNITY : </b>
Sheathed cottonsedge tussocks dominated the footslope of Nimrod Hill.
Sheathed cottonsedge frequency was 10 percent; density was 34 shoots per
square meter.  Areas between tussocks were occupied by dwarf shrubs,
mosses, and lichens.  Dwarf shrubs present were bog Labrador tea (Ledum
palustre), cloudberry (Rubus chamaeorus), mountain cranberry (Vaccinium
vitis-idaea), bog blueberry (V. uliginosum), crowberry (Empetrum
nigrum), and dwarf arctic birch (Betula nana).  Mosses were Sphagnum
spp., Dicranum elongatum, Hypnum pratense, and Aulocimium palustre.
Also present were reindeer lichens (Cladonia gracilis, C. rangiferina),
caribou lichens (Cetraria cuclata), and dogtooth lichen (Peltigera
aphthosa).  Imurak Lake was downslope from this sheathed
cottonsedge-ericaceous shrub community.  A dwarf arctic birch-ericaceous
shrub community was upslope [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>TARGET SPECIES PHENOLOGICAL STATE : </b>



<b>SITE DESCRIPTION : </b>
Imurak Lake Fire study sits were located along a topographic transect
from the bottom to the top of Nimrod Hill.  Slope was gentle (1-9%) on
the footslope where the sheathed cottonsedge-ericaceous shrub community
occurred.  Footslope elevation was 1,100 to 1,350 feet (335-411 m).
Soil was moist.  Texture of the soil mineral fraction was silty
clay-loam.  Frost depth was 11.6 inches (29 cm).  The organic layer was
3.6 to 17.2 inches (19-43 cm) thick [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>FIRE DESCRIPTION : </b>
The Imurak Lake Fire was ignited by lightning.  Fire was moderate to
severe in the dwarf arctic birch-ericaceous shrub community.  It moved
downslope from that community into sheathed cottonsedge-ericaceous
shrub, where it lowered to light and moderate severity [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES : </b>
Sheathed cottonsedge-ericaceous shrub tundra had the fastest postfire
regeneration rates of all plant communities burned, with 15 to 20
percent cover at postfire year 1.  Sheathed cottonsedge cover averaged
17.4 percent; average density of mature plants was 3.5 shoots per square
meter.  Tussocks on old frost scars apparently sprouted more vigorously
than tussocks on other substrates and produced more flowers at postfire
year 2.  Distinction between sheathed cottonsedge seedlings and Carex
spp. seedlings was difficult at postfire year 1 because they were less
than 0.4 inch (1 cm) tall.  Total sedge seedling density, however, was
greater than 100 per square meter.  After 7 postfire years, evidence of
fire was difficult to detect, except for the change in species
composition.  Sheathed cottonsedge increased in importance as a result
of fire [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS : </b>
Postfire peat thickness was 9.6 to 12 inches (24-30 cm), a reduction of
2 to 6 inches (5-15 cm) from prefire thickness.  Depth of thaw increased
12 to 14 inches (30-35 cm).  Postfire frost action created new frost
scars and renewed old ones [<a href="#1">1</a>].

The Imurak Lake Fire demonstrates how fire benefits sheathed
cottonsedge.  The fire renewed growth of senescent tussocks.  Increased
depth of active soil layer and availability of fresh frost scars created
opportunity for seedling establishment.  Increased soil nutrients
allowed for vigorous growth of seedlings and sprouting tillers [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Heavy equipement was driven across the Imurak Lake Burn the spring
following the fire.  It left deep tracks and ruts (up to 10 inches [25
cm] deep) and exposed mineral soil.  Racine [<a href="#1">1</a>] recommended that because
burned tundra is particularly susceptible to disturbance, off-road
