<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Dogfennel has no value as forage for wildlife and livestock [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Dogfennel probably has very low palatability.  Cattle graze it sparingly
if at all, even when other forage is scarce [<a href="#9">9</a>].

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Dogfennel may serve as a reservior for disease-causing pathogens when
growing among food crops [<a href="#4">4</a>].  

Dogfennel is scarce on forest ranges in good condition [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Grazing
forage utilization in excess of 65 percent will favor dogfennel
establishment [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Dogfennel presence may indicate overgrazing.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Eupatorium capillifolium
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Dogfennel is a common, aggressively weedy native of the southeastern
United States [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  It is alternately described as an annual [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>]
and a perennial [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  It has several stems arising from a stout woody
caudex.  It grows in distinct colonies on favorable sites.  Dogfennel
normally reaches 4 to 5 feet (1.2-1.5 m) in height but can reach up to 9
feet (2.7 m) on fertile sites [<a href="#9">9</a>].  The fruit is a smooth achene [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Therophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Dogfennel is wind pollinated [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Following the typical pattern of
weedy plants, dogfennel's primary mode of regeneration is probably
sexual.  Its regeneration strategy probably depends on the production of
a great many wind-dispersed seeds.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Dogfennel grows on disturbed sites in the Southeast.  It is common on
young burns in the loblolly pine (Pinus taeda)-turkey oak (Quercus
laevis) type in Florida's Ocala National Forest [<a href="#10">10</a>], on recent burns in
the Okefenokee Swamp [<a href="#1">1</a>], on burned and cut Atlantic white-cedar
(Chamaecyparis thyoides) sites in the Great Dismal Swamp [<a href="#14">14</a>], and on
overgrazed sites in Louisiana [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Dogfennel is a frequent invader of
everglades sawgrass (Cladium sp.) communities during drought [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].
Other dogfennel sites include meadows, swales, old fields, pond borders,
ditches, disturbed or overgrazed pastures, and roadsides [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Although
apparently able to grow on a variety of soils, it is most common on dry,
sandy soils [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

Dogfennel is intolerant of closed or highly structured communities [<a href="#9">9</a>].
It is undoubtedly an early seral, if not an invader, species in most
successional progressions within its range.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Dogfennel biomass peaks in the spring [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Its flowering period is
unusually long because shaded plants bloom earlier than those in full
sun.  A population of dogfennel near Gainsville Florida had the
following phenological sequence [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Phenological event                         Timing          
------------------              -----------------------------   
Flowering                       late August - early November
Fruit ripening                  early - mid November
Fruit dispersal                 late November - early December
Drying                          late November - mid January
Dormancy                        mid January - early March
Bolting                         early April - June

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Eupatorium capillifolium

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
The fire ecology of dogfennel has not been adequately described.
Dogfennel probably depends on off-site seed sources to colonize
recently burned areas.  Sprouting from a surviving caudex may also
occur.

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Eupatorium capillifolium

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Most fires probably kill or at least top-kill dogfennel.  Its caudex may
survive cool fires.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
The presence of dogfennel on recently burned sites [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>] indicates
that seedling establishment and/or sprouting occurs following fire.
