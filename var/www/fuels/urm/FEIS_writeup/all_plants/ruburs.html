<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Trailing blackberry is well represented in a wide variety of plant
communities [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  It has been identified as a codominant with
Columbia brome (Bromus vulgaris) and Shasta red fir (Abies magnifica
var. shastensis) in certain plant communities of the Cascades [<a href="#8">8</a>].
Trailing blackberry is listed as a codominant in the following
publication:

Natural vegetation of Oregon and Washinton [<a href="#21">21</a>]
 
Associated species:  Trailing blackberry grows as an understory species
with Shasta red fir, Pacific silver fir (A. amabilis), spruce (Picea
spp.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga mensiesii), white fir (A. concolor),
grand fir (A. grandis), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), western
hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), and red
alder (Alnus rubra) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  Trailing blackberry also occurs in
many West Coast riparian communities dominated by willows (Salix spp.)
or cottonwoods (Populus spp.) [23.42,62], as a codominant with
salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis) and thimbleberry (R. parviflorus), and
in baccharis (Baccharis spp.) shrub communities of the northern
California coast [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Common understory associates include Oregon
oxalis (Oxalis oregana), sweetscented bedstraw (Galium triflorum),
elderberry (Sambucus spp.), and other blackberries, raspberries, or
brambles (Rubus spp.)  [<a href="#21">21</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Wildlife:  Trailing blackberry provides food and cover for many wildlife
species [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Blackberries are eaten by numerous birds, including the
ruffed grouse, northern bobwhite, sharp-tailed grouse, California quail,
ring-necked pheasant, blue grouse, gray (Hungarian) partridge,
band-tailed pigeon, American robin, yellow-breasted chat, pine grosbeak,
gray catbird, and summer tanager [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].  Jays, pigeons, northern
mockingbird, sparrows, tanagers, thrashers, and towhees, consume the
fruit of trailing blackberry and nest in its tangled branches [<a href="#13">13</a>].
Mammals, such as the coyote, common opossum, skunks, gray fox, red fox,
raccoon, squirrels, chipmunks, and black bear, consume the fruit of
blackberries [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].

Black-tailed deer feed on the stems and foliage of trailing blackberry
[<a href="#13">13</a>], and in some parts of California it is considered a preferred
browse [<a href="#14">14</a>].  In the Coast Range of western Oregon, leaves are selected
by deer in all seasons except summer, when a wide variety of other foods
are present [<a href="#34">34</a>].  In many areas trailing blackberry is particularly
important to deer during the fall and winter [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Deer often feed
heavily on the foliage until the leaves are covered by snow [<a href="#12">12</a>].  The
young leaves, which develop earlier than those of most other associated
shrubs, provide an important food source when forage supplies are lowest
and deer are threatened with malnutrition [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Hines and Land [<a href="#35">35</a>]
report that trailing blackberry browse is a preferred winter food of
black-tailed deer inhabiting Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests
of the Oregon Coast Ranges.  In this area it supplied nearly 50 percent
of the total deer forage at the beginning of winter.  In other winter
feeding trials, deer reduced the leaves and twigs of trailing blackberry
by as much as 80 to 89 percent [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Elk feed on trailing blackberry through much of the year in parts of
California, although utilization appears to be highest during the fall
and winter [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Rabbits, porcupines, mountain beaver, and beaver
occasionally consume the stems, leaves, and cambium of blackberries
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].

Livestock:  Blackberries, in general, provide only minimal browse for
domestic livestock.  In some locations, trailing blackberry is
moderately grazed by domestic sheep but is rarely used by cattle [<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Berries:  Fruits of the trailing blackberry are sweet and succulent at
maturity [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Berries are palatable to many species of birds and
mammals.

Browse:  Trailing blackberry has been described as a relatively
unpalatable shrub [<a href="#49">49</a>].  However, in parts of California and presumably
elsewhere, deer exhibit a marked preference for the stem and foliage of
this plant.  Most blackberries are relatively unpalatable to domestic
livestock.


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The specific food value of trailing blackberry browse has not been
documented, but it is considered to be good nutritionally [<a href="#35">35</a>].  In
feeding trials conducted by Hines [<a href="#34">34</a>], it was the only native browse
species capable of maintaining the weight of deer over winter.  The food
value of trailing blackberry was found to vary seasonally, with the
crude fat content of the leaves peaking in the fall.  Only slight
seasonal changes were noted in the crude fiber content of the leaves
[<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Trailing blackberry provides important cover for a wide variety of
wildlife species [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Dense thickets of blackberries form good nesting
sites for many small birds including, thrashers, jays, pigeons, northern
mockingbird, sparrows, tanagers, and towhees [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  The endangered
least Bell's vireo frequently nests in trailing blackberry thickets
along willow (Salix spp.)-cottonwood (Populus spp.)-oak (Quercus spp.)
ecotones in certain riparian areas of California [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Mammals such as
rabbits, red squirrel, black bear, and beaver utilize blackberry
thickets for cover in many areas [<a href="#64">64</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Blackberries, because of their ability to grow well on infertile soils,
may be valuable in preventing soil erosion on some sites [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].
Trailing blackberry has been used to at least a limited extent in
rehabilitation projects in the West.  Expected mortality was estimated
at approximately 50 percent following plantings in southern California.
Planting densities of 66 per acre (163/ha) were recommended for best
results [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Plants may be propagated vegetatively, transplanted, or
seeded onto disturbed sites.  Seed which has been scarified can be
successfully planted in late summer or early fall [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Brinkman [<a href="#6">6</a>]
reports that cold treatment is not required for fall plantings.
Previously stratified and scarified seed can be planted in spring.  Good
results have been obtained after seeds were planted with a drill and
covered with 1/8 to 3/16 inch (0.3-0.5 cm) of soil.


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Fruits of the trailing blackberry are sweet and edible [<a href="#27">27</a>].  The
commercially grown loganberry, youngberry, and boysenberry were
originally derived from this species [<a href="#54">54</a>].

Native Americans historically ate fresh blackberries in summer.  Fruit
was dried and combined with meat to make cakes which were eaten in
winter [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Unripened berries were soaked in water to make a cool
refreshing drink, and leaves or vines were used in making teas.  Roots
were boiled in water to make various medicinal preparations [<a href="#9">9</a>].  The
fruit and stems of many blackberries have also been used to produce
various tonics or medicines [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Competition:  Trailing blackberry quickly assumes prominence on burned
or logged sites.  After disturbance it can compete aggressively with
conifer seedlings in many locations.  Trailing blackberry frequently
makes up a large proportion of the shrub cover on scarified plots in
brushfields of coastal Oregon [<a href="#43">43</a>] and has been described as a principal
understory species in recently clearcut Douglas-fir forests of the
Olympic Mountains of Washington [<a href="#19">19</a>].  This highly competitive shrub
also becomes prominent on cutover sites in many coniferous forests of
both northeastern Oregon and northern Idaho [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Chemical control:  Many chemicals including glyphosate, triclopyr, and
roundup, have proven effective in controlling trailing blackberry
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  Fifty to 80 percent control has been achieved with roundup in
some locations [<a href="#49">49</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rubus ursinus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Trailing blackberry is a low-growing, trailing or climbing, native
evergreen shrub [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  This mound-building shrub can grow to 15 or
20 feet (5-6 m) in length [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  The densely prickled stems are
greenish when young but turn brown at maturity [<a href="#9">9</a>].  The somewhat
prickly, deeply-lobed, alternate leaves are palmate and a lighter green
color beneath [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].

The stems of most blackberries are biennial.  Sterile first-year stems,
known as primocanes, develop from buds at or below the ground surface
and produce only leaves.  Lateral branches, or floricanes, develop in
the axils of the primocanes during the second year and bear both leaves
and flowers [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Perfect flowers of trailing blackberry develop in clusters of 2 to 15
near the ends of leafy branches [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  Fruit is red and hard when
immature but shiny black when ripe [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Fruit is oblong or conical,
somewhat bristly, and up to 0.8 inches (2 cm) in length [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].
Aggregates of druplets, commonly referred to as "berries," are sweet and
flavorful at maturity [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Trailing blackberry exhibits vigorous vegetative regeneration but also
commonly reproduces through seed.  Reproductive versatility is common in
the Rubus genus, with sexual reproduction, parthenogenesis (development
of the egg without fertilization), pseudogamy (a form of apomixis in
which pollination is required), and parthenocarpy (production of fruits
without fertilization) occurring widely.  The following types of
reproduction have been documented in blackberries:  (1) sexual
reproduction, (2) nonreduction at meiosis on the female, male, or both
sides, (3) apomixis (seed contains embryo of maternal rather than sexual
origin) with segregation, (4) apomixis without segregation, and (5)
haploid parthenogenesis [<a href="#11">11</a>].  These modes of asexual reproduction
contribute to the aggressive, vigorous spread of blackberries.

Vegetative regeneration:  Most species within the Rubus genus are
capable of vigorous sprouting from root or stem suckers, or rooting stem
tips [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Trailing blackberry sprouts readily from "suckers"
(presumably root suckers), or "nonrhizomatous sprouts" after fire or
mechanical disturbance [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  It is also capable of spreading
rapidly from trailing stems which root at the nodes [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].  These
modes of vegetative spread occur even in the absence of disturbance.

Seed production:  Most blackberries produce good seed crops nearly every
year [<a href="#6">6</a>].  During the first year of development, blackberries grow from
perennial rootstocks or creeping stems and produce sterile vegetative
shoots known as primocanes [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Lateral branches which produce both
leaves and flowers (floricanes) develop in the axils during the second
year [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Black shiny drupelets are produced on the floricanes of
trailing blackberry [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Fruit is oblong to conical, and up to 0.8
inches (2 cm) in length [<a href="#55">55</a>].  384,000 per pound (845,814/kg) [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Germination:  Blackberry seeds have a hard, impermeable coat and dormant
embryo; consequently, germination is often slow.  Most blackberries
require, as a minimum, warm stratification at 86 to 68 degrees F (30 to
20 degrees C) for 90 days, followed by cold stratification at 36 to 41
degrees F (2 to 5 degrees C) for an additional 90 days [<a href="#6">6</a>].  These
conditions are frequently encountered naturally as seeds mature in
summer and remain in the soil throughout the cold winter months.
Laboratory tests indicate that exposure to sulfuric acid solutions or
sodium hyperchlorite prior to cold stratification can enhance
germination [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Seed dispersal:  Fruit of the trailing blackberry is readily dispersed
by many small birds and mammals [<a href="#27">27</a>].  After they mature, the sweet,
succulent berries rarely remain on the plant for long [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Seedbanking:  The seeds of most blackberries remain viable for at least
several years after being buried in the soil or duff [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Although the
precise length of viability has not been determined for the trailing
blackberry, Morgan and Neuenschwander [<a href="#52">52</a>] regard it as a species which
relies heavily on seedbanking for postfire regeneration.  Average seed
densities of 290 per foot square (27 per m sq) have been reported in
western redcedar (Thuja plicata)/pachistima and western redcedar/
queencup beadlily (Clintonia uniflora) habitat types in coniferous
forests of northern Idaho [<a href="#55">55</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
The trailing blackberry occurs across a wide range of sites from warm,
open areas to dense woodlands [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  It is particularly common in
prairies, clearings, waste places, and canyons [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  Trailing
blackberry frequently assumes prominence on sites which have been burned
or logged [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>] and on river terraces or gravel bars dominated by
red alder (Alnus rubra) [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Soils:  Blackberries (Rubus spp.) grow well on a variety of barren,
infertile soils [<a href="#6">6</a>].  These shrubs tolerate a wide range of soil texture
and pH but require adequate soil moisture for good growth [<a href="#10">10</a>].
Trailing blackberry appears to be tolerant of periodic flooding by
brackish or fresh water [<a href="#65">65</a>].

Elevation:  Trailing blackberry grows from sea level along the Pacific
Coast to middle elevations farther inland [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  Generalized
elevational ranges for given locations are as follows [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>]:

        < 2,000 feet (610 m) in the Santa Monica Mtns., CA
        < 3,000 feet (914 m) in southern California


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Trailing blackberry is a vigorous competitor which commonly invades
disturbed sites created by logging, fire, or other types of disturbance
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  It is particularly well represented following "catastrophic
disturbance" in Douglas-fir forests of the Pacific Northwest [<a href="#25">25</a>], and
readily established on mudflows and other harsh microsites following the
eruption of Mount St. Helens.  Trailing blackberry typically increases
rapidly on disturbed sites, persisting until suppressed by canopy
closure [<a href="#26">26</a>].  It occurs in stands of all ages but reaches greatest
abundance in early seral communities [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Although primarily an
early seral species, trailing blackberry can sometimes persist in low
densities as a residual species in mature forest communities [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].
Trailing blackberry was observed in initial postdisturbance, early
immature, late immature, mature, and old growth stands in coniferous
forests of southwestern British Columbia [<a href="#44">44</a>].  This shrub increases
rapidly and can dominate the herbaceous layer as early as 2 to 5 years
after disturbance [<a href="#25">25</a>].  In many western hemlock-western redcedar or
Douglas-fir forests of the Pacific Northwest, this shrub remains
dominant for at least 20 years after disturbance [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Bailey [<a href="#2">2</a>]
found that trailing blackberry increased to 50 percent cover 4 years
after disturbance, fluctuated between 25 and 50 percent cover for 20
years, and declined to 1 percent cover in climax stands.  Maximum cover
values were reached 15 to 30 years after logging and fire in Douglas-fir
plantations in western hemlock-Douglas-fir habitats of western Oregon
[<a href="#59">59</a>].
 
Trailing blackberry is present in red alder communities, which on
certain upland sites, appear to represent early seral stages of western
hemlock forests.  Where these communities occur along streambanks,
periodic flooding can maintain species such as salmonberry and red alder
in long-lived, disclimax situations.  Trailing blackberry is considered
a major dominant in early successional stages of these communities [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Seasonal development of the trailing blackberry varies according to
geographic and climatic factors.  Phenology has been documented as
follows [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>]:

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rubus ursinus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Trailing blackberry is a common invader on recently burned sites in the
Pacific Northwest [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  Populations are capable of dramatic and
rapid expansion on disturbed sites [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>] through sprouting or seedling
establishment [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Belowground regenerative structures are generally
well protected from the harmful effects of heat and permit rapid
recovery where trailing blackberry plants were present in the preburn
community.  Seedbanking is also an important postfire regenerative
strategy [<a href="#52">52</a>].  Seeds accumulate in the soil or duff, remaining viable
long after this seral species has been eliminated from mature forest
communities.  Seeds commonly germinate in great abundance after fire.
The relatively large, sweet, succulent fruit of blackberries amply
"reward" animal dispersers [<a href="#40">40</a>], and some postfire dispersal of seed
from off-site is probable.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tall shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Rhizomatous shrub, rhizome in soil
   Geophyte, growing points deep in soil
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rubus ursinus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Trailing blackberry is described as "rather tolerant" of fire [<a href="#25">25</a>].
Although it may be top-killed [<a href="#52">52</a>], underground regenerative portions of
this shrub generally survive [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  Fires of relatively high
severity or intensity, with the potential to harm belowground
regenerative structures, appear to be the most damaging to trailing
blackberry [<a href="#52">52</a>].

Most trailing blackberry seed stored on-site in the soil or duff is
probably unharmed by fire [<a href="#52">52</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>



<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Vegetative response:  Trailing blackberry is capable of vegetative
regeneration following fire through nonrhizomatous basal sprouts or root
"suckers" [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Basal sprouting is believed to be of primary
importance, and often results in a large number of sprouts [<a href="#51">51</a>].  This
low-growing shrub can also root at the stem nodes [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>] and can
presumably spread quickly where portions of the aboveground stem remain
undamaged.  Vegetative spread is generally both vigorous and rapid.
Stewart [<a href="#61">61</a>] observed an average of approximately 1,520 sprouts (plus
some surviving original stems) per acre (3,762/ha) within 2 year after
fire.  Prior to the fire, an average of only 40 original trailing
blackberry stems had been counted within the same area.  Evidence
suggests that all forms of sprouting may be favored after fires of
relatively low severity or intensity which are unlikely to damage
belowground regenerative structures [<a href="#52">52</a>].  Expansion of trailing
blackberry may be delayed on heavily burned sites [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Comparative
cover and density values of sprouts on a 2-year-old burn in western
redcedar/pachistima and western redcedar/queencup beadlily habitat types
in northern Idaho are as follows [<a href="#50">50</a>]:
            
           low severity              high severity
        
  % cover     32.5                        16.0
  density      1.7                         1.8


Seedling establishment:  Seedbanking is reportedly an important means of
postfire reestablishment for the trailing blackberry [<a href="#50">50</a>].
High-severity fires, which burn to mineral soil, frequently create a
favorable seedbed for buried blackberry seed, and seedlings sometimes
germinate in abundance [<a href="#52">52</a>].  However in several instances, researchers
have observed decreased seedling establishment after unusually hot fires
with "much fuel consumption" [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].  Other factors, such as site
characteristics or climatic conditions, may have contributed to the
variable responses.  Seedling establishment of trailing blackberry can
also occur through seed transported from off-site by birds and mammals.

Rate of postfire recovery:  Sprouting produces the most rapid early
growth, as plants draw upon portions of previously established root
systems [<a href="#52">52</a>].  In many locations trailing blackberry has exhibited the
most rapid postfire expansion of any residual species [<a href="#25">25</a>].  This shrub
can dominate the herbaceous layer within 2 to 5 years after fire
[<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].  Peak cover values have been reported from 0 to 5 years
after fire [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  Trailing blackberry is characterized by a
relatively long (> 5 years) period of postfire abundance and generally
persists until suppressed by canopy closure [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Trailing blackberry
cover occasionally exhibits a temporary decline after rapid early growth
as one or a few stems attain dominance over many initial sprouts [<a href="#50">50</a>].
In western redcedar habitat types of northern Idaho, Morgan and
Neuenschwander [<a href="#52">52</a>] observed highest cover values in the third and fifth
years after fire, with trailing blackberry disappearing by the fifteenth
year.  However, trailing blackberry frequently remains abundant for 11
to 16 years or more after fire in the Cascade Mountains of western
Oregon [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  Halpern [<a href="#25">25</a>] reported that it remained prominent for at
least 20 years after fire in seral Douglas-fir forests of western
Oregon.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Fire severity and intensity can influence the rate of postfire recovery
in trailing blackberry regardless of whether regeneration occurs
vegetatively or through seedling establishment.  The following response
has been observed in western redcedar/queencup beadlily habitat types of
Idaho [<a href="#52">52</a>]:

              mean frequency of occurrence 
              burn age in years
        
severity        1        2        3        4        5        15
  low          33       82       71       74       98         0
  high         71       80       68       74      100         0


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Timber harvest and slash burns:  Trailing blackberry commonly invades
logged and slash burned sites in the Douglas-fir zone of the Pacific
Northwest [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  Reestablishment is rapid and can occur by the second
season after treatment [<a href="#53">53</a>].  In early postfire years, cover of trailing
blackberry is frequently as much as 3 times higher on slash burned sites
than in adjacent undisturbed stands [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Trailing blackberry remains
prominent until suppressed by the closure of the forest canopy [<a href="#25">25</a>].
Schoonmaker and McKee [<a href="#59">59</a>] reported the following cover values after
clearcutting and broadcast burning in the Cascades of western Oregon:

yrs. since
 tmt.       2       5       10      15     20      30      40  old growth 
        
cover(%)  2.28    2.18    1.11     9.7   20.52    7.35    0.66   0.18

Stewart [<a href="#61">61</a>] observed similar increases after clearcutting and broadcast
burns in Coastal Oregon:

years         preburn         1         3         4
        
cover (%)       .20          .90      2.40       .20

Competition:  Trailing blackberry is favored by fire and can
aggressively compete with conifer seedlings in some postfire
communities.

Wildlife:  Species which consume large amounts of blackberries are often
benefited by fire [<a href="#45">45</a>].
