<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arctagrostis latifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Grizzly bears were observed grazing large quantities of vegetation
during June and July in northwest Canada.  Polargrass was selected over
other grasses [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Reindeer graze polargrass in the Northwest
Territories [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Polargrass may be palatable to grizzly bears [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Polargrass has high food value.  Crude protein content averaged 17.8
percent over 2 years of sampling in one study [<a href="#13">13</a>].  In another study of
several collections of polargrass, one accession contained 19.7 percent
crude protein, more than adequate amounts of all other elements tested
(P, K, Ph, Mg, Ca), and had 66 percent in vitro digestibility.
Elemental concentrations were good for the first harvest, but were often
lowest compared to other species for the second harvest [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Polargrass is suitable for revegetation programs on continental tundra
regions of northwest Canada and permafrost soils in subarctic boreal
forest habitats in Alaska [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].

`Kenai' and `Alyeska' are currently the only improved cultivars of
polargrass.  'Kenai' is recommended for revegetation mixes from lowlands
to alpine situations, but 'Alyeska' is a better choice for the
northernmost regions of Alaska.  'Kenai' does particularily well on
strongly acidic soils in areas with relatively cool, moist growing
seasons [<a href="#18">18</a>].  'Alyeska' had higher production than local collections of
polargrass planted on a simulated pipeline trench in the Northwest
Territories.  Production of unfertilized 'Alyeska' was equal to
fertilized local collections [<a href="#16">16</a>].

The Alaska State Plant Materials Center is currently evaluating
polargrass accessions for revegetating gravel till.  Initial plantings
were unsuccessful, so experiments were initiated for developing
techniques to improve water and nutrient conditions [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Polargrass
has naturally invaded and colonized abandoned oil well sites in Alaska
through tillering and seedling establishment [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].

The natural combustion of pyrite-bearing bituminous shale at the Smoking
Hills in the Yukon Territory has severely contaminated the atmosphere
and resulted in acid rain.  The soil and water have become acidic in the
area of deposition.  Polargrass was dominant in moderately polluted
areas, indicating potential for use in revegetation of areas with
man-caused acidification, such as near coal smelters [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Polargrass seeds are very small (2.3 million per pound [5 million/kg]),
resulting in poor seedling vigor.  Early growth rates are also slow,
making it a poor candidate for providing initial erosion control.
Polargrass is, however, very useful for long-term soil stabalization
[<a href="#23">23</a>].  Shallow sowing and low competition are required for successful
establishment [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Seeding rates of 5 pounds per acre (5.6 kg/ha) and
7 pounds per acre (7.8 kg/ha) are used for cultivars and local
collections, respectively [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Polargrass has several attributes that make it suitable for agronomic
use:  excellent forage yield potential, high level of winter hardiness,
rapid spring growth, and succulent herbage containing markedly less
dry-matter than timothy (Phleum pratense) and smooth brome (Bromus
inermis).  Once established polargrass excels in earliness and vigor of
spring growth [<a href="#13">13</a>].  It also shows a greater tolerance of winter ponding
and icing conditions than timothy or smooth brome and has demonstrated
immunity to snow molds (Sclerotinia borealis) which adversely affect
timothy.  Polargrass generally does not surpass smooth brome for forage
purposes in areas where smooth brome is well-adapted, but it does
provide a forage option in strongly acidic soils [<a href="#18">18</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arctagrostis latifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Polargrass is a perennial, native, sod-forming grass.  Culms range from
1 to 4 feet (0.3-1.2 m) tall.  Leaf blades are 1.6 to 11.8 inches (4-30
cm) long and 0.16 to 0.56 inch (4-14 mm) wide.  Plants have a narrow,
somewhat open panicle that is 2.8 to 11 inches (7-28 cm) long.  There is
one flower per spikelet, and spikelets range from 0.12 to 0.18 inch
(3-4.6 mm) long.  The species is variable, but the typical form seldom
exceeds 1.8 feet (0.5 m) in height and has purple spikelets 4 mm long or
longer [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Polargrass reproduces both sexually and vegetatively.  Tillers spread
slowly, arising from rhizomes and forming dense clumps [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Seeds are
produced in all but the most northern latitudes [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Polargrass grows in wet meadows, along rivers, on tundra, in freshwater
marshes, and in inland levees [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  It is best adapted to cold,
boggy soils and mesic upland soils [<a href="#18">18</a>].  In freshwater marshes
polargrass is more apparent on hummocks than in depressions [<a href="#9">9</a>].  The
inland levees are sandy and well-drained, and have a neutral pH.
Bluejoint-reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis) dominates in acidic, less
well-drained areas [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Along the Tanana River in Alaska, polargrass
stands are always underlain by permafrost with shallow active layers,
commonly 127 to 152 inches (50 to 60 cm) thick [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Common overstory dominants include Sitka alder (Alnus sitchensis), white
spruce (Picea glauca), black spruce (P. mariana), paper birch (Betula
papyrifera), and dwarf alpine birch (B. nana).  Understory associates
include Labrador tea (Ledum groenlandicum), mountain cranberry
(Vaccinium vitis-idaea), flowering dogwood (Cornus canadensis),
horsetail (Equisetum arvense), northern comandra (Geocaulon lividum),
bluejoint-reedgrass, rough fescue (Festuca altaica), tall fescue (F.
arundinacea), and crowberry (Empetrum nigrum).


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Polargrass codominates with other species in grassland tundra
communities.  Evidence suggests that it occurs in the early stages of
succession following fire [<a href="#2">2</a>].  In succession on river floodplains,
however, it is abundant only in late successional mixed white and black
spruce stands [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
In the Matanuska Valley of Alaska, new panicles of polargrass appear
between mid and late June.  Anthesis is relatively inconspicuous,
occurring from early July to past the middle of the month.  Seed is
mature between September 15 and 25 [<a href="#13">13</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Polargrass is top-killed by fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Polargrass has been listed as one of the most dramatic increasers
following tundra and forest fires [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Two years after a tundra
fire, annual plant production on burned areas was greater than unburned
controls as a result of the high production of polargrass and bluejoint
reedgrass.  They were only minor species in adjacent unburned areas [<a href="#3">3</a>].
Polargrass is found in the first stage of succession (1 to 20 years)
following fire in black spruce/bog blueberry (Vaccinium uliginosum)
stands in northern Alaska [<a href="#2">2</a>].
