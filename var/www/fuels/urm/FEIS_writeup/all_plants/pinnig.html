<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of European black pine is Pinus
nigra Arnold [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  The species is genetically diverse.  Numerous
subspecies, varieties, and forms have been named; there is much
controversy as to the correct interpretation of these infrataxa [<a href="#21">21</a>].
In general, there are three main groups of European black pine races
recognized:  (1) the western group from around Austria, France, and Spain
(Austrian and Pyrenees pines), (2) the central group (Corsican pine) from
Corsica, Italy, and Sicily, and (3) the eastern group (Crimean pine) from
the Balkans and the Crimea [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

Some natural hybrids with other European pines have been reported.
Artificial hybrids have also been created [<a href="#23">23</a>].

<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus nigra
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
European black pine is native to Europe and Asia.  Its range there
extends from Spain and Morocco east to eastern Turkey, south to Cypress,
and north to northeastern Austria and the Crimea, Russia.  In the United
States European black pine widely planted in northern states in New
England, around the Great Lakes, and in the Northwest.  It has
naturalized in New England and the Great Lakes States [<a href="#21">21</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
In Europe trees usually associated with European black pine include
Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris), Swiss mountain pine (P. mugo), Aleppo
pine (P. halepinsis), Italian stone pine (P. pinea), and Heldreich pine
(P. heldreichii).  In the United States where it has become naturalized,
European black pine may be developing natural associations [<a href="#21">21</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus nigra
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
The wood of European black pine is similar to that of Scotch pine and
red pine (Pinus resinosa), which is moderately hard and
straight-grained. European black pine wood, however, is rougher, softer,
and not as strong [<a href="#21">21</a>].

In the Mediterranean region European black pine wood is used for general
construction, fuel, and in other purposes [<a href="#21">21</a>].

In the United States European black pine is of little importance as a
timber species.  It is planted mainly for shelterbelts [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
In Wyoming mule deer that were forced onto a conifer tree nursery by
bad weather browsed European black pine in preference to ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa), blue spruce (Picea pungens), bristlecone pine (Pinus
aristata), and Rocky Mountain juniper (Juniperus scopulorum).  Damage
was concentrated on the lateral branch buds and needles [<a href="#9">9</a>].  


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
White-tailed deer showed intermediate preference for European black pine
as compared to other ornamental species (including yews [Taxus spp.],
other conifers, and various hardwoods) [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
European black pine is recommended for planting on strip-mined lands in
Pennsylvania [<a href="#10">10</a>].  It has probably not been widely used for
surface-mine plantings.  European black pine is similar to red pine in
climatic adaptation and growth performance on acid minesoils.  It is
recommended for use in Ohio on fine-clay, poorly drained minesoils with
a pH of 5 to 7, although suitable native pines are preferred [<a href="#22">22</a>].  In
Idaho it was reported as having good potential for revegetating sites
denuded by heavy metal pollution from smelter emissions [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
In the United States European black pine is mainly planted for
shelterbelts, as a street tree, and as an ornamental [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  It is
recommended for windbreaks in the Northern Great Plains on medium to
deep moist or upland soils [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Its value as a street tree is largely
due to its resistance to salt spray (used in road de-icing) and various
industrial pollutants, and its intermediate drought tolerance [<a href="#21">21</a>].  It
is resistant to snow and ice damage.  In Missouri European black pines
were undamaged by a sleet storm that caused widespread and extensive
damage to many other street trees [<a href="#4">4</a>].

One- to three-year-old European black pine seedlings were found to have
no symptoms of ozone damage after exposure to 0.020 ppm of ozone for
5-hour periods (treatment repeated over one growing season) [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Most of the European black pine planted in the United States is from
Austrian sources [<a href="#21">21</a>].

European black pine seedlings up to about 2 months of age are subject to
predation by voles and rabbits; older seedlings apparently become
unpalatable [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Insects and diseases:  European black pine seedlings are damaged by
damping off fungi and seedling root rots.  Mature trees are easily
infected by Dithostroma needle blight, the most damaging foliage disease
of European black pine.  Other diseases include Lophodermium needle
cast, which is damaging to European black pine in the Great Lakes States
[<a href="#21">21</a>].  European black pine is also moderately to highly susceptible to
infection by brown spot needle disease [<a href="#18">18</a>].  The dagger nematode
damages seedlings.  Insect damage to European black pine is generally of
less importance than damage by fungal pathogens [<a href="#21">21</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus nigra
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
European black pine is an introduced, medium-sized, two-needle pine [<a href="#7">7</a>].
Mature height (approximately 80 years of age [<a href="#21">21</a>]) ranges from 66 to 165
feet (20-50 m) [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Some characters vary depending on the subspecific
taxon; the type variety has dark brown to black bark that is widely
split by flaking fissures into scaly plates [<a href="#14">14</a>].  The bark becomes
increasingly creviced with age [<a href="#17">17</a>].  European black pine is
fast growing and usually has a pyramidal form.  It has deep lateral
roots.  European black pine is long lived; harvest rotation times of up
to 360 years have been used in Europe [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
European black pine attains sexual maturity at ages ranging from 15 to
40 years.  Trees from Corsican sources in England produce their first
heavy seed crops at 25 to 30 years of age, with maximum production at 60
to 90 years of age.  Large seed crops are produced at 2- to 5-year
intervals [<a href="#21">21</a>].  The winged seeds are wind dispersed [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Fresh seed
does not require stratification for good germination, but stored seeds
can be cold stratified for up to 60 days to hasten germination [<a href="#11">11</a>].

European black pine can be propagated by grafting [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
European black pine is mainly suited to northern temperate climate zones
in the United States; it does not grow well in the southern states [<a href="#21">21</a>].
Different provenances (seed sources by geographic area) or varieties are
adapted to different soil types:  Austrian and Pyrenees pines grow well
on a wide range of soil types, Corsican pine grows poorly on
limestone-derived soils, and Crimean pine grows well on poorer,
limestone-derived soils.  Most provenances will also show good growth on
podzolic soils.  Whatever the soil type, however, the soils need to be
deep for good growth [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  European black pine grows well on high pH
soils in New England.  Some provenances exhibit better winter hardiness
than others [<a href="#21">21</a>].

In Europe, European black pine is found at elevations ranging from 820
to 5,910 feet (250-1,800 m) [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

European black pine is intolerant of shade and needs to be planted in
full sun [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  In England direct sowing of European black pine seeds
is successful on north-facing slopes on young sand dunes [<a href="#21">21</a>].  European
black pine (Corsican pine) plantations in England develop a more closed
canopy than similar-aged plantations of Scotch pine [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
In Ontario European black pine pollen is released from May to June.
Individual ovulate cones are only receptive to pollen for approximately
3 days, but collectively are receptive from May to June.  Fertilization
takes place 13 months after pollination.  Cones mature from September to
November and seeds are dispersed from October to November [<a href="#21">21</a>].
