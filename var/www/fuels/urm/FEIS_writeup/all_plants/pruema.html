<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Bitter cherry occurs in a variety of habitats including mountain brush,
woodland, and riparian [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>].  

Bitter cherry occurs in seral brushfield communities throughout the
Pacific Northwest and western Idaho.  Common associates include Rocky
mountain maple (Acer glabrum), Scouler willow (Salix scouleriana),
chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), redstem ceanothus (Ceanothus
sanguineus), deerbrush (C. integerrimus), Saskatoon serviceberry
(Amelanchier alnifolia), thimbleberry (Rubus parviflorus), pachistima
(Pachistima myrsinites), and oceanspray (Holodiscus discolor)
[<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>].

In California bitter cherry occurs in yellow pine (Pinus spp.) woodlands
and giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) communities.  Common
associates include incense-cedar (Calocedrus decurrens), sugar pine
(Pinus lambertiana), Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia), Pacific dogwood
(Cornus nuttallii), California hazel (Corylus cornuta var. californica),
greenleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula), Parry manzanita (A.
manzanita), pinemat manzanita (A. nevadensis), and bush chinquapin
(Chrysolepsis sempervirens) [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>].

In northern Idaho and eastern Washington bitter cherry occurs in quaking
aspen (Populus tremuloides) communities with Sitka alder (Alnus viridis
ssp. sinuata), Douglas maple (Acer glabrum var. douglasii), blue
elderberry (Sambucus cerulea), russet buffaloberry (Shepherdia
canadensis), and red-osier dogwood (Cornus sericea) [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>].  

In Arizona bitter cherry is a member of interior deciduous riparian
forests dominated by sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), green ash
(Fraxinus pennsylvanica), Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii),
narrowleaf cottonwood (P. angustifolia), boxelder (Acer negundo), and
Arizona walnut (Juglans major) [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Prunus emarginata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Bitter cherry is a valuable forage species for mule deer, elk, and black
bear [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>].  In the Pacific Northwest and California bitter
cherry is highly preferred winter forage for Columbian black-tailed deer
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].  In the Southwest bitter cherry is browsed by deer and elk
[<a href="#62">62</a>].

Throughout its range, bitter cherry fruits are eaten by birds, rodents,
and small mammals [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>].  In Washington bitter cherry is eaten
by slugs [<a href="#15">15</a>].  In the Sierra Nevada bitter cherry is utilized by
mountain beaver [<a href="#7">7</a>].  

Bitter cherry is highly palatable to sheep [<a href="#36">36</a>].  It is a preferred
sheep food in Oregon [<a href="#74">74</a>].  Bitter cherry is also eaten by cattle [<a href="#91">91</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
In California crude protein content of bitter cherry browse was 13.3
percent in July and 9.7 percent in September [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Dense thickets of bitter cherry provide important cover for wildlife
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>].  In Idaho bitter cherry provides important escape cover and
roosting sites for Columbian sharp-tailed grouse [<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>].  


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Bitter cherry adapts well to disturbed or degraded sites
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>].  It is used for land reclamation and erosion control
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>].  Nursery-grown stock readily establishes on disturbed
sites and once established, bitter cherry is a good soil stabilizer
[<a href="#102">102</a>].

In California and Nevada bitter cherry is used for rehabilitating acid
mine spoils [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  At the Leviathan Mine in California, planted
bitter cherry had a 90 percent survival rate on sites not seeded with
grasses after 1 year.  By the second year, grasses had established and
bitter cherry survival dropped to 60 percent of the original planting
[<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Indians of British Columbia and Washington used bitter cherry
medicinally and for making tools.  Fruits were used as laxatives, and
the roots and inner bark were boiled and ingested to prevent heart
trouble.  The bark of bitter cherry peels off in long fibrous strips
which were used to make baskets and other implements [<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>].

Bitter cherry is planted as an ornamental.  Cultivated plants are
usually Prunus emarginata var. mollis [<a href="#120">120</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Overbrowsing by deer decreases bitter cherry cover [<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>].  When used
to enhance wildlife habitat, bitter cherry benefits from protection from
foraging animals for at least 3 years after planting [<a href="#28">28</a>].

In the Pacific Northwest and California, brushfield communities are
sometimes eliminated for the benefit of conifer establishment.  Many
herbicide and mechanical treatments will control or kill bitter cherry
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>].

Bitter cherry should be propagated from seed for best results but will
also establish if propagated from softwood stem or root cuttings.
Bitter cherry should be planted in the fall or late winter to early
spring as bare root, balled, or burlapped specimens [<a href="#120">120</a>].

Numerous insect pests and diseases are associated with cherry (Prunus
spp.).  Insect pests include aphids, borers, and tent caterpillars.
Bitter cherry is susceptible to trunk and root rot fungi [<a href="#120">120</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Prunus emarginata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bitter cherry is a native, deciduous, small tree or shrub with spreading
to ascending branches [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>].  It often forms dense thickets
[<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>].  It generally persists as a medium to tall shrub, 3.3 to 20
feet (1-6 m) in height [<a href="#120">120</a>].  With abundant moisture and deep fertile
soil, bitter cherry may reach tree height:  up to 50 feet (15 m) in some
areas [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>].

The leaves are 0.8 to 2 inches (2-5 cm) long and 0.4 to 1.4 inches
(1-3.5 cm) wide [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>].  The drupelike, ovoid fruit is 0.24 to 0.56
inch (6-14 mm) in diameter [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>] and is one-seeded [<a href="#120">120</a>].  Roots may
spread up to 50 feet (15 m) from the parent plant, sending up
adventitious shoots along their length.  Bitter cherry has no taproot
[<a href="#120">120</a>].

Longevity of bitter cherry has not been fully determined.  According to
Kramer [<a href="#57">57</a>] and Mueggler [<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>] it is relatively short-lived (30-40
years).  Taylor and Taylor [<a href="#120">120</a>] described one plant 42 years old.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Bitter cherry reproduces by seed [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>].  It is pollinated by
insects and dispersed by birds and mammals [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>].  Seed can
remain viable in soil and duff for many years [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>] and can be
stored under dry conditions for up to 1 year [<a href="#120">120</a>].  It is surrounded by
a stony endocarp which may offer some resistance to germination but is
permeable to moisture.  Bitter cherry has embryo dormancy; an
afterripening period in the presence of oxygen and moisture is necessary
for adequate germination [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>].  Cold stratification at 41 degrees
Fahrenheit (5 deg C) for 90 to 160 days increases germination [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>].

Kramer [<a href="#57">57</a>] studied seedbank composition in closed-canopy forested sites
in central Idaho.  Bitter cherry seed was found in soil samples taken at
depths of up to 4 inches (10 cm); overall seed viability was 27 percent.

Bitter cherry reproduces vegetatively by root crown and root sprouts
[<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bitter cherry is most often found in cool, moist foothill, montane, or
canyon habitats throughout its range [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>].  It grows best
on moist soils with good drainage [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>], but also grows in
semishaded areas and on dry, exposed hillsides [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>].  Bitter cherry
grows best on loam and sandy loam soils but occurs on gravelly
substrates as well [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>].

Elevations for bitter cherry are as follows:

British Columbia          4,025           1,220     [<a href="#120">120</a>]


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Bitter cherry is a generally shade intolerant species of sparse woods,
riparian sites, and open areas where there is often evidence of past
disturbance [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>].  Bitter cherry is seral following
clearcutting, broadcast burning, and cattle grazing [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>]; plants
decline in vigor and numbers as the forest canopy closes
[<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>].  In northwest Washington bitter cherry occurs in
second-growth forests that are 50 to 80 years old [<a href="#100">100</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Bitter cherry flowering dates are as follows:

Arizona              April-June     [<a href="#50">50</a>]
California           April-May      [<a href="#19">19</a>]
Idaho                early May      [<a href="#99">99</a>]
British Columbia     April-June     [<a href="#120">120</a>]

Bitter cherry fruit ripening occurs from July to September and seed
dispersal is from August through September [<a href="#37">37</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Bitter cherry sprouts vigorously following fire [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>].
Approximately 15 to 50 sprouts per plant were produced after a
prescribed fire in northern Idaho [<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].  Postfire regeneration also
includes germination from on-site seed [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>], and probably also
from off-site seed dispersed by birds and mammals.  Prefire canopy
coverage is attained about 30 to 40 years following fire [<a href="#97">97</a>].

In ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of eastern Washington and
the northern Rocky Mountains, where bitter cherry occurs, fire return
intervals of 6 to 22 years [<a href="#131">131</a>] and 6 to 11 years (range of 2-20 years)
[<a href="#4">4</a>] have been described.  In western Montana at the Burdette Creek
winter range, Losensky [<a href="#75">75</a>] describes mean fire-free intervals of 37
years.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Bitter cherry is top-killed or killed by severe fires [<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>].
High-severity fires favor bitter cherry [<a href="#89">89</a>].  Young [<a href="#135">135</a>] stated that
bitter cherry is "unharmed to enhanced" by fire.  However, bitter cherry
mortality can be high when burning occurs while plants are actively
growing.  Approximately 14 percent of 36 mature bitter cherry died after
a single spring (late March/early April) prescribed fire on a seral
brushfield in northern Idaho [<a href="#73">73</a>].  Repeated spring burning of similar
sites at 5-year intervals resulted in heavy bitter cherry mortality
[<a href="#70">70</a>].  Seven plants sprouted following a fire in late March 1965.  Of
these, four resprouted after a second fire in May 1970, and two remained
alive after a third fire in May 1975.  Total mortality by 1976 was 86
percent.  Leege [<a href="#70">70</a>] suggested that the tendency toward fire-induced
mortality in bitter cherry was probably accentuated by the advanced
phenologies of plants during the second and third fires.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Bitter cherry sprouts from the root crown following fire [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>].
Since root sprouting has been documented in bitter cherry [<a href="#28">28</a>] it
probably also sprouts from roots after fire.  It establishes from buried
seed or seed dispersed onto burned sites [<a href="#114">114</a>].  Several studies have
reported rapid recovery and substantial postfire increases in bitter
cherry densities [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>].  In an Oregon coastal brushfield, bitter
cherry sprouted from roots 4 months after fire [<a href="#138">138</a>].  In an Oregon red
alder (Alnus rubra)-dominated brushfield burned on August 9, 1974, bitter
cherry started sprouting within 2 to 3 weeks.  By November, bitter
cherry was sprouting vigorously and stems were 3.3 feet (1 m) tall
[<a href="#106">106</a>].

In Montana a prescribed fire occurred on April 13, 1988.  Plots were
observed from mid-July to mid-September.  Bitter cherry sprout twig
weights on burned plots exceeded twig weights on unburned plots by a
factor of 4 on southwest-facing forested types and by a factor of 9 on a
southeast-facing forested type [<a href="#76">76</a>].

In northern Idaho more bitter cherry sprouts are produced per surviving
plant after spring fires than fall fires; however, sprout height is
usually greater after fall fires.  Bitter cherry recovery trends 1 year
after a prescribed fire in seral brushfields in northern Idaho are
presented below [<a href="#73">73</a>]:

A seral brushfield in northern Idaho was prescribed burned in 1965,
1970, and 1975.  Bitter cherry sprouted from the root crown and a few
seedlings were observed.  The average prefire crown height and diameter
were 8.4 feet and 1.6 feet, respectively.  Bitter cherry recovery trends
2 years after the prescribed fires are presented below [<a href="#70">70</a>]:

Idaho studies investigating postfire successional patterns in a western
redcedar (Thuja plicata)/queencup beadlily (Clintonia uniflora) habitat
type found that bitter cherry regenerated predominantly from seedbanks.
Seedling establishment was affected by fire severity.  Bitter cherry
seedlings had greatest percent cover on low-severity burns in postfire
years 1 to 3; in postfire years 4 and 5, bitter cherry seedling percent
cover was greatest on high-severity burns [<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>].

A seral brushfield in northern Idaho was prescribed burned on May 2,
1966; all aboveground vegetation was "totally consumed".  In May 1967,
257 bitter cherry seedlings were observed.  By May 1968, 14 bitter
cherry seedlings remained [<a href="#69">69</a>].  In northeastern Idaho, on a May 14,
1975 prescribed burn, seven bitter cherry seedlings were observed in
postfire year 2.  By postfire year 4, four seedlings remained [<a href="#71">71</a>].  In
Oregon a Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziezii) clearcut was prescribed
burned in late fall.  Bitter cherry seedlings were present postfire year
1 on the burned site but were not present in adjacent virgin forest
[<a href="#33">33</a>].

In Oregon 240 acres (96 ha) of a Douglas-fir watershed was harvested
over a 4-year period from the fall of 1962 to the summer of 1966.  It
was broadcast burned in October 1966.  Bitter cherry reached peak
abundance about 10 years after fire [<a href="#39">39</a>].  In north-central Idaho in a
grand fir (Abies grandis)/pachistima habitat type, 36 stands
representing 1, 3, 8, 12, and 23 year age classes and 7 near-climax
stands were clearcut and broadcast burned.  Canopy cover and height of
bitter cherry for each age class were as follows [<a href="#136">136</a>]:

                     canopy cover                 height

In the western Cascades bitter cherry was absent from undisturbed
old-growth Douglas-fir stands, but was abundant on Douglas-fir
plantations that were clearcut and broadcast burned 2 to 40 years ago.
Shrub dominance decreases at 20 to 30 years with canopy closure [<a href="#108">108</a>].  


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Bitter cherry is a member of the seral brush community in northern
Idaho.  These brushfields provide excellent habitat for elk.  Bitter
cherry is one of the dominant shrubs after fire, but grows out of reach
of browsing animals within several years.  If brushfields are not
maintained by fire, coniferous forest may eventually establish and large
ungulate habitat will be lost [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>].  Bitter cherry was found
to have greater frequency and crown cover on single broadcast burned
sites than on unburned and piled-and-burned sites [<a href="#92">92</a>].
