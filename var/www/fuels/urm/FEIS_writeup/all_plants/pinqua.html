<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of Parry pinyon is Pinus
quadrifolia Parl. [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  It is a member of the subgenus Haploxylon,
subsection Cembroides [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Lanner [<a href="#15">15</a>] reduced Parry pinyon to
hybrid status, (P. x quadrifolia Parl.), based upon studies of needle
number, resin canal number, twig hairiness, and stomate position.  He
concluded that Parry pinyon is the result of hybridization between
singleleaf pinyon (Pinus monophylla) and a heretofore unrecognized
5-needle pinyon now named Sierra Juarez pinyon (Pinus juarezensis).
There are divergent opinions among botanists and taxonomists regarding
these conclusions.  Perry [<a href="#26">26</a>] recognizes Parry pinyon as a separate
species pending further studies.  This paper will follow Perry's
taxonomy.   Parry pinyon hybridizes with P. monophylla and P.
juarzensis.  Lanner [<a href="#15">15</a>] also suggests that Parry pinyon crosses with P.
edulis and P. cembroides.  There are no recognized varieties, 
subspecies, or forms of Parry pinyon.

<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus quadrifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Parry pinyon is the most widespread coniferous tree in northern Baja
California [<a href="#21">21</a>].  It is mainly a Mexican species, growing in the Sierra
de Juarez and Sierra San Pedro Martir.  In the United States, Parry
pinyon occurs in California.  Several stands of Parry pinyon grow in
southeastern San Diego County, and in the southwest corner of Imperial
County, close to the Mexican border.  A small population of Parry pinyon
grows in south-central Riverside County, 30 miles (50 km) from the main
distribution [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Ranges of singleleaf pinyon and Parry pinyon overlap
in southwestern California and northern Baja California [<a href="#7">7</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Parry pinyon is a dominant member of the pinyon-juniper woodland of
southern California and northern Baja California.  California juniper
(Juniperus californica) commonly codominates with Parry pinyon [<a href="#11">11</a>]. In
the mountains of northern Baja California, Parry pinyon is associated
with pine-oak (Pinus-Quercus spp.) woodlands and typical California
chaparral [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  On the western flank of the interior Sierra de
Juarez, Parry pinyon forms scattered groves within relatively dense
chaparral of chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum) and red shank (A.
sparsifolium).  Along the crest and eastern rim of the Sierra de Juarez
it forms continuous forests with desert chaparral species such as
peninsular manzanita (Arctostaphylos peninsularis) [<a href="#21">21</a>].

A classifications listing Parry pinyon as a dominant species is:
           
Woodland classification: the pinyon-juniper formation [<a href="#11">11</a>].   
      
Common plant associates not previously mentioned include Coulter pine
(Pinus coulteri), Jeffrey pine (P. jeffreyi), and interior live oak (Q.
wislizeni) [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus quadrifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Parry pinyon wood is close-grained, soft, and knotty [<a href="#26">26</a>].  It has
little commercial value because of the tree's small size and poor growth
form.  It is used mainly for firewood and fenceposts [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].
  


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Parry pinyon seeds are an important food source for many species of
birds and small mammals [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Pinyon-juniper woodlands provide food
and shelter for deer, pronghorn, wild horses, and other species of
mammals and birds.  These woodlands have been extensively grazed by
livestock for more than 100 years [<a href="#20">20</a>].    


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The nutritional composition of Parry pinyon seeds are as follows:
protein, 11 percent; fat, 37 percent; carbohydrate, 44 percent [<a href="#37">37</a>].  


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Parry pinyon provides cover for many species of birds [<a href="#1">1</a>].



<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Parry pinyon produces a large, edible seed that is a staple food for
southwestern Native Americans [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].   


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
When pinyon-juniper woodlands are harvested, reestablishment of conifers
can be hastened by avoiding damage to the residual stand of small trees
and seedlings and by providing a shading cover of slash over small
seedlings exposed to full sunlight [<a href="#20">20</a>].  

Insect defoliators that attack Parry pinyon include the larvae of gall
midges, caterpillars of pine cone moths, larvae of small weevils, and
pinyon cone beetles.  All of these insects attack cones or seeds
[<a href="#18">18</a>].  The pinyon Ips (Ips confusus) is endemic throughout pinyon range.
Adults and larvae of this bark beetle feed on the phloem of pines
[<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  Removal or burning of all pinyon slash larger than 3 inches (8
cm) in diameter after harvest will usually prevent pinyon Ips
populations from reaching epidemic proportions [<a href="#20">20</a>].    

Pinyon dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium divaricatum) causes reduced vigor
and occasional dieback in Parry pinyon.  It rarely causes death [<a href="#20">20</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus quadrifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Parry pinyon is a long-lived, slow-growing, native tree that grows from
16.5 to 33 feet (5-10 m) tall [<a href="#26">26</a>].  According to Keeley [<a href="#12">12</a>], pinyons
often live 200 to 500 years.  The branches of Parry pinyon are stiff,
low, and spreading, giving younger trees the appearance of a pyramid.
Older trees develop a more rounded, irregular crown.  The bark is thin
and smooth on young trees, becoming deeply furrowed and scaly with age.
Needles usually occur in bundles of four, but bundles of three and
sometimes five are found on the same tree [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Conelets are borne
singly or in clusters of two to four.  Cones are 1.2 to 2 inches (3-5
cm) long, with thick cone scales [<a href="#26">26</a>].  

Growth of pinyons is dependent upon soil moisture stored from winter
snows.  Pinyons have vertical taproots as well as lateral roots; both are
capable of active absorption.  In shallow soils, lateral root systems
extend well beyond the radius of the crown [<a href="#36">36</a>].
 


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Minimum seed-bearing age for Parry pinyon is 10 to 20 years of age.
Optimum seed production occurs after 50 years of age.  Good seed crops
are produced every 1 to 5 years [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  Cones produce relatively few,
large, wingless, edible seeds that are well-adapted to dispersal by
birds, rodents and other mammals [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  Birds can disperse pinyon
seeds 12 miles (20 km) or more [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Birds and rodents cache pinyon
seeds in the ground, often at depths favorable for germination [<a href="#20">20</a>].
Fresh pinyon seeds have high viability and germinate readily with little
or no stratification.  They lose viability rapidly after 1 year.  Seeds
usually germinate in the spring if soil moisture is sufficient.
Seedlings need some shade to survive [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].   

Although the pinyon pines are tolerant of temperature and moisture
stress, water is the most limiting factor in seedling establishment and
growth [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  

Parry pinyon does not reproduce vegetatively [<a href="#12">12</a>].    


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Parry pinyon occurs on rocky slopes with thin soils that are typically
well-drained [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  Parry pinyon grows at elevations of 3,960 to 8,250
feet (1,200-2,500 m) throughout its range and is rarely found at
elevations over 8,910 feet (2,700 m) [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Climax Species

The pinyon pines are shade-intolerant as adults but require some shelter
from shrubs or tree crowns to establish [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Pinyons can invade
surrounding grassland communities [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Parry pinyon flowers in June. Cones ripen in September and seed
dispersal begins in September and October [<a href="#13">13</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus quadrifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Parry pinyon has low resistance to fire.  Like other pinyons, it has
thin bark, low branches, and no resprouting capability [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Fuel loads
in pinyon habitats are discontinuous and light, which lowers fire
frequency and severity [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Seed dispersal by birds may enable pinyon
pines to colonize burns even when parent trees are not nearby.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tree without adventitious-bud root crown
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus quadrifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire eliminates younger age classes of pinyon pines, but large
seed-source trees may survive [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Where pinyon trees have recently
invaded sagebrush-grassland communities, young trees less than 4 feet
(1.2 m) tall are easily killed by fire.  As tree dominance increases,
understory is gradually suppressed.  Understory fuels also decrease, and
the potential for severe, stand-replacing fire is reduced [<a href="#35">35</a>].  



<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Literature concerning the response of Parry pinyon is lacking.  See the
FEIS species monograph on singleleaf pinyon and true pinyon (P. edulis)
for description of general pinyon response to fire.
