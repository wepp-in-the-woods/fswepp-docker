<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of Wheeler sotol is Dasylirion
wheeleri S. Wats. [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  There are two recognized varieties [<a href="#21">21</a>]:

     Dasylirion wheeleri var. wheeleri
     Dasylirion wheeleri var. wislizenii Trel.

Laferriere [<a href="#10">10</a>] has suggested that Dasylirion durangense be considered a
variety of D. wheeleri.  However, this variety is not yet widely
recognized.

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
The sugary trunks and leaf bases of Wheeler sotol have been used to feed
cattle during droughts [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Ranchers also burn the leaves and split
the short, round flower heads of Wheeler sotol for cattle feed [<a href="#21">21</a>].

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Wheeler sotol has a variety of uses [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  The Indians and Mexicans
prepared an alcoholic drink known as sotol by roasting the flower head
in a pit for 24 hours and then distilling the expressed juice.  The
leaves are used to make mats, baskets, ropes, thatch, and paper
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>]. The broad spoonlike leafbase is often used in dried floral
arrangements [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Wheeler sotol is also grown as an ornamental [<a href="#21">21</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Dasylirion wheeleri
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Wheeler sotol is a large, native, desert leaf succulent shrub [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].
The slender leaves are basally clumped. The leaves are 0.8 to 1.6 inches
(2-4 cm) wide at the base and have prickles on the margins [<a href="#24">24</a>].  The
trunk may be up to 3 feet (0.91 m) high, and is either partially buried
or above ground [<a href="#21">21</a>].  The flowers are on a long terminal panicle 6 to
17 feet (1.8-5.2 m) high; those on the staminate plants are composed of
dense catkinlike spikes [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].  Information on the longevity and root
system of Wheeler sotol is not available in the literature.  However,
Cannon [<a href="#26">26</a>] describes a similar species (Dasylirion texanum) as having a
large number of roots, each about 0.2 inch (0.5 cm) in diameter, formed
at the base of the stem.  The roots run downward at an acute angle and
also extend out into the soil in a more or less horizontal direction.
The roots are coarse and are found between 5.9 to 14.1 inches (15-36 cm)
below the surface.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction - Wheeler sotol plants are dioecious.  They produce
thousands of tiny flowers in a long narrow cluster [<a href="#11">11</a>].  The seed is
contained in a one-celled, three-winged capsule [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Wheeler sotol is
cold tolerant and will easily grow from seed [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].

Vegetative reproduction - Wheeler sotol can reproduce vegetatively by
sprouting from a thick, woody, mostly subterranean caudex [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Wheeler sotol grows on hillsides and slopes in chaparral, desert and
semidesert grasslands and southwestern oak (Quercus) woodland
communities at 3,000 to 5,000 feet (914-1,524 m) in elevation [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].
Subsurface water is generally not available.  The soil is shallow, rocky,
or gravelly with good drainage [<a href="#24">24</a>].  In Trans-Pacos, Texas, Wheeler
sotol is commonly found growing on limestone and granite [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Wheeler sotol is commonly found associated with turpentine bush
(Haplopappus laricifolius), sacahuista (Nolina microcarpa), scrub oak
(Quercus turbinella), Arizona oak (Q. arizonicus), hollyleaf oak (Q.
wilcoxii), desert ceanothus (Ceanothus greggii), true mountain-mahogany
(Cercocarpus montanus), banana yucca (Yucca baccata), grama (Bouteloua
spp.), feather grass (Andropogon saccharoides), silver feather grass
(Muhlenbergia emersleyi), deer grass (M. rigens), and manzanita
(Arctostaphylos spp.)  [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Wheeler sotol occurs in seral, climax, and postclimax communities.  In
the desert plains grasslands it is often subdominate in the
beargrass-scrub oak postclimax community and the curly mesquite (Hilaria
belangeri)-blue grama climax community [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Wheeler sotol generally flowers in spring or early summer [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  In
the Chihuahuan Desert, New Mexico, initiation of flower buds began in
mid- to late May.  Flowering occurred in June and July, and fruits were
mature by August [<a href="#8">8</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Dasylirion wheeleri
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Wheeler sotol is moderately sensitive to fire [<a href="#22">22</a>].  It occurs in desert
communities that are subject to naturally occurring fire [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Wheeler
sotol is a survivor species capable of sprouting from an aboveground
caudex when burnt [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Caudex, growing points in soil

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Dasylirion wheeleri
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
The ability of Wheeler sotol to survive fire is dependent upon the
frequency and intensity of fire.  Severe fires can greatly reduce
Wheeler sotol.  On burnt sites in the desert grasslands of Arizona,
White [<a href="#22">22</a>] reported that all of the moderately or lightly fire damaged
plants survived the fire while only 3 percent of the severely damaged
plants survived.  Eleven and a half months after a fire in a semidesert
grassland near the Sierrita Mountains, Arizona, mortality of Wheeler
sotol was 47 percent on burnt sites and 0 percent on the control site
[<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Wheeler sotol populations may suffer high mortality after a severe fire.
However, if the plant survives, it may sprout from a short aboveground
caudex [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  After a semidesert grassland fire in southern Arizona,
the 71 Wheeler sotol plants that survived had apical regrowth.  No
seedlings were found even after 11 postfire months [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Wheeler sotol occurs in desert grasslands which are being increasingly
managed by using fire [<a href="#19">19</a>].  In these areas, fire is primarily used to
reverse dense scrub invasion and stimulate grass production.  Control of
Wheeler sotol would vary with the conditions and type of burn [<a href="#22">22</a>].
