<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arctostaphylos nevadensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Black bear, black-tailed deer, coyote, and various birds and rodents eat
pinemat manzanita fruits [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Black-tailed deer browse seedlings
for the first 3 years following fire.  Foliage of older plants is rarely
consumed by wildlife or livestock [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Mature pinemat manzanita browse is unpalatable to all classes of
livestock and wildlife [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Pinemat manzanita is recommended for stabilizing soils on steep slopes
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].  Plants are started from stem cuttings.  Containerized pinemat
manzanita planted to prevent erosion of soil into Lake Tahoe, California
showed 63 percent survival after 12 years when planted in spring.
Survival of fall-planted pinemat manzanita was 23 percent at year 12
[<a href="#33">33</a>].

If soil excavations are shallow, pinemat manzanita recovers rapidly from
log skidding damage via adventitious rooting and stem growth [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Pinemat manzanita is used for ornamental landscaping [<a href="#11">11</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arctostaphylos nevadensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Pinemat manzanita is a native, spreading to prostrate, evergreen
sclerophyllous shrub from 1 to 2 feet (0.3-0.6 m) in height.  It is
much-branched, with branchlets becoming viscid with age.  It typically
lacks a lignotuber (see Taxonomy).  The bark is thin and freely
exfoliating.  A description of its root system was not found in the
literature.  The fruit is a berrylike drupe containing several nutlets
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Vegetative:  Pinemat manzanita roots adventitiously where stems contact
soil [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Plants buried under tephra following the 1980 eruption of
Mount St. Helens produced 5 to 10 adventitious roots per centimeter of
stem during the next growing season [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Manzanita species such as
pinemat manzanita that lack a lignotuber generally do not sprout after
aboveground portions of the plant are damaged [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].

Sexual:  Little is known about pinemat manzanita sexual regeneration
except that it establishes from soil-stored seed in large numbers
following fire [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Seedling recruitment at other times is not
documented in the literature.

Manzanita species seeds are disseminated by frugivorous birds and
mammals [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Pinemat manzanita is an indicator of cold, dry sites [<a href="#23">23</a>].  It occurs in
a modified maritime climate:  winters are wet, but high pressure systems
in summer result in clear, dry weather [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Precipitation may be rain
or snow, depending upon elevation.  Pinemat manzanita occurs from 2,000
to 10,000 feet (610-3,049 m) in elevation, and is most common above
5,000 feet (1,524 m) [<a href="#25">25</a>].  The typical growing season is therefore
short; snowpack often does not melt until July [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

Soils supporting pinemat manzanita are typically shallow, infertile, and
poorly developed [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Textures vary from sand to loam and often contain
coarse fragments [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  Pinemat manzanita tolerates serpentine
soils but is not restricted to them [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].




<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Pinemat manzanita colonizes disturbed sites [<a href="#17">17</a>].  It grows well in open
plant communities where light levels are high, and persists until late
seres.  It does not tolerate the low light levels of closed canopy
forests.  McNeil and Zobel [<a href="#22">22</a>] reported that pinemat manzanita in the
understory of a white fir (Abies concolor) forest of Crater Lake
National Park, Oregon, died where the canopy had closed.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Pinemat manzanita phenological development in the Cascade Range of
central Oregon is as follows [<a href="#29">29</a>]:

growth begins:  late May
flowering:  late May to mid-June
fruit develops:  mid-June to early July
fruit sets:  mid-July to late September

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire kills pinemat manzanita [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Pinemat manzanita establishes from seed during the first postfire
growing season [<a href="#17">17</a>].  It may be an obligate seeder, requiring fire
and/or charred wood lechate to break seed dormancy.  The seed, however,
has not been tested under laboratory or other conditions for such
fire-stimulated germination responses.

Data on postfire density, frequency, or growth rates of pinemat
manzanita seedlings are not available.
