GENERAL DISTRIBUTION:</a>

<br />


The native range of cheatgrass encompasses much of Europe, the northern rim of 
Africa, and southwestern Asia [<a href="#246">246</a>,<a href="#319">319</a>]. Cheatgrass can now be found throughout 
most of Europe to southern Russia and western Asia. It has also been introduced 
to North America, temperate South America, Japan, South Africa, Australia, New 
Zealand, and Iceland [<a href="#319">319</a>,<a href="#437">437</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>].

<p> The introduction of cheatgrass to North America 
probably occurred independently, several times, via ship ballast, contaminated 
crop seed, packing material and at least 1 deliberate introduction for a college experiment in Pullman, Washington, in 1898
[<a href="#319">319</a>,<a href="#437">437</a>].
By the early 1860s, cheatgrass had been identified in the U.S. in New York and Pennsylvania
[<a href="#235">235</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>], and by the early 1900s,
cheatgrass was present in much of its current range, though it
was sparsely distributed [<a href="#261">261</a>,<a href="#469">469</a>]. Early infestations were commonly found near wheat
(<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) cropland and railroads [<a href="#306">306</a>]. Once
introduced, cheatgrass spread into adjacent rangeland in areas where it was
adapted to local environmental conditions.&nbsp;Its expansion was especially rapid in parts of the 
Intermountain
West, where its introduction followed a period of excessive livestock grazing in
an ecosystem comprised of native
plants that apparently did not evolve with heavy grazing pressure [<a href="#261">261</a>,<a href="#306">306</a>].</p>

<p>Cheatgrass now occurs throughout most of the U.S., Canada, Greenland, and northern Mexico
[<a href="#306">306</a>]. It has been found in
all Canadian provinces, and its range extends into Alaska and Yukon. In the eastern U.S.
cheatgrass is
mainly a roadside weed [<a href="#437">437</a>]. It is a &quot;common invader&quot; in the northern Great 
Plains [<a href="#322">322</a>]. Cheatgrass is most prominent and invasive in the Intermountain 
West, west from the Rockies to the Cascades and Sierra Nevada and north from central 
Utah, Nevada, and northeastern California to Canada. It is especially invasive 
in  sagebrush (<i>Artemisia</i> spp.) steppe and  bunchgrass regions in the Great Basin, 
Columbia Basin, and Snake River Plains in Nevada, Utah, Washington, Oregon, and 
Idaho [<a href="#306">306</a>,<a href="#437">437</a>,<a href="#460">460</a>]. The number 
and size of infestations in
these regions has increased dramatically over the
last 20 years [<a href="#306">306</a>]. 
<a href="http://plants.usda.gov/">Plants Database</a> 
provides a distributional map of cheatgrass in the United States and Canada.</p>

<p>The following table presents acres of BLM-administered rangelands either
infested or at risk of infestation by cheatgrass in a 5-state area as of 1992
(adapted from [<a href="#335">335</a>]):</p>

<font size="2">*Percent values refer to the estimated  composition of cheatgrass by weight in the plant community</font>

<p>The National Science and Technology Center mapped about 31.5 million acres 
(12.7 million ha) of
cheatgrass in the Great Basin from 2000 satellite imagery, about 6.7 million 
acres (2.7 million ha)
of which was in &quot;non-vegetative&quot; areas (i.e. agriculture, urban, water
and barren) [<a href="#282">282</a>].</p>

<p>Specific information on the plant communities in which cheatgrass may be 
found is limited outside its primary area of occurrence, where it is found 
mostly on abandoned cropland, roadsides, and &quot;waste places.&quot; The following lists 
reflect ecosystems and cover types in which cheatgrass is most common
and invasive, and are not
necessarily exhaustive or definitive.</p>

Cheatgrass is most widespread in  sagebrush steppe communities of the 
Intermountain West [<a href="#492">492</a>]. Daubenmire [<a href="#405">405</a>] considered cheatgrass a naturalized part of the vegetation in 
these communities as early as 1942. Many of the ecosystems that cheatgrass has invaded  are seriously altered, 
and no longer support the vegetation of the
potential natural community.&nbsp;Cheatgrass can maintain dominance for many years on
sites where native vegetation has been eliminated or severely reduced by
grazing, cultivation, or fire (e.g. [<a href="#96">96</a>]) (also see 
<a href="botanical_and_ecological_characteristics.html#SUCCESSIONAL STATUS">Successional Status</a>). 
The concept of potential natural communities based only on native species is 
seriously challenged by cheatgrass. Where cheatgrass is highly adapted, it might 
have to be recognized as a component of&nbsp; the potential plant community [<a href="#167">167</a>]. In these 
situations, cheatgrass may remain the de facto climax dominant, regardless of 
site potential. The following discussion focuses primarily on component species 
of potential natural communities that cheatgrass has invaded, from low-elevation 
salt-desert shrub communities in the southern Great Basin [<a href="#254">254</a>,<a href="#453">453</a>,<a href="#496">496</a>] into 
higher-elevation juniper (<i>Juniperus</i> spp.), pinyon-juniper (<i>Pinus-Juniperus</i> 
spp.), pine woodlands, and  the 
coniferous forest zone of the Rocky Mountains [<a href="#210">210</a>,<a href="#306">306</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>].

<p>According to Stewart and Hull [<a href="#405">405</a>] in 1949
and Beatley [<a href="#37">37</a>] in 1966, only a few
cheatgrass plants were found in black greasewood-shadscale (<i>Sarcobatus vermiculatus-Atriplex confertifolia</i>) and 
salt-desert shrub associations. Today, cheatgrass is common in
these communities [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#181">181</a>,<a href="#214">214</a>,<a href="#254">254</a>,<a href="#453">453</a>,<a href="#456">456</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>,<a href="#491">491</a>,<a href="#496">496</a>], especially in wet years [<a href="#29">29</a>]. Associated species may 
include budsage (<i>Artemisia spinescens</i>), 
bottlebrush squirreltail (<i>Elymus
elymoides</i>), Sandberg bluegrass (<i>Poa secunda</i>), and Indian ricegrass (<i>Achnatherum 
hymenoides</i>) [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].&nbsp;Cheatgrass also occurs with blackbrush (<i>Coleogyne ramosissima</i>) [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>], 
galleta (<i>Pleuraphis jamesii</i>) 
[<a href="#456">456</a>], and many other  salt-desert species.</p>

<p>In the Intermountain West, and most specifically the sagebrush steppe and  
bunchgrass zones, cheatgrass occurs in and often dominates  large acreages of rangeland where
native dominants include big sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i>), bluebunch
wheatgrass (<i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i>) [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>,<a href="#181">181</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#197">197</a>,<a href="#202">202</a>,<a href="#203">203</a>,<a href="#204">204</a>,<a href="#276">276</a>,<a href="#308">308</a>,<a href="#363">363</a>,<a href="#380">380</a>,<a href="#418">418</a>,<a href="#434">434</a>,<a href="#472">472</a>], Thurber
needlegrass (<i>Achnatherum thurberianum</i>)
[<a href="#472">472</a>], needle-and-thread grass (<i>Hesperostipa comata</i>) [<a href="#276">276</a>,<a href="#472">472</a>], western
wheatgrass (<i>Pascopyrum smithii</i>) [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#181">181</a>,<a href="#418">418</a>], basin wildrye (<i>Elymus cinereus</i>)
[<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#472">472</a>], Idaho fescue (<i>Festuca idahoensis</i>),
rough fescue (<i>F. altaica</i>), bottlebrush squirreltail, low sagebrush (<i>Artemisia</i> <i>arbuscula</i>) 
[<a href="#159">159</a>,<a href="#193">193</a>,<a href="#197">197</a>,<a href="#202">202</a>,<a href="#203">203</a>,<a href="#204">204</a>,<a href="#276">276</a>,<a href="#308">308</a>,<a href="#363">363</a>,<a href="#416">416</a>,<a href="#429">429</a>], spiny hopsage (<i>Grayia spinosa</i>), and rabbitbrush (<i>Chrysothamnus</i> 
spp.) [<a href="#53">53</a>].&nbsp;Cheatgrass often co-occurs with 
Sandberg bluegrass and/or bottlebrush squirreltail, and on some Nevada sites has 
replaced Indian ricegrass or blue grama (<i>Bouteloua 
gracilis</i>)  [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>]. By 1932 cheatgrass had replaced big sagebrush on burned-over areas in
the Great Salt Lake region of Utah, and occupied these sites in dense stands associated
with cutleaf filaree (<i>Erodium cicutarium</i>), rabbitbrush, 
broom snakeweed (<i>Gutierrezia sarothrae</i>), and several other relatively unpalatable species and annual
weeds [<a href="#340">340</a>]. Cheatgrass invades sites dominated 
by silver sagebrush (<i>A. cana</i>) and blue grama in Wyoming [<a href="#418">418</a>].</p>

<p>Wyoming big sagebrush (<i>A. t.</i> ssp. <i>wyomingensis</i>) 
and basin big sagebrush (<i>A. t.</i> ssp. <i>tridentata</i>) are the most xeric 
of the big sagebrush community types and are the most susceptible to invasion by 
cheatgrass. These communities are more likely to be converted to annual 
grasslands with increased fire frequency (see the <a href="fire_ecology.html">Fire Ecology</a> section of this report, or 
individual reports on big sagebrush subspecies in FEIS, for more information) [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#290">290</a>,<a href="#380">380</a>]. Stiff 
sagebrush (<i>A. rigida</i>) communities are often found in a depleted condition,  dominated 
by threetip sagebrush (<i>A. tripartita</i>) and an herbaceous layer consisting mainly of cheatgrass and 
other annuals  [<a href="#430">430</a>]. Cheatgrass occurs but usually does not dominate  the more mesic and 
cooler sagebrush types characterized by mountain big sagebrush (<i>A. t.</i> 
ssp. <i>vaseyana</i>) [<a href="#376">376</a>,<a href="#425">425</a>], low sagebrush [<a href="#429">429</a>,<a href="#496">496</a>], and threetip sagebrush [<a href="#427">427</a>]. Cheatgrass codominates with black 
sagebrush (<i>A. nova</i>) on several sites in Nevada, where bottlebrush 
squirreltail may also codominate [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>]. However, cheatgrass is not usually persistent in black sagebrush communities [<a href="#428">428</a>].</p>

<p>In pinyon-juniper and mountain brush lands, cheatgrass can be found
growing among Rocky Mountain juniper (<i>J. scopulorum</i>) [<a href="#181">181</a>,<a href="#416">416</a>,<a href="#420">420</a>], western juniper (<i>J. occidentalis</i>) 
[<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>], singleleaf pinyon (<i>Pinus monophylla</i>) [<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#254">254</a>], Utah juniper (<i>J.</i>
<i>osteosperma</i>) [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#193">193</a>,<a href="#242">242</a>,<a href="#254">254</a>], Colorado pinyon (<i>P. edulis</i>) 
[<a href="#193">193</a>,<a href="#310">310</a>], Gambel oak (<i>Quercus gambelii</i>) [<a href="#193">193</a>,<a href="#255">255</a>,<a href="#310">310</a>], Emory oak (<i>Q. emoryi</i>) [<a href="#448">448</a>], 
antelope bitterbrush (<i>Purshia tridentata</i>)
[<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>,<a href="#308">308</a>,<a href="#472">472</a>,<a href="#474">474</a>], curlleaf mountain-mahogany (<i>Cercocarpus
ledifolius</i>) [<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>,<a href="#254">254</a>,<a href="#363">363</a>,<a href="#472">472</a>,<a href="#474">474</a>], skunkbush sumac (<i>Rhus trilobata</i>) [<a href="#308">308</a>,<a href="#418">418</a>], snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos</i> 
spp.) [<a href="#466">466</a>,<a href="#472">472</a>,<a href="#474">474</a>], serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier
pallida</i>), and mountain big sagebrush [<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#472">472</a>,<a href="#474">474</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<p> Cheatgrass is common in the ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>) zone throughout the 
West [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>,<a href="#181">181</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#201">201</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#255">255</a>,<a href="#276">276</a>,<a href="#310">310</a>,<a href="#465">465</a>,<a href="#466">466</a>]. It may be found with Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga
menziesii</i>) [<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#255">255</a>,<a href="#400">400</a>,<a href="#401">401</a>,<a href="#402">402</a>,<a href="#465">465</a>,<a href="#466">466</a>], and on dry sites in the grand fir (<i>Abies
grandis</i>) forest zone [<a href="#159">159</a>]. Cheatgrass is restricted to dry and exposed areas in
western redcedar-western hemlock (<i>Thuja plicata-Tsuga heterophylla</i>) 
associations [<a href="#207">207</a>].&nbsp;It is 
uncommon in mature forest stands, and is usually found  only after disturbance or on dry and exposed sites within  forest 
zones [<a href="#343">343</a>,<a href="#344">344</a>].</p>

<p>Cheatgrass is found throughout California, and is the dominant annual
grass on sagebrush rangelands on the Modoc Plateau in northeastern California and along the  eastern Sierra Nevada to 
Owens Valley [<a href="#492">492</a>]. On the Modoc Plateau, large acreages are
dominated by big sagebrush and cheatgrass. Where recurrent burning has
eliminated the sagebrush, communities are dominated by rubber rabbitbrush (<i>Chrysothamnus
nauseosus</i>) and cheatgrass. Cheatgrass can also invade low sagebrush
communities in this area, but density of cheatgrass tends to be lower, and that
of medusahead (<i>Taeniatherum caput-medusae</i>) higher, than in big sagebrush 
communities [<a href="#488">488</a>]. Cheatgrass is among several Mediterranean 
species that have replaced native perennials in California grasslands [<a href="#390">390</a>], although it is relatively rare
in the annual rangeland communities  west of the Sierra Nevada [<a href="#492">492</a>]. On the south slope of Mt. Pinos, California, cheatgrass is
found in the understory of stands dominated by Jeffrey pine (<i>Pinus jeffreyi</i>), singleleaf pinyon,
shrub live oak (<i>Q. turbinella</i>), white fir (<i>Abies concolor</i>), 
canyon live oak (<i>Q. chrysolepis</i>), and California black oak (<i>Q. kelloggii</i>) [<a href="#441">441</a>]. 
It is one of the most 
common species in the herb layer of forests 
dominated by Jeffery pine on the eastern, desert-facing slopes of the Sierra 
Nevada [<a href="#30">30</a>]. Cheatgrass seeds were found in the seed bank of mixed 
chamise-desert ceanothus (<i>Adenostoma fasciculatum-Ceanothus
greggii</i>) chaparral of different ages [<a href="#495">495</a>], and 
cheatgrass plants are found on burned sites in California chaparral dominated by 
Eastwood manzanita (<i>Arctostaphylos glandulosa</i>) [<a href="#442">442</a>]. In the Sierra San Pedro 
M<font face="Times New Roman">á</font>rtir, Baja California, cheatgrass may be seen along the mountain meadow-mixed 
conifer forest fringe [<a href="#296">296</a>].  </p>
<p> In British Columbia, cheatgrass is found in very dry, hot bunchgrass and interior Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga
menziesii</i> var. <i>menziesii</i>) communities [<a href="#257">257</a>]. In southern British Columbia, Tisdale [<a href="#422">422</a>] recognized 2 cheatgrass
communities, both developing under conditions of heavy livestock grazing. One is 
a cheatgrass-Sandberg bluegrass-needle-and-thread grass<i> </i>association that  developed from a 
needle-and-thread grass<i>-</i>bluebunch wheatgrass<i>-</i>Sandberg bluegrass association in the middle grassland zone. 
The 2nd type is a Sandberg bluegrass-cheatgrass association, found in the upper grassland zone [<a href="#422">422</a>].</p>

<p>Cheatgrass is listed as a dominant or codominant species in the following 
community and habitat type classifications:</p>

Oregon and Washington [<a href="#159">159</a>]<br>
Oregon [<a href="#223">223</a>]<br>
Nevada [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>]<br>
Idaho [<a href="#380">380</a>]<br><br>

Cheatgrass is also a common cropland weed, especially in winter wheat and alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i>) in the 
Pacific Northwest and Great Plains regions [<a href="#475">475</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>], and is common in abandoned fields 
[<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>]. It may also be
found among riparian vegetation (e.g. [<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#184">184</a>,<a href="#223">223</a>,<a href="#265">265</a>,<a href="#325">325</a>,<a href="#328">328</a>]); and it dominates riparian meadows in Great Basin National
Park, Nevada [<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#393">393</a>].

GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />

The following description of cheatgrass provides characteristics that may be
relevant to fire ecology, and is not meant for identification. It is based
primarily on
descriptions found in several reviews [<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>,<a href="#306">306</a>,<a href="#419">419</a>,<a href="#437">437</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>]. Keys for identification are available (e.g. [<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>,<a href="#174">174</a>,<a href="#450">450</a>]). 

<p>Cheatgrass is a nonnative,
typically winter annual grass [<a href="#306">306</a>]. It can assume a spring annual
character when fall moisture is limiting and seeds
germinate in spring [<a href="#154">154</a>,<a href="#405">405</a>]. Finnerty and Klingman [<a href="#154">154</a>] observed that cheatgrass plants germinating after 
April 1 in Lincoln, Nebraska, exhibited a biennial character,  producing seed 
 
the following spring. Mack and Pyke [<a href="#263">263</a>] did not observe cheatgrass 
individuals with biennial character over 3 generations in eastern Washington.&nbsp;Production 
of 2 successive sets of inflorescences in a single growing season is, however, 
fairly common (see <a href="#Seed production">Seed production</a> below) [<a href="#189">189</a>]. Cheatgrass
has a panicle inflorescence 2 to 8 inches (5-20 cm)
long, open to more or
less compact and drooping, with up to 8
spikelets, 1 to 2 inches (2-4 cm) long (including awns), with 2 to 8 florets per spikelet, and long straight awns attached to
florets [<a href="#306">306</a>]. Fruits are caryopses. Leaves are 2 to 6 inches (4-16 cm) long and 2 
to 4 mm wide [<a href="#492">492</a>].</p>

<p>Cheatgrass has a finely divided, fibrous root system with an average of 7 main
roots that grow rapidly, spreading laterally and vertically. Cheatgrass roots can penetrate 34 to 60 inches
(87-150 cm) or more, and are mostly concentrated in the top 12 inches (30 cm) of
soil [<a href="#186">186</a>,<a href="#199">199</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#397">397</a>]. Plants 1st produce
roots to depths of 7 to 8 inches (18-20 cm) before sending out far-reaching
lateral roots. Cheatgrass reduced  soil moisture to
the &quot;permanent wilting point&quot;
(about 4-8% soil moisture, dry weight basis) to a depth of 28 inches (70 cm) in natural
stands , and to a depth of 40 to 50 inches (110-130 cm) in nitrogen-fertilized stands
[<a href="#207">207</a>]. Cheatgrass roots are only thinly suberized as protection against
loss of water to dry soil layers, which may explain why it dies earlier in summer 
than bluebunch wheatgrass and medusahead [<a href="#189">189</a>].</p>

<p>Cheatgrass grows rapidly, and may produce dry matter at a rate of 2.9
g/mm<sup>2</sup>/day. Plants can mature with a single floret or with multiple 
<a href="../../../glossary.html#TILLER:">tillers</a>  
and florets.  The amount of growth or tillering depends on the amount and timing of moisture received 
[<a href="#186">186</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>], and varies widely from year to year, with practically nothing one 
year and tons per acre in other years [<a href="#492">492</a>].&nbsp;Cheatgrass maintains its dominance 
on many sites by adaptations 
that facilitate early and rapid growth, including a type of carbohydrate 
metabolism that permits growth at relatively low temperatures [<a href="#86">86</a>]. Because 
cheatgrass can commence growth and deplete soil moisture before native plants 
break dormancy, it gains a competitive advantage in cold, semiarid 
environments [<a href="#186">186</a>]. This is evidenced by greater physiological stress 
and reduced total root length measured in perennial shrubs and grasses growing 
with cheatgrass than in  plants growing without cheatgrass as a neighbor [<a href="#280">280</a>,<a href="#281">281</a>,<a href="#445">445</a>]. Cheatgrass also has 
greater top-growth yields per unit water used compared to summer-growing 
perennial grasses. This high water-use efficiency is  partly due to  early 
season growth, when transpiration rates are low [<a href="#199">199</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>].</p>

<p>Density of cheatgrass plants can range between 1 and
1,400 plants per square foot (3-15,000 per m<sup>2</sup>), and averages
around 600 plants per square foot (6,450 per m<sup>2</sup>) [<a href="#210">210</a>,<a href="#405">405</a>].
Cheatgrass often grows in pure stands. Monocultures of thousands of acres
with as many as 900 cheatgrass plants per square foot (10,000 per m<sup>2</sup>) have been observed
[<a href="#483">483</a>].</p>

<p>Cheatgrass is morphologically and phenotypically variable [<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>,<a href="#272">272</a>,<a href="#317">317</a>]. 
A common garden experiment by Hulbert [<a href="#207">207</a>] demonstrated the existence of 
several distinct ecotypes with differences in winter hardiness, phenology, 
height of culms, pubescence on lemmas, openness of panicles, and dorsal 
compression of florets. Cheatgrass exhibits considerable plasticity in its 
response to variation in site conditions. It may produce a single culm 1 to 4 
inches (2.5-10 cm) tall and bearing only 1 spikelet when growing in a very dense monospecific stand, or on an
infertile, droughty site. In contrast, where moisture, fertility or light intensity are not limiting,
cheatgrass plants may produce 12-15 culms, 20 to 30 inches (50-75 cm) tall, bearing hundreds of
spikelets [<a href="#306">306</a>,<a href="#437">437</a>].</p>

<p>Cheatgrass plants may be colonized by
vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#171">171</a>], with significantly higher (p&lt;0.05)
rates of colonization on ungrazed versus grazed range [<a href="#45">45</a>]. Cheatgrass is commonly infected with a head smut fungus (<i>Ustilago
brominvora</i>) that can reduce stand density temporarily on some sites [<a href="#288">288</a>]. Smut infection is more common on north
and east aspects on range sites in Montana [<a href="#447">447</a>].</p>

Cheatgrass reproduces only by seed. Year-to-year variation in environment 
results in considerable variation in population attributes such as recruitment, 
survivorship, and fecundity. Cheatgrass can behave simultaneously on the same 
site as an ephemeral monocarpic, annual monocarpic and winter annual monocarpic 
species [<a href="#263">263</a>].

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b><a name="Breeding system">Breeding system:</a></b></font> 
Cheatgrass has perfect flowers [<a href="#184">184</a>], 
is predominantly <a href="../../../glossary.html#CLEISTOGAMY:">cleistogamous</a> [<a href="#318">318</a>], 
and is usually 
<a href="../../../glossary.html#AUTOGAMY:">autogamous</a> [<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>,<a href="#320">320</a>] 
but can be 
<a href="../../../glossary.html#XENOGAMY:">xenogamous</a> [<a href="#419">419</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>]. 
It has been suggested that the ability to crossbreed
allows cheatgrass to adapt to
differences in environment, and thus maintain its dominance and expand its range 
through selection of ecotypes that are highly
competitive under different conditions [<a href="#482">482</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>]. Young and others [<a href="#487">487</a>] suggest that lodicule rigidity, anther
exsertion, pollen vitality, and stigma exsertion and receptivity  respond
to increased environmental potential per individual (e.g. more nutrient and 
water availability and less competition following 
fire), thus improving the chances for crossbreeding in that generation.</p>

<p>Several authors provide evidence not only for phenotypic variation, but also 
for genetic variation within populations [<a href="#272">272</a>,<a href="#285">285</a>,<a href="#358">358</a>] and between populations 
[<a href="#263">263</a>,<a href="#264">264</a>,<a href="#272">272</a>,<a href="#317">317</a>,<a href="#318">318</a>,<a href="#320">320</a>,<a href="#358">358</a>]. Genetic variation tends to be greater between 
populations than within populations because cheatgrass has high levels of 
inbreeding [<a href="#275">275</a>,<a href="#320">320</a>], although Novak [<a href="#317">317</a>] found higher than expected genetic 
variation (for a self-pollinating species) within North American cheatgrass 
populations, citing the importance of multiple introductions. Populations of 
cheatgrass exhibit adaptive genetic variation corresponding to habitat 
[<a href="#285">285</a>,<a href="#286">286</a>,<a href="#358">358</a>]. Cheatgrass' success in a diverse array of environments has been 
attributed to its phenotypic plasticity, rapid growth of an extensive root 
system, ability to germinate and establish over a wide range of temperature and 
moisture conditions [<a href="#315">315</a>,<a href="#320">320</a>,<a href="#359">359</a>], and ability to adapt to different 
environments through incidents of crossbreeding [<a href="#482">482</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>]. </p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Pollination:</b></font> Cheatgrass is 
normally self pollinated [<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#317">317</a>] although cross-pollination can occur [<a href="#419">419</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>]. Young and others [<a href="#486">486</a>] suggest 
a postfire response in cheatgrass and a mechanism that would increase the likelihood for cross-pollination (see <a href="fire_ecology.html#FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS">Fire ecology or Adaptations</a>), 
although the vector(s) by which cross-pollination takes place are not given.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b><a name="Seed production">Seed production:</a></b></font>    
In general, cheatgrass is a prolific seed
producer. Hull and Pechanec [<a href="#210">210</a>] report natural seeding at an average rate of 
70.8 million seeds per acre (177 million/ha), although seed production varies with plant density, time of germination, and 
environmental conditions [<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#342">342</a>]. Cheatgrass generally
produces so many seeds that subsequent plant density is not related directly to the number
of seeds present, but to the number of available sites in the seedbed capable of
supporting germination [<a href="#485">485</a>].&nbsp;Even
during years with unfavorable growing conditions, cheatgrass can produce enough
seed to perpetuate itself [<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#423">423</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>].</p>

<p>Reductions in density of cheatgrass populations can result
in larger plants and a net increase in seed production [<a href="#365">365</a>,<a href="#485">485</a>]. Individual plants growing in high densities 
of about 1,000 plants
per square foot (10,750/m<sup>2</sup>) may produce about 25 seeds each; a large,
open-grown plant can produce about 400 seeds; while a solitary cheatgrass plant
with plentiful tillers and abundant moisture and sunlight can produce 5,000
seeds or more [<a href="#341">341</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>].</p>

<p>In general, seedlings that germinate in the fall and survive until maturity
are larger than spring-germinated plants and produce more seed [<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#263">263</a>].</p>

<p>Certain environmental conditions can result in a 2nd seed crop in
cheatgrass. Harris [<a href="#186">186</a>] observed scattered cheatgrass plants on a site in Washington that
produced a 2nd seed crop from additional tillers during 2 consecutive springs. He also observed a stand of 
cheatgrass at the same location that
produced inflorescences averaging&nbsp;4 to 5 inches (10-12 cm) long during an unusually dry
spring. After late spring rains, these drying plants greened-up and produced a 2nd,
taller set of flowering stems. He noted that a similar
response was observed at a site in Montana [<a href="#186">186</a>]. Similarly, Klemmedson and Smith
[<a href="#235">235</a>] reported observations of a 2nd crop of cheatgrass seeds in the
late spring at several locations in Idaho, and attributed it to the stimulation
of new tiller growth  by late spring rains after the cheatgrass had begun to
senesce.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seed dispersal:</b></font>    
Most cheatgrass seeds fall to the soil surface near the
parent plant, or are spread short distances by wind or water. Long-distance dispersal
is facilitated by humans and wild and domestic animals. The barbed florets are
ideally adapted to being picked up by clothing, feathers, and fur [<a href="#207">207</a>].
Seeds can also be dispersed by machinery or vehicles [<a href="#306">306</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>].&nbsp;Animals may  carry cheatgrass 
seed in their feces and hooves [<a href="#486">486</a>].  Seed-caching rodents and harvester ants can disperse seeds intermediate distances 
through caching activity [<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#311">311</a>]. Mice cache cheatgrass seeds, sometimes resulting in 
dense, even-aged and short-lived tufts of seedlings about 1 inch (2 cm) in 
diameter [<a href="#111">111</a>]. Seed predation by animals is not a major factor in
reducing or controlling populations of cheatgrass seeds. In general, rodents, birds, and
harvester ants have low preference for cheatgrass seeds when other species of 
seed are available. If granivores  selectively avoid cheatgrass, its density may increase relative to 
other plants [<a href="#353">353</a>].</p> 

<p>Cropland, particularly fields of winter wheat and dryland hay, may be potential seed sources to nearby 
natural areas and rangelands, as
cheatgrass is a common weed in these crops. Cheatgrass seed may be dispersed in contaminated crop seed
[<a href="#437">437</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>], or via animals passing through cropland. Cheatgrass seeds may remain viable for
several years when stored dry within bales of hay or straw. Subsequently,
transporting and feeding these bales to livestock  can spread
cheatgrass [<a href="#306">306</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>]. Early infestations of cheatgrass occurred along 
railroads when livestock cars used straw that was contaminated with cheatgrass seed for bedding 
[<a href="#47">47</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seed banking:</b></font> 
Hulbert [<a href="#207">207</a>] found that cheatgrass seeds stored in 
paper sacks in a laboratory for 5.5 to 11.5 years had 95 to 100% germination in 
petri dish tests, suggesting a potential for seed banking. He concluded, 
however, that in the field, all or nearly all cheatgrass seeds germinate as soon 
as conditions are favorable, and that it is uncommon for seeds to remain viable 
but ungerminated for as long as a year.&nbsp;Since that time, a number of workers 
have observed that viable cheatgrass seeds lie over from 1 year to the next in 
the litter and soil [<a href="#132">132</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>,<a href="#209">209</a>,<a href="#482">482</a>,<a href="#485">485</a>], especially when seed production is so abundant that many seeds do not find 
safe sites for germination [<a href="#492">492</a>]. Seed bank density in cheatgrass varies with 
site characteristics, current and past vegetation, 
available microsites for germination, and history of disturbance.</p>

<p>Young and Evans [<a href="#482">482</a>] observed spatial and seasonal variation in density of 
germinable seeds of cheatgrass in the soil under and between canopies of big 
sagebrush. The maximum number of germinable seeds was present in the fall, and 
fewest in winter, although they did not sample in summer. Germinable seeds were 
found more often in the litter layer than in the underlying mineral soil, and 
more often under shrub canopies than in the interspaces. Between shrubs, 81% of 
the germinable seeds were located on the soil surface; there was virtually no 
litter other than the seeds themselves, which provided an environment conducive to germination [<a href="#482">482</a>].</p>

<p>Once cheatgrass has established on a site and gone through a couple of cycles 
of seed production and dispersal, the seed bank 
can contain 2 or 3 times as many viable cheatgrass seeds as there are established plants in 
the community [<a href="#479">479</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>].&nbsp;Research by Billings 
[<a href="#48">48</a>] suggests a large viable seed bank for cheatgrass (about 106 seeds per 
square foot (1,177 per m<sup>2</sup>)) in the top 6 inches (15 cm) of soil in an 
unburned sagebrush ecosystem in Nevada.</p>

<p>Upon dispersal, cheatgrass seeds are usually at least conditionally dormant, 
and lose dormancy through dry after-ripening [<a href="#286">286</a>]. Cheatgrass seeds that are dispersed in the seedbed in topoedaphic 
situations that are not favorable for germination may acquire  dormancy [<a href="#485">485</a>]. Through the mechanism of acquired seed dormancy, 
cheatgrass has the 
ecological benefit of continuous germination [<a href="#492">492</a>], with some seeds 
remaining dormant and some germinating throughout fall and winter and into spring, 
and thus hindering short-term weed control treatments [<a href="#485">485</a>].</p>

<p>Cheatgrass seeds can remain dormant in the soil for 2 to 3 years, losing 
their dormancy slowly over time [<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#482">482</a>]. Because the breakdown is slow, 
prolonged wet periods with adequate temperatures for germination
result in many more seedlings than when these seeds are exposed to short periods
of ideal temperature and moisture conditions [<a href="#147">147</a>]. Germination of dormant seeds can be 
stimulated by nitrate 
enhancement of the seedbed [<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#306">306</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>]. Disturbances involving removal or destruction of plant biomass 
or mixing of soil typically increase nitrogen availability [<a href="#399">399</a>], 
which may  enhance cheatgrass seed germination in the postdisturbance 
environment (e.g. [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>]). While fire can kill most cheatgrass seed in the 
seed bank [<a href="#192">192</a>,<a href="#213">213</a>], surviving seeds tend to produce larger, more productive plants 
[<a href="#487">487</a>]. Thus, the cheatgrass seed bank can be replenished after 
a single growing season [<a href="#192">192</a>,<a href="#213">213</a>].</p>

<p>Daubenmire [<a href="#112">112</a>] and Tisdale [<a href="#422">422</a>] found that minimal amounts of cheatgrass were capable of
establishment and discontinuous persistence in good- and excellent-condition
bunchgrass communities in the absence of grazing. Young and Allen [<a href="#477">477</a>] suggest
that the development
of large, persistent seed banks allows cheatgrass to persist on these sites, 
where it does not otherwise have sufficient environmental potential to reproduce every year.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Germination:</b></font> Timing and success of 
cheatgrass seed germination is affected by light, temperature, and moisture 
conditions, the effects of which vary with the age of the seed, seed dormancy, and after-ripening requirements. 
In the field, patterns of germination 
response at dispersal vary between populations and across years within 
populations. Evidence of genetic control of seed germination regulation has also 
been given [<a href="#285">285</a>]. In one study, germination response differences
between populations accounted for over 90% of the 
variance in germination traits, whereas differences within populations accounted for 1% 
or less of the variance observed. Cheatgrass seeds from predictable, extreme environments (subalpine meadow and 
warm desert margin) showed substantially less variation within populations than did
seeds from less predictable environments (cold desert, foothill, and 
plains) [<a href="#8">8</a>].</p> 

<p>Seedbed characteristics (e.g. litter coverage, microtopography, and soil texture) directly affect the 
microenvironment of the seedbed (e.g. light,  temperature, and  moisture) which, in turn, affects germination of cheatgrass seeds [<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>,<a href="#481">481</a>]. Germination of 
cheatgrass is inhibited on sites with well-developed biological soil crusts 
(which prevent seed burial) and low plant 
litter. Once seeds germinate, biological soil crusts show no barrier to seedling 
root penetration [<a href="#43">43</a>]. Cheatgrass seeds 
germinate best in the dark or in diffuse light [<a href="#492">492</a>]. Cheatgrass can establish 
on the soil surface in mesic parts of the northern mixed-grass prairie and 
Pacific bunchgrass biomes, but in drier environments cheatgrass requires environmental conditions less harsh
than those of bare soil [<a href="#487">487</a>], and must be covered by soil or 
litter [<a href="#142">142</a>,<a href="#146">146</a>]. Details of temperature and 
moisture modifications created by differences in soil surface microtopography 
are given by Evans and Young [<a href="#142">142</a>] for both fall and spring emergence on clay 
and sandy loam soils with differing depths of burial. Often the seed mass 
provides the necessary litter for a portion of the crop to germinate [<a href="#486">486</a>]. 
Cheatgrass was even able to germinate in litter of singleleaf pinyon that inhibited the emergence of Sandberg 
bluegrass and Idaho fescue - apparently due to allelopathic effects [<a href="#149">149</a>].</p> 

<p>Seeds germinate more quickly when covered with soil than with litter. Depth of burial is 
important, as demonstrated by Hulbert [<a href="#207">207</a>]: from
the surface to a depth of 0.8 inch (2 cm) all cheatgrass seedlings emerged; a 
burial depth of 1.6 inches (4 cm) apparently eliminated some seedlings; and only a few seedlings emerged from a depth of 
2.4 inches (6 cm). No emergence occurred from seeds buried 4 inches (10 cm) below 
the surface [<a href="#492">492</a>].</p> 

<p>Newly ripened cheatgrass seeds germinate poorly at high temperature or in 
intense light [<a href="#189">189</a>], and seedlings that emerge in late summer and early fall are 
often killed by hot, dry weather later in the season [<a href="#189">189</a>,<a href="#264">264</a>]. In the 
Intermountain West, cheatgrass seeds typically germinate in response to autumn 
precipitation, but recruitment can occur at any time from autumn through late 
spring, within a few days after rain [<a href="#189">189</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>,<a href="#262">262</a>,<a href="#263">263</a>,<a href="#306">306</a>,<a href="#485">485</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>]. In the more mesic areas of the sagebrush-grass
ecosystems, germination&nbsp;occurs in both spring and fall [<a href="#146">146</a>]. In the more arid portions of the Great Basin, 
cheatgrass rarely germinates in the fall, 
because by the time effective moisture is received, it
is usually too cold for germination. In these areas, germination occurs in
the early spring, and cheatgrass must complete its life cycle before soil
moisture is exhausted [<a href="#146">146</a>,<a href="#479">479</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>]. It has been suggested that cheatgrass seeds may be induced into dormancy by low 
winter temperatures [<a href="#447">447</a>,<a href="#482">482</a>]. 
Young and Evans [<a href="#482">482</a>] found that by May this winter-acquired dormancy breaks down, and seeds
begin germinating at a slow rate. Seedling emergence may be slow in 
spring, and spring-germinated plants are often smaller, less numerous, and 
less vigorous than fall-germinated plants [<a href="#209">209</a>,<a href="#405">405</a>].</p> 

<p>Cheatgrass seeds
germinate quickly and at very high rates (95% or more) when moisture and 
temperature conditions are favorable [<a href="#209">209</a>,<a href="#306">306</a>], and are relatively 
insensitive to moisture and temperature stress [<a href="#170">170</a>]. 
A review by Pyke and Novak [<a href="#353">353</a>] suggests that cheatgrass germination is
uninhibited to a soil moisture of -1.5 MPa, although time to germination may increase as
soil water potentials become more negative. Results presented by Goodwin and 
others [<a href="#170">170</a>] support this, as cheatgrass seeds began germinating in 1 to 2 days at 
0 MPa and 2 to 5 days at -1 MPa. Allen and others [<a href="#7">7</a>] found that cheatgrass seeds were able to progress 
toward germination with intermittent hydration and dehydration episodes, 
although rate of germination was affected, particularly when dehydration 
occurred just prior to radicle emergence. A series of 
successive days of &gt;1mm precipitation during autumn appears adequate for 
germination [<a href="#353">353</a>].</p> 

<p>Cheatgrass seeds are highly germinable over a wide range of constant and
alternating incubation temperatures [<a href="#266">266</a>], and a wide range of 
low and widely fluctuating seedbed temperatures. 
Cheatgrass seeds can germinate at temperatures  just above freezing [<a href="#142">142</a>], and germination is inhibited by temperatures 
above 86 
degrees Fahrenheit (30 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) [<a href="#189">189</a>]. The optimum temperature for germination 
increases with seed age as 
follows: 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) for 
new seeds; 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) for 
4-week-old seeds; 59 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit (15-20 <font face="Times New Roman">°C)
</font>for 7-week-old seed; 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 <font face="Times New Roman">
°C) </font>for 1-year-old seed [<a href="#207">207</a>].</p> 

<p>This and other evidence of an after-ripening requirement for cheatgrass seed 
germination (e.g. a retardation of germination with light observed in young 
seeds [<a href="#207">207</a>]), has been presented by several authors [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#286">286</a>], 
suggesting that germination at the most favorable season is influenced by a 
mechanism involving changing reactions to light and temperature as seeds age. 
Allen and others [<a href="#9">9</a>] suggest that after-ripening is likely completed in late 
summer or early autumn regardless of summer conditions.</p> 

<p>Cheatgrass seeds were nonviable after either ensiling for 8 weeks and/or
rumen digestion by cattle for 24 hours. This rate of degradation during rumen 
digestion would result in an estimated 38 to 71% viable seeds (depending on the 
composition of the diet) following digestion by cattle [<a href="#57">57</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seedling establishment/growth:</b></font> Establishment of cheatgrass
seedlings is favored by large amounts of plant mulch [<a href="#141">141</a>], although seedlings are relatively hardy
with respect to surviving drought periods of up to 10 days [<a href="#160">160</a>].</p>

<p>Cheatgrass recruitment is usually concentrated in
late summer and autumn, but can occur at any time until about mid-May. Mack and Pyke 
[<a href="#263">263</a>] observed almost continual recruitment of cheatgrass seedlings in 
Washington, such that even if fall and early winter recruits died without flowering, the 
late winter and spring emergents produced enough seeds 
to ensure another generation.&nbsp;Most plants survived to 
produce seed. Even individuals less than 45 days old  produced at least 1 
viable seed by June [<a href="#263">263</a>].</p>

<p>Cheatgrass establishment is favored at low temperatures compared to cultivars 
of  crested and bluebunch wheatgrass [<a href="#3">3</a>]. It grows in a narrow range of soil 
temperatures, with growth starting just above freezing and stopping when soil 
temperatures exceed 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15 °C) [<a href="#492">492</a>].
Growth rate of cheatgrass increases from a low temperature limit of 37 to 45
degrees Fahrenheit (3-7 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) to an upper temperature limit between 81 and 
88 degrees Fahrenheit (27 and 31 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C). Beyond these limits growth ceases. 
These limits differ among subpopulations, and are related to the local 
microclimate. The optimum growth temperature is between 50 and 68 degrees 
Fahrenheit (10 and 20 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) [<a href="#272">272</a>]. Cheatgrass can 
be extremely cold tolerant as indicated by plants surviving 
winter lows of -10 degrees Fahrenheit (<font face="Times New Roman">-</font>23 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) in Minnesota with only very slight 
injury to leaves 
[<a href="#207">207</a>].</p>



<span class="subframeName">

SITE CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />


Cheatgrass is adapted to a variety of climatic conditions [<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#272">272</a>,<a href="#300">300</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>]. While 
this has been largely attributed 
to its phenotypic plasticity [<a href="#306">306</a>,<a href="#320">320</a>], 
populations of cheatgrass may also exhibit adaptive genetic variation 
corresponding to habitat [<a href="#285">285</a>,<a href="#286">286</a>,<a href="#358">358</a>]. Cheatgrass' broad distribution reflects its ability to establish on 
a wide variety of sites, usually following disturbance. Its tendency to 
persist and expand on a site is governed by disturbance 
regime, temperature, moisture, soil, microtopography, and plant 
community characteristics.

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Disturbance:</b></font> Often the critical factor opening niches for 
cheatgrass invasion is a heightened disturbance regime [<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#322">322</a>,<a href="#363">363</a>]. Cultivation and subsequent land 
abandonment, excessive livestock 
grazing, overstory removal, and repeated fires can  interact, or act singly, to proliferate cheatgrass [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>,<a href="#295">295</a>,<a href="#380">380</a>,<a href="#395">395</a>]. Excessive grazing and frequent 
fires can damage biological soil crusts and many perennial plants, thus
encouraging cheatgrass establishment, survival [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#487">487</a>], persistence, and 
dominance [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#287">287</a>,<a href="#338">338</a>,<a href="#460">460</a>]. In some cases, cheatgrass 
has expanded as a result of overgrazing, while in other cases intensive grazing 
has removed perennial grass fuels and reduced the ability of fire to spread, 
thus impeding the cheatgrass/fire cycle [<a href="#2">2</a>] 
(see <a href="#SUCCESSIONAL STATUS">Successional Status</a> below, and the 
<a href="fire_ecology.html">Fire Ecology</a> 
sections of this report, for more information on the cheatgrass/fire 
cycle). A study in northern Utah indicates that cheatgrass
is most invasive on mid-elevation sagebrush and shadscale sites on benches where 
livestock grazing and fires are common, and is less invasive on the higher-elevation 
sites where rugged topography and low water availability have resulted in less 
disturbance both by fire and livestock. Where fires have occurred at higher 
elevations, bunchgrasses have recovered vigorously with little cheatgrass 
invasion [<a href="#396">396</a>].</p>

<p>Cheatgrass invasion may be accelerated by disturbance, but disturbance is 
not required for cheatgrass establishment [<a href="#167">167</a>]. For example, disturbance is not a 
necessary precondition for invasion in intact shadscale-gray molly (<i>Kochia americana</i>) communities in Dugway 
Valley, Utah, but may facilitate the process in years with favorable moisture [<a href="#287">287</a>]. 
Cheatgrass can also thrive in  areas that have little or no history of 
cultivation or grazing by domestic livestock 
[<a href="#126">126</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>,<a href="#168">168</a>,<a href="#231">231</a>,<a href="#306">306</a>,<a href="#409">409</a>,<a href="#414">414</a>].&nbsp;It may establish in these relatively 
undisturbed areas when seed disperses from nearby patches and establishes on 
sites of small natural disturbances, such as  where rodents or predators dig 
in the soil [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#179">179</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#363">363</a>]. These cheatgrass plants may be small and weak with 
relatively low seed production [<a href="#207">207</a>].</p>

Cheatgrass grows under a range of climatic conditions. It can be found in salt-desert shrub 
communities that receive 6 inches (150 mm) of annual precipitation, and in high-elevation coniferous forests 
that exceed 25 inches (640 mm) of annual 
precipitation [<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#306">306</a>]. It tends to be most invasive in areas  receiving 
12 to 22 inches (300-560 mm) of precipitation that peaks in late winter or early 
spring [<a href="#353">353</a>]. Cheatgrass is well adapted to drier sites and is ubiquitous 
throughout the steppe environment of Washington, while Kentucky bluegrass 
(<i>Poa pratensis</i>) dominates in wetter habitats [<a href="#111">111</a>]. Cheatgrass is more invasive in Wyoming big 
sagebrush and pinyon-juniper belts than in cooler, more mesic sagebrush types 
characterized by mountain big sagebrush and low sagebrush communities above 5,280 feet (1,600 m) [<a href="#168">168</a>,<a href="#425">425</a>,<a href="#426">426</a>,<a href="#429">429</a>]. 
Mountain big sagebrush communities on warm exposures are  more vulnerable to
cheatgrass invasion. The ecotone between desert shrub communities and Wyoming big sagebrush communities
is associated with 7 to 8 inches of annual precipitation (180-200 mm), while communities of typical mountain sagebrush are
associated with greater than 12 inches (300 mm) annual precipitation [<a href="#168">168</a>]. In 
black sagebrush communities in central Nevada, cheatgrass 
was abundant only in years with adequate spring moisture [<a href="#490">490</a>]. Cheatgrass is
well adapted to endure extreme drought, under which conditions  plants
produce little herbage but produce enough seed to establish another generation [<a href="#405">405</a>].
In recent decades, cheatgrass has begun to dominate many arid sites in 
salt-desert shrub and shadscale communities that have about 8 inches (208 mm) annual precipitation.
It is thought that this occurred during a sequence of years of exceptionally
high precipitation in the early 1980s. The probability that cheatgrass will
invade and dominate these sites seems to depend on both weather patterns (i.e. amount and timing of precipitation)
and seed availability [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#287">287</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Elevation:</b></font>
Cheatgrass is most abundant between 2,000 and 6,000 feet (600-1,820 m) elevation in eastern Idaho, 
though it has been found at elevations up to 9,000 feet (2,700 m) [<a href="#405">405</a>]. Cheatgrass has been
found at elevations of 13,100 feet (4,000 m) and above in the United States
[<a href="#214">214</a>], and has been recorded at elevations up to 9,800 feet (3,000 m) in 
the Himalayas [<a href="#437">437</a>]. In 1966, Beatly [<a href="#37">37</a>] wrote that 
cheatgrass was confined to disturbed sites at higher elevations (5,000 to 7,500 feet
(1,500-2,270 m)) on the Nevada Test Site in southern Nevada, where vegetation is dominated 
by sagebrush or pinyon-juniper, and that red brome (<i>Bromus 
madritensis </i>ssp. <i>rubens</i>) was the frequent 
dominant winter annual species in blackbrush communities at 4,000-5,000 feet
(1,200-1,500 m). Cheatgrass has since expanded its range into lower elevation 
sites (e.g. [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#181">181</a>,<a href="#254">254</a>,<a href="#456">456</a>,<a href="#496">496</a>]).</p>

<p>The following table provides some elevation and precipitation ranges for 
communities in which cheatgrass may be dominant or codominant, as reported by 
state or province. Cheatgrass is not, however, limited to these conditions.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Soils:</b></font> 
Cheatgrass will grow in almost any 
type of soil, but it does best on deep, loamy or
coarse-textured soils (e.g. [<a href="#125">125</a>,<a href="#256">256</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>]).
Medusahead may be more likely to dominate on fine-textured soils in the
Intermountain West [<a href="#480">480</a>]. Cheatgrass is common on deep sandy
soils associated with extensive big sagebrush stands on flat
uplands and valley bottoms in mountain and foothill areas [<a href="#37">37</a>].</p>

<p>Cheatgrass can grow on calcareous and saline soils [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#276">276</a>,<a href="#454">454</a>], although increasing soil salinity has
detrimental effects on its photosynthesis and growth. A greenhouse
study by Rasmuson and Anderson [<a href="#359">359</a>] suggests that
cheatgrass' seed production and competitive ability may be impaired in 
environments where soil salinity is greater than about 4 dS/m in the 
rooting zone.&nbsp; Adverse effects were less pronounced on plants grown from
seed taken from a 
population growing on a saline site [<a href="#359">359</a>].&nbsp;Research by Billings [<a href="#48">48</a>] suggests 
that cheatgrass is not tolerant of
acidic, nutrient-poor soils. 
</p>

<p>Cheatgrass can be competitive in low-fertility soils, and
has been found growing on B and C soil 
horizons of eroded areas and on soils low in nitrogen [<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>].
Cheatgrass also does well on fertile soils where 
competition has been reduced [<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>]. 
Cheatgrass thrives and often dominates under conditions of increased nitrogen availability [<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>,<a href="#258">258</a>,<a href="#477">477</a>]. 
A study on an 
arid big sagebrush/Indian ricegrass site in Nevada indicates that nitrogen enrichment
enhances density and biomass of cheatgrass, while immobilization of nitrogen 
favors  establishment of Indian ricegrass [<a href="#478">478</a>]. It has been suggested 
that increases in nitrogen availability and in the abundance of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> 
relative to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> play important roles in allowing 
cheatgrass stands to persist in much of the western United States [<a href="#399">399</a>,<a href="#478">478</a>]. Soil disturbance, fire, 
and atmospheric nitrogen deposition
may contribute to increased abundance of introduced annual grasses,
especially on infertile soils [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#399">399</a>,<a href="#407">407</a>]. The 
cheatgrass/nitrogen relationship is not completely understood, and more research
is needed to better understand these dynamics.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Aspect/topography:</b></font> In some 
ecosystems, aspect and topography can play an important role in cheatgrass 
establishment and dominance.
In pinyon-juniper ecosystems in the Green River area in Utah [<a href="#166">166</a>,<a href="#169">169</a>] and on several sites in 
Nevada and California [<a href="#243">243</a>], cheatgrass tends to be more invasive
on southern and western exposures than on northern exposures. In areas of sand dune knob and kettle 
topography in southeastern Washington, cheatgrass dominates south-facing slopes, 
whereas Sandberg bluegrass dominates north-facing slopes [<a href="#367">367</a>].</p>

<p>Cheatgrass establishes and dominates on sites with rough microtopography and litter
[<a href="#134">134</a>,<a href="#481">481</a>,<a href="#483">483</a>]. Eckert and
others [<a href="#133">133</a>] describe 4 soil-surface types and their
influence on seedling emergence, revegetation, and secondary succession.&nbsp;Cheatgrass 
established under 1 and 2 inches (2.5 and 5 cm) of medusahead, cheatgrass, or 
bluebunch wheatgrass litter, but failed to establish under litter of any species at 3 inches (7.5 cm)  [<a href="#189">189</a>]. 
In sagebrush steppe, cheatgrass
seedlings often grow in dense, circular patches in the area directly beneath the
canopy of shrubs. This may be related to burrowing activity of mice, to litter
accumulation under shrub canopies [<a href="#111">111</a>], or to the large quantities
of grasshopper frass that accumulate in the subcanopy of big sagebrush, which the grasshoppers roost in at night [<a href="#113">113</a>]. In shadscale communities,
cheatgrass plants grow better under shrubs, which seem to act as nurse plants
for cheatgrass by ameliorating growing conditions [<a href="#287">287</a>].&nbsp;Similarly,
cheatgrass often grows
more luxuriantly near greasewood and spiny hopsage  than in adjacent open ground [<a href="#256">256</a>,<a href="#437">437</a>]. Cheatgrass was rare in
unburned transects and was found most frequently beneath
the canopy of living trees in big sagebrush and pinyon-juniper communities in west-central Utah [<a href="#327">327</a>]. 
At another study site in Utah, cheatgrass had significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher frequency under the canopies
of Colorado pinyon and juniper trees compared with the interspaces at all tree
densities [<a href="#313">313</a>].&nbsp;On a western juniper site in central Oregon, cheatgrass production increased
with increasing tree size in both the interspace and subcanopy zones [<a href="#135">135</a>].</p>

<p>Cheatgrass does not flourish in mature ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, grand 
fir, or western redcedar forests of the Intermountain
West. The inability of cheatgrass to persist under these forest canopies is attributed to the influence
of shade on the plants' photosynthetic rate and on resource allocation, the short
growing season, and  the
role of herbivory in exacerbating the other factors. Consequently, these
forest zones broadly define the current environmental limits of the distribution
of cheatgrass in western North America [<a href="#343">343</a>,<a href="#344">344</a>].</p>

<br />

Cheatgrass is a facultative seral species, acting as both an early seral invader 
and as a climax dominant on many sites that historically supported perennial grass 
and forb communities. Everett [<a href="#148">148</a>] suggests that in areas where cheatgrass is 
dominant or codominant, the habitat type or &quot;potential natural community&quot; may 
not be  useful classifications due to  severity of past disturbances and 
irreversible changes in the plant community over time. Instead one might 
consider the &quot;most probable plant community&quot; at a given site under specified 
circumstances. Cheatgrass is especially prevalent in the early stages of fire 
succession or following other disturbances when shrubs, trees, and perennial 
grasses are removed [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>,<a href="#291">291</a>,<a href="#295">295</a>,<a href="#380">380</a>,<a href="#395">395</a>]. Cheatgrass' successional status varies with plant community
composition, disturbance type,
and disturbance history.

<p>Cheatgrass can outcompete many other competitive nonnative plant species including halogeton (<i>Halogeton glomeratus</i>), 
tumblemustard (<i>Sisymbrium altissimum</i>), 
and Russian-thistle (<i>Salsola
kali</i>) [<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#342">342</a>]. On some sites cheatgrass may 
be replaced by other highly competitive, nonnnative, invasive
species such as bur buttercup (<i>Ranunculus
testiculatus</i>), forage kochia (<i>Kochia prostrata</i>) [<a href="#198">198</a>,<a href="#475">475</a>], common St. Johnswort (<i>Hypericum perforatum</i>), 
Dalmatian 
toadflax (<i>Linaria dalmatica</i>), yellow starthistle (<i>Centaurea solstitialis</i>), 
spotted knapweed (<i>C. stoebe</i> ssp. <i>
micranthos</i>), diffuse knapweed (<i>C. diffusa</i>), squarrose knapweed (<i>C. virgata</i> ssp. <i>
squarrosa</i>), rush skeletonweed (<i>Chondrilla 
juncea</i>), and leafy spurge (<i>Euphorbia esula</i>) [<a href="#187">187</a>] [<a href="#372">372</a>]. Northam and Callihan [<a href="#316">316</a>] also suggest that cheatgrass may
potentially be replaced by other nonnative, annual grasses (e.g. interrupted windgrass (<i>Apera interrupta</i>), 
corn brome (<i>Bromus squarrous</i>),
little lovegrass (<i>Eragrostis minor</i>), poverty grass (<i>Sporobolus
vaginiflorus</i>), and ventenata (<i>Ventenata dubia</i>)) that are capable of 
invading and establishing in cheatgrass-infested areas.</p>

<p>Artificial seeding of nonnative (and sometimes invasive) perennial species such as crested wheatgrass (<i>Agropyron 
cristatum</i>) is commonly
carried out following wildfire on managed lands to preclude the development of
undesirable cheatgrass stands and to meet other management objectives [<a href="#144">144</a>,<a href="#260">260</a>,<a href="#327">327</a>]. A study in Utah followed vegetation 
changes for 3 years after wildfire and
artificial seeding of desirable perennial species (mostly nonnative).
Cheatgrass density increased steadily for 3 years following burning and seeding, 
unlike the seeded species [<a href="#327">327</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Sagebrush steppe:</b></font> 
Cheatgrass is most invasive and persistent in sagebrush 
steppe and cold desert regions of the Intermountain West. Cheatgrass initially 
established in the Intermountain area with the introduction of livestock, which 
dramatically changed the balance between herbaceous understory and woody 
overstory species when intense grazing removed native 
bunchgrasses. There is a lack of native annual grasses, so cheatgrass fills that 
niche, and has truncated
succession on many sites [<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>]. Results presented by 
Young and Evans [<a href="#481">481</a>] suggest that as long as there is a seed source and a 
suitable seedbed, cheatgrass will dominate on big sagebrush sites after removal 
of  shrub overstory. They did not encounter an assemblage of native annual plants 
that was capable of preventing  cheatgrass dominance on big sagebrush sites. 
</p>

<p>Cheatgrass can
dominate the 1st or 2nd year after disturbance, and has dominated some sites
for  40 to 80 years, even in the absence of further disturbance [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>,<a href="#236">236</a>]. 
This suggests that 
communities dominated by cheatgrass are a permanent and widespread feature of 
the landscape in some areas [<a href="#236">236</a>]. Piemeisel [<a href="#342">342</a>] quantified the steps in 
succession from bare ground to cheatgrass dominance and reported that even 
rodent disturbance was sufficient to maintain cheatgrass dominance. On sites 
where a major shrub and/or bunchgrass component has not been eliminated by 
cultivation, fire, grazing, or herbicides, a shrub/cheatgrass or 
bunchgrass/cheatgrass climax community may occur [<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>]. When excessive 
grazing causes replacement of most perennial herbs by cheatgrass and other 
annuals, and when fire eliminates shrubs like big sagebrush and antelope 
bitterbrush, the percentage of rangeland dominated entirely by annuals 
progressively increases [<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>]. On some sites essentially pure cheatgrass 
stands may be found [<a href="#460">460</a>]. A combination of burning and grazing can also result 
in annual rangeland dominated by cheatgrass and rubber rabbitbrush [<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>].</p>

<p>A common pattern of succession after disturbance in<i> </i>cropped and abandoned 
fields in the Great Basin and Snake River Plains begins with Russian-thistle and/or flixweed tansymustard 
(<i>Descurainia sophia</i>) 
and tumblemustard, followed by cheatgrass dominance within 
about 5 years [<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#146">146</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>,<a href="#341">341</a>,<a href="#342">342</a>,<a href="#482">482</a>,<a href="#487">487</a>]. Cheatgrass outcompetes tumblemustard and other
broadleaf plants when sufficient litter has accumulated on the soil surface to 
allow for cheatgrass germination [<a href="#146">146</a>,<a href="#342">342</a>]. On some sites, cheatgrass may be pre-empted by  foxtail fescue (<i>Vulpia
myuros</i>), a native annual grass [<a href="#482">482</a>]. Abandoned
fields in the bluebunch wheatgrass/Sandberg bluegrass habitat type quickly
develop a dense stand of cheatgrass that may dominate, along with rubber
rabbitbrush, for more than 40 years [<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>]. On heavily grazed or abandoned farmland 
in the  common snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos albus</i>)/Idaho fescue and Nootka 
rose (<i>Rosa nutkana</i>)/Idaho fescue zones, cheatgrass will ultimately 
give way to Kentucky bluegrass, and on some sites, medusahead [<a href="#159">159</a>]. In the sagebrush steppe in 
northeastern California, Russian-thistle, tumblemustard, and cheatgrass form a 
seral continuum that closes many sagebrush communities to the establishment of 
perennial seedlings. Medusahead has extended the seral continuum by replacing 
cheatgrass on some low sagebrush (<i>Artemisia arbuscula</i>) sites on the Modoc
Plateau [<a href="#480">480</a>,<a href="#488">488</a>].</p>

<p>Medusahead can replace cheatgrass on some sites 
[<a href="#295">295</a>,<a href="#379">379</a>,<a href="#474">474</a>], especially moist sites [<a href="#196">196</a>] and those with fine-textured soils [<a href="#187">187</a>,<a href="#198">198</a>]. 
Over the past 40 years medusahead has replaced cheatgrass over extensive areas in the sagebrush 
zone in California, Idaho,
Oregon, and Washington [<a href="#196">196</a>]. Medusahead 
litter impedes cheatgrass establishment, and medusahead may do better in low-nitrogen 
environments than  cheatgrass [<a href="#187">187</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>]. Coexistence of cheatgrass and 
medusahead is most likely in habitats low in  nitrogen and phosphorus. In more fertile habitats, cheatgrass 
is likely to have the competitive 
advantage unless other environmental factors (e.g. high clay content) favor 
medusahead [<a href="#109">109</a>].  
</p>

<p> Soils in sagebrush steppe habitats tend to be low in organic matter, low in available 
phosphorus and nitrogen,
and have limited water availability; therefore, mycorrhizae can be important to 
native plants for  acquisition of water and
nutrients. Invasion by either nonmycorrhizal or
facultative mycorrhizal plants such as cheatgrass can reduce populations of mycorrhizae, thus indirectly affecting 
successional dynamics in semiarid lands [<a href="#171">171</a>,<a href="#463">463</a>].

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Postfire succession in sagebrush steppe:</font> 
Grazing and agricultural practices have disturbed 
many habitats, but each year, more 
sagebrush rangeland is converted to annual grass rangeland due to wildfires. The successional trajectory following 
fire depends on
prefire plant community and seed bank composition, site fire history, fire severity, fire return interval, 
and livestock grazing practices before and after fire.&nbsp;With the many 
possible permutations of these variables, successional patterns are very site 
specific, although  generalized patterns of the grass/fire cycle have been 
described as follows: 1st, dominant native perennial grasses and forbs are reduced by grazing, and sagebrush
and rabbitbrush  increase forming a dense canopy with
little understory vegetation [<a href="#338">338</a>,<a href="#460">460</a>]. Or, 
cheatgrass establishes on a site and increases in density with &quot;improperly timed&quot; 
grazing or other  disturbance [<a href="#340">340</a>]. Fire is carried through the community within the
canopy or via cheatgrass fuels in the  spaces between shrubs and/or 
bunchgrasses. Following fire, native species cover is typically reduced, and 
cheatgrass cover may increase or decrease, depending on prefire cheatgrass density and seed 
availability [<a href="#338">338</a>,<a href="#340">340</a>,<a href="#460">460</a>]. By the 2nd 
or 3rd postfire year, given sufficient moisture, cheatgrass cover may increase 
to the point where the site is closed to seedlings of perennial grasses [<a href="#338">338</a>,<a href="#475">475</a>,<a href="#476">476</a>,<a href="#483">483</a>]. 
It has also been suggested that 
an increase in intraspecific diversity in cheatgrass populations after fire can 
increase its adaptability and improve its chances for site dominance [<a href="#483">483</a>]. As 
cheatgrass dominance increases, so does the
likelihood of fire, and within 3 to 6 years following the initial fire, the 
amount and continuity of fuels is usually sufficient (in the absence of grazing) 
to carry a 2nd fire. Successive fires become common, and each fire reduces the
surviving shrub cover and native seed bank [<a href="#338">338</a>,<a href="#340">340</a>,<a href="#460">460</a>].</p>

<p>Associated native perennial species respond differently to fire. Native 
perennial seedlings are more likely to establish in wet years, as is 
cheatgrass. Bottlebrush squirreltail is more fire tolerant than the fescues or 
wheatgrasses (Triticeae) [<a href="#338">338</a>,<a href="#494">494</a>]. The response of 
perennial forbs varies with season of burning, and most are more tolerant of fire in late 
summer [<a href="#483">483</a>]. Recovery of shrubs tends to be slow, and those present in the early stages of 
succession are primarily those that can sprout. These 
include  diverse species and subspecies of rabbitbrush (<i>Chrysothamnus</i> 
spp.), and species of horsebrush (<i>Tetradymia</i> spp.), ephedra (<i>Ephedra</i> 
spp.), and <i>Prunus</i> [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#472">472</a>,<a href="#474">474</a>]. Although rabbitbrush may initially increase with 
fire, it is killed when the fire-free interval decreases to 5 years or less 
[<a href="#338">338</a>,<a href="#340">340</a>,<a href="#460">460</a>]. Big sagebrush is the dominant species in vast areas of the Intermountain landscape, 
and none of the subspecies sprout after burning [<a href="#472">472</a>,<a href="#474">474</a>]. To allow establishment and 
persistence of many 
sagebrush species, the fire-free interval must be greater than 20 to 50 years 
[<a href="#338">338</a>]. This varies between the subspecies of big sagebrush, 
with Wyoming big sagebrush being the most fire sensitive, followed by basin big 
sagebrush, and mountain big sagebrush being the most fire resilient [<a href="#424">424</a>,<a href="#425">425</a>,<a href="#426">426</a>] 
(See the <a href="fire_ecology.html">Fire Ecology</a> section of 
this report, or FEIS reports on individual subspecies, for more detail). In 
annual grass dominated communities, the fire-free interval is likely to be about 10 to 
12 years or less. With each successive fire, annual grass dominance is enhanced, 
and the fire-free interval is decreased. This results in a more homogenous 
landscape, decreased species diversity, and larger and more continuous burns 
[<a href="#338">338</a>]. According to state-and-transition models for sagebrush steppe presented by Laycock
[<a href="#251">251</a>], fire, grazing, and annual invasion can lead to a threshold beyond which
the  steady state becomes an annual grassland. After such a threshold has
been crossed, intensive human intervention may be necessary to bring the system to
a state containing desirable perennial species. 
</p>

<p>Successional trends are not always predictable. An 11-year study on a Wyoming 
big sagebrush semidesert site in central Utah found that Wyoming big sagebrush 
was reduced and perennial bunchgrass cover increased on all burned plots. 
Cheatgrass cover increased for 2 years following fire, followed by a 2-year 
reduction in cover, and 3 years of considerable year-to-year fluctuation in 
cheatgrass cover. The final years showed a negligible
presence of cheatgrass with and without livestock grazing. Lower-than-average rainfall during the last 4 years of the study may have played a part in
the decline of cheatgrass, and the lack of repeated fire may have been important
in the maintenance of  perennial grasses [<a href="#206">206</a>]. On a sagebrush steppe site in 
Nevada that was ungrazed for 30 years, cheatgrass cover increased by 38% over 
those 30 years. 
Thurber needlegrass and bottlebrush squirreltail also
increased (726% and 182%, respectively), and Sandberg bluegrass increased 8%. Perennial grasses as a whole 
increased 72%, and bluebunch wheatgrass was 
reestablishing naturally in favored spots [<a href="#370">370</a>].</p>

<p>Cheatgrass is less invasive in mesic environments, where it does not compete as 
effectively with established perennial grasses. It may be dominant only in early 
successional stages, and is eventually replaced by perennial species 
[<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#277">277</a>,<a href="#306">306</a>,<a href="#447">447</a>]. When mountain big sagebrush (the most mesic of the big sagebrush 
subspecies) is replaced by 
cheatgrass after fire, successional trends may be toward bottlebrush 
squirreltail and later bluebunch wheatgrass [<a href="#376">376</a>]. Cheatgrass may remain a minor component of later successional stages 
on these sites, occupying the interspaces between perennial plants [<a href="#306">306</a>].</p>

<p><b><font size="4" face="Bell MT">Salt-d</font></b><font face="Bell MT"><b><font size="4">esert 
shrubland:</font></b></font>
In many salt-desert shrubland sites dominated by species such as saltbush 
(<i>Atriplex</i> spp.), winterfat (<i>Krascheninnikovia lanata</i>), 
black greasewood, creosotebush (<i>Larrea tridentata</i>), and blackbrush, cheatgrass and other nonnative annual 
grasses (particularly red brome) have become dominant and altered successional 
pathways during the past few decades, primarily by changing fire regimes 
(See <a href="fire_ecology.html">Fire Ecology</a> for more details). 
Populations of cheatgrass in these arid 
ecosystems are ephemeral and tend to follow precipitation patterns such that 
dense populations arise during the spring following a year with high 
precipitation [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#214">214</a>,<a href="#238">238</a>]. The demise of dominant shrub 
species  contributes to cheatgrass dominance [<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#491">491</a>].</p>

<p>Just as dominance of cheatgrass promotes
fire in sagebrush steppe ecosystems, salt-desert ecosystems dominated by nonnative 
annual grasses are more flammable than those dominated by native species [<a href="#69">69</a>]. Following 2 or more
years with above-average precipitation, sufficient fine fuel may be present to 
sustain a wildfire [<a href="#238">238</a>] and convert desert plant communities to cheatgrass indefinitely
[<a href="#337">337</a>]. Generally, most native plant species in the deserts 
of North America are poorly adapted to survive fire [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>]. In experimental fires in the Mojave, flames 
fueled by annual bromes 
were sufficient to consume small shrubs such as white bursage (<i>Ambrosia 
dumosa</i>), winterfat, white 
burrobrush (<i>Hymenoclea salsola</i>), and Anderson wolfberry (<i>Lycium 
andersonii</i>), but were
usually insufficient to ignite larger shrubs such as creosotebush, unless the 
shrubs had large accumulations of grass litter and dead shrub stems in the 
subcanopy [<a href="#69">69</a>]. Species
such as shadscale and budsage  do not sprout following fire. Winterfat, saltbush, gray molly, and black greasewood do  sprout, 
but plants appear less vigorous after fire [<a href="#454">454</a>].&nbsp;Postfire dominance of
annual grasses sets the stage for the grass/fire cycle to continue, with large
areas converted to annual grasslands that may persist indefinitely.</p>

<p>Callison and others [<a href="#83">83</a>] studied 8 blackbrush sites in southwestern Utah 
that had been  burned under prescription to remove blackbrush and &quot;increase forage production&quot; 
between 1 and 37 years previous. They found that sites were dominated by forbs 1 
year after fire, dominated by annual grasses (cheatgrass or red brome) 2 to 17 
years after fire, and  dominated by shrubs 37 years after fire. Blackbrush showed no signs of recovery after 37 years [<a href="#83">83</a>].
Similarly,  research by Matchett and Brooks [<a href="#268">268</a>] indicates that 
nonnative annual grasses (cheatgrass and red brome) have persisted as the 
dominant vegetation type, along with early successional shrubs, for up to 60 years 
after fire in some blackbrush communities. Successional trends are difficult to 
predict, however, as indicated by some sites where blackbrush has recovered to prefire conditions during the same time interval 
[<a href="#268">268</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Pinyon-juniper:</b></font> 
In pinyon-juniper ecosystems in the Great Basin, cheatgrass most commonly occurs 
and has its highest cover in early to mid-successional stages [<a href="#145">145</a>,<a href="#206">206</a>,<a href="#244">244</a>,<a href="#327">327</a>,<a href="#483">483</a>]. Cheatgrass also frequently 
occurs in mature pinyon-juniper communities at low
densities. Succession in Colorado pinyon-Utah juniper in the Green River
corridor in Utah generally proceeds in the following pattern: grasses and forbs
dominate early successional stages followed by shrubs
(up to 50 years after fire), shrubs with open trees (60 to 100 years after fire),
trees with understory shrubs (100 to 200 years after fire) and mature pinyon-juniper (200 years
after fire until the next disturbance) [<a href="#166">166</a>]. As pinyon-juniper stands increase in density and approach crown closure, 
herbaceous cover [<a href="#415">415</a>] and seed production [<a href="#150">150</a>,<a href="#245">245</a>] decline. See Goodrich [<a href="#166">166</a>] for further descriptions of crown cover, 
stand structure, plant composition, and ground cover
attributes that are representative of each stage.</p>

<p>Postfire succession in pinyon-juniper woodlands is largely dependent on the degree of crown closure of the
overstory before disturbance. Recovery of native communities can be rapid
following fire in the perennial grass/forb through the shrub/open tree stages. If burned before crown
closure has eliminated the understory, the onset of precipitation and warm
temperatures encourages native woody species to sprout and native seeds to 
germinate [<a href="#166">166</a>].
Because cheatgrass is nearly ubiquitous in these woodlands and native species 
are lacking in the understory and seed bank of mature stands, cheatgrass and other nonnative 
species are likely to invade and/or dominate early successional stages following 
disturbance in mature pinyon-juniper stands if sites are not artificially seeded [<a href="#166">166</a>,<a href="#349">349</a>,<a href="#392">392</a>]. Nonnative annuals may
subsequently prevent perennials from establishing [<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#149">149</a>,<a href="#166">166</a>].
Annual cover, often dominated by cheatgrass, can increase rapidly, achieving 
ground cover closure of 60-80% in 5 to 10
years. This stage can persist for 20 years or longer, and may
persist until pinyon and juniper return as dominants, or may be
perpetuated by frequent fires fueled by cheatgrass. On some Colorado pinyon-Utah juniper sites with south
aspects in the Green River corridor, cheatgrass has dominated for 80 years
[<a href="#167">167</a>]. It has been suggested that with seeding, a perennial community can be well developed within 2 years
even with a strong presence of cheatgrass [<a href="#166">166</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, grand fir, and western redcedar forests:</b></font>
Grazing
in ponderosa pine/Idaho fescue associations in northeastern Washington may cause
an irreversible shift to understory dominance by cheatgrass and other nonnative
invasive species such as Dalmatian toadflax and common St. Johnswort [<a href="#115">115</a>]. 
Cheatgrass is also an early seral invader after logging and grazing in the 
Douglas-fir/ninebark association on sites in northern Idaho, although it appears 
to decrease in cover as succession progresses and shade increases [<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>]. 
Cheatgrass is present in early successional stages after logging and burning in 
grand fir series in the Wallowa Mountains of Washington [<a href="#159">159</a>]. In Douglas-fir in 
south-central Idaho, cheatgrass 
established after fire and remained at 4-8% cover for 5 years  and 
then increased to 20% cover, 6 and 7 years after fire [<a href="#259">259</a>].</p>

<p>Research by Pierson and Mack [<a href="#343">343</a>,<a href="#344">344</a>] in mature ponderosa pine, 
Douglas-fir, grand fir, and western redcedar  stands suggests that cheatgrass is unlikely to spread and persist in these 
forest habitats unless the scale and incidence of disturbance is severe and
frequent enough to prevent canopy closure. Establishment of cheatgrass in low-elevation ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir 
forests can be enhanced by disturbance that opens the 
understory,  removes litter, or both. Cheatgrass is unlikely to establish in grand
fir and western redcedar habitat types without simultaneous opening of  the overstory and 
understory [<a href="#344">344</a>]. Surviving cheatgrass plants in these forest types tend to be small and
produce few, if any, seeds. Cheatgrass 
appears to persist within these forest zones on open sites where temperatures 
rise sooner in spring and  light is not  limiting  [<a href="#343">343</a>]. At least in part, cheatgrass is largely restricted to 
forest gaps because of its intolerance of shade. Shading cheatgrass reduces its rate of 
growth, number of tillers, and  ability to replace leaf area lost to herbivory. These responses, in turn, intensify 
the effects of competition and defoliation on cheatgrass in forests [<a href="#345">345</a>].</p>



<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT">
SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Cheatgrass phenology and biomass allocation vary between populations. Plants in 
arid steppe sites flower and set seed earlier that those from mesic steppe or 
forest habitats [<a href="#364">364</a>]. Cheatgrass is usually a winter annual [<a href="#147">147</a>]. Its seeds typically germinate in 
the early fall when moisture becomes sufficient. In southern Idaho, about 2 inches (50 
mm) of concentrated early fall 
precipitation is required to stimulate about 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm) of fall growth 
[<a href="#210">210</a>]. After fall germination, cheatgrass plants grow rapidly until cold 
temperatures arrive [<a href="#437">437</a>]. Cheatgrass seedlings emerging in late August 
to September may die during a period of dry, hot weather [<a href="#186">186</a>,<a href="#263">263</a>]. Seedling 
death rates decline with later-emerging seedlings, and few plants die during the 
winter and spring regardless of emergence date [<a href="#263">263</a>].

<p>Cheatgrass roots often continue to develop during winter, while aboveground 
growth is minimal [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>,<a href="#306">306</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>]. In mild winter weather,
cheatgrass plants can tiller and produce many adventitious roots [<a href="#189">189</a>].</p>

<p>Harris [<a href="#186">186</a>] provides a detailed examination of root phenological development in
cheatgrass, as compared with medusahead and bluebunch wheatgrass. He concludes
that fall germination and winter growth, even at near-freezing soil temperatures, allows annuals to 
increase number and length of roots during winter so that by
spring, they are in control of the site and exhaust upper profile moisture supplies
to the detriment of bluebunch wheatgrass. Cheatgrass roots continue 
to grow at 37 degrees Fahrenheit (3 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C), 
while bluebunch wheatgrass roots remain dormant until soil temperatures reaches 46 to 50 
degrees Fahrenheit (8-10 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) in late April [<a href="#186">186</a>].</p>

<p>Studies in Washington and Idaho suggest the following sequence of 
development in cheatgrass: Increase in cheatgrass root length occurs between 
mid-December and mid-March, and may reach 36 inches (90 cm) by mid-March [<a href="#189">189</a>], 
with additional growth between mid-March and mid-April. The aerial portion of 
cheatgrass plants resumes growth after mid-March, with no further increase in 
height after emergence of inflorescences around mid-May. Prior to April, 
cheatgrass' root system consists primarily of a single main root with short 
laterals. About the time the aerial portion of the plants begins regrowth, more 
lateral development of the root systems may be observed. By the time of spring 
emergence of associated perennial species, cheatgrass has its root system near 
fully developed [<a href="#199">199</a>]. Therefore, when bluebunch wheatgrass seedlings need 
moisture to survive the summer, cheatgrass has already depleted moisture beyond 
the depth of bluebunch wheatgrass roots [<a href="#186">186</a>]. Cheatgrass plants with multiple 
culms tend to develop a more extensive root system than those with only a single 
culm. Tillering is evident by April 
[<a href="#199">199</a>].</p>

<p>Cheatgrass shoot growth typically occurs in late winter or early spring and 
continues until soil moisture is exhausted [<a href="#210">210</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>]. 
Growth and development is rapid, and plants may flower, develop seeds, and 
become fully dried within 2 to 3 months [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>,<a href="#405">405</a>]. 
Greenhouse studies indicate a requirement for either vernalization or short
day lengths to initiate panicle production in cheatgrass, followed by long day lengths
necessary for flowering [<a href="#154">154</a>]. As a winter annual, 
cheatgrass usually flowers in spring, from mid-April through June [<a href="#437">437</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>]. The anthers of cheatgrass florets
open over about an 11-day period. Seeds reach the dough stage in mid- to late May and are usually ripe 
in June or July [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#405">405</a>,<a href="#437">437</a>,<a href="#474">474</a>]. Cheatgrass seeds shatter within a week after maturity [<a href="#437">437</a>]. Plants die and become dry 
after seeds are ripe, or after early summer
drought [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#405">405</a>,<a href="#474">474</a>]. This occurs by June 5 
at lower elevations (2,000-4,000 feet (60-1,200 m)) in southwestern Idaho, and by about June 
30 in southeastern Idaho, where the season is later because of higher elevation 
(4,500-6,000 feet (1,370-1,830 m)) [<a href="#405">405</a>]. Corresponding stages are about 6 weeks 
later in bluebunch wheatgrass [<a href="#186">186</a>]. In hot weather, cheatgrass roots are 
unable to supply enough moisture to prevent a drop of leaf water potential, 
resulting in  desiccation and death of the plant [<a href="#437">437</a>].</p>

<p>During ripening, cheatgrass plants turn purple and then brown as they mature 
and senesce. A sudden drop in temperature or a sudden drought causes purple 
coloration that fades when growing conditions become more favorable [<a href="#405">405</a>]. Seeds 
are viable when the fruits have barely started to turn purple and are still 
mostly green [<a href="#207">207</a>]. Seeds begin to fall shortly after the purple stage 
is reached [<a href="#210">210</a>]. Some viable seed is produced 
even when the inflorescences are clipped before any purple coloration appears 
[<a href="#207">207</a>]. The characteristic color changes in cheatgrass while it is curing (from green 
to purple to straw color) are proposed as an indicator of impending flammability 
because these colors are generally correlated with progressive drying of plants. 
The onset of purple coloring may be taken as a warning that hazardous fire 
conditions will develop within 2 weeks 
[<a href="#312">312</a>]. Variations in phenology of about 20 days (emergence of inflorescences, 
development of purple color, drying, and browning) were observed by Hulbert [<a href="#207">207</a>] 
in plants grown from seed from different geographic locations, and in plants 
grown under different environmental conditions (location, aspect, elevation).</p>

Cheatgrass may act as a spring annual if fall moisture is inadequate [<a href="#235">235</a>]. 
Some cheatgrass plants that do not produce seed during the spring-summer growing 
season will overwinter and produce seed the following spring [<a href="#306">306</a>].&nbsp;Observations of a &quot;second crop&quot; of 
cheatgrass in the late spring have been reported and attributed to 
the stimulation of growth of new tillers by late spring rains after the 
cheatgrass had already turned purple [<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>].

<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font> 
Cheatgrass establishes from 
soil-stored and transported seed after fire (e.g. [<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#192">192</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#213">213</a>,<a href="#485">485</a>,<a href="#487">487</a>]). It 
has long been known that cheatgrass is highly adapted to a regime of frequent 
fires [<a href="#252">252</a>,<a href="#340">340</a>]. Cheatgrass has a very fine structure, tends to accumulate 
litter, and dries completely in early summer, thus becoming a highly flammable, 
often continuous fuel [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#338">338</a>,<a href="#405">405</a>,<a href="#474">474</a>,<a href="#475">475</a>]. By the time of burning most cheatgrass seeds are 
already on the ground, and those not near  the heat of  burning shrubs can survive and allow cheatgrass to pioneer in the
newly burned area [<a href="#46">46</a>]. Even if fire comes when
cheatgrass plants are still
green and kills them before they can set seed, there may be enough viable 
cheatgrass seed in litter and upper layers of soil for plants to
reestablish (e.g. [<a href="#132">132</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>,<a href="#209">209</a>,<a href="#485">485</a>]).

<p>Cheatgrass is a strong competitor in the postfire environment, where
it  takes advantage of increased resource availability and produces an abundant seed
crop [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#228">228</a>,<a href="#483">483</a>]. A cheatgrass population may average around 1,000 plants 
per square foot (10,750 per m<sup>2</sup>) prior to burning. During a wildfire, most of the cheatgrass seeds 
beneath the canopy of
sagebrush plants are killed by the heat associated with the burning of the
shrub. Some cheatgrass seeds located in the interspaces among shrubs
are also consumed, while those that are buried or lying in cracks in the soil will likely
survive. The next season,&nbsp;surviving seeds germinate and establish at
a density of about 1 plant per square foot (11/m<sup>2</sup>). These plants are 
released from competition, and have more  water and nutrients available to them. The 
cheatgrass plants in this sparse population can produce abundant tillers, each 
supporting many flowers, thus producing a large seed crop [<a href="#486">486</a>].</p>

<p>Young and others [<a href="#486">486</a>] provide an illustration of cheatgrass fire adaptations 
with an example from a big sagebrush ecosystem which suggests that hybridization 
in postfire populations contributes to the success of cheatgrass in these 
ecosystems. Studies by Novak (e.g. [<a href="#317">317</a>,<a href="#318">318</a>,<a href="#320">320</a>]) and by Pyke and Novak [<a href="#353">353</a>] suggest, however, that &quot;the success of cheatgrass throughout many areas in 
western North America is not due to genetic variation but perhaps due to 
phenotypic plasticity.&quot; 
See the section on <a href="botanical_and_ecological_characteristics.html#REGENERATION PROCESSES">Regeneration Processes</a> 
for more information.</p>

<p>Fire facilitates cheatgrass dominance on some sites by interrupting
successional trajectories of postfire plant communities, and cheatgrass facilitates
fire and can thus shorten the
interval between fires [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#261">261</a>,<a href="#405">405</a>,<a href="#454">454</a>,<a href="#460">460</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>]. This grass/fire cycle
is a serious ecological threat on sites where most native plant species are poorly
adapted to fire [<a href="#69">69</a>] and is recognized in many ecosystems worldwide [<a href="#108">108</a>]. This cycle has been documented in 
the Great Basin since the 1930s [<a href="#340">340</a>,<a href="#342">342</a>,<a href="#460">460</a>,<a href="#483">483</a>], and has been reported in the Mojave and Sonoran deserts beginning in the 
early 1980s [<a href="#71">71</a>]. The result is a type conversion from native shrub and perennial grasslands to
annual grasslands adapted to frequent fires.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font>   
Cheatgrass expansion has
dramatically changed fire regimes and plant communities over vast areas of
western rangelands by creating an environment where fires are easily
ignited, spread rapidly, cover large areas, and occur frequently [<a href="#483">483</a>]. An
estimated 80,000 km<sup>2</sup> of primarily shrubland and grassland communities 
in the Great Basin have fire regimes that have been seriously altered because of 
the presence of cheatgrass. Approximately 67% of this area is in ecosystems that 
historically experienced mixed-severity fires at intervals of 35 to 100+ years; 
and about 25% is in areas that historically experienced low-severity fires at 
intervals of 0 to 35 years [<a href="#282">282</a>]. Cheatgrass promotes more frequent fires by 
increasing the biomass and horizontal continuity of fine fuels that persist 
during the summer lightning season and by allowing fire to spread across 
landscapes where fire was previously restricted to isolated patches 
[<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#240">240</a>,<a href="#405">405</a>,<a href="#460">460</a>,<a href="#474">474</a>,<a href="#483">483</a>]. Fire in these habitats can have severe 
effects on native species of plants and animals, although the impact of fire 
regime changes may differ by region and ecosystem type due to differences in the 
composition and structure of the invaded plant communities [<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#327">327</a>,<a href="#460">460</a>,<a href="#468">468</a>] and 
to climatic differences such as occurrence of
summer thunderstorms [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#238">238</a>].</p>

<p> A review by D'Antonio [<a href="#107">107</a>] suggests that species that alter the
disturbance regime of a site are those that are qualitatively different from the
rest of the species in a community (i.e. they have no
functional analogues in the invaded system). Where invaders are similar in overall
life form to natives, they tend to alter primarily fuel biomass per unit area of
ground. This in turn has the potential to influence fire intensity, or slightly
modify the existing fire regime, as may be the case with cheatgrass invasion in
the more mesic temperate grasslands of North America [<a href="#173">173</a>].&nbsp;Where
invaders have no functional analogues (in terms of fuel characteristics) in the
invaded system, they have the potential to alter fire frequency and even to introduce fire to 
ecosystems where it had no evolutionary
role, resulting in a complete alteration of that community [<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#173">173</a>].
This has been the case with the introduction of cheatgrass in sagebrush
grasslands, desert shrublands, and pinyon-juniper woodlands over extensive
areas in the Columbia and Great basins and other areas the Intermountain West.
In these systems, cheatgrass fills  spaces between widely spaced vegetation
and dries earlier than most
native species. Thus, from the time plants dry until the onset of fall rains, cheatgrass stands present a fire
hazard not usually found in vegetation native to the areas where it is most
invasive.&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Sagebrush steppe:</font>
Historic fire regimes are variable in big sagebrush/bunchgrass ecosystems, 
with fire return intervals ranging between 10 and 70 years 
[<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#292">292</a>,<a href="#330">330</a>,<a href="#378">378</a>,<a href="#440">440</a>,<a href="#484">484</a>]. 
The introduction and increasing dominance of cheatgrass has changed the seasonal 
occurrence and increased the frequency and size of wildfires in these 
ecosystems, thus altering successional patterns [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#338">338</a>,<a href="#363">363</a>,<a href="#453">453</a>,<a href="#460">460</a>,<a href="#475">475</a>].&nbsp;The 
degree of change and impacts on native ecosystems varies with differences in 
species composition and structure of invaded plant communities [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#389">389</a>].</p>

<p>Historic fire seasons in the sagebrush steppe occurred between July and 
September [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#237">237</a>,<a href="#483">483</a>], with the middle to end of August being the period of 
the most extreme fire conditions [<a href="#79">79</a>]. Cheatgrass matures by July, while most native 
herbaceous species it replaces mature in late August. With cheatgrass dominant, 
wildfires tend to occur earlier in the season, when 
native perennials  are more susceptible to injury by
burning [<a href="#474">474</a>,<a href="#475">475</a>]. Where cheatgrass has invaded  the Snake River Plains of Idaho, the natural fire cycle has 
shortened from 30-100 years to
3-5 years [<a href="#460">460</a>]. Fires are larger and more uniform, with fewer
patches of unburned vegetation remaining within burns [<a href="#338">338</a>,<a href="#460">460</a>]. These altered fire regimes
and subsequent changes in botanical composition can occur with or without livestock grazing
[<a href="#460">460</a>].</p>

<p>Wyoming big sagebrush communities are the most xeric of the big sagebrush 
communities, and the subspecies is more susceptible to fire than the other big 
sagebrush subspecies [<a href="#426">426</a>]. When Wyoming big sagebrush communities burn, 
resulting vegetation is generally dominated by annuals such as Russian-thistle, 
tumblemustard, and cheatgrass [<a href="#426">426</a>,<a href="#474">474</a>]. Fire-tolerant, sprouting shrubs (e.g. 
rabbitbrush, horsebrush, and ephedra) may persist for awhile, but they cannot 
tolerate the short fire-free intervals that are common with nonnative annual 
grass dominance [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#338">338</a>,<a href="#340">340</a>,<a href="#460">460</a>,<a href="#472">472</a>,<a href="#474">474</a>]. Continued increases in fire 
frequency eventually remove and exclude all perennial shrubs, grasses, and forbs 
from these communities, and cheatgrass competition prevents their 
reestablishment [<a href="#338">338</a>,<a href="#460">460</a>,<a href="#475">475</a>,<a href="#483">483</a>]. Large areas of fire-induced annual 
communities occur in areas formerly occupied by the Wyoming big sagebrush cover 
type [<a href="#290">290</a>,<a href="#426">426</a>]. </p>

<p>Basin big sagebrush is also very susceptible to fire. After fires in basin 
big sagebrush communities, annuals usually dominate, and shrubs such as 
rabbitbrush and horsebrush may increase. Competition from annuals (cheatgrass 
and medusahead) makes reestablishment of native grasses difficult 
[<a href="#424">424</a>,<a href="#426">426</a>,<a href="#475">475</a>,<a href="#476">476</a>,<a href="#483">483</a>].</p>

<p>Mountain big sagebrush generally has a higher capacity for recovery following 
disturbance than  Wyoming and basin big sagebrush, with a high degree of 
variability between sites. Cheatgrass increases with grazing in mountain big 
sagebrush communities, but does not dominate to the extent that it does in drier 
sagebrush types. Mountain big sagebrush is easily killed by fire, but 
reestablishes readily from seed and tends to form dense stands after fire 
[<a href="#290">290</a>,<a href="#425">425</a>]. Mountain big sagebrush stands may recover within 15 to 20 years after fire, 
while stands of Wyoming big sagebrush may not be fully recovered after 50 to 75 years 
[<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>]. Work by Miller and Heyerdahl [<a href="#294">294</a>] indicates a high degree of spatial
variability in historic fire 
regimes in mountain big sagebrush. In the arid mountain big sagebrush/western 
needlegrass association, high-severity fires occurred 
at more than 200-year intervals, while the more mesic 
mountain big sagebrush/Idaho fescue associations experienced low-severity fires
at 10- to 20-year intervals [<a href="#294">294</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Salt-desert shrubland:</font> 
Fires were historically infrequent in salt-desert 
shrublands. Desert shrublands usually lack sufficient fine fuels to carry fire, with 
widely spaced shrubs and bunchgrasses and relatively bare interspaces [<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>,<a href="#452">452</a>,<a href="#454">454</a>]. 
Historic fire return 
intervals in these ecosystems (dominated by saltbush, greasewood, creosote, and blackbrush) are 
thought to average between 35 and 100 years or more [<a href="#330">330</a>]. Most native plant species in the deserts of 
North America are poorly
adapted to survive fire ([<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>] and references therein).</p>

<p>While cheatgrass had established in some of these areas earlier this
century [<a href="#254">254</a>,<a href="#452">452</a>,<a href="#456">456</a>,<a href="#496">496</a>], West&nbsp;[<a href="#454">454</a>] suggests that
it did not dominate until the
wet years of 1983-1985. Landscapes dominated by alien
annual grasses, especially annual bromes (<i>Bromus</i> spp.) are more flammable 
than those dominated by native forbs in the Mojave Desert. Brooks [<a href="#69">69</a>] 
suggests several possible reasons for this, including: a higher surface-to-volume 
ratio of grasses compared to forbs; more continuous vegetative cover; and the 
ability of alien annual grasses to remain rooted and upright longer than native 
forbs, allowing them to persist as flammable fuels into the summer, when the 
threat of fire is highest [<a href="#69">69</a>]. Thick layers of annual plant litter 
accumulate quickly and decompose very slowly in
desert regions [<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>]. Following 2 or more years with 
above-average precipitation, 
sufficient fuel may be present to sustain a wildfire [<a href="#238">238</a>] and convert 
the plant community to cheatgrass (or other nonnative annual grasses) 
indefinitely [<a href="#337">337</a>]. In experimental fires in the Mojave Desert, accumulations of
litter led to particularly hot temperatures, long flame residence times, and
continuous burn patterns [<a href="#69">69</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p>Postfire plant communities in the Mojave and Sonoran deserts
are typically dominated by nonnative annual grasses ([<a href="#69">69</a>] and
references therein), so  burned areas are likely to be more susceptible to fire than unburned areas. Brooks and Pyke [<a href="#71">71</a>]
note that fire regimes
in the Mojave and Sonoran deserts are beginning to shift
toward short-return intervals. Repeated fires stress
and kill native perennials. Eventually wind and water erosion may occur,
removing and diluting soil organic matter and attendant nutrient concentrations
and safe sites around shrubs. After fire has eliminated
native perennials, essential mycorrhizae may  also be eliminated [<a href="#463">463</a>].&nbsp;Biological soil crusts are also killed by 
severe fire, and the unusually large, frequent
fires associated with cheatgrass dominance can preclude crust species 
recolonization and succession [<a href="#41">41</a>]. West [<a href="#454">454</a>] gives some specific examples of fire effects on salt desert
shrub ecosystems in Utah and Nevada.</p>

<p><font size="4" face="Bell MT">Pinyon-juniper:</font>
Pinyon-juniper woodlands are characterized by a
large number of diverse habitat types that vary in tree and herbaceous species
composition and density, and fire regime characteristics. Fire severity and 
frequency vary, depending largely on site productivity. On less productive sites 
with discontinuous grass cover, fires were probably infrequent, small, and patchy [<a href="#330">330</a>]. Fire
intervals were probably greater than 100 years in these areas, but did occur
more frequently under extreme conditions [<a href="#172">172</a>]. On more
productive sites where grass
cover was more continuous, fire intervals may have been 10
years or less, maintaining more open stands. Historical fire regimes in
dense stands were a mixture of surface and crown fires, with surface fires at
intervals of 10-50 years and crown fires at intervals of 200-300 years or longer.&nbsp;Fire
susceptibility in pinyon-juniper communities also depends on the stage of stand development. In young open stands,
shrubs and herbaceous cover may be sufficient to carry fire, but as the stand
approaches crown closure, herbaceous cover
declines and eventually becomes too sparse to carry fire [<a href="#330">330</a>].</p>

<p>A dramatic increase in fire size and frequency
has been observed in pinyon-juniper woodlands as cover of nonnative annuals such
as cheatgrass increases [<a href="#289">289</a>,<a href="#481">481</a>]. Where fires have burned
in singleleaf pinyon-Utah juniper woodland invaded by cheatgrass in Nevada, the woodland is being replaced by great expanses of
annual grassland dominated by cheatgrass [<a href="#48">48</a>]. Cooler and more mesic woodlands
seem to be less susceptible to invasion and complete dominance by introduced
annuals; however, more information is needed regarding factors that influence
pinyon-juniper woodlands susceptibility to invasion [<a href="#289">289</a>].</p>

<p>Prolonged livestock grazing and fire suppression have contributed to a 
decline of perennial grasses and an increase in shrubs and trees at many 
pinyon-juniper sites [<a href="#251">251</a>,<a href="#327">327</a>]. A subsequent increase in the number of large, 
high-severity fires due to invasion by nonnative annuals such as cheatgrass 
has resulted in a loss of these shrubs and trees [<a href="#327">327</a>]. When cheatgrass is present in the 
understory with little or no perennial vegetation, removing pinyon and juniper 
trees usually leads to cheatgrass dominance 
[<a href="#346">346</a>].</p>

<p>Many <font size="4" face="Bell MT">dry temperate conifer forests</font> have become susceptible to severe 
wildfires because of the dense forest structure that results from a century of 
fire exclusion and past management practices (e.g. [<a href="#20">20</a>]). Fires in these 
ecosystems, especially fires of high severity, can lead to 
invasion and dominance of cheatgrass. At Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park, 
prescribed burning in ponderosa pine in the Cedar Grove section appears to have promoted vigorous 
invasion of cheatgrass [<a href="#228">228</a>]. Cheatgrass had higher cover on severely 
burned sites, compared to less severely burned sites, in ponderosa pine in 
Arizona [<a href="#105">105</a>]. The presence of
cheatgrass-dominated ecosystems adjacent to these dense forests is also likely to
cause larger, more frequent, and more severe wildfires [<a href="#191">191</a>]. Cheatgrass fueled a large wildfire in 
the ponderosa pine forest type in
Oregon as early as 1938 [<a href="#449">449</a>]. Fire effects on many  species, and the effects of 
invasives on disturbance regimes in temperate and boreal forests, are still poorly
understood [<a href="#191">191</a>].</p>

<p>In <font size="4" face="Bell MT">temperate grasslands</font> 
of North America, fire has historically been 
an important selective force, and native communities are well adapted to 
frequent fires in most cases. Cheatgrass is more commonly found in the northern 
portion of these temperate grasslands. In more arid habitats with low 
natural fire frequencies cheatgrass is able to replace native species. In mesic grasslands, 
however, cheatgrass does not compete as successfully against
native perennial grasses, and it does not appear to pose as great  a threat to
native communities. The effects of new species that create
greater fuel loads and/or increase the probability of fire or the rate of fire
spread are expected to have less dramatic effects in these communities [<a href="#173">173</a>].</p>

<p>A review by Grace and others [<a href="#173">173</a>] suggests that cheatgrass is favored by occasional burning
at study sites within shortgrass steppe and mixed-grass prairies.  Smith and Knapp [<a href="#391">391</a>] provide evidence
that cheatgrass and other nonnative species are less frequent on tallgrass prairie sites
at Konza Prairie, Kansas, that are annually burned than they are on unburned
sites. Across the broad range of conditions and circumstances that occur in
temperate grasslands, a complex interplay of contemporary and
historical factors will ultimately determine how fire interrelates with
invasive species [<a href="#173">173</a>].</p>

<p><font size="4" face="Bell MT">Cheatgrass fire regime:</font> 
Cheatgrass often dominates postfire plant communities, and once established, cheatgrass-dominated 
grasslands greatly increase the
potential and recurrence of wildfires. Cheatgrass fires tend to burn fast and cover large 
areas, with a fire season from 1 to 3 months longer than that of native 
rangeland [<a href="#330">330</a>,<a href="#368">368</a>]. The average fire-return interval 
for cheatgrass-dominated stands is less than 10 years [<a href="#330">330</a>], 
and is about 3 to 6 years on the Snake River Plain as reported by Whisenant 
[<a href="#460">460</a>] and Peters and Bunting [<a href="#338">338</a>]. This adaptation to and promotion of frequent 
fires is what gives
cheatgrass its
greatest competitive advantage in ecosystems that evolved with less frequent
fires. The cheatgrass-fire cycle is self-promoting, as it reduces the ability of
many perennial grasses and shrubs to re-establish and furthers the dominance of
cheatgrass [<a href="#333">333</a>,<a href="#338">338</a>].&nbsp;Moisture
availability can affect cheatgrass productivity and thus affect fuel loads on a
site. Drought years may reduce the dominance of cheatgrass in both recently
burned and unburned areas, thus decreasing fuel loads and the chance of fire
[<a href="#238">238</a>].</p>

<p>The following table provides some fire regime intervals for ecosystems in 
which cheatgrass may occur. For further information, see the FEIS summary on the

IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Live cheatgrass plants are susceptible to heat kill, as with a flame thrower or 
handled propane torch,
though they are difficult to burn when green. When cheatgrass plants are dry
enough to burn, they are already dead, and have already set seed. Fire will then reduce
cheatgrass plants to ash.

<p>Cheatgrass seeds are also susceptible to heat kill,
but can survive
fires of low-severity if the entire litter
layer is not consumed or if seeds are buried deeply enough to be insulated from 
the heat
[<a href="#475">475</a>]. The amount of litter or ash left on a site is a good indicator of 
the amount of cheatgrass seed surviving on that site [<a href="#489">489</a>]. Low density of cheatgrass   
immediately following fire [<a href="#483">483</a>] indicates either low numbers of cheatgrass seed in 
the seed bank, or poor survival of seeds during fire [<a href="#229">229</a>].</p>

<span class="subframeName"><a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT">
DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT:</a>
</span>
<br />

The effects of fire on cheatgrass plants and seeds vary with timing and severity of fire
and the composition and density of the prefire plant community.

<p>If fire occurs when seed remains in panicles above ground, most seeds will 
be killed and cheatgrass density will decline 
immediately following fire [<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#352">352</a>].&nbsp;The chances of seed surviving fire 
are enhanced once they have dispersed onto or beneath the soil surface [<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>]. In sagebrush communities, most of the 
litter and cheatgrass seeds are found under the canopies of sagebrush plants 
[<a href="#482">482</a>]. The woody biomass of the shrub, plus litter accumulations, provide 
sufficient fuel to elevate temperatures high enough for a long enough period to 
consume cheatgrass seeds on these microsites. Some cheatgrass seeds in the 
interspace zones are also consumed by  fire, but many survive even though the 
cheatgrass herbage is completely consumed [<a href="#475">475</a>]. Fire from herbaceous fuel 
alone is not 
usually hot enough to consume cheatgrass seeds [<a href="#147">147</a>]. Although fires in pure 
cheatgrass stands, without woody fuel, are less severe, cheatgrass seed banks 
can be substantially reduced after fire&nbsp;[<a href="#489">489</a>]. For example, after a 
fire in a community dominated by cheatgrass, tumblemustard, and Russian-thistle 
in Utah, postfire density of cheatgrass seeds in the seed bank was &lt;3% of that 
on unburned plots. Densities of cheatgrass seeds were higher on a low-severity 
burn compared with a high-severity burn. Nonetheless, the seed bank recovered to preburn levels after 
l growing season, even on the more 
severely burned site [<a href="#213">213</a>].</p>


<span class="subframeName"><a name="PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE">
PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Cheatgrass establishes from soil-stored and transported seed after fire (e.g. 
[<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#192">192</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#213">213</a>,<a href="#485">485</a>,<a href="#487">487</a>]). On preferred sites where cheatgrass thrives in the 
Intermountain West, cheatgrass can establish or maintain dominance in the postfire
environment (e.g. [<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#271">271</a>]),
sometimes maintaining dominance for decades (e.g. [<a href="#48">48</a>]), even after
artificial seeding with competitive plants (e.g. [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#169">169</a>,<a href="#327">327</a>]).

<p>Cheatgrass may also invade recently burned sites where it does not usually 
dominate or did not previously occur (e.g. [<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>,<a href="#228">228</a>,<a href="#259">259</a>]) if there is an 
available seed source. For example, pinyon-juniper woodlands with large, continuous tree canopies 
limit herbaceous understory and facilitate severe summer fires that promote invasion of 
nonnative species such as cheatgrass and red brome  [<a href="#457">457</a>]. Koniak and Everett 
[<a href="#245">245</a>] observed that most of the seed bank in a mature singleleaf pinyon stand 
in California consisted of annuals, many of which were not present in the community as mature 
plants. Fire can promote  germination of these dormant seeds by consuming litter containing
allelopathic compounds [<a href="#327">327</a>],
and/or altering the nutrient, water, microbial, temperature, and light regimes of
the seedbed [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#244">244</a>,<a href="#327">327</a>].</p>

<p>There are some examples in the literature reporting decreased density of 
cheatgrass in the 1st postfire year (e.g. [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#348">348</a>,<a href="#461">461</a>]). Others report increased cover of cheatgrass the 1st
postfire year in ponderosa
pine [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#283">283</a>], sagebrush [<a href="#5">5</a>], shadscale [<a href="#176">176</a>], bluebunch wheatgrass [<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#408">408</a>], and
cheatgrass communities [<a href="#89">89</a>]. These studies provide no additional
information on plant community changes in subsequent years.</p>

<p>More common are reports that cheatgrass density decreases the 1st postfire year and
approximately equals preburn density by the 2nd or 3rd postfire year in sagebrush
[<a href="#110">110</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>,<a href="#331">331</a>,<a href="#378">378</a>,<a href="#483">483</a>], desert  shrub [<a href="#83">83</a>], cheatgrass [<a href="#114">114</a>],
and antelope bitterbrush/cheatgrass communities [<a href="#79">79</a>].
This is because many cheatgrass seeds are killed by fire [<a href="#192">192</a>,<a href="#213">213</a>,<a href="#378">378</a>]: A majority of cheatgrass seeds are 
found under shrub canopies which 
tend to be the microsites that experience the greatest fire severity [<a href="#192">192</a>,<a href="#489">489</a>]. In a northern Nevada study, 
fire reduced cheatgrass seed 
density approximately 96% to 99%, from 5,000 to 8,000 seeds per square 
meter to 20 to 300 seeds per square meter [<a href="#489">489</a>]. Thus the 
number and density of cheatgrass plants are reduced the 1st postfire year.&nbsp;These
plants, however, respond to the released environmental potential resulting from the reduction in plant density 
and increased water and nutrient availability, 
and can become large
plants with many tillers and high seed production [<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#212">212</a>,<a href="#283">283</a>,<a href="#483">483</a>].</p>

<p>Young and Evans [<a href="#483">483</a>] recorded 10 cheatgrass plants per square meter 1 year 
after fire, and 10,000 plants per square meter 3 years after fire. On an unburned control plot, the maximum number of seeds on a 
cheatgrass plant was 250.&nbsp;On  burned plots, the lowest seed production per 
plant 1 year after fire was 
960 [<a href="#483">483</a>]. While plant and seed bank density may decrease the
1st postfire year, biomass and seed production may
equal or exceed that of the prefire population, resulting in increased plant and 
seed bank density by the 2nd or 3rd postfire year [<a href="#192">192</a>,<a href="#213">213</a>,<a href="#327">327</a>,<a href="#475">475</a>,<a href="#483">483</a>]. The 
increase to peak population density of cheatgrass after fire may require several 
years on some sites [<a href="#229">229</a>]. These increases in cheatgrass plant and seed bank 
density can prevent the establishment of natives and predispose the vegetation 
to recurring wildfires [<a href="#483">483</a>].</p>

<p>A few studies found that cheatgrass increased in the early postfire years and
then decreased over time. These include a wildfire in a northeastern California
antelope bitterbrush/bottlebrush squirreltail community [<a href="#102">102</a>]; fires on sites dominated by some combination of mountain big
sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, Saskatoon serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier 
alnifolia</i>), Wyoming big sagebrush,
and true mountain-mahogany (<i>Cercocarpus montanus</i>) in south-central 
Wyoming [<a href="#100">100</a>]; and a wildfire under ponderosa pine in Idaho [<a href="#283">283</a>]. A study of 
several burns in Utah juniper-singleleaf pinyon communities in west-central Utah 
found that cheatgrass cover varied from 12.6% in a 3-year-old burn to 0.9% in 
the oldest stands (85-90 years without fire). On these sites, cheatgrass was one of the initial dominant 
annuals, reaching maximum density in the first 3 to 4 years [<a href="#31">31</a>]. Cheatgrass declined in cover the first 22 years after 
fire, then leveled off and stayed about the same for the remainder of the 
invasion sequence [<a href="#32">32</a>]. Similarly, in California chamise 
(<i>Adenostoma fasciculatum</i>) chaparral sites, cheatgrass was most abundant 3 
to 5 years after fire, and its 
abundance tapered off as brush cover closed. Prior to burning, cheatgrass and 
other annual grasses were found only along trails, firebreaks, and openings [<a href="#205">205</a>].</p>

<p>Examples where fire seems to have had little or no effect  on cheatgrass populations include several 
sagebrush/bunchgrass sites in the northern Great Basin,
where cheatgrass populations were unchanged by prescribed fire treatments over 3 years 
of the study [<a href="#81">81</a>]. In a mountain meadow bordering Jeffrey pine in the 
Sierra Nevada, cheatgrass was present in both burned and unburned dry meadow 
plots but showed no apparent response to prescribed fires [<a href="#68">68</a>]. In a mountain big sagebrush-antelope bitterbrush 
community with a healthy understory of perennial bunchgrasses in Oregon that was subjected to fall and spring prescribed fire, 
there was no increase of cheatgrass after fire. Perennial bunchgrasses 
increased to &gt;50% of total vegetation cover 1 to 2 years after the fire [<a href="#354">354</a>].</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE">
DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Cheatgrass response to fire depends on plant community and seed bank composition, 
density, and spatial distribution; season of burning; fire severity, frequency and 
patchiness; scale of consideration; postfire management; and climatic conditions. 
Generalizations are difficult because each combination of climate, vegetation, 
and soil must be considered separately [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#224">224</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>], as well as considerations of environmental differences both at the
time of burning and during subsequent plant reestablishment [<a href="#412">412</a>].

<p><b><font size="4" face="Bell MT">Timing of fire:</font></b> 
If burned during a crucial time during seed ripening, 
fire can greatly reduce the density of the succeeding cheatgrass stand [<a href="#309">309</a>]; 
however, postfire seed production may equal or exceed that of the prefire population, 
resulting in increased density the following year [<a href="#192">192</a>,<a href="#213">213</a>,<a href="#327">327</a>,<a href="#475">475</a>,<a href="#483">483</a>]. Timing 
of fire is important also because of variable damage to potential competitors in 
the native community. For example, cool-season perennial grasses such as 
bluebunch wheatgrass and western wheatgrass may be less damaged by late-summer wildfires than by fires earlier in the 
growing season [<a href="#327">327</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Fire size and frequency:</b></font>
Nonnative, invasive grasses generally benefit from fire and promote recurrent
fire. Fire kills  biologic soil crusts [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#215">215</a>,<a href="#326">326</a>],
thereby allowing more germination sites for cheatgrass for several years or even
decades, as crusts are slow to recover [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>]. 
Recurrent fires also tend to enhance cheatgrass dominance because native species 
cannot usually persist under a regime of frequent fires. Native plant assemblages are thus converted to 
nonnative annual grasslands. Frequency and size of fires is then further 
increased [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#332">332</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>].</p>



<p>Explanations of why individual cheatgrass plants thrive in the
postfire environment have been explored, but remain unclear. Blank and Young
[<a href="#66">66</a>] found that after exposing cheatgrass seeds to smoke of burning big 
sagebrush, the rates of new leaf production and leaf elongation in cheatgrass 
seedlings were significantly (p&lt;0.05)
greater than cheatgrass seedlings from untreated seed. Blank and others [<a href="#65">65</a>] 
also found that cheatgrass had significantly (p&lt;0.05) greater aboveground
mass when grown in post-wildfire soil than plants grown
in unburned soil. Individual cheatgrass plants may thrive in the postfire environment
due to temporary increases in the availability of soil nutrients,
especially inorganic nitrogen, after fire. Soil disturbance and fire are known
to accelerate mineralization of nitrogen [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#399">399</a>,<a href="#407">407</a>]. Cheatgrass displays flexibility in
effectively using both patches of nitrogen and early pulses of nitrogen which may contribute to
its effectiveness in competing with perennials [<a href="#129">129</a>]. It has been suggested 
that changes in nitrogen availability, and in the abundance of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> 
relative to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, play important roles in allowing 
cheatgrass stands to persist in much of the western United States [<a href="#399">399</a>,<a href="#478">478</a>].&nbsp;Studies by Blank and others 
[<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>] further explore changes in
soil chemistry after fire under sagebrush and cheatgrass. These differential changes may
help to explain postfire succession of cheatgrass in different microsites.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Microsite effects:</b></font>
Cheatgrass' postfire response varies between 
microsites and appears to be related to microsite fuel gradients and subsequent 
differences in fire severity between microsites. Following wildfires in 
sagebrush steppe, cheatgrass 1st dominated the interspaces between shrubs, and 
later occupied shrub subcanopy microsites [<a href="#483">483</a>,<a href="#489">489</a>]. A similar postfire 
successional pattern was observed in big sagebrush and Colorado pinyon-Utah juniper 
communities in west-central Utah [<a href="#327">327</a>]. Cheatgrass became 
dominant in the interspaces between burned trees by the 2nd postfire year. In 
the subcanopy zones of burned trees, cheatgrass did not become dominant until 
the 3rd year following fire, and was preceded by exotic annual forbs. In 
creosotebush scrub vegetation in the Mojave Desert, annual brome (red brome, 
cheatgrass, and Chilean chess<i> </i>(<i>Bromus</i> <i>berterianus</i>)) prefire 
biomass was 3 times higher under the shrub canopy than in drip line microsites. 
Following experimental fires, annual bromes had poor recovery the 1st four postfire 
years [<a href="#70">70</a>]. The 
observed patterns are probably due to higher temperatures and longer duration of 
heat exposure under canopies (i.e. higher-severity fire), where prefire fuel 
loads tend to be higher. The result is greater consumption of litter and seeds 
in subcanopy zones, leaving an unfavorable and unlikely site for cheatgrass 
germination [<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#327">327</a>]. Results presented by Blank and others [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>] suggest that 
because of cooler, briefer fires in cheatgrass microsites compared with 
sagebrush microsites, postfire soil qualities differ in concentrations of 
organic and inorganic anions, which, in turn, may influence seed germination, 
plant establishment, and mineral nutrition (i.e. postfire succession). In some 
cases, recolonization by cheatgrass after fire may be delayed by drought or in 
areas where interspace cheatgrass densities are low and seeds must disperse from 
adjacent unburned areas [<a href="#70">70</a>]. Additional research is needed to understand how 
these changes affect postfire succession in specific plant communities.</p>

<p>Effects of fire severity on postfire dominance of cheatgrass at the site scale 
were observed in ponderosa pine forests in Arizona that burned in early summer. 
Two years after fire, cheatgrass had &lt;0.5% cover in unburned sites, ~19% cover in 
high-severity burn sites, and ~3% in moderate-severity sites 
[<a href="#105">105</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Plant community effects:</b></font> The 
exact nature of secondary succession following fire in sagebrush/bunchgrass 
ecosystems is not clearly understood due to the highly variable response of 
subspecific populations of big sagebrush [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#224">224</a>]. Mountain big sagebrush is the 
most mesic of the big sagebrush subspecies, usually occurs at the highest 
elevations, is probably the best adapted to fire, and tends to have the most 
productive herbaceous component of the big sagebrush communities. It is well 
adapted to postfire establishment via seeds that are stimulated to germinate by 
light and heat. It also grows rapidly and reaches reproductive maturity within 3 
to 5 years, and populations may return to preburn levels within 15 to 20 years, 
or 30 years after a severe fire [<a href="#78">78</a>]. Young and Evans [<a href="#483">483</a>] described big 
sagebrush communities at higher elevations, under more mesic conditions, and/or 
long distances from livestock water, as those where cheatgrass was still absent 
in 1978. Mountain big sagebrush is probably 
the most likely to resist invasion by 
cheatgrass, but cheatgrass may initially dominate the postfire community, 
especially if postfire cover of perennial grasses is low [<a href="#33">33</a>]. Similarly, cheatgrass is 
often found with threetip sagebrush, but  seldom becomes a problem following fire or other types of 
disturbance [<a href="#78">78</a>].</p>

<p>Another subspecies of big sagebrush with limited distribution, xeric big 
sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i> ssp. <i>xericensis</i>), sometimes referred to as an ecotype of 
mountain big sagebrush, is found primarily in western Idaho and eastern Oregon 
and is restricted to a zone where the annual precipitation exceeds 12 inches 
(300 mm), elevation is less than 4,500 feet (1360 m), and the summers are 
relatively warm. Many of these communities are on relatively steep slopes, have a high potential for human and lightning-caused fires, 
and burn frequently. These frequently burned areas
are often dominated by cheatgrass and medusahead [<a href="#78">78</a>].
Similarly, at Craters of the Moon National Monument, Idaho, cheatgrass is most likely to occur 
in 
mountain big sagebrush communities
on  xeric sites, such as those growing at lower elevations or on cinder-derived soils, where mountain 
big sagebrush is less competitive [<a href="#33">33</a>].</p>

<p>The majority of the historic area of basin big sagebrush is now under intensive
agricultural cultivation, so these communities are now restricted
primarily to field edges, swales, and along water drainage ways in areas
dominated by other sagebrush species. Sites formerly dominated by basin big sagebrush
are susceptible to invasion by cheatgrass, and as such, vast areas of this type
have been converted to annual grasslands. Basin big sagebrush does not sprout, 
and repeated fires have eliminated it from many of the remaining sites [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>]. In eastern Oregon, 
basin big sagebrush was completely eliminated by  fall burning, while 
spring burning resulted in an 84% decrease in density. Burning in both seasons reduced cheatgrass 
density at postfire year 1 compared to prefire density&nbsp;[<a href="#378">378</a>].</p>

<p>Wyoming big sagebrush is the most arid
of the big sagebrush types, occurring on sites with annual precipitation of less than 7 inches (178 mm) in some
places. Wyoming big sagebrush and its associated perennial grasses are not well adapted to fire, as 
they evolved in low-productivity communities with few herbaceous species and 
infrequent fires. Wyoming big sagebrush establishes readily from seed after 
fire, but repeated fires rapidly diminish the on-site seed source and reduce 
opportunities for establishment. Cheatgrass predominates in early successional stands of the Wyoming
big sagebrush series in western Idaho, northern Nevada, and Oregon, thus increasing
the likelihood of fire and subsequent dominance of cheatgrass.  Once a site is dominated by
cheatgrass, the risk of wildfire increases and the possibility of succession to
perennial grasses or shrubs by natural regeneration
greatly decreases. Many Wyoming big sagebrush sites have been burned repeatedly by
wildfire, resulting in a conversion to nearly pure stands of cheatgrass [<a href="#78">78</a>].</p>

<p>Cheatgrass dominance may be avoided on sites that have sufficient cover of 
native perennials, proper management of&nbsp; livestock, and favorable climatic 
conditions for postfire recovery [<a href="#32">32</a>]. Three years after a severe wildfire on an 
ungrazed foothill mountain grassland in western Montana, cheatgrass cover was 
lower in burned patches than in unburned patches, and cheatgrass showed no indication of invading the burn. At that time Idaho
fescue and bluebunch
wheatgrass cover were similar to unburned levels, and rough fescue cover was slightly
below unburned levels [<a href="#15">15</a>]. After a mid-summer, lightening-caused wildfire on a 
good condition sagebrush-grass site (Wyoming big sagebrush, black sagebrush, and 
bluebunch wheatgrass) in central Utah, cheatgrass dominated the site the 
1st postfire year. Livestock were kept off the site, and with favorable precipitation, 
perennial bunchgrasses returned to nearly their preburn cover the 2nd year. 
Although cheatgrass had highest cover of grasses, the authors conclude that 
sagebrush-grass sites in good condition may be improved for cattle production 
with a few years of livestock exclusion following wildfire [<a href="#455">455</a>]. On a similar 
site, perennial grasses came to dominate plant cover over time, especially in 
ungrazed plots. Cheatgrass became locally almost absent during a 3-year intense 
drought, so the threshold to an annual-dominated site was not crossed [<a href="#458">458</a>].&nbsp;Similarly,  a mesic site 
dominated by Colorado pinyon,
Gambel oak, true mountain-mahogany, and mountain snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos 
oreophilus</i>) was seeded with nonnative grasses, including crested wheatgrass and smooth brome 
(<i>Bromus inermis</i>), after fire. Seeded sites had lower cover of cheatgrass  than drier
sites that were not seeded [<a href="#327">327</a>].&nbsp;A tallgrass prairie community in Oklahoma 
was burned under prescription in mid-April for 3 consecutive years. At postfire 
year 3, cheatgrass cover was significantly 
(p&lt;0.05) lower on burned sites than on unburned sites, both with and without grazing [<a href="#95">95</a>].</p>

<a name="FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

As a management tool, fire can be used to either kill unwanted species or to 
simulate historic fire regimes and promote desired species. Historic fire regimes did not occur in the 
presence of many invasive plants that are currently widespread, and the use of 
fire may not be a feasible or appropriate management action if fire-tolerant 
invasive plants are present. For example, while fire may be an important natural 
component of the Great Basin ecosystem, its reintroduction by land mangers is 
complicated by the presence of invasive plants such as cheatgrass [<a href="#71">71</a>]. Fire management should be conducted in  ways that 
prevent establishment of invasive species [<a href="#191">191</a>], and the management&nbsp;of fire and invasive plants must be closely 
integrated for each to be managed effectively [<a href="#71">71</a>].

<p>Rasmussen [<a href="#360">360</a>] presents considerations (e.g. species composition, fuel 
load, fuel continuity, and weather) to be addressed when using prescribed fire 
in sagebrush steppes, and general prescriptions that could be used. When 
precipitation is below 12 inches (300 mm), caution should be used to ensure 
desired plant response. If the objective is to maintain the perennial herbaceous 
vegetation, prescribed burning is most effective when used before 
sagebrush dominates the site and effectively excludes  perennial herbaceous 
plants. Such timing reduces the need for seeding following a burn. If the objective is to
maintain the sagebrush, prescribed burning has very limited applicability
[<a href="#360">360</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b><a name="Fire as a control agent for cheatgrass">Fire as a control agent for cheatgrass:</a></b></font> 
In sagebrush ecosystems, prescribed burning alone will generally decrease 
cheatgrass cover only in the short term, so in areas where cheatgrass dominates 
the understory, fire may best be used as a seedbed preparation technique prior 
to seeding desirable species [<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#360">360</a>,<a href="#405">405</a>]. Burning of mixed 
shrub-cheatgrass stands generates enough heat to kill most cheatgrass seeds and 
may offer a 1-season window for the establishment of perennial seedlings 
[<a href="#144">144</a>,<a href="#483">483</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>]. The abundance of viable seeds of cheatgrass after a burn can be 
judged by examining seeds in the ash. Even if the lemma and palea 
are charred, if entire caryopses can be identified some seed will 
be viable and  germinate [<a href="#489">489</a>].</p>

<p>The period of reduction of cheatgrass density (1-2 years) is not usually long 
enough to allow for the establishment of perennial seedlings [<a href="#77">77</a>]. Cheatgrass 
plants that do establish the 1st postfire year tend to produce so much seed per 
plant that total postfire cheatgrass seed production for a site may actually increase by a 
factor of 100 over preburn production [<a href="#306">306</a>,<a href="#473">473</a>]. Unless desirable species 
establish and outcompete cheatgrass, density of cheatgrass plants may exceed
preburn levels within 1 to 5 years [<a href="#306">306</a>,<a href="#468">468</a>]. On range sites in Washington, seeded grasses were successfully established on
sites where cheatgrass density was reduced to less than 90 seedlings/m<sup>2</sup> with
summer burning and to less than 40/m<sup>2</sup> with burning combined with fall spraying 
of herbicide [<a href="#180">180</a>].</p>

<p>If fire is used as a pretreatment to seeding in sagebrush 
communities depleted of perennial herbs, and levels of annual grasses are low at 
the time of the fire, perennial seedlings may establish before the annuals 
dominate the site if perennials are seeded the 1st year after fire 
[<a href="#77">77</a>]. Seeding burned areas immediately after fire is likely to reduce the &quot;influence&quot; of 
cheatgrass but is not likely to exclude it. A closed-canopy Colorado pinyon-Utah 
juniper site in the Green River corridor in Utah burned in 1976. Response of 
native plants was low (because of sparse seed bank),
and within a decade cheatgrass and musk thistle (<i>Carduus nutans</i>) 
dominated the site. The site was then burned under prescription in late June 1990, when 
cheatgrass seed was mature but not yet shattered. The site was aerially seeded in fall
1990 with aggressive, introduced grasses including crested wheatgrass, intermediate wheatgrass 
(<i>Thinopyrum</i> <i>intermedium</i>), orchardgrass (<i>Dactylis glomerata</i>), and smooth
brome (<i>Bromus inermis</i>). Some of the burned area was not seeded, and 
cheatgrass established  in unseeded areas. There were fewer and smaller 
cheatgrass plants in the seeded area [<a href="#169">169</a>]. However, cover of cheatgrass was slightly 
higher in seeded versus unseeded plots following an August wildfire in sagebrush 
steppe in Idaho [<a href="#361">361</a>]. </p>

<p>Late spring or early summer burns, before cheatgrass seed matures, may 
effectively control cheatgrass [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>,<a href="#360">360</a>]; however, burning before the seed 
is ripe is difficult because the plants are still green [<a href="#25">25</a>]. This timing is 
also a period of high sensitivity to fire damage for cool-season perennial 
grasses. In areas where native warm-season grasses are desired, a prescribed 
fire that kills cheatgrass seedlings and reduces the surface seed bank may be 
effective [<a href="#492">492</a>]. A site in Oregon that was dominated by cheatgrass and annual forbs was 
burned under prescription in July. The density of cheatgrass decreased and bottlebrush 
squirreltail increased in burned areas [<a href="#494">494</a>]. Prescribed burning prior to 
herbicide application may increase the effectiveness and/or reduce the 
application rate required for effective control of cheatgrass [<a href="#385">385</a>]. Preliminary 
results from a site in Oregon indicate that glyphosate treatment or mowing 1 year following
summer prescribed burning were equally effective at 
reducing medusahead and cheatgrass cover [<a href="#347">347</a>].</p>

<p>In all cases where invasive species are targeted for control, the potential 
for other invasive species to fill their void must be considered [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#187">187</a>,<a href="#369">369</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Fire as a control agent for shrubs and trees:</b></font>
Prescribed burning to reduce cover of shrubs and trees has been 
practiced for decades (e.g. [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#289">289</a>,<a href="#332">332</a>]), and was sometimes 
successful at enhancing desirable species without increases in cheatgrass 
[<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>]. The resulting plant community is dependent on several 
variables, however, including the composition of the plant community and seed 
bank before 
burning, the conditions of the fire,  postfire management, and climatic 
conditions.</p>

<p>The cheatgrass problem on rangeland dominated by sagebrush was probably 
exacerbated by efforts, beginning in the 1930s, to control sagebrush and 
increase grazing capacity. A report by Pechanec and others [<a href="#332">332</a>] recommends 
against burning range with little understory of perennial grasses unless it is
to be reseeded the 1st fall following the burn. They note that where cheatgrass 
is present, burning the range is likely to increase cheatgrass&nbsp; and damage 
desirable perennial species. Proper grazing management following burning is 
essential in maintaining desirable species.</p>

<p>Blaisdell and others [<a href="#60">60</a>] suggest that each situation be carefully examined and 
evaluated before burning can be prescribed as a plant control measure, and 
emphasize that areas with a poor stand of desirable perennials prior to burning 
will probably require postfire seeding to provide satisfactory forage production and 
delay return of sagebrush or other unwanted species such as
cheatgrass, halogeton, and medusahead [<a href="#60">60</a>]. Burning in Wyoming big sagebrush 
will remove brush, but it will not provide more perennial grass where cheatgrass 
has become dominant [<a href="#78">78</a>]. Bunting and others [<a href="#78">78</a>] suggest prescribed burning in 
areas with 10 to 15% cover of sagebrush and desirable plants present &quot;in a 
density that will allow a favorable postfire response.&quot; Young and Evans [<a href="#482">482</a>,<a href="#483">483</a>] 
determined that 2 perennial grass plants per square foot is the minimum
necessary to preempt invasion by nonnative annual species and/or shrub seedlings.</p>

<p>A review by Bunting [<a href="#77">77</a>] suggests  many sites are difficult to burn 
because herbaceous productivity is inherently low. Sites with less than 600 
kg/ha of fine fuels will be difficult to burn. Even if sites with low amounts of 
herbaceous plant cover are burned, it may take many years for the desirable 
perennials to  establish, which leaves the site open to erosion and 
invasion by nonnative plants. If the fine fuel load is sufficient but it is composed of annuals, 
establishment of perennials may still be prevented, and&nbsp; fire return 
intervals may decrease. Thus, the site  may be  dominated by annuals indefinitely. Then the 
management concern is for 
fire prevention as a means to increase the fire-free interval until desirable perennial vegetation 
can become established [<a href="#77">77</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Postfire colonization potential:</font></b><font face="Bell MT">
</font>Cheatgrass can invade recently burned sites from  offsite seed sources [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#156">156</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#363">363</a>], or may establish from seeds in the soil 
seed bank (e.g. [<a href="#139">139</a>]), even if plants are 
absent from the site at the time of the fire (e.g. [<a href="#245">245</a>]). 
Predicting a site's susceptibility to invasion may be difficult. Management techniques to help reduce
postfire cheatgrass invasion may include elimination of nonnative seed sources from roadsides and other
disturbance areas adjacent to burn sites, and increasing size of burns to increase
the distance from seed sources. Increasing
size of burns does, however, also increase distance from native seed sources [<a href="#228">228</a>].</p>

<p>Excessive or poorly timed grazing after burning can also increase cheatgrass dominance [<a href="#332">332</a>]. The 
optimum amount of grazing rest and deferment that is needed following fire in 
sagebrush steppe and pinyon-juniper vegetation continues to be  controversial, 
but varies with vegetal composition, site potential, objectives of the burn, and 
environmental conditions following fire [<a href="#77">77</a>]. It has been suggested that grazing 
be deferred on seeded lands for a minimum of 2 years with nonnative seeding, and 
a minimum of 5 to 8 years with native seedings [<a href="#144">144</a>,<a href="#239">239</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Cheatgrass fires:</b></font> 
The majority of 
grassland fires in the Intermountain West are small (&lt;10 acres (4 ha)) and represent &lt;1%
of total acreage burned. Large fires (&gt;5,020 acres (2,008 ha)) are 
infrequent, but represent &gt;70% of the acreage burned [<a href="#238">238</a>]. These fires are of 
particular concern for rehabilitation efforts [<a href="#369">369</a>], and predicting their 
occurrence and behavior would be beneficial to land managers in assigning resource allocation 
prior to the fire season [<a href="#238">238</a>]. 
Knapp [<a href="#237">237</a>,<a href="#238">238</a>] suggests that these large fires have distinct spatial patterns, and 
their occurrence can be predicted based on antecedent moisture conditions. 
Summer moisture conditions in the year preceding that of large fire years tend 
to be near-normal or wetter. 
Conversely, &lt;20% of all the
large fires occur when the previous summer's moisture conditions were below
normal [<a href="#237">237</a>,<a href="#238">238</a>]. Other researchers have suggested this relationship between precipitation 
in the preceding winter months and large fires during the following summers 
[<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>]. Moisture conditions in the summer in which
the large fires occur appear to have less influence on the likelihood of
those fires, suggesting that fuel moisture conditions are secondary 
to fine-fuel amounts for promoting large fires on rangelands [<a href="#237">237</a>,<a href="#238">238</a>].</p>

<p>Knapp [<a href="#238">238</a>] examined the spatial and temporal occurrence of large grassland 
fires in the Intermountain West for the period 1980 through 1995. He found that 
large fires tended to occur in areas dominated by annual grass cover (&gt;50% herbaceous 
cover), at lower elevations than smaller fires (4,425 feet (1,341 m) average), 
and during a shorter fire season (July and August). More than half of all large 
fires were on relatively flat terrain (i.e. basins and foothills) that was 
historically more susceptible to invasion by nonnatives (i.e. ranch lands) and 
concurrently dominated by annual 
grasses. Because the annual grass/wildfire 
cycle is driven by positive feedback,  these areas are also likely to experience 
large fires in the future. Large fires also occurred in more physiographically 
discrete regions than did smaller fires, with 8 specific regions 
representing approximately 60% of the overall Intermountain area, and 
representing the optimal combination of fuel amounts and fuel continuity for 
large fires (see [<a href="#238">238</a>] for more detail).</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Cheatgrass fuels:</b></font> 
In the absence of grazing, grass biomass during the 
fire season may represent 2 years of fuel accumulation, which appears to be 
optimal for grassland fires [<a href="#238">238</a>]. Abundant, continuous cover of cheatgrass can 
lead to rapid spread of wildfires so that under conditions of high temperatures, 
low humidity, and wind, the fires are very difficult to suppress [<a href="#475">475</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brooks [<a href="#69">69</a>] compared the roles of nonnative annual grasses and other annual 
plants in facilitating the spread of fires in the Mojave Desert. Landscapes 
dominated by nonnative annual grasses, especially annual bromes (<i>Bromus</i> spp.), 
are more flammable than those dominated by native forbs. Possible explanations 
for this include higher surface-to-volume ratio of grasses compared to forbs; 
more continuous vegetative cover; and the ability of alien annual grasses to 
remain rooted and upright longer than native forbs, allowing them to persist as 
flammable fuels into the summer when the threat of fire is highest [<a href="#69">69</a>]. Thick 
layers of annual plant litter accumulate, and litter decomposes especially 
slowly in desert regions [<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>]. Accumulations of litter led to particularly 
hot temperatures, long flame residence times, and continuous burn patterns in 
experimental fires in the Mojave Desert [<a href="#69">69</a>].</p>

<p>Cheatgrass provides a flammable link between open grasslands and forests.  It cures early in the 
fire season and ignites readily during dry periods because of its finely divided 
stems and pedicels, and it responds readily to changes in atmospheric moisture 
because of its fine structure. Moisture content is the single most important 
factor influencing cheatgrass flammability, and varies with plant phenology and 
color change as follows [<a href="#312">312</a>]:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="1" width="27%" id="AutoNumber1">
  <tr>
    <td width="44%">Plant color</td>

    <td width="44%">straw</td>
    <td width="56%" align="center">&lt;30</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Since there is considerable variation in plant coloration in a stand, close 
inspection is necessary to determine the predominant coloration. Cheatgrass is not readily ignitable until it reaches the 
straw-colored stage. The time required for the moisture content to drop from 
100% to 30% ranged from 8 days on a northern exposure in western Montana, to 23 
days on a southern exposure in different years, with an average of 14 days. The onset of purple 
coloring 
forewarns of hazardous fire conditions within about 2 weeks [<a href="#312">312</a>].</p>

<p>Cheatgrass ignites and burns easily when dry, regardless of quantity, and can 
support rapid rate of fire spread [<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>]. When cured and at 9% moisture 
content, each gram of cheatgrass material is capable of producing 3,900 
calories to contribute to the spread of fire [<a href="#366">366</a>]. Flammability of cheatgrass 
fuels depends primarily on moisture content, weight, and porosity. Anderson [<a href="#13">13</a>] 
provides figures for equilibrium moisture content of cheatgrass litter under 
different conditions of relative humidity and temperature. Moisture diffusivity 
and response time in cheatgrass as fuel are given for different stand 
densities by Anderson [<a href="#12">12</a>]. When the moisture content reaches low levels (5 to 
10% dry weight), variations in flammability are probably primarily caused by 
fuel weight and bulk density. Estimation of bulk density (weight per unit of 
volume of the fuel bed) is a practical aid in assessing the flammability of cheatgrass. Average 
bulk density for cheatgrass in western Montana was 0.00032 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. 
More details are 
given by Brown [<a href="#74">74</a>]. Ratio of surface area to volume for several fine fuels is 
explored by Brown [<a href="#75">75</a>], and physical fuel properties of a cheatgrass fuel 
complex are given. Surface area:volume ratio for cheatgrass was 145 cm<sup>2</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>

are given below [<a href="#339">339</a>]:</p>

<p> A basic procedure for evaluating the grass fuel models of the National Fire Danger Rating System is 
provided by Sneeuwjagt [<a href="#394">394</a>], with several examples from cheatgrass-dominated sites.</p>

<p><b><font size="4" face="Bell MT">Fuel management/fire prevention:</font></b> 
On areas where cheatgrass is 
abundant, special measures may be necessary to prevent recurrent fires, and thus 
prevent the elimination of fire-sensitive perennial grasses and forbs [<a href="#60">60</a>] and 
other potential adverse impacts 
(see <a href="fire_ecology.html">Fire Ecology</a> and 
<a href="management_considerations.html#IMPACTS AND CONTROL">Impacts and Control</a> 
for more information). Fire suppression can discourage invasion and spread of cheatgrass [<a href="#363">363</a>]. Grazing management to
reduce fuel loads and greenstripping are 2 methods employed to prevent large
recurrent fires in areas dominated by cheatgrass. Additionally, herbicides are 
being tested for effectiveness in creating fuelbreaks in cheatgrass-dominated 
range [<a href="#411">411</a>].</p>

<p> Cattle grazing can reduce the accumulation of cheatgrass litter and thus lessen the fire hazard
on a site [<a href="#137">137</a>,<a href="#333">333</a>,<a href="#491">491</a>]. Grazing
cheatgrass in winter can reduce cheatgrass herbage and seeds while protecting the dormant perennial grasses [<a href="#137">137</a>]. 
Davison [<a href="#118">118</a>] provides
more detailed information on using livestock grazing to reduce fuel
loads and subsequent fire occurrence and severity in cheatgrass-dominated
rangelands.</p>

<p>Greenstripping is a method of establishing fuel breaks to impede the flow of 
wildfires and thereby increase the fire-free interval on a site dominated by
cheatgrass. These fuel breaks
are 30 to 400 feet (10-120 m) wide, and are seeded with fire-resistant vegetation.
As of 1994, 451 miles (16,280 acres) of experimental and operational greenstrips
had been established in Idaho. The effectiveness of greenstrips, or any fuels
modification project, in reducing wildfire spread is enhanced by 3 factors: 1)
disrupting fuel continuity (e.g. by replacing cheatgrass with caespitose grasses
such as crested wheatgrass, which have large spaces between individual shrubs); 2)
reducing fuel accumulations and volatility (e.g. shrub stands are thinned to maintain
a minimum distance of 10 feet (3 m) between plants);
and 3) increasing the density of plants with  high moisture and low volatile
oil content, thus reducing both the potential for ignition and rate of fire
spread [<a href="#333">333</a>,<a href="#334">334</a>]. Plants used in greenstrips remain
green and moist into late summer, making the greenstrip area less flammable for
a longer time. Wildfire speed may slow when
entering a greenstrip, thus allowing fire suppression crews to extinguish the
fire. Some wildfires burn into greenstrips and extinguish  [<a href="#306">306</a>].&nbsp;Native plants in the Great Basin 
generally do not meet firebreak criteria 
[<a href="#71">71</a>]. Crested wheatgrass and forage kochia are effective
in retarding wildfire spread,    compete well in a weedy environment, and have
been the most successful species in greenstrips [<a href="#260">260</a>,<a href="#300">300</a>,<a href="#306">306</a>,<a href="#334">334</a>]. Both plants 
can, however, be invasive and  spread 
into areas where cheatgrass is being managed with prescribed fire [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#300">300</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Revegetation after cheatgrass fires:</b></font> After wildfires or when planning 
prescribed burning in areas where cheatgrass is present, managers must decide 
whether the burned area should be seeded or whether sufficient perennial grasses 
are present to revegetate a site and successfully compete with cheatgrass 
[<a href="#369">369</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>]. Seeding may not be necessary or desirable if native plant species are 
able to recover after fire [<a href="#326">326</a>,<a href="#361">361</a>]. Cheatgrass-dominated communities tend to 
have extremely sparse perennial seed banks, however, and the cheatgrass seed 
bank generally recovers by the 2nd postfire year [<a href="#213">213</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>]. In Utah, natural 
revegetation (no seeding) is most effective at higher elevations where sufficient moisture and a 
diverse population of perennial vegetation exist, especially on north- and east-facing slopes. Below 6,000 feet (1,820 m) 
and in much of Utah's arid 
environment, cheatgrass and other weedy species readily invade and dominate 
burned areas [<a href="#260">260</a>]. Seeding following fire may be needed to prevent cheatgrass 
dominance in Wyoming big sagebrush and pinyon-juniper communities, but not in mountain big sagebrush communities [<a href="#168">168</a>].</p>

<p> Revegetation of burned areas is desirable to assure forage for livestock and 
wildlife, and to minimize the potential for erosion and/or invasion by nonnative 
species. Ideally, wildfire
rehabilitation should enhance the recovery of native vegetation through
the seeding of native plants adapted to local environmental conditions. Native plants such as
basin wildrye (<i>Leymus cinereus </i>), bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, Indian ricegrass, big
sagebrush, and fourwing saltbush (<i>Atriplex canescens</i>) have been used in rehabilitation seedings
[<a href="#326">326</a>]. Early seral species such as bottlebrush
squirreltail may provide managers with native plant materials that can
successfully germinate and establish in the presence of invasive annuals [<a href="#220">220</a>,<a href="#493">493</a>] and do well after subsequent fire [<a href="#271">271</a>].
Bottlebrush squirreltail deserves consideration as a post-wildfire revegetation 
species because in greenhouse experiments, it has substantially greater growth in post-wildfire soil 
compared with unburned soil, and    exhibits relatively higher growth 
rates in post-wildfire soil compared to cheatgrass [<a href="#62">62</a>]. Restoration projects 
using native species mixes to provide a 
variety of above- and belowground growth forms, and sowing at high densities, may 
increase establishment of desirable plants while providing adequate 
competition against invasive plants [<a href="#71">71</a>].</p>

<p>Monsen [<a href="#301">301</a>] discusses seed, seeding technology, and microenvironmental 
requirements for the reestablishment of big sagebrush weed-infested sites. 
Wyoming big sagebrush establishes readily from seed [<a href="#78">78</a>]. Establishment of 
bareroot Wyoming big sagebrush seedlings is most successful on fine-textured 
soils at Hanford in eastern Washington [<a href="#130">130</a>]. Colonization of sagebrush roots by 
mycorrhizae is much lower in burned sites compared with unburned sites; 
therefore, burning itself may impede the reestablishment of sagebrush over 
cheatgrass after fire [<a href="#178">178</a>].&nbsp;Mycorrhizae are reduced by high-severity fires for 
about 2 years; therefore, establishment of sagebrush may be more successful 2 
years after high-severity fires [<a href="#259">259</a>]. Reducing levels of available nitrogen 
immediately after fire may increase the rate of establishment by native plants 
and reduce the dominance of invasive annuals. Sucrose has been used 
experimentally to reduce nitrogen availability by increasing soil microbial biomass. Such 
treatments have reduced the growth of invasive plants while enhancing the 
establishment and composition of late-seral native plants in a semiarid 
ecosystem [<a href="#277">277</a>]. More research is needed to identify cost-effective techniques 
for reducing available nitrogen and enhancing the success of native plants [<a href="#71">71</a>]. Hardegree and others [<a href="#183">183</a>] discuss the development of technology to 
characterize
seedbed microclimate as it pertains to the restoration and maintenance of native
plant communities in  sagebrush steppe, and how to use this information to design 
optimal planting scenarios for establishment of desirable native species and develop mitigating strategies to minimize 
competition from cheatgrass. Re-inoculation of components of biological soil crusts is also 
being explored in restoration efforts [<a href="#219">219</a>].</p>

<p>Federal policy currently encourages the use of native plant materials on 
public lands; but because the primary objective of wildfire rehabilitation on 
public lands is not ecological restoration but rather prevention of erosion and 
invasion by undesirable nonnative species, and because of the limited 
availability of native seeds, the use of native species is not mandatory 
for revegetation [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#326">326</a>,<a href="#369">369</a>]. Roberts [<a href="#369">369</a>] summarizes some budgetary, 
ecological, and managerial concerns with regard to cheatgrass and pinyon-juniper 
fires. Because of difficulties related to cost, handling, and reliability of 
native seed supplies in wildfire rehabilitation situations, many managers prefer 
nonnative plant materials and traditional seeding methods.</p>

<p>Many large areas have been seeded with nonnative, 
herbaceous forage species [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#326">326</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>] including crested wheatgrass,
intermediate wheatgrass, tall wheatgrass (<i>Thinopyrum ponticum</i>), Russian wildrye (<i>Psathyrostachys 
juncea</i>), smooth brome, alfalfa, and yellow sweetclover (<i>Melilotus 
officinalis</i>). Seeds for these species are readily available 
and responsive to standard seeding methods;  plants establish and  grow rapidly, and
have wide environmental tolerances. Many cultivars are also drought tolerant,
grazing tolerant, and competitive against other, less desirable nonnative
species
[<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#326">326</a>]. The most reliable and persistent grass for low-elevation,
drought-prone areas of the Intermountain West is crested wheatgrass. It establishes
rapidly even under relatively dry conditions and tends to persist for many years
[<a href="#225">225</a>,<a href="#300">300</a>,<a href="#326">326</a>], although some sites seeded to crested wheatgrass return to
cheatgrass dominance over time [<a href="#45">45</a>]. Grasses
that are most competitive against cheatgrass include 'Hycrest' crested wheatgrass,
'Luna' intermediate wheatgrass, 'Bozoisky' Russian wildrye, and smooth brome [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#158">158</a>]. The 
competitive advantage for establishment of crested wheatgrass seedlings is lost if 
burned areas are not seeded the year of the fire [<a href="#147">147</a>]. Forbs such as alfalfa tend to have low persistence 
in rehabilitation seedings [<a href="#300">300</a>,<a href="#326">326</a>].</p>

<p>Cheatgrass suppression was best met by aerial seeding followed by chaining or
drill seeding after large wildfires on rangeland in Utah.
These methods can still result in large amounts of cheatgrass  in the interspaces between seeded
grasses [<a href="#260">260</a>,<a href="#326">326</a>]. Rehabilitation of
cheatgrass burns has been attempted with disking, plowing, and other mechanical 
methods to reduce cheatgrass competition prior to seeding, but these methods 
obliterate any remaining native plants, especially perennial grasses and 
microbiotic soil crusts. Thus, these methods are not appropriate for 
wildland settings.&nbsp;As for soil stabilization, cheatgrass establishes more 
rapidly than  seeded grasses and therefore may provide better soil protection 
in the short term [<a href="#326">326</a>]. Seeded bunchgrasses may not control soil erosion 
because of the large amount of bare soil in the interspaces between plants 
[<a href="#253">253</a>]. While perennial grasses and forbs reduce potential for recurring fire 
[<a href="#300">300</a>,<a href="#334">334</a>], perennial seedings are not immune to burning, especially when there 
is cheatgrass in the interspaces [<a href="#326">326</a>]. Finally, seeding nonnative species into 
burned areas should be carefully considered because  nonnative species may have negative impacts on native vegetation and 
wildlife [<a href="#191">191</a>,<a href="#304">304</a>]. 
See <a href="management_considerations.html#Cultural">Cultural</a> control
for more information on the relative merits of native versus 
nonnative plant materials for revegetation on rangelands.</p>

Current goals of making wildfire rehabilitation objectives compatible with 
other management objectives on public lands may require careful planning of 
treatments and some modifications of standard practices, such as greater use of 
native plants [<a href="#326">326</a>]. The identification and use of competitive native perennial 
plants for arid-land rehabilitation has become a priority for managers and 
researchers [<a href="#300">300</a>]. In big fire years - such as 1996, when millions of acres 
burned - the scale of the demand for seed greatly exceeds the supply of native 
plant seed, especially of local genotypes. The competitive ability of nonnative 
species and the relatively low cost and high availability of their seed will 
continue to appeal to those faced with of large-scale burns in cheatgrass-prone 
areas [<a href="#169">169</a>]. If managers are able to predict large fires in advance (as per 
Knapp [<a href="#238">238</a>]), perhaps more efforts could be made to have more native seed 
available for specific sites.

IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Cheatgrass was evidently widely distributed in arid and semiarid
rangelands of Eurasia before the domestication of cattle. It is consumed
by all of the native wild large herbivores on desert ranges there, and thus
evolved with grazing pressure [<a href="#246">246</a>]. In North America, 
cheatgrass can tolerate repeated grazing, heavy trampling, and manuring. As long as it has time to set seed, 
it is likely to persist on grazed rangelands 
[<a href="#116">116</a>]. Cheatgrass abundance is not necessarily favored by heavy 
grazing, for it is highly palatable and is practically eliminated by uniformly 
heavy spring grazing [<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>,<a href="#477">477</a>]. Heavy spring grazing of cheatgrass both enhances its presence by 
weakening native cool-season perennial grasses, and  suppresses its 
abundance by reducing seed production. Once it is present on a site, removal of 
livestock  increases cheatgrass seed production and thus 
encourages its dominance  [<a href="#477">477</a>].

<p>From the standpoint of volume of herbage produced and extent of area covered,
cheatgrass is undoubtedly the most important forage on grazing lands in the 
Intermountain and Pacific Northwest regions [<a href="#437">437</a>]. When it is 
green (usually in early spring), cheatgrass has excellent 
nutritive quality and supplies  forage for all classes of
livestock [<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#437">437</a>,<a href="#477">477</a>]. In
years with average to above average precipitation, cheatgrass may provide more
forage  than is available on uninvaded range, especially in  arid habitats (e.g.  shadscale 
salt-desert community types) [<a href="#475">475</a>]. 
In these warm, dry regions, cheatgrass can provide important winter range for
cattle [<a href="#137">137</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Livestock:</b></font> 
There are several disadvantages of using cheatgrass as a livestock forage 
species including its short green feed period (usually about 6 weeks) [<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#269">269</a>,<a href="#437">437</a>], its declining forage quality and 
palatability as plants dry [<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>,<a href="#269">269</a>,<a href="#477">477</a>], and its tremendous variation in 
production among years [<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>,<a href="#269">269</a>,<a href="#368">368</a>,<a href="#437">437</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>].</p>

<p>Livestock gains on cheatgrass diets in spring are comparable to those 
attainable from most spring rangeland vegetation and decline to near zero once 
the cheatgrass plants mature [<a href="#306">306</a>]. When cheatgrass is dry, cattle and horses 
will still eat it, though levels of digestible protein and phosphorus may be 
inadequate, depending on the class of animal eating it [<a href="#210">210</a>,<a href="#269">269</a>,<a href="#477">477</a>].&nbsp;Cheatgrass 
is a principal food on spring lambing ranges, but the pounds of dry 
matter consumed daily per sheep decreases sharply with increased maturity of 
cheatgrass [<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>]. Livestock grazing dry cheatgrass need to be closely 
observed, because eating dry cheatgrass herbage can greatly increase the 
incidence of mouth infections in cattle, and the sharp seeds can cause 
severe eye injuries [<a href="#210">210</a>,<a href="#306">306</a>,<a href="#475">475</a>].</p>

<p>Cheatgrass production varies and may be difficult to predict from year to 
year, as it is dependent on the amount and temporal distribution of moisture 
[<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>,<a href="#238">238</a>,<a href="#269">269</a>,<a href="#332">332</a>,<a href="#368">368</a>,<a href="#437">437</a>]. The grazing capacity of cheatgrass ranges can 
be high for part of the season. Of more importance to the livestock producer is 
the lack of cheatgrass production in dry years [<a href="#210">210</a>,<a href="#269">269</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>]. Hull and Pechanec 
[<a href="#210">210</a>] measured a 10-fold difference in cheatgrass production in consecutive 
years. The amplitude of variation in production may be greater for cheatgrass 
than for perennial natives, although a review by Young and Allen [<a href="#477">477</a>] suggests 
that as long as spring moisture is adequate, the variability in cheatgrass 
production is no greater than that of native perennial grasses. Forage 
production is especially reduced when cheatgrass germinates in spring rather 
than fall [<a href="#477">477</a>]. If germination occurs in fall and temperatures permit growth, 
the leaves can provide forage during fall and winter; if germination occurs late 
in fall, the plant remains in the rosette stage during winter and produces 
little harvestable forage until spring. If cheatgrass provides the bulk of a 
seasonal forage base, there is need to buffer the uncertainty of cheatgrass 
production [<a href="#137">137</a>].&nbsp;In addition to fluctuations in production, the threat of large 
losses of cheatgrass forage due to wildfire is high [<a href="#475">475</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>]. Forage 
production of perennials can be twice the biomass of cheatgrass in a moist year, and
12 times the biomass during drought years [<a href="#375">375</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Wildlife:</b></font> 
Cheatgrass is often used as a green food and  seed food by 
birds and wild mammals [<a href="#184">184</a>]. Several wildlife species utilize cheatgrass 
herbage for forage including bighorn sheep on winter ranges in Utah [<a href="#166">166</a>] and  Colorado 
burns [<a href="#398">398</a>]; mule deer on spring and fall ranges [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#398">398</a>]; pronghorn in 
western Utah [<a href="#35">35</a>] and southeastern Oregon [<a href="#232">232</a>]; Townsend's ground squirrels in 
Idaho [<a href="#470">470</a>]; and voles under snow cover in eastern Washington [<a href="#264">264</a>]. In eastern 
Washington the montane meadow mouse is the principle native grazer of both 
bluebunch wheatgrass and cheatgrass. Additionally, several other small mammals, birds, 
and insects (e.g. cottontail rabbits, black-tail jackrabbits, chukar, and grasshoppers)  graze both species and can play a major role in shaping 
these plant communities [<a href="#351">351</a>].</p>

<p>Cheatgrass is a major component in the diet of many upland game birds, 
especially chukar, a nonnative game bird [<a href="#475">475</a>]. In summer and fall the bulk of 
chukar diets is composed of cheatgrass seeds. The range of chukar in the Great 
Basin has expanded as cheatgrass dominance has increased [<a href="#379">379</a>,<a href="#451">451</a>]. Cheatgrass 
was also consumed during seed maturity and senescent stages by 2 different grasshopper species in Idaho [<a href="#152">152</a>]. 
Grasshopper density was also higher 
in annual grasslands dominated by cheatgrass and medusahead compared with 
vegetation types with shrub cover in Idaho [<a href="#153">153</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Palatability/nutritional value:</b></font> 
Reviews by 
Mosley and others [<a href="#306">306</a>] and Upadhyaya and others [<a href="#437">437</a>] suggest that cheatgrass is palatable and nutritious for all classes of 
livestock and many species of wildlife, especially in spring and sometimes in 
mild winters. Cheatgrass compares favorably in nutritional quality with most 
native and introduced perennial grasses that it grows in association with. </p>

<p>Ganskopp and Bohnert [<a href="#162">162</a>] characterized seasonal and annual nutritional 
dynamics of 7 grasses (including cheatgrass) in the Great Basin, at 6 sites over 2 
years (a year of below-average precipitation followed by a  year of above-average 
precipitation). They concluded that rangelands with a diversity of grasses that 
exploit all levels of the soil profile  provide  forage for longer time periods than pastures 
relying on a single
species.</p>

<p>In samples taken from 6 sites around Burns, Oregon, crude protein (CP) and in-vitro organic matter 
disappearance (IVOMD) levels in cheatgrass peaked in late April 
(~15-22% and ~76-82%, respectively),  declined 
rapidly from late April to late June, and were lowest in the fall and winter 
months (around 2%). October 1992 was an exception, when levels increased following  precipitation
of 57 mm. CP levels tended to be higher than 
Sandberg bluegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, Idaho fescue, bluebunch 
wheatgrass, and Thurber needlegrass,  but lower than giant wildrye. IVOMD was higher for cheatgrass than other 
grasses  and exhibited the greatest range of seasonal change. Neutral detergent fiber (NDF) was lowest in cheatgrass in late April 
(38.5%), with a high degree of variation between months and years. NDF was highest in fall
and decreased after the October precipitation event [<a href="#162">162</a>].</p>

<p>Austin and others [<a href="#27">27</a>] found cheatgrass was 1 of several annual grasses 
that are nutritionally valuable to mule deer in spring and 
fall in Utah, with 72.2% digestible dry matter, and 21.2% CP.&nbsp;Bishop and 
others [<a href="#49">49</a>] compared the nutritional quality (in-vitro dry matter
digestibility (IVDMD) and  CP) of cheatgrass among 3 mule deer
winter ranges and among 6 habitat components in southwest Idaho. Cheatgrass
quality varied significantly (p=0.002) between winter range sites, but not 
within sites. IVDMD ranged from 65.8 to 69.9%, and CP ranged from 16 to 17%.</p>

<br />

<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Impacts:</b></font> 
The impacts of cheatgrass invasion 
vary with plant community and degree of cheatgrass dominance. At low densities, 
cheatgrass may simply be a part of the understory. At high densities, cheatgrass 
dominance can lead to complete community type conversions from perennial 
bunchgrass, sagebrush, salt-desert shrub, or pinyon-juniper communities to cheatgrass 
monocultures. The presence and dominance of cheatgrass affects many aspects of 
community structure, process, and function including diversity of plant and animal species, 
disturbance regimes, succession to other undesirable nonnative plants, nutrient 
cycling, and soil attributes. These changes  may require substantial human 
intervention to convert to more desirable ecosystems.

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Impacts on native plants:</font> 
Cheatgrass is very 
persistent across a range of habitats [<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>], and can displace both rare 
and common plant species, thus reducing the number and genetic diversity of 
native plants in invaded communities. These changes can result from direct 
competition, from increased fire frequency, and possibly from indirect effects 
of changes in plant litter dynamics, nutrient cycling and soil ecology [<a href="#375">375</a>]. 
Soil water depletion is one of the principal mechanisms that allows cheatgrass 
to successfully compete with perennial grasses [<a href="#138">138</a>,<a href="#281">281</a>] and may negatively 
impact root growth of native species [<a href="#280">280</a>], especially during the establishment 
of perennial grass seedlings. Cheatgrass has been shown to deplete soil moisture 
and reduce growth of natives such as Idaho fescue [<a href="#314">314</a>], bluebunch wheatgrass 
[<a href="#3">3</a>], green rabbitbrush, and needle-and-thread grass [<a href="#281">281</a>]. It has also 
been observed to impede the establishment of native seedlings such as big 
sagebrush, green rabbitbrush, antelope bitterbrush [<a href="#132">132</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>,<a href="#475">475</a>], Stansbury cliffrose (<i>Purshia mexicana</i> 
var. <i>stansburiana</i>) [<a href="#350">350</a>], and several perennial herbaceous species [<a href="#371">371</a>]. 
Wallace and Nelson [<a href="#446">446</a>] suggest that cheatgrass infestations may contribute to 
shrub die-off in western rangelands. Introduction of cheatgrass and heavy 
grazing of native perennials have irrevocably altered the understories of Oregon 
white oak woodlands in the eastern Cascades 
[<a href="#2">2</a>]. A review by Mosley and others [<a href="#306">306</a>] suggests that plant biomass production on cheatgrass-infested rangeland 
is substantially less,
and much more variable from year to year, than on rangeland dominated by native 
vegetation.</p>

<p>Cheatgrass can supply reasonably good forage and ground cover when desirable 
perennials are removed, although production is unpredictable and unreliable 
[<a href="#59">59</a>]. For details on cheatgrass' impacts on forage availability 
see the <a href="#IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE">Importance to Livestock and Wildlife</a> section above. 
It has  been suggested that in the 
absence of burning or heavy grazing, cheatgrass can help prevent erosion, 
promote water infiltration, and increase soil organic matter as a result of 
litter accumulation on areas where perennial cover has been reduced [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>,<a href="#405">405</a>,<a href="#453">453</a>]. On the other hand, cheatgrass litter 
provides the fine fuel that can lead to wildfires, which may ultimately lead to 
plant community type conversions, subsequent impacts on wildlife, and the 
proliferation of other nonnative plants.<p>

<p>On the Snake River Plain, as in many areas throughout the Columbia River Basin 
and the Great Basin, the introduction of cheatgrass and other annual grasses, 
such as medusahead, has altered fuel loads and fuel distribution, which in turn 
has changed fire frequency, intensity, severity, timing, and extent 
[<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#239">239</a>,<a href="#338">338</a>,<a href="#405">405</a>,<a href="#460">460</a>,<a href="#475">475</a>,<a href="#483">483</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>]. For more information on fire regime 
changes in cheatgrass dominated ecosystems, 
see <a href="fire_ecology.html">Fire Ecology</a>. 
These fire regime changes, coupled with the impacts of domestic livestock grazing, have 
greatly modified plant recruitment, species composition and distribution, and 
the physiognomy and functioning of many vegetation types within the Intermountain 
West [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#338">338</a>,<a href="#363">363</a>,<a href="#460">460</a>]. Several plant communities that are not adapted to the 
frequent fires that cheatgrass infestations engender have become increasingly
susceptible to loss by wildfire. Examples include old growth pinyon-juniper 
woodlands  [<a href="#295">295</a>], vast areas  of sagebrush steppe (e.g. [<a href="#239">239</a>,<a href="#338">338</a>,<a href="#460">460</a>,<a href="#483">483</a>]), extensive stands 
of antelope bitterbrush in south central Idaho, central Utah, Oregon, and 
southern California [<a href="#300">300</a>], and salt-desert shrublands that often 
have high numbers of endemic plant and animal species [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].</p> 

<p>Cheatgrass alters successional trajectories of postfire plant communities by 
interfering with native seedling establishment 
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>,<a href="#281">281</a>,<a href="#314">314</a>,<a href="#350">350</a>,<a href="#371">371</a>,<a href="#405">405</a>,<a href="#475">475</a>], by competing with established perennials 
for resources [<a href="#138">138</a>,<a href="#280">280</a>,<a href="#281">281</a>], and by shortening the interval between fires 
[<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#261">261</a>,<a href="#405">405</a>,<a href="#454">454</a>,<a href="#460">460</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>].&nbsp;The ecological consequences of repeated burning 
include reduced species diversity, as the proportion of annuals in the community 
increases at the expense of other life forms [<a href="#338">338</a>,<a href="#460">460</a>].&nbsp;In the desert shrublands 
of North America, individual fires may not have serious lasting effects, but recurrent fires may lead to 
resource homogenization that can complicate restoration efforts. More research is needed to determine how widespread 
this process is and to develop management tools to mitigate its effects [<a href="#71">71</a>].</p>

<p>The vitality and integrity of several native, fire-sensitive communities has been 
so reduced by repeated wildfires that extensive areas of shrub and perennial 
grass communities have been converted to annual grasslands [<a href="#287">287</a>,<a href="#460">460</a>,<a href="#482">482</a>,<a href="#483">483</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>]. 
Knick [<a href="#239">239</a>] reports rates of loss of big sagebrush and native salt-desert shrub 
communities in the Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area in 
southwestern Idaho. In 1979, 250,000 acres (100,000 ha), or 51% of the total area, 
was comprised of big sagebrush and native salt-desert shrub communities. Because 
of fires and other disturbance, only 145,000 acres (58,000 ha) of shrubland 
remained in 1994, and another 30,000 acres (12,000 ha) of shrublands burned by 
1998. Shrubland losses of this magnitude are typical of many sagebrush 
ecosystems in lower elevations and in xeric climates throughout the Columbia 
River Basin and Great Basin [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#239">239</a>,<a href="#338">338</a>,<a href="#460">460</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>]. Monsen and Shaw [<a href="#304">304</a>] report 
 
&quot;cheatgrass invasion has completely transformed ecological communities on 
millions of acres in the sagebrush grasslands of North America.&quot;<p>

<p>Despite the trend of improving range conditions on Intermountain rangelands 
attributed to improved grazing management [<a href="#486">486</a>], the dominance and 
distribution of cheatgrass has continued to increase in various rangeland 
ecosystems of the Intermountain area. This continuing increase in cheatgrass is 
attributed to grazing management systems that favor cheatgrass establishment 
[<a href="#476">476</a>] and to the increasing role of wildfire  
[<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#239">239</a>,<a href="#338">338</a>,<a href="#460">460</a>,<a href="#474">474</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>]. Some of the native plant and animal species in ecosystems that are now
prone to widespread wildfires due to the presence of cheatgrass are at considerable risk of going extinct at the population
level: locally or even regionally. This  implies a threat to the existence of large, integrated ecosystems that have
existed since the Pleistocene in the relatively arid lands between the Sierra
Nevada and Rocky Mountains. The results could be the conversion of these native
ecosystems to  annual grasslands lacking not only the
native vertebrates but also those invertebrates and biologic soil crusts that 
are involved in the energy flow, water cycling, and nutrient balance of the 
ecosystem [<a href="#48">48</a>].<p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Impacts on wildlife:</font>
Vegetation type conversion can affect wildlife ranging from herbivores to 
carnivores and reduce overall biodiversity [<a href="#71">71</a>].
While  fires at low to moderate 
severities on sites with good productivity, deep soils, and good native plant 
components can benefit some wildlife habitats, high-severity wildfire in 
sagebrush-annual grass rangelands is considered detrimental to most wildlife 
species, as it promotes dominance of nonnative annual grasses and high fire 
frequency [<a href="#417">417</a>]. Large-scale change 
in structure of plant communities of this type can cause reductions in suitable 
habitat and concomitant shifts in the abundance of some species of birds 
[<a href="#381">381</a>] including Brewer's and sage sparrows and sage-grouse 
[<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#239">239</a>]. Areas in which sagebrush has been removed may not be used by nesting or 
brood-rearing sage-grouse until sagebrush  re-establishes [<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#234">234</a>] 
(see the FEIS report on&nbsp; <a href="../../../animals/bird/cent/index.html">sage-grouse</a>).<p>

<p>Cheatgrass fires can adversely affect wildlife habitat by eliminating important 
forage species such as antelope bitterbrush on elk and mule deer winter range in 
Lassen County, northeastern California, and in northwestern Nevada [<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#438">438</a>]. The 
habitable winter range in this area is relatively small, so when fire promotes 
cheatgrass and reduces scattered foothill clumps of antelope bitterbrush and 
sagebrush, browse, thermal cover, and hiding cover are reduced [<a href="#252">252</a>]. 
Additionally, the length of time that cheatgrass is green and actively growing 
is shorter than that of native perennial vegetation. Thus compared to native 
species, cheatgrass dominance 
reduces the green-feed period for foraging animals [<a href="#306">306</a>].</p>

<p>Conversion of sagebrush habitat to cheatgrass is associated with a decline 
in densities of black-tailed jackrabbits [<a href="#241">241</a>], Townsend's ground 
squirrels [<a href="#471">471</a>], and other small mammals [<a href="#164">164</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>]. Two factors may limit small 
mammal populations after fire: 1) the loss of shrub cover may result in 
increased predation, and 2) thick stands of cheatgrass may impede small mammal 
movements which may affect breeding success and population size [<a href="#176">176</a>]. Similarly, dense cheatgrass can 
blockade newly hatched ducklings from making the vital trek from upland nest to 
lowland water [<a href="#252">252</a>]. Because cheatgrass-dominated communities support 
fewer small mammals than shrub-dominated communities, predator species such as 
the gopher snake, coyote, badger, and raptorial birds are also affected by 
large-scale losses of shrub habitat [<a href="#161">161</a>,<a href="#241">241</a>].  Loss of small mammals results in an 
increasingly unstable prey base for raptors in the Snake River Birds of Prey 
Area [<a href="#161">161</a>,<a href="#471">471</a>] and elsewhere. Kochert and others [<a href="#241">241</a>] have also documented that 
golden eagles avoid previously burned areas, and that 
golden eagle fledging success declines as the extent of burned area increase in 
their territory. Slow-moving fauna such as desert tortoises  are sometimes 
killed in rapidly moving fires such as those that burn in cheatgrass [<a href="#492">492</a>]. The 
effective management of many wildlife species can depend on the control of 
invasive plants like cheatgrass and in the maintenance of appropriate fire regimes 
[<a href="#71">71</a>].<p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Other nonnative invasive species:</font>
Rangelands dominated by cheatgrass may also be susceptible to establishment of 
other nonnative, invasive annual grasses such as interrupted windgrass, corn brome,
little lovegrass, poverty grass, and ventenata that are already present 
in the Pacific Northwest and are capable of invading and naturalizing in 
cheatgrass-infested areas [<a href="#316">316</a>]. The concept of a cheatgrass stand being a 
community closed to the establishment of perennial species [<a href="#371">371</a>] is challenged when one considers nonnative 
perennial and annual species that have invaded cheatgrass stands such as bur 
buttercup,  forage kochia [<a href="#198">198</a>,<a href="#475">475</a>], squarrose knapweed [<a href="#372">372</a>], spotted knapweed, diffuse 
knapweed, rush skeletonweed, leafy spurge, common St. Johnswort, Dalmatian 
toadflax [<a href="#187">187</a>], yellow starthistle [<a href="#187">187</a>,<a href="#387">387</a>], and medusahead [<a href="#187">187</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>,<a href="#196">196</a>,<a href="#295">295</a>]. 
Medusahead has invaded and 
replaced dense stands of cheatgrass [<a href="#189">189</a>,<a href="#295">295</a>] over 
large areas in California, Idaho,
Oregon, and Washington during the past 40 years [<a href="#196">196</a>]. Medusahead&nbsp;herbage is less palatable 
to ungulates, thus reducing 
grazing capacity where it replaces cheatgrass [<a href="#187">187</a>], and its seeds are 
not digestible by upland game birds, which are large consumers of cheatgrass seeds 
[<a href="#379">379</a>]. Evans and Young [<a href="#141">141</a>] suggest that cheatgrass enhances seed germination of several 
nonnative species in desert 
shrublands because of improved water availability associated with cheatgrass 
litter.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Impacts on soil resource:</font>
On ranges in which sagebrush and other native species have been eliminated
by recurrent fires, cultivation, or grazing and now support nearly pure stands
of annual grasses or weeds, soil losses can be severe [<a href="#60">60</a>]. A 
review by Upadhyaya and others [<a href="#437">437</a>] suggests that cheatgrass fires may leave 
land vulnerable to soil erosion because cheatgrass burns so completely. 
Cheatgrass litter may affect the rate and quality of nutrient cycling 
differently than native species, although more research is needed to understand 
these dynamics [<a href="#62">62</a>]. Nutrients may cycle faster in systems dominated 
by cheatgrass because its fine above- and belowground plant material can decompose quickly and 
because infested areas burn frequently, releasing minerals rapidly [<a href="#324">324</a>]. MacDonald [<a href="#260">260</a>] suggests that because 
cheatgrass does not catch and hold snow like a diverse perennial stand of 
vegetation, the site becomes drier. Cheatgrass dominance and associated fires 
also reduce populations, diversity, and recovery of 
biological soil crusts, which affect nutrient cycling, water infiltration, and 
potential soil erosion. When annual nonnatives dominate the plant 
community, the makeup of  biological soil crusts changes, and their 
reestablishment is impaired [<a href="#41">41</a>].<p>

<p>The impacts of cheatgrass on ecosystems that it now dominates are such that the 
goal of managing vegetation to reflect conditions thought to have been 
present before European settlement may be impossible.  Even the concept that preservation of native plant communities will
prevent, eliminate, or control cheatgrass  is not supported by evidence from 
sites in Utah [<a href="#167">167</a>];  in other areas where cheatgrass has 
displaced native bunchgrasses and shrubs in Great Basin; and where it continues to 
dominate sites in southeastern Washington, almost to the total exclusion of native 
grasses [<a href="#324">324</a>]. Dominance of cheatgrass and medusahead will not be changed 
simply by removing cattle or reducing their numbers [<a href="#323">323</a>]. The decision to reclassify 
vegetation types and to manage for cheatgrass instead of native perennial grasses 
may be considered for areas with sparse stands of desirable perennials [<a href="#486">486</a>] 
that are dominated 
instead by cheatgrass, halogeton, and/or medusahead. In such situations neither
complete protection nor conservative grazing can restore a desirable  cover within a reasonable period because a 
seed source of desirable species is
lacking and competition from the undesirable plants is severe [<a href="#60">60</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Control:</b></font> Because cheatgrass is very 
persistent once it becomes established, eradication of large infestations is not usually a reasonable goal. The extent to which cheatgrass 
dominates a plant community greatly determines the appropriate suppression 
strategy [<a href="#274">274</a>,<a href="#306">306</a>], and cheatgrass response to management options is very site 
specific&nbsp;[<a href="#189">189</a>,<a href="#477">477</a>]. Some current research on control and management 
considerations for cheatgrass was presented at the Cheatgrass Awareness 
Conference in February 2003. Summaries and presentations are available online (<a href="http://www.wy.blm.gov/cheatgrass">Cheatgrass 
Awareness Conference</a>). </p>

<p>Care must be taken with methods employed to control 
cheatgrass so that any void left by cheatgrass removal is not filled 
with another nonnative invasive species that may be even less desirable. A thorough site reconnaissance and evaluation is 
recommended before 
initiating any form of plant control.</p>

<p>Monitoring is an important part of weed management [<a href="#218">218</a>], as are early 
detection and local eradication of new infestations [<a href="#497">497</a>]. Estimates of cheatgrass coverage should be designed to determine how 
dominant cheatgrass is in an area compared to other vegetation. Areas should be 
monitored every spring, and relative cover and boundaries of any 
infestation should be recorded. Special attention should be paid to roadsides 
and other disturbed areas where cheatgrass is commonly found. If an infestation 
is found, the location should be recorded and monitored to measure the rate in 
which the infestation is spreading. Determining the relative cover of cheatgrass 
can be difficult due to the fluctuations in cover between years in accordance 
with weather variation [<a href="#84">84</a>]. Tueller [<a href="#432">432</a>] discusses the use of remote sensing to extract
information about burns and annual vegetation patterns in the sagebrush grass
ecosystems of the Great Basin relative to cheatgrass dominance.</p>

<p>Information regarding the extent of cheatgrass dominance in comparison to 
native species can be used to decide appropriate management strategies. 
Strategies may range from protection of areas not yet invaded, to 
reclassification of areas dominated by cheatgrass and management of these areas as cheatgrass 
rangelands. Intermediate to these states are areas with varying densities of 
cheatgrass, many having the potential to be converted to annual grasslands after 
fire. A review by McIver and Starr [<a href="#274">274</a>] 
suggests that &quot;restoration&quot; requires not only the reestablishment of historical 
plant community structures and species compositions, but also of the processes 
needed to sustain these into the future. It may be difficult to predict&nbsp;the 
outcome of control efforts or changes in disturbance regimes at any given site because native plant species respond 
differently to disturbance events [<a href="#270">270</a>,<a href="#274">274</a>].</p>

<p>Once cheatgrass is established, complete protection from grazing or other disturbances 
will not usually reduce cheatgrass abundance. Protection from all grazing can in fact increase the 
chance for fire and cause subsequent increases in cheatgrass dominance 
[<a href="#460">460</a>,<a href="#477">477</a>]. A mountain big sagebrush/bluebunch wheatgrass site in southwestern Idaho that 
was invaded by
cheatgrass and  subsequently protected from further disturbance  continued to be
dominated by cheatgrass for decades. Perennial grasses recovered slowly in 
protected areas, requiring more than 45 years to increase in cover from
about 1.4 to 6.7 % [<a href="#298">298</a>].</p>

<p>Effective control of cheatgrass requires 
1) eliminating live plants, 
2) preventing seed formation, and 
3) controlling seed germination and emerging seedlings [<a href="#300">300</a>].
In plant communities where cheatgrass is present but herbaceous perennials remain abundant, cheatgrass
control measures should include the needs of the perennial plants. Control
without replacement by desirable perennials will likely result in the
reestablishment of cheatgrass or some other undesirable species [<a href="#306">306</a>]. In order to maintain 
dominance on a site, cheatgrass must produce a viable 
seed crop each year. If not, perennial plants can pre-empt the site. On the 
other hand, only a few perennial grass seedlings need to establish each 
year to maintain a perennial stand if mortality in established plants is not excessive 
[<a href="#189">189</a>].&nbsp;Grazing 
management to favor native perennial grasses is doomed to failure unless there 
are sufficient perennial grasses in the ecosystem to outcompete cheatgrass. It 
is inappropriate to manage cheatgrass ranges as if they were perennial grass-dominated ranges [<a href="#475">475</a>].</p>

<p>Large areas that are mostly devoid of perennials and have fire-free intervals 
of 5 or fewer years have probably crossed a threshold, and the cheatgrass 
community probably represents a relatively stable &quot;steady state&quot; [<a href="#251">251</a>,<a href="#306">306</a>], such as exists on 
many depleted sites within Wyoming big 
sagebrush habitat types of the Snake River Plain and other portions of the Columbia 
River Basin [<a href="#306">306</a>]. For such  sites only aggressive methods may have a chance of restoring 
more desirable sagebrush steppe communities [<a href="#251">251</a>,<a href="#377">377</a>,<a href="#439">439</a>]. Some authors 
suggest that it may be best to reclassify  these communities 
as annual grasslands, and manage them accordingly 
[<a href="#439">439</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><font size="4">Prevention:</font> </font>
The most important aspect of invasive species management is prevention [<a href="#191">191</a>,<a href="#386">386</a>]. 
Whether or not cheatgrass establishment can be prevented in arid and semiarid 
rangelands is uncertain. It has been suggested, however, that maintaining an 
adequate cover of native plant species [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>] and biological 
soil crusts [<a href="#41">41</a>] can render some communities more resistant to 
cheatgrass invasion.&nbsp;Managers must be aware that cheatgrass is especially prevalent in 
the early stages of fire succession or following other disturbances when shrubs, 
trees, perennial grasses, and other invasive plants are removed 
[<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>,<a href="#273">273</a>,<a href="#291">291</a>,<a href="#295">295</a>,<a href="#380">380</a>,<a href="#386">386</a>,<a href="#395">395</a>], and that cheatgrass density can increase 
dramatically 2 to 3 years after disturbance.</p>

<p>Proper grazing management may be an important tool in preventing or delaying further 
encroachments of cheatgrass into perennial vegetation [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#175">175</a>,<a href="#439">439</a>]. </p>

<p>Management practices that maximize the amount of
organic debris left onsite and minimize the period of time between vegetation
removal and reestablishment can limit the establishment of
invasive plant species [<a href="#399">399</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Integrated management:</font> 
Once established, cheatgrass can rarely be controlled 
or eradicated with a single method, and most researchers and managers recommend combining physical, 
biological, chemical, and cultural control methods in some fashion [<a href="#492">492</a>]. 
Individual control methods (e.g. disking, herbicides, and prescribed fire) have limited application for control of 
cheatgrass on rangeland, and are more effective when used as site preparation 
for revegetation with desirable species [<a href="#306">306</a>]. </p>

<p>Controlling live cheatgrass plants and the existing seed bank requires a 
combination of treatments conducted over a 1- to 2-year period. For example, 
mature plants can be killed before seed dispersal in spring by tilling or 
burning, with fall tillage or herbicide application as a follow-up treatment to 
eliminate any new seedlings. Artificial seeding of desired species is then conducted in 
the late fall or early winter [<a href="#300">300</a>]. Another strategy is to use prescribed fire 
in autumn to prepare sites for seeding the following spring [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#306">306</a>,<a href="#360">360</a>]. 
Disking, herbicides, or prescribed livestock grazing can then be used in late 
spring to reduce vigor and seed production of the cheatgrass plants that 
establish after the fire. Seeding the site can be delayed until after the 
disking, herbicide, or prescribed grazing treatment, or the site can be 
broadcast-seeded immediately before  grazing treatment, in order to use  livestock to trample in the seed [<a href="#306">306</a>]. Another effective approach combines 
summer burning, when the majority of cheatgrass seeds were still held in the 
inflorescences, followed by fall herbicide application after cheatgrass 
seedlings have emerged [<a href="#180">180</a>]. It is unclear how long reductions of 
cheatgrass may last. Harris and Goebel [<a href="#189">189</a>] suggest that burning alone is 
usually not enough to destroy seeds, but can be combined with mechanical or 
chemical treatment to improve effectiveness.</p>

<p>Sheley and others [<a href="#388">388</a>] provide examples of
successional weed management systems that integrate various control techniques to direct successional processes, 
resulting in different successional
patterns and usefulness to range managers. The resultant plant community is
dependent on the specific weed management system and the plant community prior to weed
management [<a href="#386">386</a>,<a href="#388">388</a>].</p>

<p>On the Lawrence Memorial Grassland Preserve in Oregon, combinations of 
prescribed burning, herbicide applications (glyphosate), and mowing treatments 
were used to prevent cheatgrass and medusahead seed maturation. Preliminary results 
indicate that glyphosate treatment, and summer prescribed burning followed by 
mowing the next year, were equally effective at reducing invasive annual grass 
cover [<a href="#347">347</a>]. A multi-state, interdisciplinary research project has 
been proposed to examine integrated restoration strategies on western rangelands 
[<a href="#321">321</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Physical/mechanical:</font> 
Mixed results are reported for controlling 
cheatgrass with physical methods such as hand pulling, cutting or mowing, and 
disking or tilling. Tillage is often cited as an effective control method when 
combined with other methods; however, such intensive treatments are not usually 
appropriate for natural areas or wildlands and often lead to establishment of 
other undesirable plants. Regardless of which method is used, the cheatgrass seed bank must 
be depleted to get effective control [<a href="#84">84</a>].</p>

<p>In small areas, hand pulling can  effectively control cheatgrass [<a href="#363">363</a>]. </p>

<p>Cutting or mowing is not a recommended control method for cheatgrass unless 
it can be repeated several times per year, for several years. Plants that are cut before seed ripening  
can generate new culms and produce seeds at the cut height. Plants that are cut
after seed ripening will still leave viable seeds [<a href="#154">154</a>,<a href="#347">347</a>]. Because seeds may be viable as early as the dough stage, 
before any purple coloration appears, there is only a short period after 
inflorescences appear that the plants can be mowed without danger of dispersing
viable seeds. Therefore there is no single phenological stage that can be mowed which 
will assure complete kill or absence of seeds [<a href="#207">207</a>]. Cutting cheatgrass 
plants along trails before seeds are ripe and throughout the season can reduce 
spread of the invasion. Cutting cheatgrass plants for 3 consecutive years 
reduced densely populated areas at the Northeast Preserves in Oregon [<a href="#363">363</a>]. 
Repeated mowing (every 3 weeks) during the spring and summer was as effective at 
controlling cheatgrass seed production as was an application of glyphosate, 
though it was very labor intensive [<a href="#347">347</a>].</p>

<p>A review by Mosley and others [<a href="#306">306</a>] suggests that tillage and other 
mechanical control methods applied alone are often ineffective for controlling 
cheatgrass on rangeland. To be effective, tillage must be 4 to 6 inches (10-15 
cm) deep to bury cheatgrass seeds in the soil and prevent them from germinating. 
More than 1 tillage treatment is 
usually needed, because the tillage equipment does not consistently cut deeply 
enough to bury the seed. To  effectively suppress cheatgrass, tillage must 
be followed by sowing of desirable plants [<a href="#306">306</a>]. Tillage is not 
usually appropriate in wildlands and rangelands since it can damage important 
desirable species, increase erosion, alter soil structure, and expose  soil 
for rapid invasion of cheatgrass and other invasive plants.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Biological:</font> 
No insects or fungi have been approved by the USDA for use as 
biological control agents for
cheatgrass. Cheatgrass is often infected with a head smut fungus (<i>Ustilago bulleta</i>)
that may reduce seed yield when severe. Meyer and others [<a href="#288">288</a>] are exploring 
whether using this fungus may be feasible for biocontrol of cheatgrass. Some research has been conducted on
the potential of pink snow mold (<i>Fusarium nivale</i>) as a control agent. In addition to these 
fungi, over 
20 diseases of cheatgrass have been reported [<a href="#492">492</a>]. Kennedy [<a href="#230">230</a>] 
summarizes developmental research on the use of soil bacteria from the genus <i>
Pseudomonas</i> as biocontrol agents for cheatgrass. Reviews by Carpenter and 
Murray [<a href="#84">84</a>] and Mosely and others [<a href="#306">306</a>] suggest that these microbes colonize 
the seeds and roots of cheatgrass and produce a toxin that appears to inhibit 
cell elongation in the growing plant. The toxin may also inhibit cheatgrass 
germination and seedling vigor. One particular strain, <i>P. fluorescens</i> D7, inhibits several biotypes of cheatgrass from throughout the
world. This strain of bacteria also attacks other species in the <i>Bromus</i> 
genus.</p>

<p>Livestock grazing can reduce cheatgrass cover [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#341">341</a>] and can be purposely manipulated to control 
cheatgrass [<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#307">307</a>,<a href="#439">439</a>], although some authors recommend against it (e.g. [<a href="#137">137</a>]). This tool is probably best suited to 
localized areas, either for
protecting existing stands of perennial plants from fire, or for aiding the
artificial seeding of severely depleted sites [<a href="#307">307</a>].</p>

<p>To prevent seed production, Mosely [<a href="#307">307</a>] recommends that cheatgrass plants be 
grazed before they turn purple in color. At least 2 defoliations are needed in 
the spring of each year, for a minimum of 2 consecutive years, to control 
cheatgrass [<a href="#307">307</a>]. Clipping was used experimentally to simulate grazing for 
cheatgrass control. Late spring clipping had the largest reduction in both 
density and biomass of cheatgrass compared to fall and early spring clipping or clipping in early spring 
only [<a href="#413">413</a>]. On salt-desert shrubland in western Utah, cheatgrass cover
remained the same over 50 years on ungrazed range. It increased only very
slightly on range grazed by domestic sheep in the fall, while spring
grazing tended to increase cover of cheatgrass in general [<a href="#459">459</a>].</p>

<p>Prescribed domestic sheep grazing can be used 
to suppress cheatgrass density, growth, seed production, and mulch accumulations [<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#307">307</a>]. This is more easily 
accomplished in areas devoid of desirable perennials 
than in areas where remnant desirable perennials are present and need to be  protected [<a href="#307">307</a>]. Where desirable perennials 
are present, grazing intensity should be light 
enough so that desirable grasses have a residual stubble height of 3 inches (8 
cm) or more [<a href="#307">307</a>]. Grazing  dried cheatgrass during winter dormancy 
will help reduce mulch accumulations and enhance seedling establishment of 
perennials. Grazing intensities in winter can be moderately heavy without 
damaging desirable plants, if soils are dry and firm [<a href="#306">306</a>]. Grazing in late autumn, when herbaceous plants are 
dormant, can reduce sagebrush 
density and enhance the ability of perennial herbs to compete with cheatgrass and 
sagebrush [<a href="#307">307</a>].&nbsp; Encouraging  reestablishment of native plants improves the 
effectiveness of grazing as a control method [<a href="#492">492</a>]. Where cheatgrass is a 
problem in bluebunch wheatgrass communities, properly timed grazing (before the 
boot stage of bluebunch wheatgrass, which coincides with shoot and flower 
development of cheatgrass) for a short 
duration is a helpful control technique [<a href="#293">293</a>]. Mixtures 
of crested wheatgrass and cheatgrass soon become dominated by crested wheatgrass 
if grazing on the area is well managed [<a href="#405">405</a>]. Prescribed domestic sheep grazing can also be combined with prescribed fires, 
herbicides, disking, and broadcast seeding [<a href="#307">307</a>].</p>

<p>In mixed stands with desirable perennials, livestock grazing can be directed 
to 1) reduce cheatgrass competition by concentrating grazing of cheatgrass 
during the dough seed stage, providing perennials have the opportunity to 
complete their life cycle, or 2) focus grazing on the needs of perennials while 
mostly ignoring cheatgrass [<a href="#439">439</a>]. Daubenmire [<a href="#112">112</a>] noted that cheatgrass did not 
dominate under heavy grazing pressure during spring, when livestock feed on the plants so heavily that no seeds matured. 
In this case, scattered plants may escape grazing, and when animals are removed, 
cheatgrass quickly dominates the area. Excessive grazing in the early spring, 
year after year, weakens the native cool-season perennial grasses, thereby 
providing habitat for cheatgrass to spread, but it also reduces abundance of 
cheatgrass. &quot;The fact that excessive spring grazing both enhances the presence 
and biologically suppresses the abundance of cheatgrass is one of the most misunderstood aspects of the biology of this
grass&quot; [<a href="#477">477</a>].</p>

<p>Sanders [<a href="#377">377</a>] suggests that annual rangelands receiving 14 or more inches 
(356 mm) of annual precipitation can be converted to perennial rangeland through
grazing management, providing there are sufficient perennial plants present as a
seed source. Even in this precipitation zone, however, conversion seldom occurs
without some means of reducing the annual grass competition (herbicides, fire,
heavy spring grazing). Sanders adds that there is little evidence that annual rangelands 
receiving less than 12
inches (300 mm) of annual precipitation can be converted through grazing management alone 
[<a href="#377">377</a>].</p>

<p>Fire-free intervals can be lengthened by using prescribed domestic sheep grazing to 
disrupt fine-fuel continuity and reduce fine-fuel loads [<a href="#307">307</a>]. 
Grazed firelines should be at least 250 feet (75 m) wide [<a href="#306">306</a>,<a href="#468">468</a>]. </p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Chemical:</font>   
Several herbicides have been used alone or in combination to
provide effective control of cheatgrass, including quizalofop, fluazifop-p-butyl,
sethoxydim, paraquat, glyphosate, imazapic, sulfometuron methyl, and atrazine 
[<a href="#84">84</a>]. Carpenter and Murray [<a href="#84">84</a>] give more details and contacts in various states with 
specific chemical control information (see The Nature Conservancy's
<a href="http://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/esadocs.html">Wildland Invasive Species Team</a> 
website to view this document online). The 
<a href="http://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/handbook.html">Weed Control Methods 
Handbook</a> has  detailed 
information on some of these chemicals as well [<a href="#431">431</a>].</p>

<p>Chemical control can be used effectively when desired perennial plants are
still abundant. One year of chemical application will
only temporarily thin the cheatgrass population and may actually increase cheatgrass
seed production. Treatment must be repeated from 2 to 5 years consecutively. Several newer herbicides, 
especially imazapic, are being tested for selective
control of cheatgrass in perennial broadleaf seedling stands [<a href="#492">492</a>]. Summaries of 
some current research on the use of imazapic for cheatgrass control are 
available (<a href="http://www.wy.blm.gov/cheatgrass">Cheatgrass Awareness 
Conference</a>).</p>

<p>Sulfometuron methyl has been used to control cheatgrass on rangelands for 1 
to 2 years and thus improve the success of rehabilitation projects. Projects in Nevada and Idaho 
comparing sulfometuron methyl treatment with burning and disking are
summarized by Pellant and others [<a href="#336">336</a>]. There are various restrictions associated 
with sulfometuron methyl use. Ongoing and available studies include rates, season 
[<a href="#56">56</a>], effects of sulfometuron methyl on survival and reproduction of native 
plants and biological soil crusts, and effects on seeded perennial plants 
[<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#336">336</a>]. Spring treatments were considerably less effective; and damage to 
native bunchgrasses (Sandberg bluegrass and bottlebrush squirreltail) occurred 
with high application rates in spring [<a href="#385">385</a>]. Other studies explore the effects 
of combining  chemical control with prescribed burning and seeding of 
desirable plants [<a href="#131">131</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>,<a href="#443">443</a>,<a href="#462">462</a>,<a href="#479">479</a>].</p>

<p>Some cheatgrass biotypes have evolved resistance to herbicides including 
atrazine, simazine, chlorotoluron, primisulfuron-methyl, and sulfosulfuron; and 
may be cross-resistant to other photosystem II inhibitors, urea, amides, 
and/or acetolactase inhibitors. More information on herbicide resistance is 
available at <a href="http://www.weedscience.org/in.asp">WeedScience.org</a>.</p>

<p>Chemical control of other invasive species can result in increases in
cheatgrass. For example, the use of 2,4-D alone to control spotted knapweed
resulted in an increase in biomass and cover of cheatgrass, while the use of
2,4-D and grazing by domestic sheep resulted in lower biomass and cover of cheatgrass

compared to treatment with 2,4-D alone [<a href="#249">249</a>]. Similarly, 
application of clopyralid to control yellow starthistle can  increase cheatgrass 
cover [<a href="#122">122</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><a name="Cultural">Cultural:</a></font> 
Cheatgrass is not competitive with established perennials, particularly grasses; 
therefore, biological suppression with desirable perennials may be an effective method of controlling cheatgrass [<a href="#492">492</a>]. 
Because cheatgrass seedlings can outcompete seedlings of most perennial
species and prevent their establishment, successful 
establishment of desirable perennials 1st requires the depletion or 
removal of cheatgrass plants and seed bank [<a href="#138">138</a>,<a href="#306">306</a>,<a href="#371">371</a>]. Robertson and Pearse 
[<a href="#371">371</a>] suggest that openings in cheatgrass communities caused by severe drought, 
fire, or grazing can provide conditions favorable for artificial reseeding with 
desirable species, provided sufficient soil remains. Evans [<a href="#138">138</a>], however, found 
that as few as&nbsp;4 cheatgrass seedlings per square foot (43/m<sup>2</sup>) can inhibit survival of crested 
wheatgrass seedlings, implying that is necessary to achieve near-perfect 
cheatgrass control for successful perennial seedings [<a href="#140">140</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#371">371</a>]. Techniques for accomplishing this are presented 
in the above 
sections. Haferkamp and others [<a href="#180">180</a>] examine several different seedbed 
preparations and seeding methods on sites in Washington and Oregon. 
Effectiveness of these techniques varies widely, depending on terrain, local 
weather conditions, treatment timing relative to cheatgrass development, and 
recovery of annuals from residual seed reserves left near the soil surface where 
they are capable of germinating [<a href="#385">385</a>]. For information regarding revegetation 
after prescribed burning or wildfire 
see <a href="fire_effects.html#FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">Fire Management Considerations</a>.</p>

<p>Young [<a href="#476">476</a>] summarizes the history of revegetation programs in the West, 
comparing species, sites, and ecosystems. Monsen and McArthur [<a href="#302">302</a>] provide a 
discussion of the history of revegetation projects in the Intermountain West, 
including constraints and benefits of using native and nonnative species. Most 
attempts to artificially seed big sagebrush ranges with native grasses prior to 
1945 were largely unsuccessful. The introduction of crested wheatgrass, a 
nonnative, drought-tolerant perennial grass, made large-scale seeding of 
sagebrush ranges possible. From 1945 to 1965, several million acres of sagebrush 
rangeland were seeded to crested wheatgrass in the Intermountain area. 
Cheatgrass distribution was limited by extreme grazing pressure at that time, so 
these seedings took place in seedbeds with limited cheatgrass competition. The 
universal grazing management systems that followed ultimately favored cheatgrass 
establishment (see [<a href="#476">476</a>] for details). Subsequent increases in the distribution 
and density of cheatgrass now precludes the successful establishment of crested 
wheatgrass and other perennials without prior cheatgrass control on most of 
these sites [<a href="#476">476</a>].</p>

<p>Crested wheatgrass is a reliable and persistent grass for low-elevation, 
drought-prone areas of the Intermountain West. It establishes rapidly even under 
relatively dry conditions and tends to persist for many years [<a href="#225">225</a>,<a href="#300">300</a>,<a href="#326">326</a>]. It 
is best adapted to the sagebrush grassland portions of the Intermountain range, 
but not to salt-desert ranges [<a href="#371">371</a>]. While studies have indicated that 
cheatgrass is a superior competitor to crested wheatgrass [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#158">158</a>,<a href="#190">190</a>,<a href="#208">208</a>], 
they have also indicated that crested wheatgrass competes more effectively with 
cheatgrass than does bluebunch wheatgrass [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#136">136</a>,<a href="#190">190</a>]. </p>

<p>In addition to crested wheatgrass, several other nonnative, herbaceous forage 
species have  been used for revegetation and cultural control 
efforts, with limited to mixed success [<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#326">326</a>,<a href="#486">486</a>]. A long-term study to 
identify the species best suited to seeding semiarid rangeland sites in 
northeastern Washington indicated that hard fescue (<i>Festuca</i> <i>trachyphylla</i>) was the most aggressive 
competitor, and  cultivars of crested wheatgrass  provided the highest yields. 
Several other grasses were also tested and compared, and results are presented by 
Harris and Dobrowolski [<a href="#188">188</a>]. A review by Mosley and 
others [<a href="#306">306</a>] provides the following summary: 'Hycrest' crested wheatgrass, 
'Sodar' streambank wheatgrass (<i>Elymus lanceolatus</i>), and 'Luna' 
intermediate wheatgrass are most suitable 
on unirrigated sites where
annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches (300-400 mm). 'Regar' meadow bromegrass (<i>Bromus biebersteinii)</i> and
orchardgrass (<i>Dactylis glomerata</i>) are suitable for reseeding most
cheatgrass-infested rangeland where annual precipitation exceeds 16 inches (400
mm), although orchardgrass can also be invasive. Drought-resistant species such as 'Hycrest' crested wheatgrass and Siberian
wheatgrass (<i>Agropyron</i> <i>fragile</i>) are most suitable in areas receiving 
less than 12 inches (300 mm) of annual precipitation, although successful 
establishment on such dry sites is especially difficult [<a href="#306">306</a>].&nbsp;Native grasses are more difficult to 
establish, less persistent, and less productive than nonnative grasses on sites 
with less than 10 to 12 inches (254-300 mm) of annual precipitation [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#300">300</a>]. Mountain rye (<i>Secale montanum</i>) was 
seeded on reclaimed coal mined lands in
southeastern Montana to suppress cheatgrass and Japanese brome (<i>Bromus 
japonicus</i>). It was effective
for short-term suppression (2 years), but not for longer-term control [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].</p>

<p>Some managers are experimenting with another nonnative plant, forage kochia, for use on 
severely altered semiarid rangelands that support monocultures of cheatgrass and/or 
tumblemustard and are subject to repeated fires in Nevada [<a href="#90">90</a>], Utah [<a href="#271">271</a>,<a href="#329">329</a>], 
and Idaho [<a href="#305">305</a>]. 
It is argued that forage kochia provides mule deer with highly digestible 
protein that crested wheatgrass lacks; is adapted to very dry sites (5 to 27 
inches (127-956 mm) precipitation); is more easily
established and has higher growth rates than antelope bitterbrush;  is 
persistent; and  is one of
the few perennial species that can compete with cheatgrass. It is also suggested 
that forage kochia can create an open window for the return of native plants by 
decreasing fire frequency. In a seeding operation on a degraded range in Nevada, managers
planted a mixture of forage kochia, Wyoming big sagebrush, fourwing saltbush,
and a variety of bunchgrasses. By the 4th growing season, Wyoming big
sagebrush, thickspike wheatgrass (<i>Elymus 
lanceolatus</i>), and other native bunchgrasses and forbs were becoming more 
visible [<a href="#90">90</a>]. Care must be taken if using forage kochia, since it can also be 
invasive.</p>

<p>The practice of seeding nonnative perennial grasses such as crested 
wheatgrass to contain nonnative 
annuals, stabilize disturbances, and provide forage for livestock was initially successful, but resulting stands do not provide the structure, functions, 
resilience, or values of native communities any more than monocultures of 
cheatgrass [<a href="#239">239</a>,<a href="#253">253</a>,<a href="#304">304</a>]. These plant conversions have negatively impacted 
wildlife habitat in big sagebrush communities by reducing the diversity of 
shrubs and forbs that was present in native communities. Big sagebrush 
communities throughout the western U.S. have seen rapid and continuing declines 
in populations of small mammals, raptors, sage-grouse, songbirds,
other vertebrates, and invertebrates, particularly in the last 20 to 40 years
[<a href="#304">304</a>].  Monsen and Shaw [<a href="#304">304</a>] review the current status of 
rehabilitation efforts in big sagebrush communities and suggest that failure to establish native species
in revegetation plantings is due in part to inexperience and inappropriate 
planting techniques, and may also be related to  species, subspecies, and 
ecotypes of plants used.</p>

<p>It is commonly thought that restoration of rangeland plant communities 
using native grasses is difficult [<a href="#476">476</a>]. However, natural recovery of some 
cheatgrass sites by native species has been observed (e.g. [<a href="#300">300</a>,<a href="#455">455</a>]). Sandberg 
bluegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, Thurber needlegrass, western wheatgrass, 
and thickspike wheatgrass&nbsp;have recolonized and gained dominance on sites once infested by 
cheatgrass [<a href="#300">300</a>]. The natural recovery process certainly suggests that 
these same species can be effectively used in artificial seedings if seeds are 
readily 
available and planting requirements are better understood.&nbsp;Some progress has 
been made using selected native species to restore cheatgrass-infested sites, 
and carefully planned seedings in  sagebrush benchlands and pinyon-juniper 
woodlands can often restore the native understory and prevent further spread of 
cheatgrass. Additional information on the use of native plant materials for 
sagebrush steppe restoration is given by Jones [<a href="#221">221</a>].</p>

<p>As is true for nonnative perennials, establishing native perennials is most 
effective when cheatgrass is removed or its density substantially reduced 
[<a href="#189">189</a>,<a href="#303">303</a>,<a href="#357">357</a>,<a href="#492">492</a>]. Replacement species for cheatgrass must be able to germinate 
and produce a vigorous seedling with 1 to 2 days of wet soil, and the seedling must be  morphologically adapted to 
survive drought periods
of 10 or more days following a 2-day wet period in order to be competitive with
cheatgrass [<a href="#160">160</a>]. Hardegree [<a href="#182">182</a>] suggests seed priming to increase germination 
rates of native perennial grasses relative to cheatgrass. Research by Chambers 
[<a href="#85">85</a>] indicates the need to create soil surface features that  trap and retain 
seeds and provide favorable conditions for seedling establishment. Monsen and 
Shaw [<a href="#299">299</a>,<a href="#301">301</a>,<a href="#304">304</a>] provide detailed discussions of restoration of big sagebrush 
communities in the Intermountain West using native plants such as big sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, 
thickspike wheatgrass, and Sandberg bluegrass.</p>

<p>A review by Ott and others [<a href="#326">326</a>,<a href="#327">327</a>] suggests that native perennial grasses 
such as bluebunch wheatgrass and bottlebrush squirreltail can have a competitive 
impact on cheatgrass growth and reproduction, particularly as mature plants. 
Suppression of cheatgrass invasion following fire has been observed in areas 
where these grasses or other fire-tolerant native plants were abundant in the 
prefire community and readily recovered following fire [<a href="#326">326</a>,<a href="#361">361</a>,<a href="#455">455</a>]. Cheatgrass 
has high relative shoot and root growth rates  compared with bottlebrush 
squirreltail and bluebunch wheatgrass [<a href="#23">23</a>]. Detailed treatment of competition between cheatgrass and bluebunch wheatgrass
is given by Harris [<a href="#186">186</a>]. Bluebunch wheatgrass seedlings may have a better chance of
establishing among bottlebrush squirreltail plants than among cheatgrass or 
medusahead [<a href="#196">196</a>].</p>

<p>Bottlebrush squirreltail is a promising candidate for assisting ecological 
restoration of rangelands dominated by medusahead and cheatgrass [<a href="#196">196</a>,<a href="#220">220</a>]. It has successfully colonized stands of annual 
grasses in 
southern Idaho [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#198">198</a>], and can 
 
establish naturally in rangelands infested by cheatgrass [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#300">300</a>]. Bottlebrush squirreltail appears particularly well 
adapted to 
postfire establishment and competition with cheatgrass [<a href="#62">62</a>]. 
Early fall seeding of
bottlebrush squirreltail in  cheatgrass-infested rangelands could be effective in future
restoration projects [<a href="#38">38</a>].</p>

<p>Idaho fescue is a native perennial bunchgrass that can persist in areas with 
high densities of cheatgrass. Idaho fescue plants from cheatgrass-infested areas 
tend to be more effective competitors than plants&nbsp;from pristine areas. This 
suggests that continual competition with cheatgrass selects for a  more competitive group of Idaho fescue plants. Hence,
seeds from Idaho fescue plants in cheatgrass-infested areas may prove to be more 
successful at suppressing cheatgrass when planted elsewhere [<a href="#314">314</a>,<a href="#315">315</a>].</p>

<p>Desert needlegrass (<i>Achnatherum speciosum</i>) is a potentially  valuable native 
species for use in restoration seedings in the more arid portions of the Great 
Basin [<a href="#357">357</a>]. Kitchen&nbsp;[<a href="#233">233</a>] summarizes information on perennial forb life-history
strategies on semiarid rangelands and their implications for revegetation. Meyer [<a href="#284">284</a>] discusses establishment of big
sagebrush in community
restoration projects in the Intermountain West. She suggests 1st establishing 
early seral species such as bottlebrush squirreltail, since they
appear better able to compete with cheatgrass and other annuals, and then seeding 
big sagebrush along with late-seral understory species. Shaw and Haferkamp [<a href="#384">384</a>] discuss using spiny 
hopsage for revegetation in a Wyoming big sagebrush community in southern Idaho. Belnap and Sharpe [<a href="#42">42</a>] 
present a study using native grasses to revegetate a bunchgrass community in 
Utah. Winterfat was successfully established after fire in 
Idaho [<a href="#303">303</a>]. Stevens [<a href="#403">403</a>] cites evidence and 
provides guidelines for establishing plants such as big sagebrush, rubber 
rabbitbrush, fourwing saltbush, antelope bitterbrush, Palmer's penstemon (<i>Penstemon</i>
<i>palmeri</i>), western yarrow (<i>Achillea millefolium</i>), globemallow (<i>Sphaeralcea
</i>spp.), and other native and some nonnative species by interseeding into existing stands  of cheatgrass.</p>

<p>Jones and others [<a href="#219">219</a>] conducted a study to determine if it is possible to restore the moss component
of biological soil crusts to a nonnative annual grassland devoid of perennial 
mosses. Moss recovery or initiation was low over the 
entire experiment, regardless of the site preparation methods used (sulfometuron 
methyl, burning, and tilling), all of which were effective for controlling the 
cheatgrass [<a href="#219">219</a>].</p>

In the absence of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM), mycorrhizal bunchgrasses (e.g. bluebunch
wheatgrass and Idaho fescue) are at a competitive disadvantage compared to nonmycorrhizal species (e.g. Russian-thistle) 
or facultatively mycorrhizal species 
(e.g. cheatgrass) in capturing limited soil resources.  When a plant community
is predominantly nonmycorrhizal, VAM fungi decline in abundance and remain
depressed until host plants  reestablish. Therefore, reestablishment of
VAM-dependent plant species may not occur until both plant propagules and the spores of
VAM fungi occupy the same site at the same time [<a href="#404">404</a>,<a href="#463">463</a>]. Rehabilitation of disturbed
sites may need to include techniques designed to stimulate the reestablishment of VAM symbiosis [<a href="#463">463</a>].
