<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Arizona cypress has a restricted range in the southwestern United
States.  The typical variety is local in mountain canyons from
Trans-Pecos Texas (Chisos Mountains) to southwestern New Mexico and
southeastern Arizona.  Arizona cypress is best developed in Mexico, from
northeastern Sonora south to Durango and east to Coahuila, Zacatecas,
and Tamaulipas [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  It is cultivated in Hawaii [<a href="#72">72</a>].  Smooth
cypress is local in the mountains of central Arizona [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  It is
also cultivated in Hawaii [<a href="#72">72</a>].  Piute cypress is rare and local in the
Piute Mountains in the vicinity of Kern and Tulare counties, California.
Cuyamaca cypress is rare and local in the Cuyamaca Mountains of San
Diego County, California, and is also local in the Sierra Juarez, Baja
California Norte, Mexico.  San Pedro Martir cypress is local in the
Sierra San Pedro Martir, Baja California Norte, Mexico [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Arizona cypress is a common but scattered component of canyon riparian
associations [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  These interior, mixed-broadleaf communities
comprise a variety of typical riparian species that include Arizona
sycamore (Platanus wrightii), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica),
cottonwoods (Populus fremontii, P. angustifolia), box elder (Acer
negundo), Arizona alder (Alnus oblongifolia), bigtooth maple (Acer
grandidentatum), and Arizona walnut (Juglans major) [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].

Carmichael and others [<a href="#70">70</a>] have described an Arizona cypress-shrub live
oak (Quercus turbinella) association.  Arizona cypress is also a
frequent codominant with alligator juniper (Juniperus deppeana), pinyons
(Pinus cembroides and P. edulis), and a number of oaks including
silverleaf oak (Q. hypoleucoides), netleaf oak (Q. reticulata), and
Arizona white oak (Q. arizonica) [<a href="#46">46</a>].  In Cochise County, Arizona,
Arizona cypress is co- or subdominant in oak woodlands that include
Emory oak (Quercus emoryi), Mexican blue oak (Q. oblongifolia), Toumey
oak (Q. toumeyi), oneseed juniper (Juniperus monosperma), and Arizona
madrone (Arbutus arizonica), in addition to the aforementioned oaks and
junipers [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Arizona cypress is progressively more restricted to
riparian habitats at lower elevations where the woodland zone grades
into the shrub-dominated desert and semidesert vegetation types [<a href="#46">46</a>].

Arizona cypress is also found in stands at higher elevations, mixed with
other conifers including Arizona pine (Pinus ponderosa var. arizonica),
Apache pine (P. engelmannii), Chihuahua pine (P. leiophylla var.
chihuahuana), and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) [<a href="#46">46</a>].

In pure stands, Arizona cypress often forms closed canopies that
preclude the occurrence of understory species over considerable portions
of the stand [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Shrub associates along canyon bottoms and lower
slopes include skunkbush sumac (Rhus trilobata), mountain-mahogany
(Cercocarpus spp.), New Mexico locust (Robinia neomexicana), cliff
fendlerbush (Fendlera rupicola), indigobush (Dalea formosa),
mountainbalm (Eriodictyon angustifolium), and buckthorn (Rhamnus spp.).
On drier sites, understory species include sugar sumac (Rhus ovata),
desert ceanothus (Ceanothus greggii), pringle manzanita (Arctostaphylos
pringlei), and pointleaf manzanita (A. pungens) [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
The wood of Arizona cypress is light, moderately soft, close-grained,
and has a specific gravity of 0.48.  The wood is durable when seasoned
properly [<a href="#64">64</a>].  It is suitable for sashes, doors, and blinds [<a href="#24">24</a>].
There are not enough large, accessible populations of Arizona cypress to
make it commercially important, though it is sometimes cut locally for
rough construction and fenceposts [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Rodents consume cypress seeds [<a href="#1">1</a>].

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Arizona cypress is sometimes planted on disturbed sites for erosion
control [<a href="#64">64</a>].  Direct seeding is slightly better than transplanting for
successful establishment.  Arizona cypress's ability to stabilize soil
and adapt to disturbed areas is rated as moderate; it is suitable for
either acidic or alkaline soils [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Everett and others [<a href="#13">13</a>] reported
that Arizona cypress had low survival (40 percent) when planted for
revegetation of mine spoils in central California, where frost heaving
was a problem.


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Arizona cypress is valued as an ornamental.  It is also planted for
windbreaks [<a href="#64">64</a>] and is cultivated for Christmas trees [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
The limited distribution of Arizona cypress varieties in the United
States has raised concerns about the risk of its extinction [<a href="#68">68</a>].  Posey
and Goggans [<a href="#49">49</a>] reported that they observed little Arizona cypress
reproduction anywhere in the Southwest (no specific data, however) and
were concerned that a low reproductive rate may threaten the existence
of the species.
  
Natural stands of Arizona cypress in Texas occur only in Big Bend
National Park and are therefore protected from logging and most other
disturbances.  Groves in southeastern Arizona and southwestern New
Mexico all occur on public lands; some are in National Monuments where
they are protected [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Smooth cypress occurs mostly on public lands,
some of which are accessible to logging.  Piute cypress occurs in the
Piute Cypress Botanical and Natural Area in Kern County, California, and
in the Bodfish Botanical Area, and is protected.  Cuyamaca cypress, the
rarest variety, is known in the United States from a single grove in the
Cuyamaca Mountains, partly within the Cleveland National Forest and
partly in the Cuyamaca Rancho State Park; it is protected from logging
[<a href="#32">32</a>].  This variety is under consideration for listing as federally
endangered; a single large fire could conceivably annihilate the entire
grove.  Wolf [<a href="#68">68</a>] suggested that it is feasible to set all areas
occupied by Arizona cypress varieties aside as reserves, eliminate
excessive cutting and grazing, and protect the stands from fire.

Arizona cypress is easily cultivated, which could help protect it
against extinction by fire or other disturbance [<a href="#32">32</a>].  It can be
propagated by cuttings or veneer grafting [<a href="#64">64</a>].

Seedlings are susceptible to damping-off fungi [<a href="#22">22</a>].  San Pedro Martir
cypress is occasionally attacked by mistletoe (Phoradendron bolleanum
ssp. pauciflorum), and Arizona cypress may be infected by P.
juniperinum ssp. juniperum.  Cypress canker attacks most species of
cypress [<a href="#22">22</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cupressus arizonica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Arizona cypress is a native, evergreen tree.  In Arizona, it usually
grows 40 to 50 feet (12-15 m) tall but may be as tall as 90 feet (27 m).
Arizona cypress has a diameter of to 2 to 3 feet (0.6-0.9 m) with a
maximum of 5.5 feet (1.6 m) [<a href="#24">24</a>].  In Texas, Arizona cypress usually is
less than 33 feet (10 m) tall but may reach 82 feet (25 m) in height,
and is usually 20 inches (50 cm) or less in diameter [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Smooth
cypress is usually 25 to 50 feet (8-15 m) tall, Cuyamaca cypress is
generally 30 to 50 feet (9-15 m) tall, and Piute cypress is usually 20
to 50 feet tall (6-15 m) [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  The short, stout horizontal branches
form a dense, conical or narrowly pyramidal crown, which may sometimes
be broad and flat [<a href="#64">64</a>].  The trunk either branches near the ground or is
well developed and branch-free for some length [<a href="#24">24</a>].  The largest trees
are seldom more than 700 years old [<a href="#64">64</a>].  Two stands examined for age
structure in southeastern Arizona had individuals ranging in age from
approximately 25 to 178.1 years and from 197.6 to 456.7 years [<a href="#46">46</a>].

The leaves are all small and scalelike.  The ovulate cones are globose,
with woody, separating scales [<a href="#24">24</a>].  In young trees, the bark breaks
into thin, large, irregular scales.  On older trunks and branches the
bark is longitudinally furrowed, fibrous, and shreddy [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].

Smooth cypress is distinguished by its habit of shedding the outer bark,
which exposes the smooth inner bark [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Cuyamaca cypress has thin
bark that is smooth and exfoliating [<a href="#42">42</a>].

A well-defined taproot and numerous lateral roots are formed the first
year [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Arizona cypress reproduces exclusively from seed.  Mature cones have
been observed on 14-year-old individuals of Cuyamaca cypress, indicating
that sexual maturity occurred sometime previous [<a href="#66">66</a>].  Ovulate cones are
usually abundant each year and contain from 48 to 112 seeds each [<a href="#64">64</a>].
The cones are closed; they persist on the tree until opened by the heat
of a fire or desiccation due to age [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].  Seeds are shed gradually
over several months after the cones are opened by heat [<a href="#66">66</a>].  Detached
cones will open, but they rarely result in seedling establishment,
usually due to the lack of a suitable seedbed [<a href="#1">1</a>].  The exception is the
San Pedro Martir cypress, whose cones open and shed seeds in July when
they are ripe [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Seeds do not appear to have innate dormancy; they
remain viable for a number of years in unopened cones and germinate when
moistened [<a href="#64">64</a>].

Arizona cypress requires bare mineral soil for germination and seedling
establishment, which gives it a competitive advantage over the dominant
plants of adjacent communities.  The presence of a litter layer reduces
germination; 10 percent of seeds germinated on bare mineral soil, but
only 3.7 percent germinated on litter-covered substrate [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].
Seedlings are sensitive to excessive moisture [<a href="#68">68</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Arizona cypress occurs in the southwestern United States where the mean
annual precipitation is approximately 16 to 24 inches (400-600 mm).
Precipitation is bimodally distributed; relatively wet in summer and
winter, and dry in the spring and fall [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Arizona cypress grows in dry, well-drained soils on cool sites [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].
Arizona cypress is usually characterized as a moisture-demanding species
of riparian habitats [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  However, recent findings show that Arizona
cypress can occupy relatively xeric sites, including south-facing
slopes, ridge tops, and convex slopes at higher elevations (around 6,600
feet [2,000 m]).  Arizona cypress occurs in relatively pure, dense
groves of smaller trees on most canyon side slopes and is relatively
less important and represented by fewer, larger individuals in riparian
stands [<a href="#47">47</a>].  The Arizona cypress-shrub live oak association is found on
wet, north slopes and generally occurs on the upper portions of slopes,
on soils derived from slate, schist, limestone, and granite parent
materials [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Arizona cypress is generally found at elevations from 3,000 to 8,000
feet (900-2,400 m) on gravelly slopes or cuts with northern exposure
[<a href="#64">64</a>].  Cuyamaca cypress is found on dry slopes from 3,000 to 4,500 feet
(900-1,400 m) within or adjacent to chaparral [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Piute cypress
occurs at elevations between 4,000 and 6,000 feet (1,219 and 1,829 m)
and is associated with foothill woodland and chaparral communities.
Some groves of Piute cypress contain singleleaf pinyon (Pinus
monophylla) and California juniper (Juniperus californica) [<a href="#66">66</a>].  Piute
cypress occurs on a variety of soils, including red and black clays,
decomposed granite, and fractured rock.  The best growth is on red clay
with well-developed topsoil [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative seral species

The successional status of Arizona cypress is unclear.  Arizona cypress
communities are considered a topo-edaphic climax in southeastern and
central Arizona [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  However, cypress seedlings are shade
intolerant and survive best in full sunlight on bare mineral soils [<a href="#66">66</a>].
Parker [<a href="#46">46</a>] studied the age structure of a number of Arizona cypress
communities and concluded that Arizona cypress is an intolerant species
that requires disturbance to expose mineral soils for seedling
establishment.  He designated Arizona cypress a "pseudoclimax" species.
The term "pseudoclimax" indicates that stands appear to be climax but
are eventually replaced by more tolerant species.  Arizona cypress
continues to establish on disturbed sites for 50 to 100 years, thus
establishing an apparently climax population with a number of age
classes.  Recent studies, however, indicate a paucity of seedlings under
these stands, which would indicate that the stands are susceptible to
replacement by other species [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].

Alternatively, the lack of regeneration in these stands can be
interepreted as resulting from fire exclusion and the absence of
suitable sites for regeneration; Arizona cypress may therefore be
considered a fire climax.  Parker [<a href="#46">46</a>] pointed out that Arizona cypress
seedlings established on sites that had been disturbed by logging.  Moir
[<a href="#39">39</a>] reported good regeneration in Texas, where there had been fire as
recently as 1944, and he estimated that recruitment is approximately
equal to mortality in an Arizona cypress/Chisos bluegrass (Poa involuta)
habitat type and in Arizona cypress/bigtooth maple habitats as well.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Both the pistillate and staminate cones of Arizona cypress emerge in
spring [<a href="#64">64</a>].  Pollen is shed in October and November by Arizona cypress
and smooth cypress in Placerville, California (cultivated outside their
native range) [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Ovulate cones remain closed until opened by heat or
age [<a href="#68">68</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cupressus arizonica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Arizona cypress is the least fire-tolerant of all trees and shrubs in
the Arizona chaparral zone [<a href="#69">69</a>].

The serotinous cones of Arizona cypress persist on the tree for years.
When opened by the heat of a fire, the seeds fall on the exposed mineral
soil, producing thickets of seedlings [<a href="#68">68</a>].

Fire history:  Fire regimes in Arizona cypress communities vary greatly
in frequency and severity, and are difficult to determine
dendrochronologically because Arizona cypress tends to produce false
annual rings.  In Arizona chaparral habitats adjacent to Arizona cypress
stands, both wildfires and prescribed fires are frequent [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Swetnam
and others [<a href="#57">57</a>] determined that the fire history of Chirichua National
Monument for the past 300 years consisted of large surface fires that
burned most or all of Rhyolite canyon at 9- to 22-year intervals.  This
canyon consists of mixed conifer forests and oak woodlands.  Relict
conifer forests dominated by Arizona cypress occur on canyon bottoms at
low to middle elevations [<a href="#52">52</a>].  The community in Rhyolite Canyon was
comparatively isolated from fires occurring in the surrounding community
types [<a href="#43">43</a>].  In this area, the fire season occurs in late spring and
early summer, during the hot, dry weather that occurs before the summer
rains [<a href="#57">57</a>].

Marshall [<a href="#37">37</a>] noted a difference in physiognomy between the pine-oak
woodlands in Mexico, where fires are not suppressed, and those in the
United States, where fire suppression is sophisticated and efficient.
He described open woodlands with grassy understories in Mexico; in the
United States, comparable woodlands are stunted, with heavy fuel
accumulations and little grass.  Fires that do occur in these woodlands
tend to be severe and kill most of the understory and overstory plants.

A well-developed population of Arizona cypress occurs in Boot Canyon, in
the Chisos Mountains of Texas (Big Bend National Park).  The fire
history here was also difficult to determine.  Moir [<a href="#39">39</a>] estimated that
there had been at least 10 fires between 1770 and 1940, at intervals
from 9 to 60 or more years. He suspected that he had substantially
underestimated the number of fires, and that many of the fires were
low-intensity surface fires that left no scar records.

Vogl and others [<a href="#66">66</a>] stated that Piute cypress communities occurring
within pinyon-juniper woodlands are probably burned less frequently than
cypress groves within chaparral.  The southern California varieties of
cypress occur in areas that have more frequent fires and have more
prolonged summer drought [<a href="#65">65</a>].  Such frequent fires as occur in
chaparral could destroy cypress groves completely by eliminating young
trees before they reached cone-producing age.  In this area, the
majority of cypress fires occur in the fall [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Strong winds and low
humidities commonly accompany or follow these fires [<a href="#26">26</a>].  This ensures
maximum cone opening; ejection of seeds from the suspended, opened
cones; and widespread dispersal [<a href="#65">65</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cupressus arizonica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Low-intensity surface fires are lethal to Arizona cypress with stem
diameters less than 4 inches (10 cm) [<a href="#47">47</a>].  Larger trees are also not
very resistant to fire.  Cuyamaca cypress has thin exfoliating bark
which offers little fire protection [<a href="#66">66</a>].

A simulated exposure of cones to canopy fire conditions reduced
germination success but did not kill all seeds.  Cones open as the resin
melts and boils.  Rapid charring of the thick cone scales extinguishes
the flames, leaving seeds unburned (Armstrong in [<a href="#66">66</a>]).  Surface fires
kill all seeds in cones on the forest floor [<a href="#46">46</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
Historically, fires in Arizona cypress groves were patchy, resulting in
a mosaic of different-aged stands of uniform height and density [<a href="#1">1</a>].
Patchy surface fires would probably leave some seedling and sapling
stands untouched, and thus able to survive to fire-resistent heights
[<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Vogl and others [<a href="#66">66</a>] reported the occurrence of thickets of Cuyamaca
cypress saplings that appear to have originated after a 1950 wildfire
that killed some of the larger trees in the grove.  A small grove of
Piute cypress was reduced from three trees to one by a September
wildfire.  However, 40 seedlings were produced the following year, and
the total acreage occupied by Arizona cypress was unchanged [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fire plays a necessary but delicately balanced role in cypress life
history.  Too frequent fires can destroy a grove, but elimination of
fire may lead to its extinction [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Moir [<a href="#40">40</a>] has suggested that low-intensity surface fires at up to 50- to
60-year intervals will help keep Mexican pinyon (Pinus cembroides)
thickets from developing and excluding Arizona cypress.  A fire-return
interval of more 80 years will allow fuel build-up and produce a shift
in dominance patterns from those species that are maintained by
recurrent fire.

Arizona cypress was used to sample for live fuel moisture values, and
can can be used as an indicator of fire behavior [<a href="#53">53</a>].  The moisture
content (measured as the weight of water to the total dry weight) for
Arizona cypress sampled in November ranged from 84 to 123 percent and
averaged 96 percent.  This is considered relatively dry and was the
lowest of sample species.  The author concluded that the potential for
crowning is great in Arizona cypress, especially when the dry branches
are low in the crown.  Arizona cypress does tend to have a "ladder-fuel"
branching habit, with many branches hanging low to the ground [<a href="#53">53</a>].

In the Chisos Mountains of Big Bend National Park, Texas, downed woody
fuels totalled 15.44 tons per acre (34.7 T/ha), with a litter layer
continuous enough to carry fire [<a href="#12">12</a>].
