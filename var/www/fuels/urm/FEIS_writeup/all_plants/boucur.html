Sideoats grama generally occurs in dry woods in the eastern United States and in 
dry prairies and sandhills in the western states [<a href="#73">73</a>]. 
It is a major species in grasslands of the Great Plains, including tallgrass 
prairie&nbsp;[<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#173">173</a>], mixed-grass prairie and shortgrass steppe [<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>], and in desert grasslands of the
Southwest [<a href="#221">221</a>]. Sideoats grama 
is also found in ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>) forests, eastern hardwood 
savannas [<a href="#194">194</a>],&nbsp; southwestern oak (<i>Quercus</i> 
spp.) and pinyon-juniper (<i>Pinus</i>-<i>Juniperus</i> spp.) woodlands and 
savannas [<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>], and desert and semidesert 
shrublands [<a href="#101">101</a>]. Sideoats grama is commonly associated with bluebunch wheatgrass (<i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i>), 
western wheatgrass (<i>Pascopyrum smithii</i>), little bluestem (<i>Schizachyrium 
scoparium</i>), big bluestem (<i>Andropogon gerardii</i> var. <i>gerardii</i>), 
Idaho fescue (<i>Festuca idahoensis</i>), prairie Junegrass (<i>Koeleria 
macrantha</i>), blue grama (<i>Bouteloua gracilis</i>), black greasewood (<i>Sarcobatus 
vermiculatus</i>), true mountain-mahogany (<i>Cercocarpus montanus</i>), 
southwestern oaks, Colorado pinyon pine (<i>Pinus edulis</i>), 
and several juniper species including redberry juniper (<i>Juniperus pinchotii</i>), 
eastern redcedar (<i>J. virginiana</i>), oneseed juniper (<i>J. 
monosperma</i>), Ashe juniper (<i>J. ashei</i>), alligator juniper (<i>J. 
deppeana</i>), and Utah juniper (<i>J. 
osteosperma</i>) [<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>].

Sideoats grama is a native, warm-season perennial grass that grows 3 to 39 in 
(8-100 cm) tall [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#195">195</a>]. <i>Bouteloua curtipendula</i> var. <i>
curtipendula</i> culms occur singly or in small clusters from creeping rhizomes, 
while <i>B. curtipendula </i>var. <i>caespitosa </i>culms are in large clumps 
arising from a common root crown [<a href="#42">42</a>]. Sideoats grama leaves are 0.11 to 0.15 inch (3-4 
mm) wide and flat at maturity [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>]. Inflorescences are elongate and may bear over 20 and up to 80 deciduous spikes 
[<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>], each of which bears 3 to 8 spikelets hanging to one side  [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>]. The fruit is an awnless caryopsis [<a href="#49">49</a>].<p>
Sideoats grama typically has many coarse, fibrous roots [<a href="#204">204</a>], which may grow 2 
to 4 feet (0.6-1.2 m) in length and spread laterally 1 to 1.5 feet (0.3-0.5 m) 
in the top 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm) of soil [<a href="#214">214</a>]. In a Nebraska study sideoats 
grama plants had a range of 170 to 423 roots per 
plant [<a href="#215">215</a>]. Roots of sideoats grama are well adapted to growth in dry 
conditions [<a href="#214">214</a>]. They extend rapidly into wet subsurface levels, reducing plant
dependency on more variable moisture conditions at the surface 
soil [<a href="#187">187</a>]. More information on drought resistance of sideoats grama is included 
in <a href="management_considerations.html">Management Considerations</a>.

Sideoats grama regenerates from seed, rhizomes, and 
<a href="../../../glossary.html#TILLER:">tillering</a> [<a href="#195">195</a>].

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Breeding system:</font></b> 
Sideoats grama reproduces <a href="../../../glossary.html#APOMIXIS:">apomictically</a> 
or sexually [<a href="#49">49</a>]. Apomixis occurs in the southern range of sideoats grama, most commonly within 
the range of <i>Bouteloua curtipendula</i> var. <i>caespitosa</i>. Sideoats 
grama has perfect flowers [<a href="#78">78</a>] that cross pollinate [<a href="#76">76</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Pollination:</b></font>
In plants reproducing sexually, cross pollination is effected by wind [<a href="#106">106</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Seed production:</font></b>
Sideoats grama produces a &quot;fair amount of seed of 
rather low viability&quot; [<a href="#204">204</a>] but seeds readily when adequate moisture is 
available [<a href="#214">214</a>]. There are several cultivars of sideoats 
grama (see <a href="management_considerations.html">Management Considerations</a>) with 
varying seed productivity.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed dispersal:</b></font> 
Awnless fruits suggest that sideoats grama seed is dispersed mainly by wind [<a href="#49">49</a>]. </p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed banking:</b></font> 
Little direct information is available about seed 
banking of sideoats grama, but several studies indicate that seed banking of 
sideoats grama is minor, and varies with local conditions. A study 
of seed banks in postsettlement vegetation communities in the Loess Hills of 
Iowa found sideoats grama had low seed density (&lt;25 seeds/m<sup>2</sup>) in the 
seed bank of a shrubland site dominated by shrubby roughleaf dogwood (<i>Cornus drummondii</i>) and elm (<i>Ulmus</i> spp.), but moderate 
seed density (25-100 seeds/m<sup>2</sup>) in a grassland site 
dominated by Kentucky bluegrass (<i>Poa pratensis</i>) and smooth brome (<i>Bromus 
inermis</i>) [<a href="#177">177</a>]. Seeds of sideoats grama were not encountered in the seed bank of a deciduous woodland 
site dominated by tree-size roughleaf dogwood and elm. 
Examination of Texas seed banks in plots managed with long-term (36-year) grazing Texas revealed seeds of 
sideoats grama appeared to be transient and were not stored in seed banks.
Sideoats 
grama was part of the historic vegetation: savanna dominated by 
caespitose mid-grasses including sideoats grama, Texas tussockgrass (<i>Nassella</i>
<i>leucotricha</i>), 
Texas cupgrass (<i>Eriochloa sericea</i>), and little bluestem, with associated 
short grasses including curlymesquite (<i>Hilaria belangeri)</i> and hairy 
woolygrass (<i>Erioneuron pilosum</i>), and scattered clumps or 
individuals of oak (<i>Quercus</i> spp.) and Ashe juniper 
[<a href="#107">107</a>]. Sideoats grama's cover was not 
specified, although the authors did state late-seral mid-grasses had been 
reduced by grazing. In a study testing seed viability in Kansas prairie 
communities, soil samples taken from a mid-grass community dominated by sideoats 
grama yielded only 2 sideoats grama germinants [<a href="#123">123</a>].</p>

<p>Seed dormancy can affect 
timing of germination. Germination rate of sideoats grama seed from 148 sources ranged from 18% for the 
most dormant seed to 96% for the least dormant [<a href="#125">125</a>]. Major and Wright [<a href="#125">125</a>] 
found after the postharvest period, dormancy was completely broken in sideoats 
grama seed when floral parts were removed from caryopses. Germination was highest for seed with the 
heaviest caryopses, and fewer caryopses per gram. Dormancy may be 
controlled by &quot;coumarin-like&quot; inhibitory compounds.</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Germination:</font></b> 
A number of studies have 
focused on germination requirements of sideoats grama. These studies reveal that 
germination rates of sideoats grama vary with place of seed origin, as well as 
with temperature regimes, moisture, and other conditions. Sideoats grama seed vigor is good 
compared to seeds of other warm-season grasses [<a href="#212">212</a>]. When conditions are 
favorable, germination is rapid; in 1 case sideoats grama showed 50% germination 
within 22 hours [<a href="#187">187</a>].&nbsp;Studies have 
found differing results&nbsp; for germination success rate. Halinar [<a href="#79">79</a>] reported germination 
rates of 20 to 30% and 18 to 34% in 
2 consecutive years. Other sources found 50 to 70% germination 
[<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>]. Jordan and Haferkamp [<a href="#102">102</a>] found  high sideoats grama germination success, ranking 3rd out of 19 warm-season grasses tested. Wasser 
[<a href="#212">212</a>] stated most sideoats grama seed germinates within 7 days under ideal 
field conditions. Light improves germination [<a href="#40">40</a>].&nbsp; </p> 

<p>Heat affects  rate and success of sideoats grama germination. Temperatures 
between 50 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit (10 and 30 �C) are generally best for germination [<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#180">180</a>]. Sabo 
and others [<a href="#180">180</a>] found&nbsp;a constant temperature of 73 
degrees Fahrenheit (23 �C), 
or alternating temperatures of 54 degrees Fahrenheit (12 �C) for 8 hours with 88 
degrees Fahrenheit (31 �C) for 16 hours, gave best 
germination of sideoats grama. Over 1 month, germination of seed collected in southeastern 
Montana averaged 95% for treatments of 68 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (20 to 30 �C). 
Seeds required 1 to 3 days to achieve 50% 
germination. Germination for the 
low-temperature treatment of 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 �C) was only 60%, and
seeds required 15 days to attain 50% germination [<a href="#59">59</a>].
Jordan and Haferkamp [<a href="#102">102</a>] found the minimum 
germination temperature for the 'NM-28' cultivar was 48 degrees Fahrenheit (8.9 �C).</p> 

<p>Planting depth 
also affects germination rate. Sideoats grama had the highest germination rate 
(58%) at 1-inch planting 
depth compared to 37% at 0.5 inch (12.7 mm), 
10% at 2 inches, and 0% at 3 inches (76 mm) [<a href="#28">28</a>]. Germination of sideoats grama 
is good under both dry and moist conditions [<a href="#154">154</a>]. Germination of sideoats grama 
is &quot;not greatly affected&quot; by water stress down to 1 mP [<a href="#180">180</a>]. Qi and Redmann [<a href="#167">167</a>], 
however, 
found sideoats grama had a lower tolerance to water stress than was reported in 
Sabo and others [<a href="#180">180</a>], with 1 of the lowest germination rates of the 6 grass species tested&nbsp; 
under water stress.&nbsp;</p> 

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Seedling establishment/growth:</font></b> Seedling 
vigor of sideoats grama is good to excellent [<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#212">212</a>]. In a study comparing
seedling growth, sideoats grama seedlings developed more quickly than most of the 44 
prairie forb and grass species tested [<a href="#154">154</a>]. In the&nbsp; greenhouse, tillering began 3 weeks after seeds of sideoats grama were planted, 
and continued at a rapid rate [<a href="#142">142</a>]. Nine-week-old plants produced  20 to 40 stems and rhizomes. Temperature affected 
seedling growth rate. Seedlings grew more rapidly at 80 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit (26.7 to 
29.4 �C) than at 60 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit (15.5 to 18.3 �C) 
[<a href="#176">176</a>]. Of 5 grass species tested for growth patterns, 'Coronado' sideoats grama 
showed the most rapid shoot and root growth [<a href="#47">47</a>]. </p>

<p>Sideoats grama seedlings are more  drought tolerant than many other 
warm-season grasses, although seedlings that are not well established can be 
killed by a short drought period [<a href="#65">65</a>]. Dahl and others [<a href="#44">44</a>] found sideoats grama 
was 1 of the easiest 
species to establish in wet or dry years in Texas. Root length and root:shoot 
ratio are important factors in survival rates of seedlings growing in 
water-limited areas [<a href="#187">187</a>]. In a study by Simanton and 
Jordan [<a href="#187">187</a>], sideoats grama had the highest root length, 
shoot length, and root:shoot ratio compared to other warm-season grass species. Robocker and others [<a href="#176">176</a>] 
reported sideoats grama has high root growth in relation to leaf development.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Asexual regeneration:</b></font> Sideoats grama 
reproduces asexually from rhizomes and tillers. 
Rhizomes are the main form of reproduction in <i>Bouteloua curtipendula </i>var.
<i>curtipendula</i> [<a href="#204">204</a>].&nbsp; The bunchgrass variety of sideoats grama (<i>Bouteloua 
curtipendula</i> var. <i>caespitosa</i>) reproduces asexually from tillers.
Although rhizomatous, vegetative expansion of the 'El Reno' cultivar of sideoats grama studied in Colorado was primarily from 
tillering. Rhizomes did not contribute significantly to new shoot production. 
According to&nbsp;Sims and others [<a href="#188">188</a>] the 'El Reno' cultivar produced rhizomes  mainly from reproductive 
shoots and tillers  mainly from vegetative shoots.</p>

Sideoats grama is widely distributed across the plains, prairies, and 
lower mountains of much of North America  [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>]. 
It grows on a wide variety of landforms and habitats, but is most abundant and 
important in the central and southern mixed-grass prairies [<a href="#214">214</a>].

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Elevation:</b></font> Sideoats grama occurs at a wide elevational range that varies 
with location.&nbsp; In the southwestern United States, it is found from 3,000 to 8,000 feet (914-2,440 m) 
elevation [<a href="#204">204</a>]. Ranges are similar for both varieties. <i>Bouteloua 
curtipendula</i> var. <i>curtipendula</i> occurs at elevations of from less than
328 feet (100 m) in southern Texas to over 8,200 feet (2,500 m) in the 
northwestern United States. <i>Bouteloua curtipendula</i> var. <i>caespitosa</i> occurs
from 650 to 8,200

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Climate/moisture regime:</b></font> 
Sideoats grama grows under a wide variety of 
climate conditions. A study of establishment of seeded-in grasses  in pinyon-juniper 
woodlands in Arizona and New Mexico found sideoats grama was adapted 
to warm-moist and hot-dry sites, but not cold, cool, warm-dry, or hot-moist sites [<a href="#100">100</a>].
A study of water-use 
of plains grasses suggests sideoats grama requires a fairly large supply of 
water for limited periods. Sideoats grama showed inefficient water-use relative to other plains grasses, 
especially in cold weather [<a href="#130">130</a>]. According 
to Fulbright and others [<a href="#68">68</a>], sideoats grama has a low soil moisture 
requirement, but requires at least 15 inches (380 mm) of annual precipitation. 
Story [<a href="#191">191</a>] reported good stands of sideoats grama developed in areas with 
12 to 16 inches (305-406 mm) of annual rainfall in the Southwest. In the central Great Plains, stand development of sideoats 
grama was greatest on fine-textured  upland soils with 17 to 20 inches (432-508 
mm) of annual rainfall. On Wisconsin prairie and savannas, sideoats grama occurs 
on sites characterized by cyclic mild to severe summer drought, less 
than 45 inches (1140 mm) annual snowfall, 
and a mean summer temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 �C) [<a href="#27">27</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Soils/landform:</b></font>
Sideoats grama is adapted to a broad spectrum of 
soils, from sands to clays [<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#212">212</a>]. It is 
least adapted to loose sand and dense clay, and has best stand development on 
medium to fine-textured soils [<a href="#212">212</a>]. Sideoats grama grows on shallow to deep 
soils. It does not grow well on wet soils, although it is moderately tolerant 
of spring flooding [<a href="#185">185</a>]. In the Intermountain 
West, sideoats grama grows well on sandy loam to clay loam [<a href="#50">50</a>]. In North Dakota it 
is found on shallow 
soils with textures ranging from loamy sands through loams and silt loams to silty clay loams 
[<a href="#223">223</a>]. Sideoats grama is an important component of grasslands on clay 
soils in the northern Great Plains [<a href="#70">70</a>] and on loess soils in the 
central Great Plains [<a href="#203">203</a>]. In Kansas shortgrass prairie 
sideoats grama grows on fine-textured, silty clay loams, especially in 
areas with deep soils [<a href="#3">3</a>]. Bush and Van Auken [<a href="#34">34</a>] reported sideoats grama aboveground, belowground, 
and total dry mass increased with 
increasing soil depth of&nbsp; up to 71 inches (180 cm).</p>

<p>Sideoats grama has weak to moderate tolerance to saline soils [<a href="#212">212</a>] but does well on calcareous 
or alkaline soils [<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#138">138</a>]. It often occurs on shallow limestone 
or dolomite soils [<a href="#140">140</a>] and on soils high in available 
nitrate. Sideoats grama is associated with moderate 
levels of soil water stress relative to other grama species [<a href="#153">153</a>]. In mixed-grass prairie of northern 
Wyoming and southern Montana, it 
occurs on shallow soils with low water-holding capacity and high infiltration 
rate, and does well with relatively high growing season precipitation and no 
available groundwater [<a href="#109">109</a>].</p>

<p>Studies in Texas provide information about the soil requirements of the 
different varieties of sideoats grama. <i>Bouteloua curtipendula</i> var. <i>curtipendula</i> grows 
mostly on loose, limey soils and on relatively good soils in less disturbed 
areas&nbsp;including native Texas prairies [<a href="#49">49</a>], while <i>B.</i> <i>curtipendula</i> var. <i>
caespitosa</i> has higher cover on soils with higher clay content, pH, and 
organic matter [<a href="#48">48</a>]. However, according to Gould [<a href="#77">77</a>], <i>Bouteloua curtipendula
</i>var. <i>curtipendula</i> grows best on loamy, well-drained soils, while <i>B. curtipendula</i> var. <i>caespitosa</i> 
is usually found on loose, sandy or rocky, well-drained limey soils. </p>

<p>Sideoats grama is well-adapted to steep, rocky slopes [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>,<a href="#204">204</a>]. In Illinois sideoats grama 
is found in coarse soil on limestone outcrops [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#192">192</a>]. It occurs on shale barrens 
in West Virginia [<a href="#192">192</a>]. Sideoats grama is  common in 
washes and on low benches [<a href="#20">20</a>]. In the Southwest it grows on south- to west-facing  slopes, dry hills, and mesas [<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#196">196</a>].</p>


<span class="subframeName">

Sideoats grama occurs in all stages of succession. It is moderately shade tolerant [<a href="#185">185</a>],  growing 
in partial shade to full sun [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#135">135</a>,<a href="#182">182</a>,<a href="#212">212</a>]. In ponderosa pine woodlands of 
northwestern Nebraska, the importance of sideoats grama relative to other grass 
species increases with increasing canopy cover, indicating that sideoats grama is relatively shade tolerant [<a href="#201">201</a>]. Bolander [<a href="#24">24</a>] found sideoats grama 
in Arizona chaparral was moderately dense where the canopy was open and grazing
was not been 
heavy.&nbsp;<p>Sideoats grama can be a primary or secondary colonizer on burned areas. Seeds
are carried into burned sites by wind or produced by plants surviving fire [<a href="#88">88</a>].  Sideoats grama occurs in 
early seral postfire communities [<a href="#162">162</a>] and increases on disturbed sites through 
asexual regeneration or self-seeding [<a href="#210">210</a>,<a href="#213">213</a>].  Sideoats grama seeds more successfully on burned than unburned 
sites [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>], indicating it colonizes after disturbance by 
fire. It may increase in cover immediately following fire [<a href="#133">133</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>], indicating it can 
also spread by tillering or rhizome expansion. Leopold [<a href="#122">122</a>] described sideoats 
grama communities maintained by frequent fires in areas relatively undisturbed 
by grazing.

<p>Sideoats grama is a climax indicator in arid grasslands throughout the 
Southwest [<a href="#162">162</a>], and is a dominant or codominant species in late-seral 
vegetation across much of the Great Plains [<a href="#78">78</a>]. Dodd and Holtz [<a href="#52">52</a>] list 
sideoats grama as a dominant component in late-seral grassland vegetation on a 
loam range site in southern Texas. </p>



<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT">
SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Sideoats grama starts growth in mid-spring, and generally flowers between July 
and September [<a href="#212">212</a>]. In native tallgrass prairie in central Oklahoma, anthesis occurs from July to September, 
seedlings sprout in November and 
December and in March and April, and seed formation and dissemination occur 
from July through November [<a href="#2">2</a>]. 
The growing period for sideoats grama in the southern Great Plains is April 
through October [<a href="#181">181</a>]. In Wisconsin,  root crown growth occurred from early 
April through mid-July, then again from early to mid-August. Production of secondary and 
tertiary shoots occurred from mid-March through late October, and anthesis occurred 
from mid-July to mid-August [<a href="#146">146</a>]. 
Production of shoots slowed during flower production but did not cease at any 
time during the growing season. In general, sideoats grama flowers from April to 
October [<a href="#104">104</a>]. Flowering dates for sideoats grama vary with location, and are summarized in the following table:<br><br>

Phenology differs due to variety and place of origin. Olson [<a href="#159">159</a>] 
planted 4 cultivars of sideoats grama, and cultivars of other 
warm-season grasses, in a common garden in Minnesota to study phenology of 
grasses collected from locations throughout the Great Plains. Sideoats grams cultivars from North Dakota ('Kildeer') 
and South Dakota ('Pierre') reached anthesis 21 to 28 days earlier than cultivars from Kansas ('Butte' and 'Trailway'). In clones grown from locations throughout the Great Plains, 
flowering began earliest in plants from northern and western sites, and occurred 
progressively later in plants originating in more southward and eastward sites 
[<a href="#132">132</a>]. Flowering for northern clones was in late June, with the 
earliest flowering in clones from northeastern Montana. A study by Olmsted [<a href="#158">158</a>] 
also provides insight on the phenological variability of sideoats 
grama from different locations. Olmsted tested the photoperiodic response of sideoats
grama from Texas, Oklahoma, and North 
Dakota. He found the Texas strain grew and flowered vigorously in natural or 
simulated 13-hour daylight. The Oklahoma strain flowered equally well and 
rapidly with 13 to 14 hours of daylight, and the North Dakota strain grew and flowered 
vigorously in 14- and 15-hour photoperiods. The photoperiodic responses of the 
strains corresponded to flowering earlier in the year and during longer days for 
more northern species, which may have been an adaptation in response to 
northward expansion of sideoats grama in the past.

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font>
Sideoats grama establishes after fire through seed and/or lateral spread by rhizomes and 
tillers. Recovery often takes 2 to 3 years [<a href="#226">226</a>,<a href="#227">227</a>] and varies with site conditions, 
burning frequency, and plant growth form (see <a href="fire_effects.html">Fire Effects</a>). 
Sideoats grama fruits lack an awn; therefore, initial seed dispersal onto burned 
sites is effected primarily by wind. Postfire seed production may increase after burning. In Wisconsin, flowering of 
sideoats grama increased after spring burns [<a href="#88">88</a>] (see <a href="fire_effects.html">Fire Effects</a>). 
However, another Wisconsin study found no increase in flowering of sideoats 
grama after an April wildfire [<a href="#51">51</a>] .

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font> 
Grassland and shrubland ecosystems where sideoats grama is important 
historically experienced frequent, stand-replacement fire. Fire regimes are highly variable across sideoats grama's wide 
distributional range, however. In plains grassland communities 
where sideoats grama is important, historic fire return intervals ranged from 
less than 10 years up to 35 years. Return fire intervals for desert grassland communities 
with sideoats grama 
ranged from 1 to 100 years, and some shrub-dominated communities with sideoats 
grama had historic fire return intervals of 100+ years [<a href="#162">162</a>].  Fire regimes for plant communities and ecosystems in which sideoats grama occurs 
are summarized in the table below. For further information regarding fire regimes 
and fire ecology of communities where sideoats grama is found, refer to the

Fire generally top-kills sideoats grama [<a href="#226">226</a>]. Further information concerning 
the immediate effects of fire on sideoats grama is sparse.


<br><br>

<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT">

<br />

The immediate effect of fire on sideoats grama varies seasonally with 
differences in air temperature and plant desiccation. A study in Arizona indicated that 
lethal temperatures at culm bases of sensitive 
perennial grasses such as sideoats grama closely approximate existing air 
temperatures at or near ground level during  hot dry months of summer. 
During cooler, moister periods, when plant material is less desiccated, lethal temperatures 
at culm bases are much higher. Over the 2-year study, the lethal temperatures for sideoats grama ranged 
from 138 to 154 degrees Fahrenheit (58.8-73.7 �C) [<a href="#98">98</a>].


<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE">
PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Sideoats grama recovers from burning by tillering and/or rhizomatous spread (in <i>Bouteloua curtipendula </i>var.
<i>curtipendula</i>), and by establishing from seed [<a href="#195">195</a>]. Awnless seeds may be carried by wind 
[<a href="#218">218</a>] into burned areas for natural reestablishment, and the nutrient-rich 
postfire environment may encourage mass flowering in postfire year 2 or 3 [<a href="#88">88</a>].

<p>The response of sideoats grama to fire varies with growth form, fire 
frequency and severity, season of burn, climatic conditions, and composition of 
associated plant community. Fire<i> </i>generally favors<i> </i>the bunchgrass 
variety, <i>Bouteloua curtipendula </i>var. <i>
caespitosa</i>. The rhizomatous variety of sideoats grama (<i>Bouteloua curtipendula</i> var. <i>curtipendula</i>) 
generally decreases after fire, particularly in dry years. It may require 3 or more years for full 
recovery [<a href="#227">227</a>].&nbsp; In wet years the rhizomatous variety 
tolerates fire &quot;reasonably well&quot; [<a href="#226">226</a>]. Several studies have documented the response of sideoats grama to 
fire. Results vary by study and are summarized below. </p>

<p>Sideoats grama appears to respond most favorably to fire at approximate 5-year intervals. In southeastern Arizona, Robinett and Barker [<a href="#174">174</a>] studied the response of 
several grass species in areas subjected to different fire frequencies during the hot season (May through July). 
Species composition on plots subjected to 1 fire, 2 or 3 
fires, or 5 or 6 fires over 15 years was compared on sites with different soil 
textures and other site characteristics. On the Loamy Hills and Granitic Hills 
sites, sideoats grama had  greatest percent 
cover relative to other species on plots that were burned 3 times over the 
15-year period, compared to sites burned only once or those burned 5 or 6 times 
during that time. On the Sandy Loam 
Upland site, frequency of sideoats grama was approximately 40% on the 1-burn 
site and declined to less than 5% on  sites subjected to 3 or 5 burns 
in the 15-year period. Decadence of sideoats grama was observed on 
sites burned only once. A similar trend in response 
of sideoats grama to different fire frequencies was reported  by Collins and others [<a href="#38">38</a>] 
on the Konza Prairie in northeastern Kansas. Average cover 
of sideoats grama was highest (4.9%) in plots burned every 4 years, compared 
to 3.1% on plots burned annually and 1.6% on  unburned ploys. However, sample 
sizes were small (n = 2 or n = 3) and significance of differences in cover of sideoats grama was not reported. 
Becker [<a href="#13">13</a>] found sideoats grama increased over 5 years on plots 
burned annually at low to moderate severity on a blue grama-little bluestem prairie  in southwestern 
Minnesota.</p>

<p>Several studies indicate that site characteristics  influence the response of sideoats grama to 
fire. In the Molino Basin of southern Arizona, Caprio [<a href="#35">35</a>] compared 
vegetation on unburned sites with sites burned in June 1983. He found 
 cover of sideoats grama increased following burning on south and east 
slopes, but declined on the north slope. Fire severity was not 
specified. Pemble and others [<a href="#163">163</a>] reported flowering of sideoats grama was stimulated by fire on a dry, 
hilly, undisturbed prairie site, inhibited on a mesic, level, undisturbed site, 
and showed no significant increase or decrease (p &gt; 0.05) on a mesic, gently sloping to level&nbsp; site. 
Litter was almost completely consumed on dry hilly site, but 
considerable litter remained in depressions on the wetter sites. Fire severity was not specified. 
In 1937, Leopold [<a href="#122">122</a>] compared vegetation of Mexico and the United 
States. He concluded that the Sierra Madre of Chihuahua, Mexico, 
supported comparatively lush stands of sideoats grama because of frequent fires and light grazing. 
Across the border, fire suppression and 
overgrazing had already reduced  sideoats grama cover in  the 
United States by that time.</p>

<p>Fire response of sideoats grama is partially dependent on the response of 
competing species. Cover of sideoats grama decreased after burning treatments on a 
big bluestem-porcupine grass (<i>Hesperostipa spartea</i>) tallgrass prairie in Iowa. 
 
The site had been mowed prior to the 
experiment, allowing sideoats grama to maintain an artificially high cover. 
After burning 
without follow-up mowing, the tall grasses provided more competition. In 
contrast, sideoats grama increased or remained essentially the same on a loess 
hills prairie site [<a href="#25">25</a>]. On a tallgrass 
prairie site in Kansas, stem density of sideoats grama was reduced after 3 years 
without burning on both deep- shallow-soil plots [<a href="#53">53</a>].</p>

<p>Burning prior to seeding can help establishment of sideoats grama. When used for revegetating 
stands dominated by exotic Lehmann lovegrass (<i>Eragrostis lehmanniana</i>), 
sideoats grama had higher seedling density after seeding on a burned plot than 
on plots sprayed with herbicide prior to seeding, although the difference among 
plots was only significant (p&lt;0.05) for the late-season (August) planting in 
1 year [<a href="#18">18</a>]. Reseeding of prescribed burned areas resulted in &quot;especially good 
establishment&quot; of sideoats grama in Great Basin shrubsteppe area of 
northwestern Arizona [<a href="#19">19</a>].  </p>

<p>Several studies, most from the southwestern United States, have found 
a short-term decrease in sideoats grama after burning. Cover of sideoats grama &quot;decreased dramatically&quot; 
after a wildfire in a desert 
mountain scrub community in Texas, determined by comparing vegetation on burned 
and unburned plots at postfire year 2 [<a href="#33">33</a>]. Frequency of sideoats grama was less on 3-year-old burns 
than on unburned sites in the Guadalupe Mountains of New Mexico. Fire severity was not 
specified, but fuels were estimated at <u>&lt;</u> 0.5
ton/acre for litter and cured grasses and 7 tons/acre for living
vegetation [<a href="#1">1</a>].&nbsp; On Arizona range sites sideoats grama often declines in the season or year 
immediately following burning, but recovers in subsequent years [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#219">219</a>]. </p>

<p>In some cases burning may have little or no 
effect on sideoats grama. In a study in Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota, 
Bock and Bock [<a href="#22">22</a>] measured plant height of several graminoid species before and after burning with 
&quot;relatively cool&quot; surface fires. 
Height of sideoats grama did not differ significantly (p &lt; 0.05) in any year between 
burned  and unburned control plots. Sideoats grama showed no difference in flowering 
response between burned and unburned stands in Wisconsin [<a href="#51">51</a>]. Fire severity 
was not specified, but the  2.3-inch (5.8-cm) mulch layer was completely removed by the 
fire.</p>

<p>Fire can increase nutritional value of sideoats grama. Iron, phosphorus, 
and zinc concentration in sideoats grama increased with 
increasing fire frequency, although trends in nutrient increase were not all 
statistically analyzed. The effects of fire frequency on nutrient 
concentrations in sideoats grama are summarized in the table below [<a href="#157">157</a>]:</p>

<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE">
DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Site grazing and fire history is likely to affect the response of grasses 
to fire. In an unfinished manuscript, Hulbert (as presented in Gibson [<a href="#72">72</a>]) 
specified  6 to 10 years of mowing and burning treatments are not sufficient 
to remove all effects of prior burning and grazing, which may influence fire 
behavior and effects on sideoats grama.</p>

<p>The response of sideoats grama to fire varies with time of burning. Several 
studies report favorable response of sideoats grama to spring burning. Sideoats grama increased under 
annual early spring burning of grassland pasture [<a href="#6">6</a>]. In Kansas bluestem prairie, Aldous
[<a href="#4">4</a>] studied response to several annual burning treatments  conducted after rains, when 
wet ground  protected the root crowns of  dominant grasses.
The number of sideoats grama plants doubled in 6 years under early spring
burning; increased under mid-spring burning; increased by more than a 3rd of
the original number of plants in the late spring-burned plot; but showed little
change on the fall-burned  and unburned plots [<a href="#4">4</a>]. In Wisconsin late-spring fire enhanced flowering of sideoats 
grama more than did an early spring fire, and resulted in a&nbsp; greater 
postfire increase in flowering on 
the  mesic site compared to the drier site. In the first 2 years of the 
study, sideoats grama averaged a 250% increase in flowering after early spring burning&nbsp;and 600% 
after late spring burning on dry-mesic plots. Increases in flowering on the dry 
site were 60% and 150% for early and late spring burns, respectively [<a href="#88">88</a>]. McMurphy [<a href="#133">133</a>] compared percent basal cover 
 
of sideoats grama on plots burned annually in March with those 
burned in April or May, and with unburned plots, over  12 years. On 
the &quot;ordinary upland&quot; site with medium- or loam-textured soil, the unburned pasture consistently had a lower 
percent of sideoats grama than the burned plots, although the differences were only significant 
(p&lt;0.05) between unburned and early&nbsp;(March) burn sites, and not significant in all 
years. There was no apparent trend between burned and unburned plots on the 
limestone breaks site. On the claypan site, late spring (May) burned and early 
(March) burned pastures supported significantly more (p&lt;0.05) sideoats grama than the mid-spring 
(April) and unburned plots. In contrast, Henderson [<a href="#87">87</a>] compared an unburned plot with 
3 plots with 3 different fire treatments (late fall, early spring, and late spring burn), 
and found no significant difference in frequency of occurrence of sideoats grama 
among plots. The author specifies that due to the abundance of sideoats grama, 
only dramatic declines would have been detected by the frequency of occurrence 
data. </p>

<p>Sideoats grama increased following early spring burns in eastern Kansas [<a href="#189">189</a>] 
and in southern Nebraska. The table below compares the herbage yield of sideoats 
grama harvested in June and September from burned and mowed plots [<a href="#198">198</a>]:</p>

Spring burning appears to be most beneficial to sideoats grama [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>]. Site 
characteristics should be  part of a fire management plan for sideoats 
grama. Fire is more beneficial in relatively humid, more productive grasslands 
than in drier, less productive sites, partially because litter buildup in 
more productive communities can reduce sideoats grama productivity, while litter improves 
moisture-holding capacity of soil in drier sites [<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>]. Studies indicate that sideoats grama 
generally increases after fire on relatively mesic prairie sites [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>,<a href="#198">198</a>,<a href="#227">227</a>] but 
 
shows a short-term decrease following fire on more arid grasslands of 
the Southwest [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#219">219</a>]. Burning every 4 to 5 years appears to benefit 
sideoats grama more than more frequent burning [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#174">174</a>].

Sideoats grama is highly productive, providing valuable forage for all classes of 
livestock and wildlife [<a href="#86">86</a>]. It is good winter and
summer forage [<a href="#205">205</a>]. In some areas sideoats grama is an important 
summer food when cool-season grasses are dormant [<a href="#221">221</a>]. In Arizona it maintains 
relatively high forage value throughout the year. It 
provides forage earlier in the spring than the other gramas, remains green later 
in the fall, and cures well [<a href="#96">96</a>].

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Palatability/nutritional value:</b></font>
Sideoats grama is highly palatable and nutritious, and is readily eaten 
by all classes of livestock [<a href="#186">186</a>]. Leaves are more palatable than stems and 
are generally
consumed 1st [<a href="#205">205</a>]. Sideoats grama is highly palatable to livestock during late spring and summer, 
and provides fair forage value when mature [<a href="#213">213</a>]. It is 
highly palatable while green and is consumed
throughout the growing season, including early spring (if spring rains occur) [<a href="#205">205</a>]. 
In Nebraska it is grazed mostly in late summer and fall, and remains moderately 
palatable into winter [<a href="#194">194</a>].</p>

<p>Studies report varying results for the nutritional value of sideoats grama. 
Sideoats grama has fair energy value and fair protein value but  poor food 
value for mule deer, white-tailed deer, and pronghorn in North Dakota [<a href="#50">50</a>]. It 
is  moderately valuable winter forage in the southern Great Plains, but nutrient 
value is too low to be one of the outstanding warm-season forage grasses in the region [<a href="#182">182</a>]. Newell and Moline 
[<a href="#153">153</a>] reported sideoats grama provided high-quality  forage 
from May through October, as indicated by crude protein content. However, 
according to a study in Texas, protein content was ranked &quot;good&quot; in samples 
taken in the early 
growth stage and &quot;deficient&quot; for mature growth.&nbsp;Protein was considered 
deficient in 60% of sideoats grama samples. Sideoats grama was &quot;deficient&quot; and 
&quot;very deficient&quot; for phosphoric acid in the young and mature growth stages, 
respectively [<a href="#66">66</a>].&nbsp; In samples from Arizona, crude protein content of 
sideoats grama varied seasonally from 2.66% to 6.23%, with the highest levels in 
May to June [<a href="#185">185</a>]. Crude protein content was also highest in May and June in 
both standing biomass and 30-day-old regrowth for 'El&nbsp; Reno' sideoats grama 
from 3 sites in Texas. Crude protein content values for sideoats grama ranged from 1.9% 
to 13.2%, and varied among sites and seasons. In-vitro digestible organic matter 
was also generally highest in May and June at all 3 sites [<a href="#127">127</a>]. Protein content 
of dormant sideoats grama from an arid New Mexico range  was 3.7%. 
Sideoats grama was  low in many other nutrients compared to other species 
[<a href="#148">148</a>]. The table below summarizes nutritional content of sideoats grama forage, 
expressed as percentage of dry matter [<a href="#146">146</a>]:</p>

<p>On plots treated with annual spring burning and application of 2.2 kg/ha 
tebuthiuron, crude protein content and percent digestibility of sideoats grama 
increased from the 1st year of treatment to the 2nd year. Pretreatment data were limited, but showed lower nutritional value of 
grasses prior to treatment. For both years of treatment, crude protein and 
percent digestibility of sideoats grama were highest in May and declined steadily throughout the 
sampling season, to mid-September [<a href="#23">23</a>].</p>

<p>Sideoats grama is sometimes used for hay in southwestern and prairie states 
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#193">193</a>,<a href="#201">201</a>,<a href="#225">225</a>]. According to Williams [<a href="#225">225</a>], livestock eat the  coarse leaves more readily dry 
than when leaves are fresh.</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Cover value:</font></b> 
Sideoats grama provides excellent nesting cover for a variety of 
songbirds and is readily used by a variety of small mammals [<a href="#157">157</a>]. Sideoats grama is sometimes seeded for game bird 
habitat improvement, and is  recommended in grass mixes to provide cover for nesting 
lesser prairie-chickens [<a href="#150">150</a>,<a href="#184">184</a>]. Sideoats grama provides 
good cover for quail species [<a href="#184">184</a>] and is sometimes planted for scaled quail habitat improvement [<a href="#31">31</a>]. 
It is listed as a component of prime sharp-tailed grouse habitat [<a href="#150">150</a>]. Sideoats 
grama  provides good habitat for black-tailed jackrabbit 
and eastern cottontail on Kansas prairies [<a href="#29">29</a>]. It is a component of open grasslands preferred by mountain 
sheep [<a href="#60">60</a>]. In Arizona, areas used by mountain sheep had a 
significantly greater (p &lt; 0.05) cover of sideoats grama, and a greater proportion of grass 
cover overall, than areas  mountain sheep did not use.</p>

<br />Sideoats grama establishes quickly and provides good erosion control 
[<a href="#186">186</a>]. It is commonly seeded on southern plains ranges to reduce wind erosion, 
reduce soil temperatures and evaporation, and help control weeds 
[<a href="#45">45</a>]. Sideoats grama is very drought resistant [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>,<a href="#214">214</a>],. Density and 
vigor of sideoats grama stands may decrease during drought [<a href="#194">194</a>]; however, stand density 
may increase, and sideoats grama expand by self-seeding, after drought [<a href="#153">153</a>]. 
Sideoats grama can increase rapidly on prairie damaged by extreme drought or overgrazing [<a href="#214">214</a>]. <p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed weight 
and seeding rate:</b></font> Seed weight for sideoats grama is 
170,000 seeds/lb [<a href="#169">169</a>] to 191,000 seeds/lb [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#192">192</a>]. Range of pure live seed (PLS) per pound of bulk seed was 
reported as 42,020 to 64,940 PLS/lb bulk [<a href="#79">79</a>]. Recommended seeding rate is 3 to 6 lbs PLS/ac 
(<span style="background-color: #FFFFFF">3.3 to 6.7&nbsp; kg/ha</span>). 
Seeding dates vary from April 1 to May 15 in the northern and central Great 
Plains, January to April in the southern Great Plains and June 15 to July 15 for 
Trans-Pecos Texas and the Southwest [<a href="#192">192</a>].

<p>Sideoats grama is often included in native seed mixes for prairie reclamation 
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>] and is widely used for reseeding 
ranges [<a href="#194">194</a>]. Stubbendieck and others [<a href="#194">194</a>] recommend sideoats grama as a 
component of native grass mixes in silty, clayey, and sandy sites throughout 
Nebraska. Sideoats grama is used for revegetating coal surface-mined lands in the eastern 
United States 
[<a href="#210">210</a>],  Iowa [<a href="#55">55</a>],  eastern Montana [<a href="#62">62</a>], and  other areas.&nbsp; It 
has been seeded successfully on iron ore for mine reclamation in Wisconsin [<a href="#83">83</a>].&nbsp; 
</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Cultivars:</font> </b>Sideoats grama is commercially available [<a href="#169">169</a>]. Several improved cultivars of sideoats 
grama have been developed including 'Vaughn' and 'Niner,'  originating from western 
areas of the Southwest [<a href="#86">86</a>], 'Trailway'&nbsp; from Nebraska, 'Pierre'&nbsp; from 
South Dakota,&nbsp;'Kildeer' from North Dakota, 'Premier' and 'Haskell' from 
Texas, as well as 'EL Reno,' 'Butte,' and 'Native' [<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#156">156</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>]. Production and 
timing of maturity of the individual cultivars vary by planting 
site [<a href="#97">97</a>]. Improved cultivars are often used for reclamation. Of several cultivars 
evaluated at a mine site in the Southwest, 'Vaughn' ranked best for both stand 
density and vigor in all 3 study years, followed by 'NM-28' and 'El Reno' 
[<a href="#156">156</a>].</p>

<b>Herbicides and fertilizer treatments:</b></font>
Reaction of sideoats grama to 
herbicide treatments varies with the herbicide and stage of phenological development. Sideoats grama had good to 
excellent tolerance to imazethapyr 
applied either pre- or postemergence [<a href="#14">14</a>]. Application of 2,4-D favored establishment of sideoats grama 
on an upland site seeded with native grasses and treated with 2,4-D, atrazine, and mowing 
[<a href="#26">26</a>]. In a study of the effects of clopyralid, picloram, 
triclopyr, and 2,4,5-T, development of sideoats grama seedlings was reduced as 
rate of herbicide application increased [<a href="#95">95</a>]. Clopyralid had minimal effect at 
application rates of 0.98 lb/ac (1.1kg/ha) and less, but the other 3 herbicides caused 
more damage as application rate increased. Triclopyr and 2,4,5-T 
had detrimental effects at 0.98 lb/ac (1.1kg/ha) or higher, and picloram caused increasingly 
negative effects on growth at 1.96 lb/ac (2.2 kg/ha) and higher.  </p>

<p>Application of fertilizer 
may increase sideoats grama production. Application of nitrogen and nitrogen+phosphorus fertilizer increased 
herbage production of sideoats grama 
relative to the control on 3 different soil types in which laboratory 
specimens were grown [<a href="#99">99</a>]. On a loamy upland site in south-central New Mexico, cover of sideoats grama increased over 
4 years with annual June application of nitrogen [<a href="#57">57</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Competition:</b></font>
Light competition from trees may have detrimental effects on 
sideoats grama stands. Sideoats grama increased after cabling of Colorado pinyon-oneseed 
juniper woodland in south-central New Mexico [<a href="#183">183</a>]. After trees, shrubs, and forbs in another pinyon-juniper 
woodland were killed, herbage production for sideoats grama increased from 5 kg/ha 1 year after 
treatment to  155 kg/ha 3 years after treatment [<a href="#36">36</a>]. In  eastern Nebraska native 
little bluestem prairie, cover 
of sideoats grama was lowest in shaded 
plots under eastern redcedar, compared to plots 
in open sites and at the edge of tree crowns [<a href="#71">71</a>]. In contrast, McPherson and 
Wright [<a href="#136">136</a>] found cover of sideoats grama increased 
with increased canopy cover of redberry juniper on 
both ungrazed and formerly grazed sites, even though overall grass production 
decreased with greater canopy cover. In another study sideoats grama increased on plots where redberry 
juniper was controlled with picloram [<a href="#176">176</a>].  </p>

<p>Sideoats grama can reduce the success of other species. Sideoats grama in dense stands may reduce  
honey mesquite (<i>Prosopis glandulosa</i>)&nbsp;seedling 
establishment [<a href="#34">34</a>]. Sideoats grama reduced dry mass of honey mesquite 
when the 2 species were planted at the same time or when sideoats grama was already 
established. Similarly, sideoats grama caused a decrease in the dry weight of 
smooth hawthorn (<i>Crataegus 
laevigata</i>) and sweet acacia (<i>Acacia smallii</i>) when  planted with 
those species [<a href="#209">209</a>].</p>

<p>Extracts from Utah juniper foliage and litter suppress growth of sideoats grama seedlings [<a href="#100">100</a>]. 
In grasslands, sideoats grama may be reduced by competition from taller prairie grasses more 
adapted to mesic sites, declining in cover or disappearing from mesic 
sites within a few years [<a href="#46">46</a>]. Sideoats grama may have lower yield where planted with 
tallgrass species, as taller grasses can outcompete sideoats grama [<a href="#130">130</a>].</p>

Sideoats grama is often considered an 
increaser under grazing [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>]; however, sideoats 
grama often decreases under grazing on  arid western ranges [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>]. Tomanek and Albertson [<a href="#203">203</a>] 
report sideoats grama both 
decreased and increased under grazing, depending on site characteristics and 
grazing pressure. Sideoats grama often increases under grazing in tallgrass 
prairies [<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>]. When growing in association with little bluestem and blue 
grama, sideoats grama often increases with 
heavy grazing pressure but may be replaced 
by blue grama or forbs [<a href="#102">102</a>]. In Nebraska sideoats 
grama increases under heavy grazing on favorable, wetter sites, but 
does not do well under prolonged heavy grazing [<a href="#194">194</a>]. Sideoats grama may increase under grazing due to 
reduced competition by other 
grasses. Percent species composition of sideoats grama declined from 11.54% to 1.12% 
after 17 years of protection from grazing on a mixed-grass prairie  in Nebraska 
[<a href="#145">145</a>]. On native prairie site in Kansas, a decrease in competition due to 
drought caused an increase in relative cover and 
seed production of sideoats grama until other grasses recovered [<a href="#41">41</a>]. Sideoats 
grama is most abundant on 
steep slopes not easily accessible to cattle, and is increasing on some western 
ranges protected from grazing [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]. Bolander [<a href="#24">24</a>] states sideoats grama 
is common in areas of Arizona chaparral that have not been overgrazed, but is 
replaced by other grasses in heavily grazed areas. Similarly, cover of sideoats grama in semiarid grasslands 
of the Edwards Plateau in Texas has been 
reduced by prolonged overgrazing [<a href="#109">109</a>].</p>

<p>Fire affects the response of sideoats grama to grazing. Sideoats grama increased in early spring-burned pastures 
where fire essentially eliminated Kentucky bluegrass (<i>Poa pratensis</i>), increasing grazing 
pressure on sideoats grama [<a href="#162">162</a>]. Sideoats grama increased in cover and frequency in response to 
bison grazing at stocking rates of 9 ha/<a href="../../../glossary.html#ANIMAL UNIT:">AU</a> 
to 5 ha/AU [<a href="#85">85</a>]; the difference between grazed and ungrazed plots was significant (p &lt; 0.1) on 
tallgrass prairie sites burned every 4 years but was not significant on plots 
burned annually. On season-long grazed sites, moderately stocked (3.3 ac/head) 
with cattle, sideoats grama represented a greater proportion of vegetation composition on 
spring-burned plots than on unburned plots monitored  from 
1950 to 1967 [<a href="#119">119</a>]. Sideoats grama significantly (p&lt; 0.05) increased in percent 
species composition 4 years after fire on sites under season-long 
continuous grazing and fertilized with 80 lb/ac (90 kg/ha) nitrogen, but decreased 
(though change not significant at p = 0.05) on unburned, grazed plots fertilized at 80 lb/ac nitrogen [<a href="#119">119</a>]. For more information about the response of sideoats grama to 
fire, see <a href="fire_effects.html">Fire Effects</a>.</p>

Several studies have investigated the effects of grazing and mowing on 
sideoats grama [<a href="#161">161</a>,<a href="#171">171</a>,<a href="#208">208</a>]. Clipping reduces aboveground and belowground dry 
mass [<a href="#208">208</a>], and can increase stands of sideoats grama if clipped herbage is 
removed from the ground [<a href="#161">161</a>]. Clipping  sideoats grama at a high 
frequency and a high intensity (to 3 inches (8 cm) every 3 weeks) severely reduced 
plant vigor compared to lighter, less frequent clipping (to 6 inches (15 cm) every 6 
weeks) [<a href="#171">171</a>]. Reardon and others [<a href="#171">171</a>] caution against using clipping 
as a direct surrogate for studying grazing response, reporting that regrowth 
of sideoats grama was greater after grazing by domestic sheep, goats , or cattle than clipping to the 
same height as grazed plants.
