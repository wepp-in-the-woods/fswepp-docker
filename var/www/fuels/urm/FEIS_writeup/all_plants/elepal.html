<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Eleocharis palustris
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Common spikerush is widely distributed across North America, from
Saskatchewan west to British Columbia, north into Alaska, Yukon
Territory, the Northwest Territories, south into parts of the Pacific
Northwest States to southern California, east across the Great Plains
into the southeastern states, and as far north as Minnesota and Illinois
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Common spikerush's distribution in the East is not
well known because of difficulties in distinguishing it from E. smallii
(Britt.) [<a href="#29">29</a>].  It is native in Hawaii [<a href="#39">39</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Eleocharis palustris
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Common spikerush is a native, perennial, rhizomatous graminoid.  It
grows 0.66 to 4 feet (0.2-1.2 m) high with spikelets 2.45 to 7.35 inches
(6.45-18.67 cm) long.  Its culms are tufted at the base [<a href="#9">9</a>].  The
seedheads are brown, scaley, and conical.  Coastal specimens generally
have broader culms with purple to black scales, while inland specimens
show more rounded culms with lighter colored scales [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Common
spikerush is a nitrogen fixer [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Common spikerush regenerates primarily by rhizomes [<a href="#26">26</a>], colonizing
areas not conducive to seedling establishment.  Seeds are always present
in the seed bank (long-lived propagules) and can germinate in standing
water [<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Common spikerush grows in marshes and ditches and along streambanks,
lakeshores, riverbottoms, and in wet meadows and flood areas
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  It grows in the potholed, sand dune country of
south-central Washington [<a href="#15">15</a>], as well as in areas dominated by
sagebrush (Artemesia spp.) [<a href="#1">1</a>].  It occurs at the follow elevations:

State           Elevation                      Authority 
MT         2,200-8,120 feet (671-2,477 m)       [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>] 
UT         3,700-9,900 feet (1,135-3,200 m)     [<a href="#30">30</a>] 
OR         3,000-6,800 feet (914-2,073 m)       [<a href="#19">19</a>] 
CO         5,000-9,000 feet (1,525-2,750 m)     [<a href="#1">1</a>] 

Common spikerush grows in a variety of soils, including those derived
from alluvial parent materials, alkaline, sand loams, sedimentary peat,
organic loams, the Quaternary group, Histosols, Mollisols, and Entisols
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Common spikerush is a shade-tolerant, dominant graminoid in many wetland
communities in Montana, Colorado, and Utah [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  It is
subdominant to water sedge (Carex aquitilis) in wetland habitats of
Colorado [<a href="#1">1</a>] and seral in some wetlands of Oregon [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Common
spikerush forms monotypic stands with needle spikerush (Eleocharis
acicularis) in riparian sites of northwestern Montana [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
The following anthesis dates for common spikerush have been recorded: 

Southeast - July through October [<a href="#32">32</a>] 
Colorado, Wyoming, Montana - May through August [<a href="#7">7</a>]

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Eleocharis palustris
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Common spikerush is usually top-killed by fire [<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
Prescribed burns will reduce the litter layer in wetlands but often do
not affect plant species composition unless the organic layer is burned
[<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Common spikerush usually sprouts from rhizomes following fire [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Common spikerush sprouted following prescribed burning in Saskatchewan
[<a href="#24">24</a>].  Following prescribed burning in October in Oregon, common
spikerush's aboveground standing crop was nearly twice that of unburned
plots [<a href="#34">34</a>].  One hundred percent of the shoots produced flowers in both
the fall-burned and unburned plots.


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Young [<a href="#34">34</a>] cautions that wetlands and their respective upland
communities should not be managed separately because of the combined
importance of both for wildlife habitat.  Thus, the effects of fire on
one community should be considered in conjunction with the effects on
the other community.  He also recommends defining the soil-peat moisture
conditions before burning wetlands.

<b>CASE NAME : </b>
Malheur NWR, Oregon


<b>REFERENCE : </b>
Young, R. P. 1986 [<a href="#34">34</a>]


<b>SEASON/SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION : </b>
fall burn; information on severity unavailable



<b>STUDY LOCATION : </b>
The fire was conducted on Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, 40
kilometers south of Burns in southeastern Oregon.  The common spikerush
(Eleocharis palustris) burn was located at
Martha Lake Field (T26S, R28E, S24, SE 1/4, & S25, NE 1/4).


<b>PREFIRE VEGETATIVE COMMUNITY : </b>
The study sites consisted of five wetland habitats dominated by
monotypic communities of emergent macrophytes.  These sites ranged from
deep-water habitats to upland wet meadows.  All dominant species were
rhizomatous and included common spikerush (Eleocharis palustris),
hardstem bulrush (Scirpus acutus), American threesquare (S. americanus),
alkalai bulrush (S. maritimus), common cattail (Typha latifolia),
burreed (Sparganium eurycarpum), awned sedge (Carex atherodes), Nebraska
sedge (C. nebraskensis), and Baltic rush (Juncus balticus var.
montanus).


<b>TARGET SPECIES PHENOLOGICAL STATE : </b>
dormant


<b>SITE DESCRIPTION : </b>
Total area of the refuge is 72,219 ha and sits within a basin which
forms the northwest part of the Basin and Range Province of the western
United States.  Two major rivers, the Silvies and the Blitzen flow
through the refuge.  The climate is semiarid with moderate to cold
temperatures.  Annual precipitation averages between 25 and 30
centimeters, the majority of which falls in winter and spring.  Growing
seasons are shortened by cool springs, dry summers, and freezing in late
August or early September.


<b>FIRE DESCRIPTION : </b>
The burn on the common spikerush site was conducted on 20 October 1981.
Test burns were used to evaluate fire behavior before burning the main
unit.  Fires were started with drip torches on the downwind boundaries
of all plots.  Strip headfires were used after backing fires created a
wide line.  Firelines were constructed where natural breaks did not
occur.  Preburn feuls and weather conditions at the time of the burn
were as follows:

        Preburn fuel loading:  389-805 gm2
        Fuel height:  12 cm
        Litter height:  6 cm
        Fuel moisture:  3.7 percent
        Temperature:  16-23 deg C
        Relative humidity:  13-17 percent
        Wind speed:  2-16 km/hr

Fire behavior and effects on fuels during the prescribed fire were as
follows:

                                                        Postburn

<b>FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES : </b>
Fire effects were evaluated in terms of vegetative response, including
shoot height, density, weight, and growth rate; aboveground standing
crop; residual organic materials; and reproductive effort.  These
measurements were taken for two years following the burn.  Common
spikerush increased its aboveground standing crop and shoot densities.
Shoot weights decreased, although not significantly.  Residues after 2
years did not differ much.  All shoots produced inflorescences.  Shoot
height and rate of height-growth following burning and nonuse treatments
for the first postfire growing season follow:
                              Fall burn              Nonuse

<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS : </b>
The purpose of this study was to provide information for wetland fire
management plans.  Fire can play an important role in rejuvenating these
emergent species; however, long-term effects and effects of repeated
burning need to be further investigated.
