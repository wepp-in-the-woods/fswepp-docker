The currently accepted scientific name for Canada thistle is <i> Cirsium arvense</i> (L.)
Scop. (Asteraceae) [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#135">135</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#187">187</a>,<a href="#209">209</a>,<a href="#233">233</a>,<a href="#249">249</a>]. Canada thistle is extremely variable with regard to leaf division and vestiture,
and it has been treated as several species, numerous varieties, or as a single
highly polymorphic species [<a href="#81">81</a>]. Several authors recognize different varieties based
primarily on differences in leaf morphology [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#233">233</a>,<a href="#239">239</a>]. Voss [<a href="#233">233</a>] says it is doubtful that the variety designations are
meaningful, and Cronquist and others [<a href="#42">42</a>] state that contemporary European
botanists do not consider described variants of the species to be taxonomically
significant.

GENERAL DISTRIBUTION:</a>

<br />


Canada thistle is native to southeastern Europe and the eastern Mediterranean
area, and was probably introduced to North America in the 1600s as a contaminant
of crop seed and/or ship's ballast [<a href="#153">153</a>]. It is probably the
most widespread of all thistle species [<a href="#153">153</a>]. In addition to North
America, Canada thistle is invasive in northern and southern Africa, the Middle East, Japan,
India, New Zealand, Australia, and South America. It infests at least 27
crops in 37 countries and thrives in temperate regions of the northern
hemisphere [<a href="#147">147</a>]. In North America, Canada thistle occurs from Alaska east to the Northwest
Territories, Quebec, and Newfoundland and south to California, New
Mexico, Kansas, Arkansas, and North Carolina [<a href="#107">107</a>]. The <a href="https://plants.usda.gov/">PLANTS database</a>
provides a map of Canada thistle's distribution in the United States.

<p>Canada thistle has
been identified as a management problem in many national parks and on The Nature Conservancy preserves in the upper Midwest, the Great Plains states, and the Pacific
Northwest [<a href="#215">215</a>]. It is an invader in Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado [<a href="#67">67</a>], Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#219">219</a>], Wood Buffalo National Park,
Northwest Territories, Canada [<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#238">238</a>], Theodore Roosevelt National Park, North
Dakota [<a href="#32">32</a>], and the Camas Swale Research
Natural Area in the Willamette Valley, Oregon [<a href="#43">43</a>].
</p>

<p> Although Canada thistle is not usually found in
undisturbed forested areas, it has the potential to colonize a wide variety of
forest habitats within its range following overstory removal and soil
disturbance. The following listings take this potential into account.</p>

Canada thistle
is adaptable to a wide range of habitats. It occurs in nearly every
upland herbaceous community within its range, particularly
prairie communities and riparian habitats [<a href="#162">162</a>]. It is most commonly found in disturbed areas as part of the
initial postdisturbance community along roadsides, railroads, streambanks, ditches, lakeshores, seashores, sand dunes and
other open
sandy areas [<a href="#153">153</a>], in clearcuts and forest openings, and in wet and wet-mesic
grasslands and prairie potholes.

<p> In Canada, Canada thistle frequently occurs in prairie marshes and sedge
meadows,
where it is often associated with sow thistle
(<i>Sonchus</i> spp.), goldenrod (<i>Solidago</i> spp.), smartweeds (<i>Polygonum</i>
spp.), mint (<i>Mentha arvensis</i>), rough bugleweed (<i>Lycopus asper</i>),
marsh hedgenettle (<i>Stachys palustris</i>), and western germander (<i>Teucrium
canadense</i> var. <i>occidentale</i>) in upland transition zones [<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#160">160</a>,<a href="#170">170</a>,<a href="#214">214</a>].
Canada thistle is also a component of the emergent vegetation after drawdown in marsh communities
dominated by common reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>), along with alkali bulrush (<i>Scirpus</i>
spp.), cattail (<i>Typha </i> spp.), purple loosestrife (<i>Lythrum salicaria</i>),
sow thistle, and stinging nettle (<i>Urtica dioica</i>) [<a href="#143">143</a>,<a href="#214">214</a>,<a href="#230">230</a>]. In a southern Ontario wet
prairie, Canada thistle occurs with bluejoint reedgrass (<i>Calamagrostis canadensis</i>),
prairie cordgrass (<i>Spartina pectinata</i>), and sedges (<i>Carex</i>  spp.)
[<a href="#60">60</a>]. On
a seasonally flooded delta in Alberta, Canada thistle occurs with other xerophytic forbs such as
sow thistle, largeleaf avens (<i>Geum
macrophyllum</i>), willow shrubs (<i>Salix</i> spp.), Siberian yarrow (<i>Achillea sibirica</i>),
threepetal bedstraw (<i>Galium
trifidum</i>), and fringed willowherb (<i>Epilobium ciliatum</i>) [<a href="#98">98</a>].
</p>

<p>Canada thistle emerges after drawdown in a northern marsh in Minnesota,
along with sow thistle, willows, and sweet clover (<i>Melilotus</i>
 spp.) [<a href="#87">87</a>]. In a North Dakota meadow/riparian transition,
Canada thistle is found with sedges, sow thistle, tall nettle (<i>U. procera</i>)
and river-bulrush (<i>S. fluviatilis</i>) [<a href="#136">136</a>]. In the prairie pothole region of
Iowa, Canada thistle occurs with Kentucky bluegrass (<i>Poa pratensis</i>),
goldenrod, wild bergamot (<i>Monarda fistulosa</i>), and common milkweed (<i>Asclepias syriaca</i>)

(<i>Chenopodium album</i>) and Fuller's teasel (<i>Dipsacus fullonum</i>) [<a href="#71">71</a>]. Dense Canada
thistle stands in undisturbed areas in Colorado are associated with American
bulrush (<i>S. americanus</i>), creeping bentgrass (<i>Agrostis palustris</i>),
longstem spikerush (<i>Eleocharis macrostachys</i>), and saltgrass (<i>Distichlis
stricta</i>). In moderately
dense stands of Canada thistle, associates include giant ragweed (<i>Ambrosia
trifida</i>), horseweed (<i>Conyza canadensis</i>), common lambsquarters, rough pigweed, prairie sunflower (<i>Helianthus
petiolaris</i>), smooth dock (<i>Rumex altissimus</i>), and foxtail barley (<i>Critestion
jubatum</i>) [<a href="#204">204</a>]. In a riparian-wetland shrub
community in Montana, Canada thistle is found with Sandbar willow (<i>Salix
exigua</i>), rose (<i>Rosa</i> spp.),
      red-osier dogwood (<i>Cornus sericea</i>), other willows, redtop (<i>Agrostis
gigantea</i>), and Kentucky
      bluegrass [<a href="#86">86</a>].

Fuller's teasel (<i>D. f.</i> ssp. <i>sylvestris</i>) [<a href="#95">95</a>].
</p>

<p>Pacific Northwest: In the mountains of Washington and Oregon, Canada thistle is found along roadsides
and in clearcuts on many forest types, but is usually absent from undisturbed forests
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#161">161</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>,<a href="#166">166</a>,<a href="#251">251</a>]. It occurs in the beardless wildrye (<i>Leymus triticoides</i>) habitat type in mesic upland meadows in eastern Oregon with Douglas sedge (<i>C. douglasii</i>),
Baltic rush (<i>Juncus balticus</i> var. <i>montanus</i>), and Sandberg bluegrass (<i>P.

lambsquarters [<a href="#242">242</a>].
</p>

<p>Intermountain west: Canada thistle grows in a wide range of
environmental types including those dominated by little bluestem (<i>Schizachyrium
scoparium</i>), blue grama (<i>Bouteloua gracilis</i>), bluebunch wheatgrass (<i>Pseudoroegneria
spicata</i>), ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>), and Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga
menziesii</i>). Canada thistle is found in many
forest types after disturbance [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>], and it has the ability to invade undisturbed
sites in Douglas-fir and subalpine fir (<i>Abies lasiocarpa</i>)/twinflower (<i>Linnaea
borealis</i>) habitat types [<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>]. In Montana, Canada thistle may be found in ponderosa pine-Douglas fir
communities with white spirea (<i>Spiraea
betulifolia</i>), snowbrush ceanothus (<i>Ceanothus velutinus</i>), big
huckleberry (<i>Vaccinium membranaceum</i>), and sticky currant (<i>Ribes viscosissimum</i>)
[<a href="#123">123</a>], or on high river terraces with silver sagebrush (<i>Artemisia

(<i>Pascopyrum smithii</i>),
green needlegrass (<i>Nassella viridula</i>), Kentucky bluegrass and smooth
brome (<i>Bromus inermis</i>) under
Russian-olive (<i>Elaeagnus angustifolia</i>) [<a href="#130">130</a>]. In Glacier
National Park, it occurs in wetland communities with sedges (<i>Carex</i> spp.) [<a href="#243">243</a>]. In Yellowstone National Park, Canada thistle

</p>

In California, Canada thistle infests middle-elevation Sierran
meadows, including those in Yosemite Valley, as well as clear-cuts in the El Dorado National
Forest and riparian zones throughout the state, and is general to many disturbed
habitats [<a href="#197">197</a>]. In the
annual grassland of northern California, Canada thistle may be found with
coyotebrush (<i>Baccharis pilularis</i>), Italian ryegrass (<i>Lolium
multiflorum</i>), soft chess (<i>Bromus hordeaceus</i>), ripgut brome (<i>Bromus
rigidus</i>), wild oat (<i>Avena fatua</i>), blue fieldmadder (<i>Sherardia
arvensis</i>), foxtail fescue (<i>Vulpia myuros</i>) and purple tussock grass (<i>Nassella</i>
<i>pulchra</i>) [<a href="#96">96</a>]. In the coastal redwood (<i>Sequoia
sempervirens</i>) zone in California, Canada thistle may be found in cottonwood
(<i>Populus</i> spp.)-ash (<i>Fraxinus</i> spp.) habitats [<a href="#235">235</a>].

Livestock tend to dislike and avoid Canada
thistle and may also reduce their consumption of desirable plants in the vicinity
of Canada thistle colonies [<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>]. Canada thistle can be a minor component in the winter and spring diet of
mule deer [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>]. White-tailed deer forage on Canada thistle in marsh meadows
[<a href="#73">73</a>]. Thistles (<i>Cirsium</i>
spp.) are sometimes eaten by grizzly bear [<a href="#46">46</a>]. There are more than 130 species,
including pathogens, birds, and over 80 insects, known to feed on Canada thistle
[<a href="#137">137</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>]. Larvae of the painted lady butterfly feed
on Canada thistle, but only on an intermittent basis [<a href="#182">182</a>,<a href="#208">208</a>]. Seeds of Canada thistle
are eaten by goldfinches, whose diet consists largely of thistle seeds. Many of
the seeds are destroyed this way, but some may pass through the birds unharmed
[<a href="#186">186</a>].

The fragrant flowers of Canada thistle attract honeybees, the primary pollinator for this species.
Thistles (<i>Cirsium </i>spp.) are reported to be both edible
[<a href="#177">177</a>] and medicinal [<a href="#83">83</a>]. Canada thistle has been used by native peoples in
the northeastern United States in remedies for worms and poison-ivy (<i>Toxicodendron
radicans</i>) and was used
to make a mouthwash for children, a
treatment for tuberculosis (Duke 1986, cited in [<a href="#83">83</a>]), and a tonic for gastrointestinal ailments
[<a href="#148">148</a>]. The roots and
shoots of Canada thistle are said to be tender and tasty when taken early in the
spring, and were reportedly used as a food in Russia and by
North American natives [<a href="#186">186</a>]. The roots of Canada thistle, however,
may be emetic when consumed (Lewis and Elvin-Lewis 1977, cited in [<a href="#153">153</a>]). &quot;Cirsium&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;cirsos,&quot; meaning &quot;swollen
vein,&quot; for which the
thistle was considered a remedy [<a href="#237">237</a>].

After its introduction to North America in the 1600s, the rapid spread of Canada
thistle led to the enactment of control legislation as early as 1795 in Vermont and 1831 in New York
[<a href="#147">147</a>]. Since that time it has spread
throughout most of Canada and the United States, north of the 35th parallel,
where it is considered one of the most
tenacious and economically important agricultural weeds. It is also known to
invade native plant communities in forest and range sites [<a href="#49">49</a>].&nbsp; 

<p>
Canada thistle has the potential to rapidly form dense
infestations through vegetative reproduction, and the spread of these clones may
continue indefinitely, crowding out and displacing native
grasses and forbs through shading, competition, and possibly allelopathy [<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>]. Its spread can change the structure
and species composition of natural areas and reduce plant
and animal diversity [<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>]. Infestations of Canada thistle may contribute to
the elimination of endangered
and/or endemic plant species such as the Colorado butterfly plant in Wyoming
[<a href="#38">38</a>]. Canada thistle can decrease or limit forage and
livestock production on rangelands and can limit the use of recreational areas,
as it is annoying to hikers [<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>,<a href="#238">238</a>]. Natural
communities that are threatened by Canada thistle include nonforested plant
communities such as prairies, barrens, savannas, glades, sand dunes, fields, and
meadows, especially those that have been impacted by disturbance as well as those
undergoing manipulative restoration management [<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#215">215</a>]. In
addition, Canada thistle can spread from adjacent disturbed sites into sedge meadows, wet
prairies [<a href="#105">105</a>], and disturbed forests. Surveys in
the Northwest indicate acreage infested by Canada thistle increasing at an annual rate of 10%,
causing an average 42% reduction in range carrying capacity on infested lands [<a href="#49">49</a>]. 
</p>

<p>Maintaining a healthy native community is the best defense against Canada
thistle invasion, and can help to shade and weaken Canada thistle plants on sites already infested [<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>]. Canada thistle should be
removed from lightly infested natural areas when first observed, since it is very tenacious and
difficult to control once well established [<a href="#162">162</a>]. Priorities for controlling infestations must be
developed when planning a Canada thistle management
program, with actions ranging from prevention, to reduction and containment, to
eradication. Control measures
for Canada thistle have been developed primarily for agricultural systems, and
may not be feasible in
natural areas due to comparatively
low forage values, rough topography, and/or large areas. Furthermore, some
control measures can negatively impact
wildlife and native plant populations [<a href="#162">162</a>,<a href="#253">253</a>].
Eradication of established Canada thistle in natural areas is, therefore, not often a practical
goal. Reducing infestations to
manageable levels is a more viable objective [<a href="#162">162</a>]. Some state noxious weed laws require the
implementation of control measures [<a href="#153">153</a>]. Many native species of thistle occur in the
U.S.; some
of them are rare. Because of the possibility of confusion with native species,
Canada thistle must be accurately identified before any control efforts are attempted [<a href="#215">215</a>].</p>

<p>Effective long-term control of Canada thistle includes killing the roots and root
buds, and preventing seed production and reinfestation by seedlings [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>]. Because Canada thistle
has root nutrient stores, it recovers readily from most types of stress,
including control attempts. Therefore, control is optimized
by stressing the plant enough to force it
to use all of its root-stored nutrients. New seedlings must
be killed
within 2.5 weeks of emergence so they will not become perennial [<a href="#85">85</a>].
A buffer zone between uninfested areas and external
sources of thistle can help prevent vegetative invasion, and Canada thistle
plants within wind-dispersal
range must be controlled or kept from seeding. Treatment to control the perennial plants must
be thought out in advance and followed until control is complete [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>]. Control may take
several years and the treatment area must be monitored annually for presence of
Canada thistle [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>]. It takes at least 2 growing seasons to determine whether a
particular control
method is effective. Degree of control is influenced by clonal structure, growth stage, season of treatment, weather conditions, ecotype,
soil type, and control methods used [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#223">223</a>].
Timing of control methods to coincide with the most susceptible phenological
stage of the plant is critical in optimizing effects. A single control method is rarely effective,
and it is often necessary to use 2 or more methods at any given site [<a href="#55">55</a>]. Treatments or combinations that
are effective
at one site may be ineffective at others [<a href="#53">53</a>]. Donald [<a href="#53">53</a>] provides a comprehensive review of cultural and chemical
control practices for Canada thistle. Management of Canada thistle may be achieved through
hand cutting, mowing, controlled burning,
chemical
poisoning, or some combination of these treatments, depending on the level of infestation and the type of area being managed.</p>

<p>
 Integrated weed management: Control programs with a series of well calculated and
properly timed combinations of treatments are likely to be the most effective means of
controlling
Canada thistle, and may require 5 to 10 years of effort [<a href="#53">53</a>]. Haderlie
and others [<a href="#84">84</a>] suggest optimizing control of Canada thistle by using late summer
tillage to increase the number of foliar shoots and leaf area, thereby creating
more surface area for subsequent herbicide application. In natural areas with limited
infestations, Canada thistle can be pulled and/ or cut several times during the growing season to weaken
roots, and carefully treated with spot application of herbicide in the fall. Combinations of mechanical
 (hand pulling
and mowing) and chemical
methods improved control of Canada thistle in non-crop situations in Colorado
[<a href="#198">198</a>]. At another Colorado site, however, disking after herbicide application
did not influence Canada thistle control for any of the herbicides tested,
regardless of the timing of application (spring vs. fall) [<a href="#255">255</a>]. In native prairies, a spring burn followed by seeding of native species
is a possible option [<a href="#162">162</a>]. Drought stress reduces the
effectiveness of most herbicides against Canada thistle but increases the
effectiveness of mechanical controls. Therefore, mowing and burning may be preferred
strategies under drought conditions [<a href="#162">162</a>]. Tilling and planting competitive grasses was as
      effective as yearly applications of clopyralid for Canada thistle control
in a Nebraska pasture [<a href="#247">247</a>]. The interaction of defoliation (by <i> Cassida rubiginosa</i>) and plant
competition (by crownvetch (<i>Coronilla varia</i>)) and tall fescue (<i>Festuca arundinaceae</i>))
can seriously reduce productivity of Canada thistle [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>]. Similarly, the weevil <i>Ceutorhyncus</i>
 <i> litura </i>alone will not effectively control Canada thistle, but may be
more successful when combined with cultural techniques that
allow for maximum desirable plant competition [<a href="#182">182</a>]. Canada thistle stands were treated with mechanical,
chemical, and biological measures in Mesa Verde National Park, with some degree of
 success. Results are still forthcoming [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].</p>

<p>
Prescribed fire: For information on prescribed fire as a management tool for
Canada thistle control, please see the &quot;Fire Management
Considerations&quot; section of the &quot;Fire Effects&quot; frame in this
report.
</p>

<p>Competition: Canada thistle is susceptible to shading and grows best when no competing vegetation is present.
In a study comparing possible control methods for
perennial pepperweed, Canada thistle established, along with non-native cheatgrass (<i>Bromus
tectorum</i>), after
disking and herbicide treatments that reduced cover of native forbs and grasses
[<a href="#112">112</a>]. Overgrazing is a major cause of perennial weed invasion,
because grasses can compete
effectively with and inhibit the establishment
of non-natives if grass growth is favored by good management. Canada thistle growth
may be discouraged in disturbed natural areas if suitable native species are seeded
densely enough to provide sufficient competition [<a href="#83">83</a>]. To be
effective against Canada thistle the seeded species must come up before Canada
thistle, grow rapidly during the early
summer in order to shade out the thistle, and retain vigor until frost [<a href="#162">162</a>]. In a riparian site in north-central Washington,
areas seeded to grass kept noxious weeds out and areas which were missed during grass
seeding operations were rapidly colonized by annual and perennial forbs
including Canada thistle [<a href="#34">34</a>]. An attempt at controlling Canada
thistle with competitive species in Minnesota failed because the grasses failed
to establish [<a href="#19">19</a>]. On a
reclaimed parking lot in Illinois that was planted by broadcast seeding and seedling
transplanting, then burned 5 years later and on an annual basis thereafter,
Canada thistle decreased over time and was virtually absent by year 8 [<a href="#114">114</a>].</p>
<p>Cultivation: Repeated tillage or mowing gives long-term Canada thistle
control by depleting root carbohydrate reserves. A typical seedling, 14 days after
emergence, does not yet have a perennial root, so it can
be killed by cultivation. However, a 3-week-old seedling can regenerate after
the top-growth is clipped. Tillage exposes roots to drying
and freezing at the soil surface, and can be an
effective method of control [<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>]. Because the roots of Canada thistle tend to be deeper than
plow
depth, cultivation may affect only a small part of the plant and must be started at flowerbud time,
repeated every 10
to 14 days through the season, and repeated again the following year [<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#158">158</a>]. Tilling is generally limited
to cropland [<a href="#85">85</a>], and is not recommended in natural areas since it is likely to severely damage
natives and may make an infestation worse by spreading root pieces [<a href="#162">162</a>]. Tillage disturbance of soil may
also provide ideal conditions for erosion, reinvasion, and introduction of other exotics.</p>
<p>Mowing: Mowing or cutting Canada thistle plants temporarily reduces
aboveground biomass and can prevent
flowering and seed production, but does not kill plants unless repeated at 7- to
28-day intervals for up to 4
years [<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>]. Repeated and frequent
pulling or hand cutting of individual plants will eventually starve underground
stems. Cutting or pulling should be at least 3 times each season, in June,
August, and September. This treatment is feasible for light and moderate
infestations, but may be prohibitively time consuming in heavy infestations [<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>]. Stems with flowers that have been open for
8-10 days can develop viable seeds and must be removed from the site in order to
prevent germination. The best time to cut is in the very early bud stage when food reserves are at their
lowest point, and cutting must be repeated until
the starch reserves in the roots are exhausted [<a href="#215">215</a>]. When the primary stem of Canada thistle is removed, rootbuds are stimulated to produce new
shoots that might otherwise be suppressed. Therefore, plants must be cut high enough to leave
more than 9 leaves/stem or more than 8 inches (20 cm) of bare stem
tissue. In high humidity, root buds are stimulated to grow regardless of cutting method, and cut plants produce twice the length and weight of new shoots
after 7 days under high humidity than they produce in low humidity [<a href="#104">104</a>].
After several years of mowing a hay meadow in
Illinois and then
stopping, native prairie species reemerged and dominated the site [<a href="#190">190</a>].</p>

<p>Biological control: Biological control may be a viable option for national parks and other natural areas
that have restrictions on
herbicide use [<a href="#208">208</a>]. Wilson
and McAffrey [<a href="#245">245</a>] provide a discussion of considerations and safety issues in
developing and implementing a biological control program.</p>

<p>There are more than 130 species,
including pathogens, birds, and over 80 insects known to attack Canada thistle [<a href="#137">137</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>]. Some of the
biocontrol agents that
have been tested and references pertaining to them are listed below:</p>

<p>To date, biological control of
Canada thistle has not been successful, although some biological control agents
(e.g., <i>Ceutorhynchus litura </i>and <i>Cassida rubiginosa</i>) suppress
it to a
limited extent and may be effective when combined with other control
methods [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#181">181</a>]. Even in its native range in
Europe, Canada thistle is a serious weed in spite of the large number of insects
that are found in and on the
plant [<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>]. Most potential biocontrol organisms are not adequately
synchronized with Canada thistle's life cycle in North America to induce high
mortality. Management that delays Canada thistle maturation, such as mowing
or burning, may help synchronize the susceptible thistle growth stage to the
biocontrol agent life cycle [<a href="#69">69</a>]. Biological control measures may also be more effective when coupled with
factors that favor the competitive ability of native forbs and grasses [<a href="#111">111</a>].
</p>

<p>Grazing is not likely to be an effective control method
for Canada thistle since cattle and horses avoid it and graze competing
vegetation which results in gradual dominance by Canada thistle. Furthermore,
heavy grazing breaks up sod and reduces cover of native vegetation, which encourages the spread of Canada thistle [<a href="#162">162</a>]. Some evidence suggests
that domestic goats, sheep, and cattle may prevent Canada thistle from flowering by
grazing it prior to the bud stage in early spring [<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>]. Domestic sheep have been reported
to graze and trample plants that have been treated with salt [<a href="#83">83</a>], and
intensive pasture grazing by sheep in
Australia reduced the spread of Canada thistle compared to an ungrazed pasture [<a href="#153">153</a>].
</p>

<p>
Chemical: Most reports and studies of herbicide use for reduction of Canada thistle
apply to agricultural areas and are not directly applicable for use in natural
areas. Many herbicides cannot be used in natural areas
because of their potential to harm non-target plant and animal species, including soil organisms, aquatic species, humans, and other
vertebrates, and the potential to contaminate water resources and set back the succession of natural
communities [<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>]. Dioxin toxicity is also a concern in herbicide use since these chemicals
are often found as impurities in herbicides [<a href="#227">227</a>]. Herbicides usually require
repeated applications to achieve moderate
control, and their continual use may lead to
herbicide resistance, soil sterilization, and erosion [<a href="#111">111</a>]. Herbicides
seldom provide long-term control of weeds when used alone and outside the
context of an integrated weed management plan. They may control existing weeds, but the lack of a healthy community of
desirable plants usually allows that weed or another invasive species to become
established after the residual effects of the herbicide have dissipated [<a href="#31">31</a>].&nbsp; 
</p>

<p>Donald [<a href="#53">53</a>] provides a comprehensive review of
chemical control of Canada thistle. More information is available on use of herbicides on
rangelands [<a href="#31">31</a>],
on national forests
in the Pacific Northwest ([<a href="#244">244</a>] and <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/r6/weeds/framert.htm">USDA Forest Service-PNW</a>), and in general (<a href="https://ace.orst.edu/info/extoxnet/">EXTOXNET</a> or
<a href="https://ace.orst.edu/info/nptn/">NPTN</a>). See the <a href="https://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/handbook.html">Weed Control Methods Handbook</a> for considerations on the use of herbicides
in natural areas and detailed information on specific chemicals.
</p>

<p> Results from herbicide treatment of Canada thistle can vary for several
reasons including differential susceptibilities of different ecotypes, different
growth stages [<a href="#70">70</a>], application method and rate, and the possibility of selecting a tolerant
variety from the original gene pool [<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>]. If the physiological, morphological, and
phenological stage of the plants and the environmental conditions under
which the plants are growing are not optimal, herbicides will be ineffective
and control will not be satisfactory [<a href="#203">203</a>]. Many herbicides recommended for control of Canada
thistle are foliar applied, systemic toxins that must be translocated to the
roots to be effective. These chemicals must be applied when moisture status of
the plants is favorable (i.e. do not apply
herbicides to old leaves or to drought stressed plants), plants are growing well,
and, ideally, during the period when photosynthates are translocated to the
roots [<a href="#203">203</a>,<a href="#222">222</a>]. For Canada thistle, this period is thought to correspond to the
bud stage [<a href="#203">203</a>], but more recent evidence suggests that greater photoassimilate
movement to the roots occurs during the rosette and bolt stages.
Additionally, environmental conditions typical of fall, and possibly early
spring, favored photoassimilate movements to the roots [<a href="#223">223</a>]. Spot treating Canada
thistle with herbicides in the early spring or fall when native species are dormant
may be less damaging to the ecosystem as well.&nbsp;Differences in foliar lipid
extracts between Canada thistle ecotypes may have implications for chemical
control, as those with greater amounts of lipids on the leaves are more
resistant to foliarly applied herbicides [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#203">203</a>].
</p>

Canada thistle was unaffected by AAl-toxin, a natural herbicide (a plant
pathogen metabolite) [<a href="#1">1</a>], while wheat gluten meal was found to inhibit
germination and root extension in Canada thistle [<a href="#79">79</a>]. Some persons have had success killing individual plants by cutting
the top and putting table salt down the hollow stem [<a href="#248">248</a>].

Canada thistle is a perennial introduced forb. It is distinguished from other
thistles by creeping horizontal lateral roots, dense clonal growth, and
dioecious habit [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>,<a href="#241">241</a>]. Descriptions and terminology of Canada thistle
biology can be confusing or contradictory. For example, descriptions of leaf morphology,
stem
height, and number of flowering heads may differ somewhat between floras. The
following discussion provides ranges of what may be encountered for
these characteristics, which will vary under different field conditions. Donald
[<a href="#55">55</a>]
and Moore [<a href="#151">151</a>] provide comprehensive reviews of the biology of Canada thistle.

<p> Canada thistle has a deep and wide-spreading root system
with a slender taproot and far-creeping lateral roots. It often forms large patches,
and individual clones may reach 115 feet (35 m) in diameter [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#187">187</a>,<a href="#249">249</a>].
Most
Canada thistle roots are in the top 0.7 to 2 feet (0.2-0.6 m) of soil, but roots
can extend as
deep as 6.5 to 22 feet (2-6.75 m) [<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>,<a href="#158">158</a>]. Carbohydrate reserves are stored in roots and can range from 3%
of root fresh weight during spring to as high as 26% in late fall [<a href="#138">138</a>]. Roots are injured when directly
exposed to freezing temperatures for 2 hours at -5 &deg;C and killed after 2 hours at -7
&deg;C [<a href="#193">193</a>]. Arbuscular mycorrhizal infection of Canada thistle roots has been
observed in several studies [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>]. Canada thistle does not form rhizomes, despite this
assertion in some literature. Adventitious root buds that may form new adventitious shoots
can develop along the root at any location, and at any time of
the year with favorable growing conditions [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].
New plants can also form from root fragments as short as 0.2 inch (6 mm)
[<a href="#158">158</a>]. Soil type, structure and horizonation may impact the anatomy,
morphology and distribution of Canada thistle roots as well. This suggests that root morphology
and distribution are site specific and greenhouse studies of root morphology may not apply
[<a href="#55">55</a>].
</p>

<p>Canada thistle has slender aerial shoots with leafy stems
reaching 1 to 6.5 feet (0.3-2 m) tall [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#177">177</a>,<a href="#239">239</a>]. Leaves are 1.2 to 7 inches (3-18
cm) long and 0.2 to 2.4 inches (0.5-6 cm) wide [<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#135">135</a>,<a href="#239">239</a>]. Canada thistle leaf morphology (texture,
hairiness, lobing and spininess) can vary considerably, even within a geographical
region [<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>]. Canada thistle has numerous
aboveground branches that
bear several, small flowerheads (0.4 to 0.75 inch (1-2 cm) in diameter) in
clusters [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#177">177</a>,<a href="#241">241</a>]. Seeds are 0.09 to 0.2 inch (2.4-5 mm) long, and
0.04 inch (1 mm) in diameter with a pappus of feathery bristles
[<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#177">177</a>,<a href="#239">239</a>,<a href="#241">241</a>].
</p>

<p>While allelopathy has not been conclusively
demonstrated for Canada thistle, this species may produce phytotoxins that inhibit the growth of other
plants [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#204">204</a>]. Fructan metabolism in Canada thistle
adds to its competitive advantages by allowing it to grow at relatively cool
temperatures [<a href="#37">37</a>].</p>

Canada thistle reproduces both sexually by seed and vegetatively by creeping roots. Generally, vegetative reproduction
contributes to local spread and seeding to long distance dispersal. Introduction into
new areas is mostly by wind- or water-borne seed, or by seed in
contaminated crop seed, hay or machinery [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>]. Canada thistle allocates most of its reproductive energy
to
vegetative propagation, and a patch can spread rapidly by vegetative means under
favorable conditions. Total allocation of dry weight to sexual reproduction was
only 7% for Canada thistle grown in pots [<a href="#23">23</a>]. However, the
contribution of sexual reproduction to the survival and spread of Canada thistle
may be underestimated and may be an important mechanism for initiating continued genetic
diversity in a clonal population [<a href="#89">89</a>].

<p>Sexual reproduction: Shoot elongation
and flowering in Canada thistle are induced by 15-hour day length, therefore flowering and seed
production will be limited or prevented in regions with shorter summer days [<a href="#84">84</a>]. A typical Canada thistle shoot may produce 32 to 69
flowerheads per shoot (1-5 per branch) on average, but can produce as many as 100
flowerheads
in a season [<a href="#151">151</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>]. Canada thistle is &quot;imperfectly dioecious&quot; [<a href="#55">55</a>], with male and female flowers
occurring on separate plants. Up to 26% of &quot;male&quot; plants are actually self-fertile
hermaphrodites or subhermaphrodites that occasionally produce seed [<a href="#108">108</a>].
</p>

<p>Seed production: Canada thistle is
insect pollinated, primarily by
honeybees [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>]. Male and female plants must be located
within a few hundred yards of each other for insect pollination and seed set to
occur [<a href="#84">84</a>].
Seed set is highest when male and female plants are
intermixed and decreases when
female plants are more than 164 feet (50 m) from male plants [<a href="#126">126</a>]. Since Canada thistle can grow in large patches, it is not uncommon to
find sterile heads of female flowers [<a href="#126">126</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>].
Canada thistle has a reputation for producing few viable seeds, but the
literature gives a wide range of estimates for seed production with numbers
ranging from 0 to 40,000 seeds per stem [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>].
Reports of average seed-set per flowerhead range from 21-93 [<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>]. Kay [<a href="#108">108</a>] reports that females produce
an average of 30 to 70 seeds/flowerhead
and males average 2 to 10 seeds/head. The number of flowerheads per stem
reported ranges from 0 to 100 [<a href="#89">89</a>]. In annual grasslands in
northern California
where biomass of Canada thistle was 13<u>+</u> 8 g/m<sup>2</sup>, seed production was 1300
seeds/m<sup>2</sup>, seed rain was 80<u>+</u>
50 seeds/m<sup>2</sup>, and germinable seeds in the top 2 cm of soil were 280<u>+</u>110/m<sup>2</sup> [<a href="#96">96</a>]. Inefficient pollination and genetic variability may contribute to poor seed
yields [<a href="#89">89</a>]. Seeds
of Canada thistle are subject to predation by insects before dispersal, but information is more qualitative
than quantitative [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>]. Weather
extremes (cool and moist or hot and dry) can interfere with pollination, so
some years even female plants do not produce much seed [<a href="#61">61</a>].
</p>

<p>Seed dispersal: Canada thistle seeds are released
about 2-3 weeks after pollination [<a href="#124">124</a>].
They are equipped with a
pappus, loosely attached to the seed tip, that enables wind dispersal, and
have good aerodynamic efficiency [<a href="#199">199</a>]. Canada thistle
seeds have been observed windborne on the prairie several hundred meters from
the nearest source population [<a href="#176">176</a>]. Evidence from seed rain studies on
Mount St. Helens, Washington suggests that Canada thistle seeds can travel several kilometers
[<a href="#250">250</a>]. This dispersal
mechanism accounts for the numerous examples of Canada thistle seedling
establishment after disturbance in natural areas [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#221">221</a>], especially after fire [<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>,<a href="#194">194</a>]. However, wind
dispersal has not been considered a
major factor in its spread, since the pappus readily
breaks off, leaving the achenes within the seedheads [<a href="#23">23</a>]. In developed areas,
seeds
are more commonly spread by animals, in hay, contaminated crop seed,
machinery, and irrigation water [<a href="#162">162</a>]. Observations in Rocky Mountain National
Park&nbsp; indicate that trails, especially those used by horses, are major
invasion pathways for Canada thistle [<a href="#140">140</a>]. Livestock consuming unprocessed hay before entering
national forests will likely spread more Canada thistle seeds than those
consuming feed
pellets, since pellet manufacturing destroys 99% of viable
Canadian thistle seed when it includes grinding and screening [<a href="#35">35</a>].
</p>

<p>Viability and germination: Canada thistle seeds
mature quickly and most are capable of germinating 8 to 11 days after the
flowers open, even if the plants are cut when flowering. Moore [<a href="#151">151</a>] summarized research indicating
that almost all Canada thistle seed can germinate upon dispersal, although
germination is extremely variable (0-95%). Viability of seeds during the 1st
season after dispersal may be as high as 90% [<a href="#84">84</a>]. Most seeds germinate in
the spring after the year in which they are produced [<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>], with some seeds producing basal leaves
before winter and emerging to flower the next spring [<a href="#105">105</a>]. However,
Heimann and Cussans [<a href="#89">89</a>] indicate that seedlings are not always able to
survive the winter. Germination may be affected by ecotype, temperature, day length,
depth of seed burial, substrate stratification, and seed freshness [<a href="#162">162</a>]. Seeds
from &quot;male&quot; plants are smaller and percent germination
is lower [<a href="#108">108</a>]. Temperature requirements for germination were summarized by
Moore [<a href="#151">151</a>]; the effects of light, pH, and salinity are summarized by Donald
[<a href="#55">55</a>]. Canada thistle seeds germinate best in warm
temperatures (68 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit (20-40 &deg;C)), with
alternating light and dark periods [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>,<a href="#246">246</a>]. Germination
in Canada thistle was best after 0.5 to 16 days at 88 to 108 degrees Fahrenheit
(31-42 &deg;C) [<a href="#213">213</a>]. At lower temperatures germination is aided by
high light intensity [<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>]. Germination at higher
temperatures can help ensure that maximum germination takes place during warmer
periods of the year [<a href="#89">89</a>]. Canada thistle seeds are
somewhat tolerant of heat, and some were still viable after 10 minutes at 216 degrees
Fahrenheit (102 &deg;C) and 2
minutes at 504 degrees Fahrenheit (262 &deg;C), although viability was decreased at these temperatures compared to unheated controls
[<a href="#213">213</a>]. Canada thistle seeds germinate over a wide range of soil moisture [<a href="#246">246</a>]. Heimann and Cussans [<a href="#89">89</a>]
provide a summary indicating that Canada thistle seed can germinate
on the soil surface,
but that germination is best when seeds are buried 0.2 to 0.6 inch (0.5-1.5 cm) deep.
Emergence as deep as 6 cm in some soil types has been reported [<a href="#246">246</a>]. Most germination studies have
been done under artificial conditions, and factors influencing germination in
the field are far more complex [<a href="#89">89</a>].
</p>

<p>Seed banking: The soil seed bank does not usually contain large numbers of Canada
thistle seeds [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>], although there is evidence of seed banking
in a coastal British Columbia coniferous forest soil [<a href="#110">110</a>], in mature forest sites in central Idaho
[<a href="#117">117</a>], and in the Delta Marsh in Manitoba [<a href="#230">230</a>]. Length of survival is related to depth of burial, with seeds
surviving up to 22 years when they are buried more than 8 inches (20 cm) deep
[<a href="#78">78</a>]. Under more natural conditions
of shallower burial and periodic soil disturbance, Canada thistle seeds are more short lived
(&lt;5 years), with most seed being lost from the soil seed bank by germination
during the 1st year [<a href="#55">55</a>]. Seeds that have been in water for several months can still be viable
[<a href="#84">84</a>]. Donald [<a href="#55">55</a>]
summarizes the research on seed banking in Canada thistle and the effects of seed immersion in water.
</p>

<p>Seedling establishment: Canada thistle seedlings
usually start growing slowly and are sensitive to competition and shading [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. Seedlings grow poorly in very moist, poorly aerated soils and
do not tolerate drought stress [<a href="#246">246</a>]. Before seedlings become
perennial, they are also highly susceptible to
tillage [<a href="#153">153</a>].
</p>

<p>Asexual reproduction: Vegetative spread of Canada
thistle can occur from horizontal extension of the root system, from root fragments, or
from subterranean stem tissue
[<a href="#132">132</a>]. Spread can be rapid when there is little competition, with 13 to 20 feet
(4-6 m) of horizontal root growth possible in one season [<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>]. Canada thistle
can develop new aerial shoots at any
location along the root length, from the original vertical root, or from buds on
lateral roots. Within a few weeks of germination, a
Canada thistle seedling with at least 4 true leaves can begin producing root buds that can eventually produce new shoots
[<a href="#84">84</a>]. Buds on lateral roots may form new adventitious shoots as
frequently as 0.3 to 1-inch (0.8 to 2.4 cm) intervals [<a href="#103">103</a>], although the number of root buds is likely to vary from place to place
and year to year [<a href="#158">158</a>]. A single Canada thistle plant can
potentially produce 26 adventitious shoots, 154
adventitious root buds, and 364 feet (111 m) of roots after 18 weeks of growth [<a href="#153">153</a>,<a href="#158">158</a>]. It is possible that a colony of male plants would maintain itself
regardless of whether it produced fruits [<a href="#241">241</a>].
</p>

<p>Root buds are inhibited by the presence of the main shoot,
primarily due to a competition for water [<a href="#104">104</a>], and new root
bud growth is highest during late fall and winter months following death of aerial shoots
[<a href="#138">138</a>]. When the main shoot is removed (e.g. as by mowing) the root buds are released,
and new shoots emerge rapidly, especially when humidity is high [<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#158">158</a>].
Wilson [<a href="#246">246</a>] found that some 19-day old plants were capable of regenerating
top-growth after clipping, and that 40-day old plants could produce 2 or 3
shoots after clipping. Root fragments as short as
0.2 inch (6 mm) and more than 6 weeks
but less than 2
years old can regenerate entire plants, regardless of whether they have
identifiable root buds at the
time [<a href="#158">158</a>]. Nadeau and Vanden Born [<a href="#158">158</a>]
observed that an 18-week-old plant had the potential of producing 930 shoots if
its root system was cut into 10-cm-long pieces.&nbsp;
</p>

<p> Vegetative spread of Canada thistle may also occur from
subterranean stem tissue that can produce shoot buds and adventitious roots at
each node. Partially buried stem sections from the postbloom stage survived and
produced adventitious roots that over wintered and produced new infestations the
following spring [<a href="#132">132</a>]. Similarly, Canada thistle can
survive disturbance to be part of the early successional community in natural
areas by resprouting from buried root and stem fragments [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>].</p>

<br />

Temperature: Canada thistle grows best between 32 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit (0-32
&deg;C)
[<a href="#151">151</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>]. Extended periods with temperatures over 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 &deg;C)
reduce
plant vigor and generally limit growth. High temperatures and shorter days keep
Canada thistle from
thriving in the southern U.S. Optimum day/night
temperatures for
growth are 77 and 59 degrees Fahrenheit (25 and 15 &deg;C), respectively [<a href="#85">85</a>]. The northern
limit of Canada thistle's growth corresponds to the 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 &deg;C) mean January isotherm;
flowering is
also limited in the northern latitudes [<a href="#151">151</a>]. Canada thistle invasion of native rangelands appears
to be a problem especially of highly productive, mesic habitats [<a href="#180">180</a>,<a href="#204">204</a>,<a href="#253">253</a>]. However, Canada thistle was able to infest
subalpine fir/twinflower habitats in western Montana [<a href="#68">68</a>]. The temperature exposure of overwintering buds required to reduce survival of
Canada thistle was 2 hours at 19 degrees Fahrenheit (-7 &deg;C) and to reduce
total dry weight was 2 hours at 23 degrees Fahrenheit (-5 &deg;C) [<a href="#193">193</a>]. The
ability of adventitious root buds to withstand freezing depends on their location
in the soil profile [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#193">193</a>]. In soil samples from
a mid-boreal wetland subjected to increased
temperatures, Canada thistle seedling emergence increased significantly
(p&lt;0.05) at higher temperatures [<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].

<p>
Moisture: Canada thistle tolerates annual precipitation ranging from 12 to 40 inches
(305-1015 mm) per year, and grows best with 16 to 30 inches (400-750 mm) of precipitation per year
[<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>]. In
range and pastureland, Canada thistle is often restricted to swales or other areas of deep,
moist soils [<a href="#129">129</a>]. Canada thistle is concentrated in disturbed areas and along
streams, rivers and other moist areas in Rocky Mountain National Park, although
individual plants have been found on relatively dry, sagebrush-dominated sites
[<a href="#140">140</a>]. A high water table limits root growth [<a href="#186">186</a>], but Canada thistle often occurs in wetlands where water
levels fluctuate, and in degraded sedge meadows it may be found growing on tussocks elevated
above the normal high water line. In a mid-boreal wetland subjected to
drought, Canada thistle increased 5- to 13-fold over predrought levels [<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].
Canada thistle survives well in dry places [<a href="#186">186</a>] and under extended periods of drought, but biomass and
number of root buds decrease after several years [<a href="#195">195</a>]. Growth was increased by high
relative humidity (90-100%) over low relative humidity (30-50%) [<a href="#104">104</a>].
</p>

<p>Elevation and slope: Canada thistle occurs over a
wide range of elevations from sea level [<a href="#58">58</a>] to elevations in excess
of 8,000 feet (2,500 m) [<a href="#49">49</a>]. In the northern Rocky Mountains, it is found
mainly by roadsides and other disturbed sites in the lower elevations and
warmer, drier habitats, and escapes to
undisturbed sites at upper elevations [<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#236">236</a>]. In Yellowstone
National Park, Wyoming, Canada
thistle occurs at elevations ranging from 5,970 to over 7,875 feet (1,820-2,400 m) [<a href="#4">4</a>].
In Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, Canada thistle coverage is greater at
elevations around 8,375 feet (2,550 m) and decreases at elevations around 9,095
feet (2,770 m), but occurs up to at least 9,185 feet (2,800 m) [<a href="#140">140</a>]. Canada thistle grows best on shallow (9-30%) slopes
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>].

</p>

<p>Soils: The wide distribution of Canada thistle suggests that
it is adaptable to many soil types [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>]. It grows on all but
waterlogged, poorly aerated, and peat soils, including clay, clay loam, silt loam, sandy
loam, sandy clay, sand dunes, gravel, limestone, and chalk [<a href="#162">162</a>]. Rogers [<a href="#186">186</a>]
suggests that Canada thistle grows best on limestone soils with abundant
moisture. Some authors suggest that it is best adapted to clay soils
[<a href="#153">153</a>]; others suggest that it prefers
well-aerated soils [<a href="#151">151</a>]. Preliminary results in Rocky Mountain National Park
indicate that soils supporting Canada thistle tended to have a surface (0-10 cm)
texture higher in clay and silt than in sand [<a href="#140">140</a>]. Canada thistle was found growing on heavily saline soils
in central Alberta, though it was absent from saline areas of Saskatchewan and
Manitoba [<a href="#24">24</a>]. Hardpans, gravel, sand, or very alkaline soil horizons can limit root development of
Canada
thistle [<a href="#186">186</a>].
</p>

<p>Competition and light: Canada thistle grows best in open sunny sites
[<a href="#151">151</a>].
Canada thistle seedlings are much less
competitive than established plants, and will survive only if competition is
limited and the daytime light intensity remains above 20% of full sunlight [<a href="#153">153</a>].
In Rocky Mountain National Park, total canopy cover of vegetation within Canada
thistle patches is less than outside the patches [<a href="#140">140</a>]. At Yellowstone National Park, Canada thistle was
found in 6 out of 10 campgrounds, with occurrences most frequent under a
canopy cover of less than 20%, although it was occasionally present under more
closed canopy covers (up to 95%) suggesting that it is somewhat tolerant of
shade. Twenty percent of the quadrats in which Canada thistle
was present had no evidence of disturbance [<a href="#4">4</a>]. Because Canada thistle is
relatively shade intolerant, it may be found
growing along the edges of woods (both deciduous and coniferous), but is rarely
found under forest canopy, in undisturbed prairies, good to excellent pastures, or woodland or
sites that are shaded most of the day [<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>]. In the Delta Marsh in Manitoba, Canada thistle is
present in communities dominated by common reed. It is capable of
persisting on undisturbed plots, growing with stunted spindly stems and no flowers,
but growth improves after disturbance [<a href="#214">214</a>].
</p>

<p>
Generally, Canada thistle establishes and develops best on open, moist, disturbed
areas, including ditch banks,
overgrazed pastures, meadows, tilled fields or open waste places, fence rows,
roadsides, and campgrounds; and after logging, road building, fire and
landslides in natural areas [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>,<a href="#194">194</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#221">221</a>]. Roads, streams
and ditches provide areas of disturbance and corridors for invasion. At
Yellowstone National Park, Canada
thistle
was found in all levels of disturbance (along horse and foot trails,
roadways, and campgrounds) and its abundance increased as disturbance cover increased
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#220">220</a>]. Physically disturbed habitat in fragmented old growth in Indiana
facilitated invasion by exotics including Canada thistle [<a href="#26">26</a>]. Canada
thistle invasion was also enhanced by heavy grazing by bison [<a href="#238">238</a>], areas left barren during planting operations, and on earth mounds made by
pocket gophers and badgers in North and South Dakota [<a href="#93">93</a>].</p>

Canada thistle is an early successional species that emerges from seed or root
fragments shortly after disturbance. It grows best in open sunny sites, though
may be somewhat tolerant of shade (see &quot;Site Characteristics&quot;). Canada
thistle may establish in natural areas as part of the initial
plant community after logging [<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#161">161</a>,<a href="#251">251</a>], fire
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>,<a href="#194">194</a>,<a href="#243">243</a>], volcanic eruption (debris deposit, landslide)
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#218">218</a>], grazing [<a href="#144">144</a>], and road building [<a href="#141">141</a>]. Canada thistle and other
introduced species are taking over large tracts of logged, burned, or otherwise
disturbed land in British Columbia [<a href="#221">221</a>]. In northern Idaho, Canada thistle establishes
following clearcutting with soil displacement. With low soil displacement, the
plant community follows a successional sequence that favors the eventual establishment of tree and
shrub species, but with heavy soil displacement, a
persistent forb-rich community, including Canada thistle, develops with few tree species present, and very
little species replacement over time [<a href="#106">106</a>]. Canada thistle may not establish immediately after logging and
fire disturbances, but may be delayed for 2 or more seasons [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>,<a href="#243">243</a>]. Canada thistle was among the 3 most common species to
survive a debris deposit created by the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, where
it sprouted from transported root fragments, and from seed [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>]. Canada thistle is also found among the emergent vegetation after drawdown in the Delta Marsh,
Manitoba
[<a href="#143">143</a>,<a href="#230">230</a>]. In a study comparing possible
control methods for perennial pepperweed, Canada thistle established, along with
cheatgrass, after disking and herbicide treatments that reduced cover of native
forbs and grasses [<a href="#112">112</a>].

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT">
SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:</a>
</span>
<br />

 Most Canada
thistle seed is sufficiently mature to germinate 8 to 11 days after flowering begins,
depending on specific growing conditions [<a href="#89">89</a>].
Seedlings begin to develop lateral roots and adventitious root buds when they are about 3
to 5 weeks old, thereby becoming perennial [<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>]. Canada thistle seedlings can flower in the same growing season
that they emerge, but they require a juvenile vegetative period before
established plants can flower in response to light [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>]. It has not been established whether shoots arising from
adventitious root buds on established root systems have a similar juvenile
period before flowering [<a href="#55">55</a>].

<p>Canada thistle phenology varies with ecotype, but
follows a general pattern. Plants develop new roots and underground shoots in
January and begin to elongate in February [<a href="#162">162</a>]. New shoots from established Canada thistle plants begin to emerge when average weekly temperature reaches 41 degrees Fahrenheit (5
&deg;C), with optimum emergence after temperatures are at least 46 degrees Fahrenheit
(8 &deg;C) [<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>]. Plants remain short until long days trigger flowering and stem elongation, normally in May and June,
or about 3 weeks after
emergence [<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>]. When soil is warm and temperatures are moderate (as in fall) Canada
thistle grows vigorously [<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>].
</p>

<p>The growth
response of Canada thistle shoots and roots to temperature and photoperiod has
been reviewed [<a href="#151">151</a>]. In general, flowering occurs in response to 15-hour
photoperiods, and low temperature and short photoperiods
(fall) favor root growth more than shoot growth [<a href="#55">55</a>]. The flowering period varies from place to place
and year to year, but
occurs sometime between May and October in North America. The blooming period is longer in northern locales
than in the south [<a href="#162">162</a>]. The flowering periods for some locations are
presented below:</p>

Root carbohydrate reserves follow an annual cycle,
though it is unclear whether root reserve depletion and replenishment are
controlled by environment or plant growth stage. Root carbohydrate reserves
decline at several growth stages in the spring and early summer, and
replenishment occurs only in late summer and fall [<a href="#223">223</a>]. The period of rapid
shoot elongation may correspond to the period when root reserves are lowest
[<a href="#97">97</a>]. Root growth continues in the
fall as long as leaves are present [<a href="#84">84</a>]. Canada thistle emerging in fall tends to form
rosettes with stems that do not elongate to produce flowers prior to killing frosts, whereas shoots
that emerge in spring tend to elongate without forming extensive rosettes [<a href="#55">55</a>]. Seasonal dormancy in Canada thistle is induced by
limiting growth temperatures [<a href="#85">85</a>].

<br />

Canada thistle is adapted to both survive fire on site, and to colonize recently
burned sites with exposed bare soil. The extensive root system gives it the
ability to survive major disturbances as observed, for example, at Mt. St.
Helens, where Canada thistle was part of the initial community after the 1980
eruption. It survived landslide and resprouted from root and stem fragments
after the blast [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>]. Similarly, the roots can survive fires of varying severity and
produce new shoots [<a href="#189">189</a>]. Additionally, there
are numerous examples from the literature where Canada thistle seedlings established
from wind-deposited seed, anywhere from 2 to
9 years after fire [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>,<a href="#191">191</a>,<a href="#220">220</a>,<a href="#243">243</a>].

<p>
 Canada thistle
may change the fire ecology of the site in which it occurs by its abundant,
flammable aboveground biomass. For example, in boreal wet-meadows,
Canada thistle has the potential to increase fire
frequency and perhaps severity as a result of its abundant and readily ignited
litter [<a href="#100">100</a>].</p>

Canada thistle is slightly damaged
to enhanced by fire [<a href="#253">253</a>]. It can survive fire and sprout vegetatively from its extensive
perennial root system [<a href="#189">189</a>], or colonize bare
ground via seedling establishment after fire [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#191">191</a>]. For example, in Yellowstone National Park, Canada thistle is rare in
unburned forests but locally abundant in burned areas [<a href="#48">48</a>]. When
sites supporting Canada thistle are burned, its response is variable, and may be
affected by season of burn, burn severity, site conditions, and plant community
composition and phenology before and after the fire. Existing research provides
no clear correlations with these variables.

 Several studies have indicated the presence of Canada thistle in burned
areas where it was absent from the prefire community and/or adjacent unburned areas
[<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>,<a href="#194">194</a>]. In Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, Canada thistle did not occur in unburned forest
and was not part of the initial postfire vegetation after a mixed-severity
wildfire. It established 2 years after fire on a moderate-severity site, and 9 years
after fire on a severe site. On both sites, it decreased to <u>&lt;</u>1% cover by
postfire year 17 as cover of tree saplings increased [<a href="#56">56</a>]. Seedlings were found
in a red pine forest in
Minnesota, 3 years after fire, but not on adjacent unburned forest [<a href="#3">3</a>]. Canada thistle
established 3 years
after
mixed-severity fires in sedge meadows in Glacier National Park [<a href="#243">243</a>]. In Yellowstone National Park, Canada thistle established after 1988 fires and increased in density over time, 2 to 5 years
after fire, in all burn
severities. Density was lowest in the low-severity burns and highest in the stand-replacing burns [<a href="#220">220</a>]. Canada thistle established on both bulldozer lines and burned areas after a 1988
wildfire in Glacier National Park, but was not present in comparable undisturbed
sites [<a href="#16">16</a>].

<p>Response of established Canada thistle plants to fire
is unclear, as there are mixed reports in the literature. A Canada thistle clone in a mid-boreal wetland site
was not noticeably changed when burned in the spring with a propane torch to
simulate both light and deep burns [<a href="#98">98</a>]. The authors concluded that there is a
moderate to high probability that Canada thistle and other
Eurasian xerophytic species will dominate these wet-meadows in the short term
after fire, and that they will continue to dominate small areas for longer
periods [<a href="#100">100</a>]. There were no significant differences (p&lt;0.05) in Canada thistle cover after spring
burning in the prairie pothole region of Iowa [<a href="#146">146</a>]. In Mesa Verde
National Park, Colorado, populations of Canada thistle that were well established before
an August wildfire resprouted immediately
after the burn, and spread downstream in the canyons. Canada thistle and other
non-native species (e.g., cheatgrass (<i>Bromus tectorum</i>) and musk thistle (<i>Carduus
nutans</i>)) continued to dominate the severely burned areas and
expanded their area by 260% 6 years after the wildfire [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]. In a native mixed-grass prairie in North
Dakota, late-spring and late-summer burning increased seed production and seedling
numbers in Canada thistle, but fewer
thistles were observed during the years following the burn than before or
during the year of the burn [<a href="#202">202</a>]. Dormant season (winter and early spring) burning in eastern Oregon resulted in fewer
total and fewer functional flowerheads on reproductive shoots of Canada thistle
when compared to unburned control. Also, Canada thistle plants on burned sites grew
more slowly and associated vegetation was more productive than on control sites.
It was concluded that burning reduced the relative abundance of Canada thistle and may be useful as a means of
halting its invasion or spread by maintaining a productive stand of native
vegetation [<a href="#253">253</a>]. The discrepancy in these reports is probably due to the
large number of variables that can affect the response of Canada thistle to
fire, including fire severity, for which we lack a standard nomenclature in the
literature. Other important variables include vegetation and site characteristics,
frequency, and season of burning.
</p>

<p>Site differences such as soil moisture content, plant
community, and slope aspect can influence fire severity and may influence the
response of Canada thistle to fire. In a northwestern Minnesota prairie site,
prescribed burning on a nearly level mesic site in badly disturbed prairie had
no effect on Canada thistle flowering while flowering was inhibited on a level,
wet-mesic site in badly
disturbed prairie after burning [<a href="#171">171</a>].
On a forested site in western Montana that was harvested and burned, Canada thistle seems to have increased with
both light and severe burning in the fall, with larger increases on south
aspects compared with others [<a href="#123">123</a>]. Olson [<a href="#163">163</a>] provided evidence
that prescribed burning in the spring either reduced or did not change canopy
cover of Canada thistle in Minnesota. Results differed between sites, which
differed primarily in plant community type and in time and frequency of burning.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Frequency, severity and season of burning may have a
considerable effect on Canada thistle response. In a study conducted on a mesic
tallgrass prairie site in Colorado, plots that were burned frequently (5 times
over 7 years) had lower density of Canada thistle than did and area that was
burned only twice during the same period. Results were inconclusive,
however, since the final season of the study saw increased spread of Canada
thistle from the surrounding area, probably due to clonal growth from existing
plants [<a href="#152">152</a>]. In a prairie site at Pipestone National Monument, Minnesota, 5 years of annual
spring burning in mid- to late April, with fires of low to moderate severity,
reduced the frequency of
Canada thistle over time until it was absent after the 5th year [<a href="#15">15</a>]. Similarly,
observations in tallgrass prairie sites in South Dakota indicate that late spring
prescribed burning (when native species are still dormant) on a 4 to 5 year rotation (as per the historic fire regime)
encourages the growth of native plants and discourages the growth of Canada,
bull and musk thistles. Livestock use must be carefully timed following burning,
since grazing early in the growing season can potentially negate beneficial
effects of prescribed fire [<a href="#44">44</a>]. On a
common reed marsh in Manitoba, Canada thistle response to burning
varied with season of burn. Aboveground biomass, stem density, and seedling
density were unchanged on spring
burns, but increased on both summer and fall burns [<a href="#214">214</a>].

FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>

<br />

Abundant evidence of postfire establishment of
Canada thistle [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>,<a href="#194">194</a>] suggests that managers need to be aware of this possibility,
especially if a known seed source is in the area, and take measures to prevent
the establishment of Canada thistle after prescribed burning and wildfires. Seeding with
aggressive, introduced grasses such as crested wheatgrass, intermediate
wheatgrass, orchardgrass, and smooth brome following a prescribed burn
in Utah pinyon-juniper communities prevented establishment of Canada
thistle, whereas unseeded areas supported Canada thistle seedlings [<a href="#77">77</a>].
Similarly, in disturbed forest sites where Canada thistle becomes established,
it may be shaded out over time as trees reestablish [<a href="#56">56</a>].

<p> Research in this report suggests that response of Canada thistle to fire is
variable and it depends on vegetation and site characteristics, as well as frequency,
severity and season of burning. Prescribed burns may be effective at stimulating
growth of native species and thereby discouraging the growth of invasives such
as Canada thistle [<a href="#183">183</a>], and may be best if timed to emulate the natural fire
regime of a site [<a href="#44">44</a>]. Hutchison [<a href="#105">105</a>] states that prescribed burning is a &quot;preferred treatment&quot; for the control of Canada thistle, and that late spring
burns effectively discourage this species, whereas early spring burns can
increase sprouting and reproduction. During the first 3 years of
control efforts, he recommends that burns be conducted annually [<a href="#105">105</a>]. Season of
burn is an important consideration for prescribed burning, as the timing of the
burn will determine species composition and cover in the post-fire community
[<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>]. Dormant season burning may be a preferred treatment method in some
areas, because in many habitats it stimulates growth of native vegetation that subsequently competes with Canada thistle [<a href="#162">162</a>,<a href="#253">253</a>]. However, dormant
season burning may not be as effective as late spring burning [<a href="#105">105</a>]. Controlled studies comparing the effects of these
variables in different natural areas are currently lacking in the literature.&nbsp;
</p>

<p> 
Equations for estimating fuel loading of forb communities including Canada
thistle are available [<a href="#27">27</a>].
</p>

<p>The USDA Forest Service's &quot;Guide to Noxious Weed
Prevention Practices&quot; [<a href="#225">225</a>] provides several fire management
considerations for weed prevention in general that apply to Canada thistle. To prevent
invasion after wildfires and prescribed burns, re-establish vegetation on bare ground as soon as possible using
either natural recovery or artificial techniques as appropriate to site
objectives. When reseeding burn areas, use only certified weed-free seed. Monitor
burn sites and associated disturbed areas after the fire and the following spring for emergence of
Canada thistle, and treat to eradicate any emergent Canada thistle plants.
Regulate
human, pack animal, and livestock entry into burned areas at risk for weed
invasion until desirable site vegetation has recovered sufficiently to resist weed
invasion. 
</p>

When planning a prescribed burn,
preinventory the project area and evaluate cover and phenology of any Canada
thistle present on or adjacent to the site, and avoid ignition and burning in areas at high risk
for Canada thistle establishment or spread due to fire effects. Avoid creating soil conditions that promote weed
germination and establishment. Discuss weed status
and risks in burn rehabilitation plans. Wildfire managers might consider
including weed prevention education and providing weed identification
aids during fire training; avoiding known weed
infestations when locating fire lines, monitoring camps, staging areas,
helibases, etc., to be sure they are kept weed free; taking care that equipment is weed free;
incorporating weed prevention into fire rehabilitation plans; and acquiring restoration
funding. Additional guidelines and specific recommendations and requirements are
available [<a href="#225">225</a>].

The study area is a mesic herbaceous community dominated by creeping wildrye (<i>Elymus
triticoides</i>). Associated vegetation includes Douglas sedge (<i>Carex
douglasii</i>), Baltic rush (<i>Juncus balticus </i>var.<i> montanus</i>),
Sandberg bluegrass (<i>Poa secunda</i>), and a diverse mixture of other
graminoids and forbs. Populations of Canada thistle (<i>Cirsium arvense</i>), ranging from scattered
shoots to dense patches, occur throughout the study area. Canada thistle was the
dominant or codominant species on each of the study sites.

Both the winter (10 December) and spring (7 April) burns were conducted when
weather was cool (36 to 43 degrees Fahrenheit (2-6 &deg;C)) with moderate to high relative humidity
(38-53%) and
steady, light winds (2.4 to 7.2 mi/hr (4-12 km/h)). Fuels were abundant (averaging
473-644g/m<sup>2</sup>) and
continuous and produced uniform, steadily advancing fires. Fire intensities of
the winter and spring burns were 1,004 kW/m and 4,465 kW/m, respectively. Both
burns consumed virtually all aboveground plant residues, leaving only white ash.

Newly emerged rosettes of Canada thistle were noted on 5 April after the 10
December burn. Height and development over the remainder of the
season was not discernibly different between winter and spring burns. Growth on
burned plots was not different from controls until 21 June, when control plants
were significantly taller (p&lt;0.05). Bud formation in burn treatments was
delayed by 1-2 weeks, and most flowerheads were aborted, resulting in the production of
few functional flowers (&gt;10%) on the burns, compared with &gt;45% functional
flowers on control. Shoots on control sites were still significantly taller than
those on burn sites on 8 August. Total shoot density was more than 2
times greater on burn plots compared with control. Number of reproductive shoots
was similar between burned and control plots, therefore the difference was
attributed to the greater number of vegetative shoots on the burn plots. Total
aboveground herbage production was greater on burned plots and was attributed to
increased production by the associated vegetation in the burned areas. Burning
altered the population structure of Canada thistle to a higher density of smaller shoots.&nbsp;

<br />

Prescribed burning during the dormant season did not decrease biomass of Canada
thistle and, therefore, may not be effective in eliminating&nbsp;it where it
has become established in these plant communities. Fire did, however, reduce the
relative abundance of Canada thistle within these communities, as well as the
potential for spreading by seed. Canada thistle may be slowed or contained by
prescribed burning under these conditions. The treatment warrants further study
as a potential control measure.
