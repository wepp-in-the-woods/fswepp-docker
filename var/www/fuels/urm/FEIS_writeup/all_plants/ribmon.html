<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ribes montigenum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
The fruit of Ribes spp. is a valuable food source for songbirds,
chipmunks, ground squirrels, and other animals [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Gooseberry currant is not very palatable to livestock [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].  In
Ephraim Canyon on the Wasatch Plateau, Utah, domestic sheep browsed
gooseberry currant only a little or not at all.  Observations were made
in a 9-acre pasture for 2 consecutive years in July while a variety of
other forage species were available [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Dittberner and Olson [<a href="#8">8</a>] rate
the palatability of gooseberry currant in Utah as poor for cattle and
horses and good for sheep.


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Currants (Ribes spp.) contain high concentrations of mono- and
disaccharides [<a href="#48">48</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Cover values for gooseberry currant are as follows [<a href="#8">8</a>]:

                              UT            WY
Pronghorn                    poor          poor
Elk                          poor          poor 
Mule deer                    poor          fair 
White-tailed deer            ----          poor
Small mammals                fair          good
Small nongame birds          fair          good
Upland game birds            fair          good
Waterfowl                    poor          poor


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Gooseberry currant can be used to revegetate disturbed mountain areas.
Plummer [<a href="#47">47</a>] rated the suitability of gooseberry currant for restoring
high-elevation mountain environments as follows:

        seed establishment			good
        transplant establishment		very good
        seed production	                        medium
        natural seed spread			medium
        vegetative spread			good
        growth rate				medium
        soil stability				good
        adaptation to disturbance		good


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Currants (Ribes spp.) can be used for making jam, jelly, or pie [<a href="#28">28</a>].
Some western Indian tribes used currants for making pemmican [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Gooseberry currant is an alternate host for white pine blister rust
(Cronartium ribicola) which infests five-needled pines.  Because of
their association with the rust, Ribes spp. have been the targets of
various eradication efforts; however, these efforts have not been
successful in the western states [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ribes montigenum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Gooseberry currant is a native, deciduous shrub growing from 0.6 to 3.3
feet (0.2-1 m) tall.  Its many low, straggling branches are bristly.
The orbicular, five-lobed leaves are 0.4 to 1.6 inches (1-4 cm) long, at
least as wide, and glandular-pubescent on both sides.  Drooping racemes
are three- to eight-flowered.  The smooth, globose berries are 0.2 to
0.4 inch (5-10 mm) in diameter and contain numerous seeds
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Gooseberry currant reproduces vegetatively and by seed.

Neither the root system of gooseberry currant nor its ability to sprout
from the root crown after fire or disturbance is described in the
literature; however, on the Wasatch Plateau, Utah, Ellison [<a href="#11">11</a>] observed
gooseberry currant forming adventitous roots.  Decumbent outer branches
partially covered by earth were rooting.  The plants were spreading
outward and dying in the center, forming a clonal ring.  The rings were
sometimes 15 to 20 feet (4.5-6.1 m) in diameter.

Ribes spp. generally begin fruiting after 3 years [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Many seeds fall
beneath the parent plant; they are also dispersed by birds and animals.
Fallen seeds of Ribes spp. may remain viable in the soil and duff for
many years [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].

Mineral soil and scarification generally enhance germination in Ribes
spp. [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  In the labortory, a 53 percent germination was
obtained without scarification by stratifying gooseberry currant seeds
at 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 deg C) for 200 to 300 days.  Seeds were
stratified and germinated in sand moistened with nutrient solution [<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Gooseberry currant occurs on a variety of sites.  It is found in dry,
rocky places from the middle subalpine zone to timberline, sometimes
extending into alpine communities.  It grows on open, talus or scree
slopes, on ridges, and in boulder fields, meadows, and forests
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  It may also occur along streams and in wet forests,
ravines, and washes [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Gooseberry currant occurs on loamy or
clayey soils that contain gravel [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  In northern Utah, habitat
types in which gooseberry currant occurs have an average litter depth of
1.2 to 2.9 inches (3-7.4 cm) [<a href="#23">23</a>].  In central Idaho, average litter
depth where gooseberry currant occurs may reach 2 inches (5 cm) [<a href="#40">40</a>].

Where gooseberry currant occurs in the Engelmann spruce (Picea
engelmanii)-bristlecone pine (Pinus aristata) series in New Mexico,
climate is at the cold extreme for forests.  The mean annual air
temperature is 34 to 36 degrees Fahrenheit (1-2 deg C), and the mean
soil temperature is 33 to 34 degrees Fahrenheit (1 deg C).  The growing
season for forest plants is less than 110 days [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Elevational ranges for gooseberry currant are as follows:
	
        		            feet		  meters
California [<a href="#17">17</a>]			6,930-15,840	        2,100-4,800	
Colorado [<a href="#16">16</a>]		        7,500-11,500            2,273-3,485
central Idaho [<a href="#40">40</a>]		8,400- 9,800            2,545-2,970
Utah [<a href="#45">45</a>]			7,046-12,078		2,135-3,660


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Gooseberry currant is somewhat shade tolerant.  It grows in dense
forests with few canopy openings, but it occurs most often and grows
most vigorously on sites without forest canopy.  In the Big Horn
Mountains of Wyoming, gooseberry currant occurred in the understory of
spruce (Picea spp.)-fir (Abies spp.) forests but its average cover was
less than 1 percent [<a href="#7">7</a>].  In the Crested Butte area of west-central
Colorado, gooseberry currant was the most common tall shrub in dense
spruce-fir forests, occurring throughout the understory with a constancy
of 72 percent and an average cover of 4 percent.  In canopy openings it
formed thickets [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Near timberline in Colorado and Utah, gooseberry
currant formed a dense fringe around spruce and fir "tree islands"
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Gooseberry currant flowers from late June to August [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Fruit
ripens from August to September [<a href="#28">28</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ribes montigenum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
The fire ecology of gooseberry currant is not described in the
literature.  Although many authors discuss the effect of fire on Ribes
spp., most refer to studies conducted by Quick [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Quick described
postfire seedling establishment by Sierra Nevada gooseberry (R. roezli).

Gooseberry currant regeneration is probably favored by fire because
scarification of soil-stored seed generally enhances germination in
Ribes spp. [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  The ability of gooseberry currant to sprout from
the root crown after fire is described in the literature as "variable"
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ribes montigenum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire probably kills most gooseberry currant.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
In New Mexico spruce-fir forests and Utah tall shrub communities,
gooseberry currant was described as a dominant early seral species after
fire [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].  The origin of gooseberry currant (seedlings or sprouts) in
postfire communities was not described.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In south-central Colorado quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides)/gooseberry
currant communities may be prescribe burned in the fall to encourage
quaking aspen regeneration.  Many of the community's undergrowth plants
have high or moderate fire resistance and a postfire community "quickly"
resembles the prefire one [<a href="#29">29</a>].
