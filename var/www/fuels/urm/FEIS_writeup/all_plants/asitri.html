<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Asimina triloba
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Pawpaw wood is light, soft, coarse-grained, and weak [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  It is not
of economic importance.


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Pawpaw fruits are consumed by many birds and mammals, including
raccoons, gray foxes, opossums, squirrels, and black bears [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].
White-tailed deer browse pawpaw; beavers consume the bark [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Pawpaw fruit can be consumed by humans, although handling the fruit may
cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals [<a href="#28">28</a>].  The fruits can
be eaten raw, cooked in puddings or breads, or used to make ice cream
[<a href="#9">9</a>].  It is planted for fruit production and as an ornamental [<a href="#2">2</a>].

An anticancer drug has been purified from pawpaw, and is being tested [<a href="#34">34</a>].

The seeds contain an alkaloid, asiminine, which is reported to have
emetic properties.  The bark also contains an alkaloid, analobine, and
was once used as a medicine [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Pawpaw is not valued for silvicuture.  Sites that have been clearcut may
need to be treated to suppress pawpaw, since it may outcompete valued
timber species [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Pawpaw creates heavy shade that reduces seedling
recruitment of white oak (Quercus alba) and shagbark hickory (Carya
ovata) [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  In southwestern Illinois, an increase in pawpaw cover
was attributed to defoliation of overstory trees by the linden looper.
The pawpaw canopy suppressed seedling establishment of less tolerant
species.  An increase in shade-tolerant species such as sugar maple
(Acer saccharum) is now occurring [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

In Ohio, pawpaw did not occur on study plots until the fourth growing
season following clearcutting [<a href="#35">35</a>].

Pawpaw leaves are not preferred by the gypsy moth [<a href="#14">14</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Asimina triloba
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Pawpaw is a native, deciduous, large shrub or small tree.  It exhibits
clonal growth, forming thickets or small colonies [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  It grows
from 20 to 40 feet (6-12 m) tall [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  There is usually a single
trunk [<a href="#28">28</a>].  The bark is thin with shallow, irregular fissures [<a href="#28">28</a>].
Young twigs are hairy [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Pawpaw leaves can be up to 1 foot (30 cm)
long, and are odorous when bruised [<a href="#17">17</a>].  The fruit is a large berry
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>

Vegetative reproduction by root suckering is the most important method
of pawpaw regeneration [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Rogstad and others [<a href="#25">25</a>] reported a
relatively high level of genetic variation among populations, but
moderate or no variation within populations.  This was attributed to the
formation of clonal thickets and/or inbreeding in small populations [<a href="#25">25</a>].

Pawpaw reproduces sexually, however, the rate of fruit set is very low
(0.45 percent) compared to the number of flowers produced [<a href="#33">33</a>].  It is
pollinated by flies or nitidulid beetles [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  It
self-pollinates, but outcrossing is more common [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Germination of
pawpaw seeds is slow, probably due to embryo dormancy [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Pawpaw is found in deciduous forests, on slopes of ravines, along
streams, and floodplains.  Soils on which it occurs are usually deep,
rich, damp, sandy, or clayey [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].

Common tree associates include blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), Ohio buckeye
(Aesculus glabra), honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthus), and coffee tree
(Gymnocladus dioica) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Pawpaw is tolerant of shade, but appears to die out in old-growth
forests.  In southwestern Pennsylvania, moderate numbers of pawpaw
seedlings and saplings were found in mature second-growth forests, but
none were found in undisturbed, old-growth forests [<a href="#7">7</a>].  

From a compilation of historical records and current data on its
distribution, Campbell [<a href="#3">3</a>] concluded that pawpaw is suited to regimes of
moderate disturbance.  Pawpaw is a good competitor when undisturbed for
a period of time, but does not spread into either early- or
late-successional forest types [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Pawpaw flowers emerge with the leaves, from February to May, depending
on latitude [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Fruits ripen from July to September [<a href="#17">17</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Asimina triloba

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Pawpaw is probably able to survive top-kill by fire due to its ability
to produce root sprouts.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>

   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>



<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Pawpaw cover is probably reduced by fire.  In a study to determine the
effects of repeated prescribed fires on vegetation in the
prairie-woodland transition zone, fires were conducted for 3 consecutive
years.  The vegetation was monitored for almost 20 years after the last
fire was conducted.  Pawpaw stems increased in number only in the
absence of fire, and only after 13 years had passed since the last fire [<a href="#1">1</a>].
