<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Sweet grass usually grows among other grasses or shrubs; it is seldom
found in pure stands [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Sweet grass occurs in north-central Alberta in the wheatgrass (Agropyron
spp., sensu latu)-sedge (Carex spp.) community in low, moist areas.
Associated species include slender wheatgrass (Elymus trachycaulus),
slough sedge (Carex atherodes), false-melic (Schizachne purpurascens),
brome (Bromus spp.), reed grass (Calamagrostis spp.), meadow sedge
(Carex praticola), and American vetch (Vicia americana).  This community
is within the wheatgrass-needlegrass (Stipa spp.) association [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Associates of sweet grass in the meadow stage of succession on glacial
gravel outwash terraces in south-central Alaska include boreal wildrye
(Leymus innovatus), altai fescue (Festuca altaica), bluegrass (Poa
spp.), Sierra larkspur (Delphinium glaucum), monkshood (Aconitum
delphinifolium), and northern goldenrod (Solidago multiradiata).  A
nearly continuous moss mat, primarily of mountain fern moss (Hylocomium
splendens), grows under this vegetation [<a href="#32">32</a>].

Associates of sweet grass in a meadow on the banks of the Churchill
River on the Hudson Bay Lowlands in northeastern Manitoba include red
fescue (Festuca rubra), alkali grass (Puccinellia paupercula), aster
(Aster puniceus var. firmus), bittercress (Cardamine pratensis), mud
sedge (Carex limosa), parnassia (Parnassia multiseta), lomatogonium
(Lomatogonium rotatum), and plantain (Plantago maritima).  Sweet grass
is one of the most important grasses of this community [<a href="#26">26</a>].

rhizome development [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>

Dried sweet grass foliage is fragrant because of its coumarin content
[<a href="#10">10</a>] and is used as incense and in making perfume [<a href="#5">5</a>].  The long leaves
of sterile shoots are used by Native Americans in making baskets
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Sweet grass has religious significance to some Native
American peoples [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Sweet grass tea was used for coughs and sore throats, to treat chapping
and windburn, and as an eyewash.  It was strewn before church doors on
saints' days in northern Europe [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Sweet grass does not have dense enough growth for turf [<a href="#20">20</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Hierochloe odorata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sweet grass is a native, rhizomatous perennial grass [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].
Rhizomes are slender and creeping [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Culms are hollow, erect [<a href="#11">11</a>],
and 8 to 24 inches (20-60 cm) tall [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>]; they arise from among
the dead foliage of the previous year [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Cauline leaves are few
and short; leaves of sterile shoots are 4 to 12 inches (10-30 cm) long
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  The inflorescence is an open pyramidal panicle 1.6 to 4.7
inches (4-12 cm) long, with slender branches [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Spikelets are
three-flowered [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>]; lemmas are awnless [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  The fruit is a
caryopsis [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Rhizomes and roots form a dense mat beneath the soil
surface [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sweet grass spreads vigorously [<a href="#9">9</a>] by creeping rhizomes which are often
fairly deep [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  It also reproduces by seed [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  However,
sweetgrass is largely infertile [<a href="#34">34</a>]; it produces relatively few
seedheads, and these contain few seeds [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sweet grass occurs in wet meadows [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>], low prairies [<a href="#22">22</a>], the
edges of sloughs and marshes [<a href="#11">11</a>], bogs [<a href="#15">15</a>], shaded streambanks [<a href="#10">10</a>],
lakeshores [<a href="#34">34</a>], and cool mountain canyons [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Sweet grass grows on moist, heavy soil near the upper areas of the tidal
marshes around the coast of Nova Scotia [<a href="#27">27</a>].  It occurs on granular
calcareous soil from glacial river deposits on the Churchill River
estuary in northeastern Manitoba [<a href="#26">26</a>].  In northeastern Alberta,
sweet grass occurs on well-drained loamy soil with heavy clay subsoil; pH
is 4.7 near the surface and increases with depth [<a href="#25">25</a>].  It occurs on
coarse river gravel terraces covered by a 2-inch (5-cm) layer of organic
material (pH 6.0) along the McKinley River in south-central Alaska [<a href="#32">32</a>].

Sweet grass has been reported at the following elevations:

                     Feet            Meters

   Alaska          730-3,281        223-1,000  [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>]
   Arizona           7,000            2,134    [<a href="#19">19</a>]
   California        6,000            1,830    [<a href="#14">14</a>]
   Colorado      7,500-11,500     2,286-3,505  [<a href="#12">12</a>]
   Utah          6,990-11,485     2,130-3,500  [<a href="#34">34</a>]


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Sweet grass is usually found in mid-successional communities.  It can
withstand some soil disturbance.

Sweet grass was a major component of the meadow zone just above high
water on the Churchill River in northeastern Manitoba.  This was the
earliest closed-cover successional community on the flats.  Sweet grass
was not present in later successional zones [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Sweet grass was a minor component of undisturbed and disturbed dry
grassland sites in northeastern Alberta.  Disturbance by vehicle traffic
and bison had caused soil compaction and erosion [<a href="#25">25</a>].

Sweet grass was a component of a wheatgrass-sedge community in
north-central Alberta which had succeeded a marsh community [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Sweet grass was a minor component of the meadow stage of succession on
gravel outwash terraces in south-central Alaska.  It was not present in
earlier or later stages [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
In spring, creeping rhizomes of sweet grass produce inconspicuous
fruiting culms with leaves that are few and short [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Somewhat later,
long leaves develop from separate sterile basal off-shoots [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Culms
shrivel soon after flowering [<a href="#7">7</a>].

In southwestern Saskatchewan, sweet grass first flowered, on the
average, on June 2 (recorded over 6 years), the earliest date being May
17, and the latest June 22.  The mean number of days in flower was 28
[<a href="#3">3</a>].

Sweet grass is among the earliest flowering of Alaskan grasses.
Seedheads are formed in autumn and remain small and hidden through
winter in the new growing shoots, which elongate the following spring.
Seedheads appear early in May, almost as soon as the grass begins spring
growth.  Anthesis occurs near May 20, and seed is ripe from late July to
early August [<a href="#20">20</a>].

The following sweet grass flowering dates have been reported:

              Alaska            late May         [<a href="#20">20</a>]
              Arizona           June-July        [<a href="#19">19</a>]
              Michigan          spring           [<a href="#33">33</a>]

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Hierochloe odorata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Sweetgrass has creeping rhizomes which are often fairly deep [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>] and
which may sprout after aerial portions are burned.  Culms arise from
among dead foliage of the preceding year [<a href="#7">7</a>].  This foliage may protect
basal buds from fire damage in the spring when moisture content of dead
foliage is high.  But in fall, it is more likely that the buds would be
damaged by heat produced when the dried foliage burns.

<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Sweet grass is a member of some meadow communities succeeded by forest
in the absence of disturbance.  Fire exclusion from these communities
may favor other species over sweet grass.
