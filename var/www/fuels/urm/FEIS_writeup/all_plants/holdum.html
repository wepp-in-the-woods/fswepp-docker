<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The fully documented scientific name of bush oceanspray is Holodiscus
dumosus (Nutt.) Heller.  The taxonomy presented here follows that of
Welsh and others [<a href="#36">36</a>].  These authors take a conservative approach to
recognizing infraspecific taxa within this complex, indicating that most
variation appears to reflect ecological rather than genetic differences.
Holodiscus microphyllus, an entity occurring in montane habitats from
Oregon to California [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>], has been included within Holodiscus
dumosus [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Bush oceanspray has been used as an indicator of climax conditions on
rocky sites in both nonforested and forested communities throughout its
range.  A bush oceanspray shrubland series has been described for steep,
talus slopes in Colorado; habitat types include bush oceanspray/Thurber
fescue (Festuca thurberi) and bush oceanspray/wax current (Ribes cereum)
[<a href="#17">17</a>].  In the Pacific Northwest, Erhard [<a href="#7">7</a>] has described a curlleaf
mountain-mahogany/bush oceanspray (Cercocarpus ledifolius/Holodiscus
microphyllus var. glabrescens) habitat type associated with basalt lava
flows.  Along the east slope of the Cascades in Oregon, Hopkins and
Kovalchik [<a href="#16">16</a>] have described a western juniper/big sagebrush-bush
oceanspray/bluebunch wheatgrass-arrowleaf (Juniperus occidentalis/
Artemisia tridentata-Holodiscus dumosa/Pseudoroegneria spicata-
Balsamorhiza sagittata) community type.

On high-elevation sites in the southern Rocky Mountains, bush oceanspray
is listed as the understory dominant in forested scree habitat types
within the white fir (Abies concolor), alpine fir (A. lasiocarpa), and
Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menzeisii) series; it is also utilized as a
phase indicator in the following Southwestern forested habitat types
[<a href="#1">1</a>]:

     white fir/big tooth maple (Acer grandidentatum)
     white fir/Rocky mountain maple (A. glabrum)
     white fir/Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii)
     Douglas-fir/Gambel oak

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Holodiscus dumosus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Bush oceanspray is generally unpalatable to the majority of livestock
and big game [<a href="#32">32</a>].  It increases in response to grazing on western
juniper/big sagebrush habitat types in eastern Oregon [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Since this
species is typically distributed on the summer ranges of most animals,
Ferguson [<a href="#10">10</a>] suggests that bush oceanspray is not an extensively
utilized browse plant.  In southern Colorado, however, bush oceanspray
comprises a portion of the summer diet of bighorn sheep [<a href="#31">31</a>].



<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Bush oceanspray is generally unpalatable to both livestock and big game
[<a href="#32">32</a>].  However, it comprised an average relative density of 10 percent
of the summer diet of bighorn sheep populations in southern Colorado.
Plants are utilized by a variety of small bird species [<a href="#30">30</a>], and also by
rabbits in California [<a href="#34">34</a>].  The palatability of bush oceanspray to
livestock and wildlife species in several western states has been rated
as follows [<a href="#5">5</a>]:

                       CO       UT       WY

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Bush oceanspray has been rated as fair in both energy and protein value
[<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The degree to which bush oceanspray provides environmental protection
during one or more seasons for wildlife species has been rated as
follows [<a href="#5">5</a>]:

                        CO      UT      WY

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Bush oceanspray appears to be an excellent candidate for use in the
reclamation of disturbed sites within its range.  Plants are naturally
capable of establishing and persisting on rather severe, rocky sites
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>] and are also extremely drought tolerant [<a href="#28">28</a>].  In additon, this
species is adapted to sites with unstable, shifting surface materials;
it is often the dominant species on sites characterized by moving screes
in both nonforested [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>] and forested [<a href="#4">4</a>] communities.  Despite such
attributes, bush oceanspray has not been widely used in rehabilitation
projects, primarily due to a scarcity of commercially available seed
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Other factors contributing to problems in the culture of
the Holodiscus genus include:  (1) a pronounced seed dormancy and (2)
low production of viable seed [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Stickney [<a href="#29">29</a>] reported that
germination of oceanspray (Holodiscus discolor) is enhanced following
stratification at 41 degrees Fahrenheit (15 deg C) for 18 weeks.
Although plants can be successfully established via fall broadcast
seeding, nursery culture from fall-sown seed appears to be a more
reliable means of propagation; fall-planted bareroot stock is generally
quite hardy [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Propagating Holodiscus accessions via stem cuttings
has been unsuccessful in Nevada [<a href="#8">8</a>].

The adaptability of bush oceanspray to high-elevation mountain sites has
been rated as follows [<a href="#26">26</a>]:

Adaptational attribute             Rating (1-5)
----------------------             --------------

Soil stablility                     good (4)
Adaptation to disturbance           good (4)


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
East of the Cascade Range, bush oceanspray is planted as a showy
ornamental shrub [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>]; plants are often preferred to oceanspray due
to their more compact growth form [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Indigenous peoples used the
extremely hard wood of this shrub to make arrows and digging sticks;
pioneers used it to make nails [<a href="#16">16</a>].  The "berries" were once gathered
as food by Indian tribes inhabiting the Great Basin [<a href="#2">2</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Holodiscus dumosus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bush oceanspray is a moderately long-lived, native, deciduous,
drought-tolerant shrub that typically ranges from 20 to 60 inches
(25-150 cm) in height [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  Plants are densely to intricately
branched from the base.  The majority of the foliage originates on spur
branches with leaves in fasicles of six or seven [<a href="#14">14</a>].  The root system
is fibrous and spreading [<a href="#28">28</a>].  This species is characteristically found
in large clumps [<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Information on the regenerative processes of bush oceanspray is scant.
Plummer [<a href="#26">26</a>] reported that this species possessed an above average
capacity to spread naturally via wind-dispersed seed on disturbed sites
in Utah; however, seedling establishment is rated as only average.  Bush
oceanspray has a high resistance to disturbance, but modes of vegetative
regeneration have not been widely documented or described.  For a
description of the regeneration processes of a morphologically and
ecologically similar ally, see the FEIS write-up for oceanspray
(Holodiscus discolor).


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bush oceanspray is most often associated with dry, rocky habitats [<a href="#32">32</a>].
In the Great Basin this shrub is ubiquitous in numerous plant
communities from desert valleys to areas well up in the mountains [<a href="#14">14</a>];
it is most abundant at elevations between 4,500 and 11,000 feet (1,372
and 3,354 m) [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Typical sites include rocky outcrops, slickrock
plateau margins, bases of cliffs, talus slopes, and steep, canyon walls
[<a href="#36">36</a>].  Soils are dry to moderately dry, and well drained; textures range
from sand to clay [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Plants appear somewhat tolerant of alkaine
soils.

Elevational ranges vary as follows [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>]:

        from 6,800 to 10,000 feet (2,073-3,049 m) in AZ
             5,500 to 11,000 feet (1,677-3,354 m) in CA
             5,500 to 10,000 feet (1,677-3,049 m) in CO
             7,200 to 8,500 feet (2,195-2,591 m) in NM
             2,500 to 3,000 feet (726-915 m) in OR
             4,198 to 12,000 feet (1,280-3,659 m) in UT
             6,500 to 8,200 feet (1,982-2,500 m) in WY


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Self-perpetuating stands of bush oceanspray are indicative of climax
conditions on rocky sites in both nonforested and forested communities
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  This species is a pioneer on young lavas in southern Idaho.
Plants establish during early seral stages and coexist with later
arriving species that are also adapted to such severe site conditions
[<a href="#6">6</a>].  Bush oceanspray is a component of seral brushfields that develop
following fire on white fir/Rocky Mountain maple/bush oceanspray sites
in New Mexico [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  However, it is unclear whether postburn coverages
are derived via residual plant survival or from seedling establishment.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Bush oceanspray generally begins blooming in June at lower elevations in
the Great Basin, but on sites at the upper limits of its elevational
range, plants may not flower until August [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Anthesis data for
several western states are as follows [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>]:

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Holodiscus dumosus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
The fire ecology and fire adaptations of bush oceanspray are poorly
documented.  Fire is reported to be the principal factor initiating
succession on many of the high-elevation sites occupied by this shrub in
the Southwest [<a href="#12">12</a>], and bush oceanspray is apparently able to maintain
itself into late successional stage on many of these rocky, forested
sites [<a href="#1">1</a>].

It is currently unknown whether postfire reestablishment is from
sprouting from surviving plants, or from on-site or off-site seed
sources, or both.  In the White Mountains of New Mexico, bush oceanspray
was a conspicuous componenet of the shrub layer 2 to 3 years after fire
[<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)
   Small shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
The effect of fire on bush oceanspray is poorly documented.  The
intricately branched nature of this shrub suggests that most plants are
readily top-killed by relatively low-intensity fires.
