<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted name of common woodsorrel is Oxalis montana Raf.,
in the woodsorrel family (Oxalidaceae).  There are no recognized
subspecies or varieties.  Common woodsorrel is closely related to the
European species Oxalis acetosella.  Some earlier authors included
common woodsorrel as a variety of O. acetosella [<a href="#10">10</a>].  However, common
woodsorrel currently is recognized as a distinct species.  Two forms
based on flower color are infrequently used [<a href="#10">10</a>]:

        O. m. f. montana
        O. m. f. rhodantha Fern.

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Common woodsorrel is a dominant understory species in red spruce (Picea
rubens) and balsam or Fraser fir (Abies balsamea or A. fraseri) forests
of the Appalachian Mountains, which are part of the boreal forest
formation [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Common woodsorrel is an indicator for several forest
habitat types or site types in the balsam and Fraser fir phases
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].

Common woodsorrel is dominant in the northern hardwoods forest, red or
sugar maple-yellow birch-American beech (Acer rubrum or A.
saccharum-Betula lutea-Fagus grandifolia) [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  It is also a dominant
species in the transition plant associations between the boreal forest
and the northern hardwoods [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  It is a minor component of the
riparian communities in the northern hardwood forests [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Common woodsorrel is subdominant in seral communities of black cherry
(Prunus serotina)-red maple [<a href="#36">36</a>].  In northern Wisconsin, common
woodsorrel is a dominant forb in the association of eastern
hemlock-false lily-of-the-valley-goldthread (Tsuga
canadensis-Maianthemum canadense-Coptis groenlandica) [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  In white
cedar (Thuja occidentalis) communities, common woodsorrel is a minor
component with a corresponding low importance value of 0.4 [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Frequent herbaceous codominants are false lily-of-the-valley,
goldthread, starflower (Trientalis borealis), and woodferns (Dryopteris
spp.) [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
While common woodsorrel has not been investigated, other members of the
woodsorrel family (Oxalis pes-capre and O. corniculata) form
concentrations of soluble oxalates lethal to livestock under specific
grazing conditions [<a href="#18">18</a>].

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Common woodsorrel is a soil stabilizer; it has extensive clonal growth
and the ability to grow on steep ground, poor soil, and in deep shade
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].

In a Canadian northern hardwood-boreal transition forest, disturbed
ground was mulched to suppress red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) growth [<a href="#16">16</a>].
Common woodsorrel appeared during the second growing season, despite the
oat (Avena sativa) mulch.  Because only plants with 10 percent or
greater cover were recorded, it is likely that common woodsorrel was
present the first year in low amounts [<a href="#16">16</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Oxalis montana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Common woodsorrel is a native woodland perennial with well-developed
clonal growth [<a href="#1">1</a>].  It is a small evergreen plant (less than 4 inches
[10 cm] high) that has scaley rhizomes [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Common woodsorrel does not
have a main stem.  Leaves, with three cloverlike leaflets, are basal.
The fruit is a round capsule [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Reproduction usually involves episodes of seedling recruitment as a
result of disturbance, such as fire and logging, followed by long
periods of vegetative clonal growth [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Common woodsorrel forms
extensive colonies in boreal spruce-fir forests; however, its colonies
rarely exceed several feet in diameter in the northern hardwood forests
[<a href="#35">35</a>].

Common woodsorrel reproduces both sexually and asexually.  Asexual
flowers (cleistogamous) produce greater amounts of seed compared to
sexual flowers [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Total fruit set per plant is low because there is
only one flower per stalk, with a recorded maximum of 34 flowers per
plant [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Mature capsules dehisce seeds forcefully, flinging them
outward from the plant [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Common woodsorrel has wide ecologic amplitude and occurs commonly
throughout the northern hardwood and spruce-fir (Picea rubens-Abies
basalmea) forests of the Appalachian Mountains [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Some authors have
stated that common woodsorrel occurrence is not correlated with any
particular suite of site features [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

Common woodsorrel is on the glaciated uplands of the Canadian shield
[<a href="#24">24</a>].  The shallow soils are sandy loams to loamy tills [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Saturated
soils may be poor to moderately well-drained [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].  However, soils are
generally poorly developed and often consist only of an organic mat on
top of bedrock [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Soil pH is strongly to moderately acidic
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  Common woodsorrel occurs on level to steep slopes and any
aspect [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Plants occur at 500 feet (152 m) in Maine coastal forests
to 5,000 feet (1,524 m) in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].

The growing season throughout its range is from 110 to 140 days and is
cool with ample moisture [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Snowpack in the subalpine zones can
extend from November to May [<a href="#31">31</a>].  The average annual temperatures are
less than 60 degrees Fahrenheit (16 deg C) [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Average annual
precipitation is 90 to 140 inches (2,286-3,556 mm) per year [<a href="#5">5</a>].  The
moisture regime is perhumid to humid [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Rainfall is equitable in all
summer months.  Fog drip from evergreen needles increases precipitation
amounts [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Moss coverage can be low to high, and very high fern coverage reduces
common woodsorrel populations [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Associated understory species
include lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium), witherod (Viburnum
cassinoides), hobblebush (Viburnum alnifolium), and bunchberry (Cornus
canadensis) [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Overstory species also include white ash
(Fraxinus americana) and paper birch (Betula papyrifera) [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Climax Species

Common woodsorrel is a climax understory species.  It is a tolerant
species under mature fir canopy [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Common woodsorrel is present
in, although not characteristic of, early or mid- seral stages in New
England's northern hardwood or spruce-fir boreal forests [<a href="#35">35</a>].
Disturbance occurs as severe winds, hurricanes, and fire [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Plant growth mainly occurs before flowers are out [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Sexual flowers
on common woodsorrel bloom from late May to August throughout its range
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  In a population, the flowering period lasts approximately 30
days with individual flowers open for about five days [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Fruits
mature in about 12 days, requiring warm days before dehiscence [<a href="#14">14</a>].
Seed is shed from June to September throughout its range [<a href="#14">14</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Oxalis montana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Burning conditions are usually poor in the spruce-fir boreal forests in
which common woodsorrel grows due to the presence of water throughout
the year [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Droughts can make the areas more susceptible to fire.
Fires may occur in the southern boreal forests every 50 to 150 years,
and in the northern boreal forests, fire frequencies are every 100 to
300 years [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Common woodsorrel fire survival strategy is that of a perennial with
underground rhizomes; surviving rhizomes sprout.  However, it often
grows in humus on bedrock in spruce-fir forests [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  The organic
layer does not give much protection from fire.  No information was found
about common woodsorrel seed surviving fire.

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Oxalis montana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
No fire studies have been done on common woodsorrel.  Fire would
top-kill this plant.  Growing in mainly organic or shallow soils, its
rhizomes probably would not survive a fire of moderate severity.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Surviving rhizomes will sprout.  Existing patches can expand to colonize
open areas.  Vegetative reproduction allows the population flexibility
in initiating or stopping plant development.  Since common woodsorrel
can reproduce by asexual flowers, seed set is highly probable, despite a
possible low initial population size.  Dissemination by explosive
dehiscence provides the ability to colonize open disturbed areas.  When
open ground has closed with vegetation, common woodsorrel colonies will
continue to expand by rhizome growth (see SUCCESSIONAL STATUS).
