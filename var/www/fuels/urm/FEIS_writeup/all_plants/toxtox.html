<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name for eastern poison-oak is
Toxicodendron toxicarium (Salisb.) Gillis (Anacardiaceae) [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  This
taxon is often confused in the literature with eastern poison-ivy (T.
radicans), with which it has shared the synonym Rhus toxicodendron.  A
source of confusion over identification arises from sexual dimorphism in
eastern poison-oak; male clones produce leaflets with deeper, more
pronounced lobes than do female clones [<a href="#8">8</a>].  This report follows the
nomenclature of Gillis [<a href="#8">8</a>], who appears to have resolved much of the
confusion.

The possibility of hybridization between eastern poison-oak and other
Toxicodendron species is limited due to differences in habitat.  Eastern
poison-oak forms occasional hybrids with eastern poison-ivy (T.
radicans) where their ranges overlap [<a href="#8">8</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Eastern poison-oak is seldom abundant [<a href="#8">8</a>].  It occurs in open woodlands
of various mixtures:  longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)-scrub oak (Quercus
spp.), pine (Pinus spp.)-hardwood, and second-growth hardwood [<a href="#9">9</a>].  It
is found most often in scrub oak and pine woodland savannas with an
understory of ericaceous shrubs and bunchgrasses including threeawn
(Aristida spp.), needlegrass (Stipa spp.), and bluestem (Andropogon
spp.) [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Eastern poison-oak occurs under loblolly pine (P. taeda)
plantations in Louisiana [<a href="#2">2</a>].  It is listed as an associated species in
a big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii)-kochia (Kochia scoparia)-common
sunflower (Helianthus annuus) community that occurs in Kansas.  Other
associates in that community include western ragweed (Ambrosia
psilostachya), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), lambsquarters
(Chenopodium album), and sedge (Carex spp.)  [<a href="#6">6</a>].  In Alabama, eastern
poison-oak is reported from a community in the Bee Branch Gorge Research
Natural Area which represents the southernmost limit of eastern hemlock
(Tsuga canadensis).  Tree associates of eastern poison-oak in this
community include eastern hemlock and American beech (Fagus
grandifolia).  Understory associates include muscadine grape (Vitis
rotundifolia) and cane (Arundinaria gigantea) [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Eastern poison-oak is seldom associated with other members of its genus
because of differences in soil requirements [<a href="#8">8</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Specific instances of wildlife use of eastern poison-oak have not been
reported in the literature, although Blair [<a href="#2">2</a>] listed it as palatable
browse for white-tailed deer.  Eastern poison-ivy, a closely related
species, is browsed by white-tailed deer, and its fruits are consumed by
61 species of wildlife [<a href="#15">15</a>].

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Rhus toxicodendron occurred with 1 percent frequency on 10-year-old,
unreclaimed lignite mine sites.  It occurred at 15 percent frequency on
30-year-old sites, and 67 percent on 60-year-old sites.  It was not
found on sites less than 10 years old, but did occur on undisturbed
adjacent sites at 3 percent frequency.  It is not clear from this
article whether the reference is to eastern poison-ivy or to eastern
poison-oak [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Eastern poison-ivy was used as a stimulant and a narcotic.  Its juice was
used to make indelible ink [<a href="#19">19</a>].  It is likely that eastern poison-oak
has been used for the same purposes.


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Eastern poison-oak produces uroshiol, an allergenic oil that causes
dermatitis in susceptible individuals [<a href="#11">11</a>].  A skin test has been
developed to determine individual sensitivity to uroshiol.  Other work
is in progress to develop preventative treatments for sensitive
individuals [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Eastern poison-oak can be controlled by a number of herbicides [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Toxicodendron toxicarium
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Eastern poison-oak is a native, rhizomatous, deciduous shrub [<a href="#5">5</a>].  It
has slender, erect stems that are woody for 20 to 24 inches (50-60 cm)
[<a href="#5">5</a>], and are not over 3 feet (1 m) tall.  The trifoliate leaves are
oak-like in appearance with three to seven lobes [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Many authors
report that the leaves are more leathery than those of eastern
poison-ivy; however, Gillis [<a href="#8">8</a>] stated that this is a variable
character.  The flowers are produced in dense panicles 1 to 3 inches
(2.5-7.6 cm) long.  The fruit is a hard, reniform-globose or
depressed-globose drupe [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  Unlike its congener eastern poison-ivy,
it is not a climber, nor does it produce aerial roots [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Eastern poison-oak reproduces both vegetatively and by seed [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].

Vegetative reproduction in eastern poison-oak is accomplished by the
formation of clones via rhizomes [<a href="#20">20</a>].  The intervals at which aerial
stems are produced from rhizomes are greater than the intervals observed
for eastern poison-ivy [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Eastern poison-oak occurs on dry barrens, pinelands [<a href="#5">5</a>], and oak woods
[<a href="#8">8</a>].  It is largely confined to sandy soils of low fertility on the
Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains.  Soils are most often coarse sands that
are low in calcium, magnesium, and potassium [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Eastern poison-oak is probably not tolerant of heavy shade [<a href="#19">19</a>].  In
Louisiana, eastern poison-oak production was highest under loblolly pine
plantations that had been lightly thinned, and lowest under similar
plantations that had been heavily thinned [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Eastern poison-oak is in flower from May to June, and ripened fruits are
available from August through November [<a href="#5">5</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Toxicodendron toxicarium
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Eastern poison-oak occurs in the understory of open woods, particularly
in the longleaf pine, loblolly pine, and scrub oak types [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  The
open condition of these communities is maintained by fire.
Historically, fires in these communities occurred frequently (intervals
from 3 to 20 years) and were usually low-intensity surface fires.  It is
likely that eastern poison-oak is able to survive low-intensity surface
fires by sprouting from rhizomes if top-killed.  In Texas, eastern
poison-oak is a common understory plant in a dry, upland longleaf pine
savanna which has been maintained by periodic prescribed fire (burned at
3- to 5-year intervals) [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous shrub, rhizome in soil

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Toxicodendron toxicarium
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
No specific information on eastern poison-oak mortality or top-kill due
to fire was available in the literature.  It is likely that, given its
small stature, eastern poison-oak is easily top-killed by even
low-intensity surface fires.  It is likely to survive such fires and
sprout from rhizomes.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
In Tennessee, eastern poison-oak occurred on plots that were prescribed
burned annually between 1963 and 1988.  Years and duration of its
occurrence were not reported; the authors stated only that it "occurred
widely across the years".  Eastern poison-oak was also present on plots
that were burned periodically (1964 and 1969) but disappeared from these
plots after 1972 [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
The allergenic oil (uroshiol) from eastern poison-oak can be carried on
soot particles when the plant is burned and causes dermatitis on persons
working in areas where eastern poison-oak is burned [<a href="#11">11</a>].  The smoke can
injure lungs.  Reports of ill effects from exposure to the smoke of
burning eastern poison-ivy or poison-oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum)
include head-to-toe dermatitis, fever, lung infections, and even death
caused by the throat swelling up [<a href="#18">18</a>].  It is likely that under similar
burning conditions and plant densities, smoke from eastern poison-oak
could cause the same problems.  Eastern poison-oak, however, has not
been reported at anywhere near the same densities encountered for either
eastern poison-ivy or poison-oak.
