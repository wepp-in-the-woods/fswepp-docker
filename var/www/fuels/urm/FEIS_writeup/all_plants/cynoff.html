GENERAL DISTRIBUTION:</a>

<br />


The center of origin
of houndstongue is thought to be the mountains of western Asia and eastern
Europe. Houndstongue also occurs in apparently natural communities in
Great Britain. It is widely distributed through Europe, where its northern limit
is approximately 60°N, though there are isolated occurrences up to 68°N in Sweden. Towards the Mediterranean region it becomes rare.
Houndstongue does not grow in the southernmost regions of Europe [<a href="#26">26</a>].<p>A review by Upadhyaya and others
[<a href="#99">99</a>] suggests houndstongue was
introduced to North
America as a crop seed contaminant from Europe. Herbarium specimens of houndstongue
were collected in Ontario as early as 1859 and in the western provinces between
1922 and 1934. Houndstongue was noted in 1884 as &quot;common&quot;
around Montreal, and as &quot;a pest&quot; in Ontario. As of 1988, houndstongue
occurred in all provinces in Canada except Prince Edward Island
and Newfoundland, and appeared to be most abundant in southern British Columbia and
Ontario. Houndstongue occurs throughout the contiguous U.S., in all but 6 southern
states. Its occurrence has not been reported in Alaska or Hawaii [<a href="#96">96</a>].
Houndstongue is reported as a problem plant in natural areas and parks in several
states including Michigan, Missouri, Indiana [<a href="#73">73</a>], Colorado, and
Oregon [<a href="#80">80</a>]. The <a href="http://plants.usda.gov/">Plants</a> database provides
a distribution map of houndstongue in the United States.</p>
<p>The following biogeographic classification systems are presented as a guide
to demonstrate where houndstongue may be found. Precise distribution information is
limited. Because it is so widespread and has broad ecological
tolerances, it is difficult to exclude many ecosystems as potential hosts of
houndstongue plants or populations. Therefore, these lists are speculative and
not necessarily exhaustive.

In British Columbia, houndstongue occurs predominantly in the Interior
Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>) and ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus
ponderosa</i>)-bunchgrass biogeoclimatic zones [<a href="#99">99</a>].<p>In Utah, houndstongue may be found in
sagebrush (<i>Artemisia</i> spp.), pinyon-juniper (<i>Pinus</i> spp.-<i>Juniperus</i>
spp.), cottonwood (<i>Populus</i> spp.),
mountain brush, quaking aspen (<i>Populus tremuloides</i>), ponderosa pine, and spruce-fir
(<i>Picea</i> spp.-<i>Abies</i> spp.) communities [<a href="#107">107</a>]. It is a minor component in
Gambel oak
(<i>Quercus gambelii</i>) communities in central and northern Utah [<a href="#58">58</a>]. On preserves in Colorado, houndstongue has been reported in
shortgrass prairie, narrowleaf cottonwood/red-osier dogwood (<i>Populus
angustifolia</i>/<i>Cornus sericea</i>) riparian forests, and riparian meadows.

<p>In northeastern Oregon, houndstongue invades Idaho fescue (<i>Festuca
idahoensis</i>), bluebunch wheatgrass (<i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i>), and
prairie Junegrass (<i>Koeleria macrantha</i>) grasslands, and riparian habitats
[<a href="#80">80</a>].</p>

In Iowa, houndstongue was found on an upland site dominated by white oak (<i>Q.
alba</i>), northern red oak (<i>Q. rubra</i>), and shagbark hickory (<i>Carya ovata</i>) [<a href="#54">54</a>].

Houndstongue is a biennial or short-lived perennial forb. The following description of houndstongue is based on reviews by Upadhyaya and others
[<a href="#99">99</a>] and de Jong and others [<a href="#26">26</a>]. It presents characteristics of
houndstongue that may be relevant to fire ecology, and is not meant
to be used for identification. Keys for identification are
available [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>]. A detailed discussion of the biology of houndstongue is provided by de
Jong and others [<a href="#26">26</a>].
<p>Houndstongue forms a rosette in its 1st
year with softly pubescent leaves 4 to 12 inches (10-30 cm) long and 0.8 to 2
inches (2-5 cm) wide. It has a
thick, black, branching taproot, extending to depths &gt; 40 inches (100 cm). An individual plant consists of 1 or several rosettes on
a single root system.
Flower
stems, 12 to 48 inches (30-120 cm) tall, are produced the 2nd year, or sometimes
later. The upper part of the stem is
branching. Stem leaves are generally broadest near the base and narrower
towards the tip. Houndstongue inflorescences have up to 35 but usually no more
than 10 flowers each and are axillary to leaves or
terminating short branches. Each flower can produce up to 4 fruits. The fruits are nutlets, the surfaces of
which are flat and densely covered with small, barbed hooks (glochidia) that facilitate dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>Houndstongue rosettes can withstand drought stress, enabling the plant to survive water
deficits and to delay flowering until conditions are favorable. The thick, deep
taproot can exploit lower soil strata for water and nutrients. The root also serves as an underground food
reserve which may offer protection against winter injury [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>].</p>
<p>Houndstongue often occurs in dense stands, but may also occur as a small but regular proportion of
regional flora. Seedlings
are usually strongly clustered
around parent plants in densities of up to 405 seedlings per ft<sup>2</sup> (4500/m<sup>2</sup>)
[<a href="#26">26</a>].
Houndstongue may grow as an isolated plant or at densities up to 1
individual per ft<sup>2 </sup>(8/m<sup>2</sup>) on dunes in England. On coastal dunes in the Netherlands, its
abundance ranges from rare to abundant. Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae are usually present
on houndstongue roots [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].</p>

Houndstongue is a biennial or short-lived perennial that reproduces only by
seed. An annual life cycle apparently does not occur anywhere in the entire range of the species [<a href="#26">26</a>]. The following discussion
of the regeneration processes in houndstongue derives primarily from research in
British and Dutch coastal dune areas. More research is needed on houndstongue
regeneration on sites where it is invasive in North America.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Breeding system:</b></font>   A review by Upadhyaya and others [<a href="#99">99</a>] suggests
that houndstongue flowers are perfect (having both male and female parts), and that seed
production occurs via autogamy. However, de Jong and others [<a href="#26">26</a>] report that
houndstongue plants produce only very few nutlets if pollinators are
excluded, and that bagging inflorescences in the field generally results in reduced seed set per
flower. This suggests some mechanism that prevents self-pollination within
the flower. Seed set per flower is greatly increased by exchanging pollen
between flowers on the same plant.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Pollination:</b></font>   Houndstongue is pollinated by bumblebees
[<a href="#75">75</a>]. Flowers are also visited by other bees, thrips, and butterflies [<a href="#26">26</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Seed production:</b></font>  Estimates
of total seed number per plant in houndstongue range from 50 to more than 2,000
[<a href="#99">99</a>]. In Montana, houndstongue seed production
ranges from 300-675 seeds per plant [<a href="#50">50</a>].</p>

<p>Houndstongue plants typically have 1 or 2 stems, although up to 8 stems per
plant have been reported on plants growing in dune grasslands in England. In
this ecosystem, a single stem could produce around 300 seeds, and
seed number per stem was correlated with stem basal diameter (r=0.84,
p&lt;0.01) [<a href="#11">11</a>]. In a sand
dune area in the Netherlands, larger plants produce more seed per flower, and smaller plants produce more flowers
per plant [<a href="#51">51</a>]. Researchers there found that watering
houndstongue plants had a positive effect on seed set [<a href="#26">26</a>].</p>

<p>  Each flower has the potential to produce 4
nutlets. A review by Upadhyaya and others [<a href="#99">99</a>] reports an
average 2.75 nutlets per flower. In
Dutch sand dunes, 5.2 to 7.8% of the nutlets produced in a population formed
seedlings in the following spring [<a href="#26">26</a>]. Boorman
and Fuller [<a href="#11">11</a>] estimated this figure at 25% on coastal dunes in England.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed dispersal:</b></font>  Houndstongue seeds are
covered in a spiny husk and possess a protruding barb that enables the seed to
adhere to wild and domestic animals thus promoting long-distance dispersal
[<a href="#50">50</a>]. European studies, however, suggest that animal
dispersal is rare in houndstongue [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>], and wind is considered to be the primary dispersal
mechanism [<a href="#100">100</a>]. In one study, the majority of houndstongue seeds (75%) fell into
an area of radius
5 inches (12 cm) around the
parent plant. The greatest recorded dispersal
distance was 4.6 feet (1.4 m). With such limited primary dispersal range, even rare dispersal
events by
animals could be important [<a href="#11">11</a>]. </p>

<p>It has been proposed that the
presence of houndstongue around rabbit warrens in European ecosystems is the result of rabbits cleaning
seeds off their fur before entering the warrens. However, seeds do not adhere well to fine
rabbit fur [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Evidence from a study in
British Columbia indicates that cattle are important dispersers of houndstongue
seed, picking up about 65% of seeds per stalk in grazed
paddocks [<a href="#23">23</a>]. Some houndstongue seeds remain on plants well into the
winter [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>]. These seeds are
dispersed slowly over time by attaching to animal wool and hair. Dispersal via streams and irrigation ditches is unlikely due to the
high specific gravity of houndstongue seeds [<a href="#99">99</a>]. Although seed dispersal occurs slowly over
time, colonization of disturbed sites can take place very quickly [<a href="#50">50</a>]. </p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed banking:</b></font>   A review by Upadhyaya and
others [<a href="#99">99</a>] cites several studies that indicate that houndstongue does not
produce a large, persistent bank of buried seeds, and that seeds remain viable
no longer than 2-3 years. Newly ripened seeds of houndstongue exhibit an innate dormancy
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>]. Most seeds
fall from the plant soon after ripening; however, some seeds remain on plants for up to 2 years, especially in sheltered habitats (e.g.
scrub), thus creating an above-ground seed bank. A
fraction (less than 5 to 10% in exposed habitats) of seeds that fall to the
ground do not germinate in the 1st year [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>]. A small percentage of these seeds (4-7 %) may remain viable after 1 year
[<a href="#26">26</a>]. In the Netherlands, viable seeds were found to occur
almost entirely within the top 0.4 inch (1 cm) of soil, and viable seeds did not occur deeper
than 2 inches (5 cm). Experimentally, all buried seeds had germinated within 9 months at both
0.8-inch (2 cm) and 6-inch (15 cm) depths [<a href="#100">100</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Germination:</b></font>   Seed burial depth, ambient
temperature, moisture, soil nitrate levels, and light have been shown to affect
seed germination in houndstongue (reviews by [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>]).</p> 

<p>  The viability of freshly
harvested houndstongue seeds exceeds 90%, although newly ripened seeds of houndstongue exhibit
an innate dormancy [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>]. Thus, houndstongue
seeds remain ungerminated throughout the fall and winter and germinate uniformly
in the spring, suggesting a vernalization requirement for dormancy release. In Dutch
coastal dunes, almost all houndstongue seedlings emerge in March and April, the main
germination period being March, with very little to no germination in any other month
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].</p> 

<p>Germination in houndstongue generally requires some form of scarification or
softening of the seed coat. Seeds are likely to remain dormant until they can
take up sufficient water [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Nitrate also breaks seed dormancy [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>]. In laboratory studies, germination rate was highest after 6-12 weeks of moist-chilling
at 32 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit (0-10 ºC). Germination of dispersed seeds depends strongly on burial.
Of the viable houndstongue seeds buried 0.4 inch (1 cm) in sand, almost 100% germinated
before and during the 1st spring, while germination on the surface was less
than 4% [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>]. Darkness may either stimulate or have no effect on germination
of houndstongue seeds [<a href="#100">100</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seedling establishment/growth:</b></font>  Large temporal and
spatial variation in the number of surviving seedlings per reproductive
individual has been observed for houndstongue [<a href="#24">24</a>]. It is estimated that less than 1% of
dispersed seed survives to produce more seed (review by [<a href="#26">26</a>]). Reports of 7 to 40%
of dispersed houndstongue seeds were retrieved as seedlings in spring. The remaining seeds may have been dispersed
secondarily or lost through predation, although death of seeds or seedlings immediately
after germination was the most plausible explanation [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>]. First
year survival of seedlings from spring to fall ranged from
22 to over 50% on Dutch coastal dunes [<a href="#24">24</a>].<p>Houndstongue seedlings have a low growth rate and are not strongly competitive. Plants do well when
their competitors are kept in check (e.g. grazed by rabbits) [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Small-scale
disturbances are important for houndstongue establishment. Houndstongue occurs
only in areas of the Dutch coastal dunes where grazing by horses and cows is
allowed [<a href="#20">20</a>]. Prins and Nell [<a href="#74">74</a>]
compared population dynamics of houndstongue with and without protection from
generalist herbivores (insects, rabbits and mice). Houndstongue mortality was significantly higher in protected populations for 3
consecutive years (p&lt;0.05). Germination, seedling establishment and number of
flowering plants were also lower inside exclosures.
Similar results were observed in
exclosure studies in northeastern Oregon, where percent canopy cover of houndstongue
increased over a 30 year period under grazing pressure from both cattle and wildlife
[<a href="#81">81</a>]. Generalist herbivores
seem to play a positive role in the population dynamics of houndstongue by
reducing competition from grasses [<a href="#74">74</a>]. Seedling
growth and survival are also reduced by intraspecific competition at high population
densities [<a href="#26">26</a>].<p> Seeds of houndstongue have large nutrient reserves that allow
rapid seedling root growth so that plants can be well established before drier
weather begins (reviews by [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>]). Most
seedling mortality, however, is attributed to water deficit in the early
summer months, before the development of a deep and extensive root system [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>]. Seedling survival
is lowest in dry summers and
on exposed sites [<a href="#24">24</a>]. Seedling
mortality was negatively correlated with the water content in the top 4 inches (10 cm) of
soil (r=-0.65, p&lt;0.001) in Dutch coastal dunes. Early seedling mortality
(April to May) was also negatively correlated with the cover of shrubs and trees
(r=-0.70, p&lt;0.001) and soil humus content, (r=-0.63, p&lt;0.01). Variation in rainfall
may cause yearly differences in houndstongue survival and growth, and also affects its distribution over shaded and exposed habitats on dune sites [<a href="#25">25</a>]. A large proportion of houndstongue rosettes that delayed
reproduction buffered the population against low seedling recruitment in some
years (a bud bank versus a seed bank) [<a href="#24">24</a>].

<br />

In North America, houndstongue often occurs in &quot;waste&quot; areas [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>] and disturbed sites (especially roadsides)
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>], including logging roads and heavily grazed areas [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>], disturbed woods and forest clearings
[<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>], and lake shores [<a href="#104">104</a>]. Dense infestations of houndstongue are found
in clearcut areas in northern British Columbia [<a href="#99">99</a>], and Upadhyaya and Cranston
[<a href="#98">98</a>] suggest that houndstongue thrives and has great potential for spread in
areas disturbed by logging operations and road construction.<p>Houndstongue is most abundant in areas with more than 10% bare ground
(review by [<a href="#99">99</a>]). Studies in Europe also indicate that houndstongue requires open,
disturbed ground and that it is most common in dry, open habitats [<a href="#26">26</a>],
such as the dune grasslands in England. Houndstongue can exploit bare ground around
rabbit warrens, benefiting from the high nitrogen levels from rabbit
excreta, and the fact that rabbits do not usually eat houndstongue. Houndstongue
is often found in areas grazed by livestock and wildlife [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>].</p>
<p> In England and in the Netherlands, houndstongue occurs on sand dunes and
calcareous substrates. These calcareous, sandy soils have high nitrate levels
that favor houndstongue establishment, and abundant calcium that houndstongue accumulates
to a marked degree, especially in its leaves [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Houndstongue
is absent from acid coastal
dunes and from acid sandy soils and does not occur on peat or clay soils [<a href="#99">99</a>]. In Germany
houndstongue grows on both calcium-rich and weakly-acid soil, and is classified
as both a drought and nitrogen indicator [<a href="#26">26</a>]. In British Columbia
it is found on soils ranging from well-drained, relatively
coarse material to clay subsoils in the open coniferous and deciduous forests.
In Eastern Canada, houndstongue is often associated with rocky pastures in limestone
regions [<a href="#98">98</a>].</p>
<p>

Houndstongue is found in temperate regions. In British
Columbia it is found on sites that are
characterized by hot, dry summers and cold winters, with annual precipitation in
the range of 11 to 18 inches (268-448 mm), and mean January and July temperatures of
approximately 21 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit (-6 and 22 ºC), respectively. In Ontario,
houndstongue-infested regions have annual precipitation and mean January and July
temperature variations in the range of 31 to 41 inches (770-1020 mm), 39 to 52
degrees Fahrenheit (3.9-10.9 ºC) and 67 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit (19.2-22.2
ºC),
respectively [<a href="#99">99</a>]. On droughty sand dunes in the Netherlands, the amount of rainfall during the growing
season greatly affects growth, survival and seed production in houndstongue.
Here the species may disappear from the most exposed sites after several dry years,
and recolonize these areas again after a number of wet years. Plants grow poorly
and eventually die after waterlogging [<a href="#26">26</a>]. Houndstongue is not well
adapted to dry grassland sites with less than 12 inches (300 mm) annual precipitation in
British Columbia. It
survives well in wetter grasslands and moist draws in drier sites [<a href="#98">98</a>].</p>
<p>The distribution pattern of houndstongue in Europe suggests that at its
northern limits its temperature requirements during the growing season, rather
than the occurrence of winter frost, restrict the species to warmer microsites. On sand dunes in England, it occurs mostly on south or
south-east facing slopes [<a href="#26">26</a>]. Houndstongue is completely absent from areas above
495 feet (150 m) in England. In
continental Europe, it reaches the subalpine but only rarely the alpine (4,950
to 7,920 feet (1,500-2,400
m)). Some elevational ranges at which houndstongue occurs are given below:</p>

SUCCESSIONAL STATUS:</a></span><br>
Houndstongue is an opportunistic species that exploits conditions suitable for
its establishment and growth. In the variable environment of dune habitats,
houndstongue populations are usually in decline, and only in rare years are
conditions favorable for growth and/or seed production. For this reason, one may see large
fluctuations in population density in a single locality [<a href="#24">24</a>].
As is typical of biennials, large population increases are observed following
reproductive success and large decreases or even local extinctions following reproductive
failure. Annual disturbances as well as absence of disturbance can be fatal for
biennial plant development; therefore most habitats are only
temporarily suitable for biennials. Grazed range provides an
environment where gaps are repeatedly created and therefore suitable sites
for establishment are usually available [<a href="#101">101</a>]. Where it has established on disturbed sites such as roads and around old
buildings, it may persist indefinitely, as is evidenced by its continued presence
in abandoned mining towns in southwestern Montana, even after 45 to 77 years of recovery
[<a href="#52">52</a>].</p>
<p>Houndstongue is shade tolerant [<a href="#98">98</a>] but grows best in full sunlight, if sufficient water and nutrients are
available. In sand dunes it may occur in both open and shaded sites (5-10%
of full daylight). Its establishment in open sites may depend on spring and
summer rainfall. In half-open habitats, at
the edges of the canopies of shrubs or trees, plants are less susceptible to
drought [<a href="#26">26</a>]. Houndstongue
was significantly (p&lt;0.05) positively associated with closed canopies at Mammoth
campground in Yellowstone National Park. Here it was more consistently found under
high canopy cover than any
other nonnative species. Similarly, Lacey and Lacey [<a href="#59">59</a>] describe occurrences
of houndstongue in areas of thick litter accumulation (as
might be found under a forest with high canopy cover) [<a href="#1">1</a>].</p>
<p>


<span class="subframeName"><a name="SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT">SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:<br></a></span>Houndstongue seeds overwinter predominantly in the top (1 cm) of soil,
although some seeds may
remain attached to the parent plant throughout the winter [<a href="#99">99</a>]. Houndstongue
germination starts in late winter and early spring, when soil temperature
rises above the freezing point. Houndstongue plants then
develop from seedling to rosette
within the 1st year of growth. When night frosts begin in autumn, rosette leaves
die back and the taproot remains. Houndstongue requires a vernalization period before
stem elongation can occur.
Stem elongation is probably stimulated by day length [<a href="#26">26</a>]. Flowering is strongly
size-dependent, with the probability of flowering increasing
with the size of the plant. There may also be a critical size below which plants do not flower
[<a href="#27">27</a>]. The
main period of flowering is about 55 days, with seed ripening requiring an
additional 70 days. Most ripened seeds fall to the ground within 4 months of
ripening [<a href="#99">99</a>].</p>

<p>Although usually a biennial, houndstongue can behave as a short-lived
perennial. Under fertile conditions plants typically flower in their 2nd year.
Under adverse environmental conditions, flowering can be delayed
until the plants reach a
sufficient size for vernalization [<a href="#26">26</a>]. Delay of flowering is common in natural populations of
houndstongue on Dutch coastal dunes. Over a 7-year period, the percentage of
rosettes that flowered ranged from 2 to 25%. The proportion of rosettes
flowering was positively correlated (r=0.62, p=0.05) with rainfall in the
previous year and was reduced after a very cold winter [<a href="#27">27</a>].</p>
<p>While most houndstongue plants die after flowering, houndstongue is not
strictly monocarpic. Of 55 houndstongue plants
studied, 7 flowered again in both the 2nd and 3rd years and 2 in their 3rd and
4th years [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Repeated flowering has also been observed in
houndstongue not only after damage to the flowering plant, but also in undamaged
plants under both natural and
garden conditions [<a href="#26">26</a>].

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font>  Houndstongue reproduces by
seed, some of which may be dispersed over moderate to long distances by animals.
Fire creates conditions that are favorable for establishment of houndstongue
(i.e. open canopy, reduced competition, areas of bare soil), so if houndstongue
seeds are present and competition minimal, it may be favored in the postfire
community. Houndstongue plants may also survive fire, since nutrient
reserves in the taproot acquired during the 1st year are sufficient for normal
seed production the following year, even if the plants are completely defoliated
early in the spring [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>]. More research is needed regarding
adaptations of houndstongue to fire.<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font>  Introduced species can
alter the rate of spread of fire, the probability of occurrence of fire, and the
intensity of fire in an ecosystem [<a href="#18">18</a>]. It is unclear how the presence of
houndstongue may alter the fire regime of a given site, and it is unclear how a
historical fire regime might affect the presence or abundance of houndstongue at
a given site. It has been suggested that the exclusion or alteration of natural
processes, such as fire and flooding, can encourage the establishment and
persistence of houndstongue on prairie sites in Colorado [<a href="#80">80</a>]. Houndstongue
did not occur in any of these communities at the time in which historic fire
regimes were functioning, but has established since fire exclusion began. More information is needed
about ecosystems in which houndstongue is likely to be invasive in North America.</p>

<p>

The following table provides some fire return intervals for communities or
ecosystems in which houndstongue may be found. Because houndstongue is widespread, it is difficult to exclude many ecosystems as potential hosts of
houndstongue plants or populations.</p>

Fire probably top-kills houndstongue plants. A high severity fire would probably
be necessary to kill houndstongue because of its hardy taproot. Research is needed regarding the
effects of fire on both houndstongue plants and seeds.

Response of houndstongue to fire will depend on the conditions of the fire such as
fire severity, time of burning, prior and subsequent weather conditions [<a href="#18">18</a>], and composition of the preburn community and
seed bank. Fire creates conditions that are suitable to houndstongue
establishment; however,
it is unclear how houndstongue plants or populations would respond to historic fire regimes on sites where it occurs. On a western
juniper
(<i>J. occidentalis</i>)/mountain mahogany (<i>Cercocarpus</i>
spp.)/bluebunch wheatgrass site in
northeastern Oregon, houndstongue established 5 years after a wildfire of
moderate severity, and did not establish on a similar site that was
severely burned [<a href="#46">46</a>].<p><span class="subframeName"><a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE">DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE:</a>

FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Fire as a control agent: The lack of normal ecological processes such as
fire and flood can promote establishment by invasive plants such as houndstongue
[<a href="#80">80</a>]. In some ecosystems, re-establishing historic fire regimes can be effective at controlling invasive species by encouraging growth and vigor of
native species (e.g. [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>]). Research is needed regarding the potential of
prescribed burning to control houndstongue.</p>



<p>
Postfire colonization potential: General precautions should be followed
to prevent houndstongue establishment after fire. The USDA Forest Service's &quot;Guide to
noxious weed prevention practices&quot; [<a href="#95">95</a>]
provides several fire management considerations for weed prevention in general
that can be applied to houndstongue. Wildfire managers might consider including
weed prevention education and providing weed identification aids during fire
training; avoiding known weed infestations when locating firelines, monitoring
camps, staging areas, and helibases to be sure they are kept weed free;
taking care that equipment is weed free; incorporating the cost of weed prevention
and management into fire
rehabilitation plans; and acquiring restoration funding. Careful postfire vigilance
to identify and record the establishment of new populations is critical. About 1 month after
fire, survey for signs of new or resprouting weeds. Repeat surveys will be
needed, with the frequency and intensity of the survey guided by local conditions [<a href="#7">7</a>].</p>



<p>Potential weed
problems must be addressed during prefire planning of prescribed burns, and following both
wild and prescribed fires. When planning a prescribed burn, preinventory the project area,
evaluate
cover and phenology of any houndstongue present on or adjacent to the site,
and evaluate the
potential for increased houndstongue populations in the area [<a href="#7">7</a>]. Avoid ignition and burning in areas at high risk for
weed establishment or spread, and/or plan for follow-up treatments in succeeding
years. Avoid creating soil conditions that promote weed
germination and establishment. Discuss weed status and risks in burn
rehabilitation plans [<a href="#95">95</a>].</p>
To prevent new infestations, re-establish vegetation on bare ground as soon after
fire as possible, using either natural recovery or artificial techniques as
appropriate to site conditions and objectives. When reseeding after wildfires
and prescribed burns, use only certified weed-free seed. Monitor the burn site
and associated disturbed areas after the fire and the following spring for
emergence of houndstongue, and treat to eradicate any emergent houndstongue or
other pestiferous plants. Regulate human, pack animal, and livestock entry into burned
areas at risk for weed invasion until desirable site vegetation has recovered
sufficiently to resist weed invasion. Additional guidelines and specific
recommendations and requirements are available [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].

Houndstongue causes poisoning in horses and cattle [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>]. Houndstongue contains various pyrrolizidine
alkaloids (PAs), whose concentrations are highest during its rosette stage and decrease as the
plant matures [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>]. PAs are known to cause liver damage or failure in
livestock [<a href="#90">90</a>]. Kedzie-Webb and Sheley [<a href="#50">50</a>] suggest that
PAs are toxic to horses and cattle but not to domestic sheep. Poisoning can occur when houndstongue
is cut and dried with harvested hay, or when animals are confined to a small area
lacking desirable forage. Most livestock poisonings occur from ingestion of contaminated hay
or feed [<a href="#90">90</a>]. The acute or chronic nature of poisoning depends on
the PA concentration, amount eaten, and rate of ingestion [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>]. Any level of houndstongue contamination
in feed should be
considered potentially lethal for all livestock [<a href="#90">90</a>].<p> Kufeld and others [<a href="#57">57</a>] report light use of houndstongue by
Rocky
Mountain mule deer in winter in Montana. Domestic sheep commonly graze
houndstongue leaves [<a href="#26">26</a>]. There are few direct effects of herbivores on houndstongue where it
occurs on coastal dunes in England and the Netherlands. It is not normally eaten
by rabbits [<a href="#11">11</a>], although rabbits have been observed digging up taproots in
winter [<a href="#26">26</a>]. A 3-year study by Prins and Nell [<a href="#74">74</a>] indicates
only low levels of leaf herbivory on houndstongue in coastal dunes in the
Netherlands. Rabbits caused some leaf damage in early
spring, and no root consumption by
rabbits was found. From June
to November, larvae of the oligophagous Lepidopteran, <i>Ethmia bipunctella</i>,
are the most important herbivores on
houndstongue. Captive mice eat
nutlets, but it is unknown whether this occurs in the field. Ring-necked
pheasants
graze on the cotyledons and on whole seedlings of houndstongue (review by [<a href="#26">26</a>]). </p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Palatability/nutritional value:</b></font>

OTHER USES:</a>
</span>
<br />

A review by Upadhyaya and others [<a href="#99">99</a>] suggests the following traditional uses
of plants in the borage family such as houndstongue. Extracts of Boraginaceous roots have been used for centuries as &quot;folk&quot;
remedies for a variety of disorders such as eczema, fever, acne, corn callus, dermatophytosis, burns and hemorrhoids. Lipophilic red
pigments associated with the outer surface of the roots of many members of the
Boraginaceae are antibacterial, antitumorogenic and possess wound-healing
activity. These pigments have also been used as food and wine colorants in at
least 12 European countries. Roots and leaves of houndstongue have been used as
&quot;folk&quot; pesticides; their herbage has been reported to repel moles in gardens
and to protect stored fruits and vegetables from rodents.<p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="IMPACTS AND CONTROL">
IMPACTS AND CONTROL:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Impacts:</b></font>    Houndstongue can establish
rapidly and form dense monocultures in disturbed habitats. Populations of houndstongue
displace native plant species and hinder the re-establishment of valuable range
species, thereby decreasing availability of forage to wildlife and livestock [<a href="#80">80</a>].
It is most detrimental on
rangelands and hayfields because of its toxicity to livestock, although, in most cases, the fresh
plant is considered unpalatable by livestock and is generally avoided (see
&quot;I<a href="management_considerations.html#importance to livestock and wildlife">Importance
to Livestock and Wildlife</a>&quot; section above) [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>].

</p>

<p>


 The barbed seeds of houndstongue readily attach to wool and fur. This can
create marketing problems and require extra time and money for removal, thus
reducing the value of livestock. The seeds can also attach to the eyelashes of
animals and cause eye damage, and the foliage may cause dermatitis [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>].
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Control:</b></font>   Houndstongue can be controlled
by killing plants and/or preventing seed production. Long-term control of
houndstongue requires an integrated management approach [<a href="#50">50</a>]. </p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
Prevention: </font> Prevention is the most
effective method for managing invasive species, including houndstongue [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>]. Preventing or
dramatically reducing seed production and dispersal, detecting and eradicating weed introductions
early, containing current infestations,
minimizing soil disturbances, establishing competitive grasses, and managing
grazing properly will all help decrease the spread of
infestations.</p>

<p> Cleaning livestock when they are moved from an
infested area to an uninfested area is critical to prevent seed spread [<a href="#23">23</a>]. Houndstongue seeds also readily adhere to shoes and
clothing and need to be removed and carefully disposed of (burned or bagged). It
is important to clean
mowers, vehicles, and tillage equipment after operating in an infested area. When seeding is necessary, use clean, certified weed-free seed and mulch to ensure that
these or other weeds are not being sown.</p>

<p> Place a priority on controlling small infestations so they do
not expand. Conducting aggressive monitoring and treatment several times each year can help with early detection and containment of
infestations when they are small. Monitoring
efforts are best concentrated on the most disturbed areas in a site,
particularly along roadsides, parking lots, fencelines, and waterways. When an
infestation is found, the location can be recorded and the surrounding area
surveyed to determine the size and extent of the infestation, so these sites can
be revisited on follow-up surveys.
For more on monitoring see Johnson [<a href="#47">47</a>].</p>

<p> Historic overgrazing by livestock and native ungulates encourages invasion by
houndstongue [<a href="#80">80</a>]. In areas susceptible
to invasion, proper livestock grazing should include altering timing, frequency
and level of defoliation to allow a full recovery of desirable grass species.
This grazing regime promotes litter accumulation to allow proper nutrient
cycling and enhances vigor of desirable grasses which limits invasion by rangeland weeds [<a href="#50">50</a>]. For more information on grazing
management for weed control see Olson [<a href="#71">71</a>].</p>



<p>Weed prevention and control can be incorporated into all types of management
plans, including logging and site preparation, management of grazing allotments,
recreation management, research projects, road building and maintenance, and
fire management.
See the &quot;Guide to noxious weed prevention practices&quot; [<a href="#95">95</a>]
for specific guidelines in preventing the spread of weed seeds and propagules
under different management conditions.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
Integrated management:</font>     

   The goal of any management plan should be to not only control
invasive plants, but also to improve the affected community by maximizing forage quality and quantity
and/or preserving ecosystem integrity, and preventing
reinvasion or invasion by other invasive species. This must be done in a way that is
complementary to the ecology and economics of the site [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. Effective long-term control requires
that invasive plants be removed and replaced
by more desirable and weed-resistant plant communities [<a href="#45">45</a>]. Once the desired plant
community has been determined, an integrated weed management strategy can be
developed to direct succession toward that plant community by identifying key
mechanisms and processes directing plant community dynamics (site availability,
species availability, and species performance) and predicting plant community
response to control measures [<a href="#87">87</a>]. This requires a long-term
integrated management plan.</p>

Most often, a single method is not effective for controlling an invasive
plant, but there are
many possible combinations of methods that can achieve the desired objectives. Methods selected for removal or control of
houndstongue on a specific site will be
determined by land use objectives, desired plant community, extent
and nature of the infestation(s), environmental factors (nontarget vegetation,
soil types, climatic conditions, important water resources), economics, and
effectiveness and limitations of available control techniques [<a href="#78">78</a>].



</p>



<p> Managers are encouraged to use combinations of
control techniques in a manner that is appropriate to the site objectives,
desired plant community, available resources, and timing of application. For information
on integrated weed management without herbicides, see the Bio-Integral
Resource Center (<a href="http://www.keyed.com/birc/index.html">BIRC</a>)
 website.

<p><font face="Bell MT">
Physical/mechanical: </font> Tillage,
hoeing, and hand-pulling may provide effective control of houndstongue, providing these
operations are done before the reproductive growth stages to prevent seed
production. Mechanical methods may not be practical on rangeland
and
natural areas, but could be useful in improved pastures or roadsides.</p>



<p>First-year houndstongue plants are difficult to control by aboveground
cutting, as the prostrate rosette resists mowing and grazing [<a href="#99">99</a>], and nutrient
reserves of the taproot acquired during the 1st year are sufficient for normal
seed production the following year, even if the plants are completely defoliated
early in the spring [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>]. Furthermore, defoliation at the rosette stage may cause
the plant to delay flowering for a year and thus result in a larger plant with a
greater seed output [<a href="#102">102</a>]. Mowing or clipping 2nd year plants can
reduce seed production in houndstongue provided that it is done before seeds are
formed and that defoliation is severe enough to prevent regrowth and subsequent
flowering [<a href="#80">80</a>]. Clipping 2nd year houndstongue plants 0 to 3 inches (0-7 cm) above ground
in late June reduced but did not eliminate seed
production in houndstongue (Dickerson and Fay 1982, as cited by [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>]). Sixty percent of cut plants failed to regrow,
and seed production of the plants that resumed growth declined to about 25 seeds
per plant compared to 364 seeds per plant in the unclipped controls. Boorman and Fuller
[<a href="#11">11</a>],
on the other hand, found that removing the
leaves from 2nd year plants had little effect on seed number or seed weight.
Additionally, if the
flowering stalk is cut off or if flower buds are removed, axillary buds lower on
the stem may be activated and develop into cymes; or the plant may respond by forming vegetative side-rosettes
from the axils of old leaf-bases [<a href="#26">26</a>]. Response of houndstongue after serious defoliation
depends on the vigor of plants and the fertility of the site, especially
nitrogen availability. Plants with low growth rates
respond quite poorly to defoliation, while vigorous plants may recover and set
seed [<a href="#102">102</a>].</p>

<p>Plowing is said to control houndstongue [<a href="#99">99</a>]. However, tillage is not usually
appropriate in wildlands and
rangelands since it can damage important desirable species, increase erosion,
alter soil structure, and expose the soil for rapid reinfestation by
houndstongue and other invasive species [<a href="#62">62</a>]. Cutting the root
crown of either young rosettes or older houndstongue plants (before seed set) 1 to 2 inches
(2.5-5 cm) below the soil surface in autumn or early
spring and removing top-growth
can be effective in controlling small infestations [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>]. Hand-pulling of houndstongue on the Dunstan Homestead in
northeastern Oregon reduced houndstongue populations by 85% [<a href="#80">80</a>]. For very large
infestations, it may be difficult to get enough labor for cutting or
hand-pulling. The Salmon River Restoration Council (<a href="http://www.srrc.org/">SRRC</a>)
provides an example of watershed-scale weed control using primarily mechanical
control methods and volunteer labor.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
Biological:</font> Biological control of invasive species has a long history; many important considerations
need to be made before implementation
of a biological control program. The reader is referred to other sources [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>] and the <a href="http://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/handbook.html">Weed
Control Methods Handbook</a>   [<a href="#94">94</a>]
for background information on biological control. Additionally, <a href="http://www.nysaes.cornell.edu/ent/biocontrol/">Cornell
University</a>
and <a href="http://ceris.purdue.edu/napis/index.html">NAPIS</a>
 websites offer information on biological control.</p>

<p>As of 1999, 5 biological control
agents were being screened for their potential use on houndstongue. These include
a root weevil (<i>Mogulones cruciger</i>), a seed weevil (<i>M. borreginis</i>), a stem
weevil (<i>M. trisignatus</i>), a root beetle (<i>Longitarsus quadriguttatus</i>), and a root
fly (<i>Cheilosia pasquorum</i>) [<a href="#50">50</a>]. Recent research on the host specificity
of <i>Mogulones cruciger </i>indicates that this agent can complete full
development on several plant species within closely related genera in the
Boraginaceae, but prefers houndstongue as a host. This is a matter of concern
since at least one species in the genus <i>Cryptantha</i> (<i>C. crassipes</i>)
is listed as endangered in the U.S., and 6 of the 12 <i>Cryptantha</i> species
tested supported full development of the root weevil (<i>C. crassipes </i>was
not tested) [<a href="#22">22</a>]. As of the time
of this writing, no further information is available regarding the status of the
other biocontrol agents. <i>Erysiphe
cynoglossi</i> is a commonly encountered pathogen on houndstongue in western
North America that is being studied for its impact on vegetative plant growth
and reproduction [<a href="#21">21</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
Chemical:</font>  Herbicides are effective in gaining initial control of a new
invasion or a severe infestation, but are rarely a complete
or long-term solution to weed management [<a href="#15">15</a>]. Herbicides are more effective on large infestations when incorporated into long-term management plans that include
replacement of weeds with desirable species, careful land use management, and
prevention of new infestations.
Control with herbicides is temporary, as it does not change those conditions that
allow infestations to occur [<a href="#110">110</a>].
See the <a href="http://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/handbook.html">Weed Control Methods
Handbook</a> for considerations on the use of herbicides in natural areas and
detailed information on specific chemicals.</p>

<p>  Picloram, dicamba, chlorsulfuron, metsulfuron and 2,4-D amine can kill houndstongue
plants. Repeated applications may be necessary for several years to
maintain adequate control [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>]. Herbicide
choice and rates are influenced by growth stage, stand density, and
environmental conditions (e.g. drought or cold temperatures). Check with state or county weed specialists for appropriate local use rates
and timing.</p>

<font face="Bell MT">
Cultural: </font> No matter what method is used to kill
weeds, re-establishment of competitive, desirable plant cover is imperative for
long-term control.
Fertilization and reseeding with competitive, adapted species is often necessary
in areas without a residual understory of desirable plants [<a href="#78">78</a>].<p>Houndstongue seedlings have a
comparatively low growth rate and are not strongly competitive. Interspecific competition severely reduces
the dry weight of 1st
and 2nd year houndstongue plants [<a href="#99">99</a>]. Generalist herbivores play a positive role in the population dynamics of houndstongue by
reducing competition from grasses in coastal dunes in the Netherlands [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>]. Similarly, in
exclosure studies in northeastern Oregon, percent canopy cover houndstongue
increased over a 30-year period under grazing pressure from both cattle and wildlife
[<a href="#81">81</a>]. These studies suggest, therefore, that planting and maintaining
competitive species can effectively control houndstongue, although more research
is needed.
