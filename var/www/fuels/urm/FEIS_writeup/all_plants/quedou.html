<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Blue oak-dominated communities are highly variable in composition.  Blue
oak frequently associates with gray pine (Pinus sabiniana).  It also
occurs in monospecific stands or codominates with several other oak
species.  Oak codominants not listed in previous frames include interior
live (Q. wislizenii) and valley (Q. lobata) oaks.  The blue oak
community ranges in physiognomy from open savanna to farily dense
woodland with a shrubby understory.  It merges or forms a mosaic with
annual grassland at low elevation and with chaparral, other oak woodland
phases, or singleleaf pinyon-California juniper (Pinus
monophylla-Juniperus californica) woodland at higher elevation [<a href="#26">26</a>].

California scrub oak (Q. dumosa), buckbrush (Ceanothus cuneatus),
California coffeeberry (Rhamnus californica), chamise (Adenostoma
fasciculatum), manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.), poison-oak

(Taeniatherum caput-medusae), ripgut brome (Bromus rubens), wild oat
(Avena fatua), bur clover (Medicago polymorpha), filaree (Erodium spp.),
star thistle (Centaurea spp.), and tarweed (Hemizonia, Holocarpha, and
Madia spp.) [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus douglasii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Blue oak wood is not used in manufacturing because of the tree's
frequently short stature and poor form.  Products are limited to
fenceposts and fuelwood [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Historically, the wood was used for shaft
supports in gold and silver mines [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Blue oak is an important species for livestock and wildlife.  Sixty-five
percent of California livestock forage is provided within blue oak-gray
pine woodland [<a href="#14">14</a>].  A 3-year study in the central Sierra Nevada
foothills showed that blue oak woodland is utilized by 92 species of
birds, 60 of which nest there [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Bird species of federal protected
status inhabiting the woodland are the bald and golden eagles.  It is
also inhabited by seven species of rodents, three species of lizards,
four species of snakes, and the state-endangered foothill yellow-legged
frog.

Blue oak is browsed by livestock, black-tailed deer, lagomorphs, and
rodents.  The acorns are eaten by at least a dozen species of songbirds,
several upland game birds, rodents, black-tailed deer, feral and
domestic pig, and all other classes of livestock [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  The acorns
are a critical food source for black-tailed deer, who migrate from
high-elevation dry summer ranges to blue oak woodland for fall and
winter forage [<a href="#16">16</a>].  On the Tehema County winter range, blue oak acorns
account for about 15 percent of the total volume of food consumed by
black-tailed deer [<a href="#60">60</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Blue oak acorns are highly palatable to livestock, black-tailed deer,
and other wildlife.  The sprouts are palatable to all classes of
browsing wildlife and livestock.  Sampson and Jesperson [<a href="#60">60</a>] gave mature
blue oak foliage the following browse rating:

     black-tailed deer:  excellent to good
     sheep:  fair to poor
     goats:  fair to poor
     cattle:  poor
     horses:  poor to useless


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The crude protein content of young, partially expanded leaves of blue
oak on the San Joaquin Experimental Range averages 30 percent, while
that of fully developed leaves averages 11 percent.  The ratio of
calcium to phosphorus is nutritionally satisfactory in young leaves
(2.2:1.0), but disproportionate in mature leaves (15:1).  Acorns are low
in crude protein (4%) but high in crude fiber, fat, and oils [<a href="#60">60</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Blue oak is the prefered nesting, foraging, and escape cover of the
Nuttall's woodpecker, plain titmouse, and white-breasted nuthatch [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Blue oak is planted for wildlife and riparian habitat and watershed
restoration.  Trees are established from acorn plantings or from
transplanting nursery stock.  Top-quality acorns are obtained by
harvested directly from branches in early to mid-fall.  They require
refrigeration at just above freezing for a few weeks to prevent
premature germination.  Acorns are planted in late fall or early winter
after soil is saturated from the first rains [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Dusting acorns with
captan fungicide prior to planting may improve emergence [<a href="#2">2</a>].  When
transplanting, 2-month-old nursery stock is recommended because it shows
better establishment and is cheaper to grow, transport, and plant than
older stock [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Protection against herbivory greatly enhances seedling
survival, and may include fencing or wire cages extending 36 inches (92
cm) aboveground and 18 inches (46 cm) belowground [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Fertilizer has
a negative effect on survival because it enhances growth of annual
grasses over that of blue oak; weed control improves blue oak seedling
survival.  Netting may be neccessary at some sites to reduce losses from
grasshopper herbivory [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Augering holes where seedlings or acorns are
to be planted will increase survival and growth rates.  Roots of
individuals planted in 3-foot-deep (0.9 m) auger holes are able to more
quickly access the deeper soil horizons where more moisture is available
[<a href="#48">48</a>].

Blue oak roots bind soil of steep watersheds, reducing the incidence of
mass soil movement downslope into permanent and ephemeral streams [<a href="#16">16</a>].
Blue oak was successfully used to revegetate upper streambanks in
Almaden Valley [<a href="#25">25</a>].

Blue oak scions can be grafted onto blue oak stumps following fuelwood
harvesting.  Grafting genetically superior scions onto rootstock allows
for more rapid reestablishment of depleted blue oak woodland [<a href="#63">63</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Blue oak is a valuable landscaping ornamental.  A study was conducted in
Mendocino and Sonoma Counties to assess the value of blue oak on lands
undergoing subdivision [<a href="#61">61</a>].  It showed that the aesthetic and amenity
values of trees at a density of 40 stems per acre (16 stems/ha)
resulted in a 21 to 27 percent increase in land value when compared
to acreage with no trees present.

California Indians made meal from blue oak acorns.  They used the acorn
leachate for dying baskets.  The wood was fashioned into bowls [<a href="#64">64</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Blue oak woodland covers 8 percent of California's total land area
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].  Seventy-five percent of this resource is in private ownership,
14 percent is in the National Forest System, and 11 percent is in
various other public ownerships [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Management of this species is
controversial.  From the late 1950's through the early 1970's, several
studies showed that palatability and production of graze in the
understory of blue oak was low when compared to graze in open grassland
areas [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  As a result of these studies, statewide
"rangeland improvement" was recommended, involving removal of blue oak
from grazing areas [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].  This recommendation resulted in the loss of
1 million acres (0.4 million ha) of blue oak woodland to cutting,
prescribed burning, and aerosol spraying [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].  In contrast, more
recent studies [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>] found forage production to be from 15 to over
100 percent higher under blue oaks than in open grassland, and that
herbaceous plants beneath blue oak were nutritionally superior to plants
growing in open grassland.  Forage under blue oak started growing
earlier and remained green after surrounding graze had dried.
Additionally, Duncan and Clawson [<a href="#20">20</a>] reported that cattle prefer forage
beneath blue oak to that of open grassland, even in summer after graze
in both areas has dried.  Holland [<a href="#31">31</a>] found that death or removal of
blue oak resulted in a gradual decline in forage production.  Supporting
this, a separate study [<a href="#37">37</a>] showed an increase in tarweed (Madia
gracilis) following blue oak removal.  The discrepancy between early and
later studies on the effects of blue oak on forage production remains
unresolved.  One study [<a href="#7">7</a>] suggests that understory production increases
on dry sites but is lowered on wetter ones.  Another recent study [<a href="#71">71</a>]
indicates that blue oak with shallow, fine roots inhibits understory
production.  This may be partially attributable to allelopathic blue oak
root exudates as well as competition for water and nutrients.
Variations in root morphology may therefore explain differences in
understory production of blue oak.

Most current public rangeland managers regard blue oak as a desirable
species.  Continued clearing of blue oak for rangeland improvement
projects and poor natural regeneration were two major management
concerns identified by the Hardwood Task Force of the California Board
of Forestry [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Other factors contributing to species decline are road
construction, residential, and commercial development.  Limited data
suggests that development accounted for 46 percent of blue oak loss
between 1973 and 1985, surpassing the loss from rangeland clearing that
dominated before that time.  Water tables that have lowered from
historic levels may also be contributing to the decline of this species
[<a href="#69">69</a>].  In addition, use of blue oak for fuelwood has greatly increased in
recent years [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Damaging agents:  Blue oak is vulnerable to several species of fungi.
The most serious of these are Inonotus dryophilus, Laetiporus
sulphureus, and Armillaria mellea, which cause heart rot [<a href="#16">16</a>].

A large number of insects infest blue oak.  One study showed that 38
species of insects inhabit blue oak, attacking every part of the tree.
The most damaging of these pests in terms of regeneration are the acorn
feeders, which include various species of cynipid wasps, the filbert
weevil (Curculio uniformis), and the filbert worm (Melissopus
latiferreanus).  These insects can destroy large portions of a year's
mast [<a href="#16">16</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus douglasii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Blue oak is a native, deciduous, flood-tolerant, drought-resistant tree
[<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  It is generally short and straight, from 20 to 66 feet (6-20
m) in height and from 14 to 24 inches (36-60 cm) in d.b.h.  [<a href="#16">16</a>].  The
acorns are from 0.8 to 1.2 inches (2-3 cm) long [<a href="#53">53</a>].  The bark is thin
and flaky [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Roots are extensive, and may grow through fractured and
jointed rock to a depth of 80 feet (24 m) or more to tap groundwater
reserves [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Stands are typically from 90 to 100 years old [<a href="#19">19</a>].  The
oldest known blue oak is in Sequoia National Park and is about 400 years
old [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  The age of sexual maturity is unreported for this species.
Catkins develop from flora primordia formed during the previous growing
season.  During drought, these flower buds may not develop [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Acorns
mature in 1 year [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Abundant crops are produced every 2 to 3 years,
with bumper crops every 5 to 8 years [<a href="#57">57</a>].  One 38-foot (11.6 m) blue
oak in Shasta County produced 3,750 acorns during a favorable season
[<a href="#16">16</a>].  Fresh acorns collected by Mirov and Kraebel [<a href="#51">51</a>] from various
locations around the state were 72 percent viable.  Acorns are
disseminated by various animals.  Magpies, scrub jays, and various
rodents bury them in caches, resulting in high rates of emergence [<a href="#27">27</a>].
The acorns are capable of immediate germination.  Germination may be
epigeal or hypogeal, with buried acorns showing greater recruitment [<a href="#14">14</a>].
At plots in various Sierra Nevada locations, germination was initiated
at the first rainfall and slowly continued through winter [<a href="#42">42</a>].
Germinants are susceptible to fungal infection during this time, and
many acorns in the various plots rotted over winter.  A study conducted
in Berkeley and Mendocino Counties found that emergence was greatest at
75 percent of normal rainfall [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Greater than normal rainfall
results in high rates of germinant death due to damping-off fungi.

Blue oaks show rapid, early root elongation prior to shoot development
[<a href="#43">43</a>].  Seedlings growing on the canopy edge or in open positions
establish more frequently than those beneath the parent tree.  Seedlings
do not compete well with annual grasses.  Radicles of unburied acorns
often fail to reach the soil surface before desiccation when growing
through the thatch of these grasses.  Additionally, annual grasses often
outcompete blue oak seedlings for water and light [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Nonnative
annuals now represent 50 to 90 percent of ground cover in blue oak
woodlands, and may have irreversably altered the seasonal availability
of soil moisture to blue oak seedlings [<a href="#10">10</a>].  

Because of a flush of blue oak establishment that occurred statewide
from 1850 to 1900, it has been suggested in the literature that
recruitment of this species occurs in episodic bursts [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].
Tree-ring age analysis of trees in Kern County, however, showed blue
oak recruitment to be fairly continuous from 1570 to 1850, when the
seedling flush occurred [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Successful establishment of this species
depends upon a favorable combination of many factors.  Major factors
include abundant acorn production, escape from acorn predation,
sufficient rainfall, protection from desiccation during germination,
limited competition for light and water, and escape from browsers and
burrowing gophers [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Seedling recruitment is successful in some
areas, but few blue oak survive to the sapling stage.  Lack of sapling
recruitment was once attributed mainly to livestock herbivory.  At the
San Joaquin Experimental Range, however, few blue oak have reached
sapling size despite lack of livestock grazing since 1934; lack of
sapling recruitment there is attributed to wildlife herbivory [<a href="#21">21</a>].
McClaran and Bartolome [<a href="#47">47</a>] suggest that seedlings must grow quickly
enough to surpass the browse line in 10 to 13 years for new stand
establishment, and that this may not be possible during periods of
prolonged drought.

In a statewide study, sapling stand establishment varied according to
geographical location [<a href="#52">52</a>].  In the northern Sierra Nevada, the steeper
slopes supported the greatest number of saplings.  Along the Delta and
in the central Coast Ranges, saplings were more frequent on mesic
slopes.  In the southern Sierra Nevada, sapling frequency was greatest
where shrub cover was low.

Vegetative:  Blue oak produces root crown and coppice sprouts after
cutting or burning but is generally regarded as a weak sprouter [<a href="#16">16</a>].
Sprouting ability varies with geographic location and may be poor or in
some areas nonexistent [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].  Frequent resprouting may result in
bushlike or stunted trees [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Sprouting is vigorous in some
locations, however.  At the University of California's Sierra Foothill
Range Field Station on the east side of the Sacramento Valley, coppice
and root crown sprouts grew rapidly from experimentally-cut trees
measuring 4 to 36 inches (10-91 cm) in diameter [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Sprouting ability
declines with age.  Mature trees produce a greater number of coppice
sprouts, which are less vigorous and show higher mortality rates than do
root crown sprouts [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Very old trees either do not sprout or produce
only coppice sprouts [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Winter cutting or burning results in more
vigorous sprouting than tree removal in other seasons [<a href="#49">49</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Soil:  Blue oak grows in soils derived from a variety of parent
materials.  Soils are characteristically shallow, skeletal, infertile,
thermic, and moderately to excessively well drained.  Soil textures
range from gravelly loam to gravelly clay-loam [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Climate:  Blue oak occurs in a Mediterranean climate, with hot, dry
summers and cool, wet winters.  The mean maximum July temperature is 90
degrees Fahrenheit (32 deg C); the mean minimum January temperature
is 30 degrees Fahrenheit (-1 deg C).  The frost-free growing season
varies from 150 to 300 days.  Annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 40
inches (510-1,020 mm), with most occurring between November and April
[<a href="#16">16</a>].

Elevation:  Blue oak ranges in elevation from 165 feet (50 m) at the
northern Central Valley floor to 5,900 feet (1,800 m) in its
southernmost distributional limits [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Blue oak is shade intolerant [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Acorns planted at the Hastings Reservation in Carmel Valley emerged from
late February to late March [<a href="#26">26</a>].  The following seasonal development
was reported for blue oak in Sequoia National Park [<a href="#4">4</a>]:

     leaf buds swell:  January to mid-May
     stem elongation:  February to mid-May
     new leaves appear:  mid-March to May
     catkins emerge:  March to mid-June
     leaves fall:  August to mid-November

Acrorns are disseminated from late summer to late fall [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Blue oak
undergoes premature leaf abscission during drought [<a href="#16">16</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus douglasii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire top-kills seedlings and saplings [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  The bark of young
blue oak catches fire and burns easily, providing little protection from
fire.  Mature trees are resistant to the quick heat of grassland fire
but are top-killed or killed by the sustained heat of most chaparral
fires [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Top-killed saplings and seedlings sprout during the first postfire
growing season following low-severity fire; even first-year seedlings
are capable of this.  Sprouts may grow above the browse line more
rapidly than true seedlings, and therefore have a greater probability
of survival to sexual maturity [<a href="#47">47</a>].  McClaran [<a href="#44">44</a>] reported that 70 to 85
percent of blue oaks in a stand probably originated as sprouts that emerged
within 1 year of fire.

Mature crown-scorched trees subjected to surface-level grassfire replace
their leaves the next year with no apparent ill effects [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Blue oak may recover poorly following moderate-severity fire, and some
ecotypes within this species will fail to sprout following even
low-severity fire [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].  A prescribed fire was conducted on a cattle
ranch in Madera County to eliminate dense brush stands.  Preburn
vegetation consisted of blue and interior live oaks with an understory
of mixed chaparral brush.  Many blue oak seedlings and mature trees were
completely killed by the fire.  A few new seedlings emerged at postfire
year 1.  Blue oak recovery was as follows:

                    Plot One            Plot Two           Plot Three

<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Blue oak has evolved under a regime of low-severity grassland fires at
intervals of 8 to 14 years [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Based upon limited research,
low-severity fire appears to favor species establishment [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Frequent
fire decreases the relative dominance of the annual grasses which
frequently outcompete blue oak seedlings while increasing the relative
dominance of forbs [<a href="#58">58</a>].  Fire also eliminates the thatch layer that
inhibits establishment of aboveground germinants.  Blue oak sprouts may
have a higher probablity of survival to sexual maturity than true
seedlings, although the data are not yet conclusive [<a href="#47">47</a>].  Managers
should be aware of the sprouting capability of blue oak recruitment
within their jurisdiction before conducting prescribed burning over
large areas of blue oak woodland.  Cool or low-severity fire is
recommended when using fire as a managemnent tool for this species.
