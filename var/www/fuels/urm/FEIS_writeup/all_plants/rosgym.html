<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rosa gymnocarpa

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Baldhip rose serves as an important year-round food source for mammals,
birds, and insects.  Livestock will browse baldhip rose when available
[<a href="#37">37</a>].  Baldhip rose is considered poor wildlife browse in parts of
California [<a href="#4">4</a>], but in British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest,
white-tailed deer and mule deer use of baldhip rose has been noted,
particularly in burned areas [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  The fruits (hips) persist
throughout the winter, and are eaten by small mammals, birds, and
insects [<a href="#4">4</a>].  In northern Idaho, ruffed grouse utilized the hips, but
infrequently [<a href="#18">18</a>].

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Native Americans utilized the hips and flowers of baldhip rose.  The
hips are high in vitamin C and are also a source of calcium,
phosphorous, and iron [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Leaves were often chewed and applied to
reduce pain and swelling, and were also used to make tea [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Baldhip rose is still used as a food source by the Nuxalk of British
Columbia.  The wild hips are harvested for food each year from August to
October [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Baldhip rose is highly tolerant to browsing by wildlife.  Livestock
browsing, however, retards the spread of baldhip rose, possibly through
rhizome damage from trampling [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  Baldhip rose appears to be
little affected by disturbances such as logging or burning [<a href="#27">27</a>].
Baldhip rose is not tolerant of excessive frost or harsh winters [<a href="#7">7</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rosa gymnocarpa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Baldhip rose is a native, long-lived, deciduous shrub generally 3 feet
(1 m) or less in height; however, heights of 3 to 9 feet (1-3 m) have
been reported [<a href="#11">11</a>].  The stems are slender with straight prickles.  The
compound leaves have five to seven leaflets that are 0.5 to 1 inch
(1-2.5 cm) long and 0.25 to 0.5 inch (0.6-1.2 cm) wide [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  Baldhip
rose is rhizomatous and has a shallow root structure [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte
   Chamaephyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction:  Baldhip rose attains sexual maturity at 3 to 5
years [<a href="#18">18</a>].  The seeds are eaten and dispersed by birds and mammals
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Information on seed viability and germination is lacking.

Vegetative reproduction:  Baldhip rose sprouts from the root crown and
rhizomes [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Baldhip rose occurs predominantly in the low-shrub layer of moist,
shaded forests of British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest.  It is
generally found at elevations of 5,000 feet (1,500 m) or less.  It is
well adapted to mesic-coniferous understories and grows best on eastern
and southern exposures [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  It is found in both mountainous and
riparian areas [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Baldhip rose is adapted to a variety of moisture
conditions but fares better on slightly dry sites [<a href="#22">22</a>].  It is adapted
to a short growing season.

Baldhip rose is found on coarse-textured, well-drained soils such as
sandy loams, loamy sands, and cobbly loams [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].



<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Baldhip rose is shade tolerant; it persists from the initial plant
community to climax.  It flourishes initially with thinning and opening
of the canopy, but then slows in growth [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Baldhip rose grows in
full sunlight but has a higher overall survival rate in the shade [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Baldhip rose flowers in the late spring and early summer [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Hips
appear at the end of July and remain on the plant throughout the winter
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rosa gymnocarpa

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Baldhip rose is well adapted to low- to medium-severity fires.  It
sprouts from both root crowns and rhizomes.  It is also an off-site
colonizer [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Small shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Rhizomatous shrub, rhizome in soil
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rosa gymnocarpa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Aboveground portions of the plant are killed by fire.  Root crowns and
underground rhizomes typically survive low- to moderate-severity fires
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Severe fires can cause damage to root crowns,
decreasing potential regrowth [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Baldhip rose rapidly recovers following low- to medium-severity fires.
Top-killed plants typically sprout vigorously from the root crown or
rhizomes [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].

Seedlings are rarely observed in a burn area [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  No seedlings were
present on clearcut 2-year-old burns in a western redcedar/queencup
beadlily (Thuja plicata/Clintonia uniflora) habitat type in northern
Idaho [<a href="#26">26</a>].
