<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Oxydendrum arboreum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Sourwood grows in upland forests of the southeastern United States.  It
is found from southern Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana, to southeastern
Louisiana and the panhandle of Florida.  It also grows in the
mountainous regions of Kentucky and Tennesse and along the Atlantic
Coast from North Carolina to Virginia.  The main range of sourwood lies
between 30 and 40 degrees N. and 75 and 92 degrees W.  Sourwood reaches
its largest size on the western slopes of the Great Smoky Mountains in
Tennessee [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Oxydendrum arboreum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Sourwood is of little value as a commercial timber species.  The wood
is used to make tool handles and for fuel.  Sourwood is used with a
mixture of other species for pulp [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Sourwood sprouts are often browsed by white-tailed deer [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  In a
study on 35 acres (14 ha) of the Pisgah National Forest in North
Carolina, browse utilization of sourwood twigs by white-tailed deer was
74 percent [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Sourwood snags provide cavity-nesting sites for various birds in
southern Appalachian forests [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Sourwood is occasionally used as an ornamental because of the brilliant
fall color of its leaves and midsummer flowers.  The flowers of sourwood
are also an important source of honey [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Sourwood sprouts often compete with the establishment of more desirable
species in second-growth and cutover areas [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Methods and
effectiveness of herbicide treatment for controlling sourwood and other
undesirable hardwoods have been given in detail [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].

Damaging Agents:  Several insects attack sourwood.  The dogwood-twig
borer (Oberea tripunctata) and the twig girdler (Oncideres cingulata)
attack the twigs.  The fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea) and the hickory
horn devil (the larvae of the regal moth [Citheronia regalis]) consume
the foliage.  There are no known serious diseases that affect sourwood
[<a href="#32">32</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Oxydendrum arboreum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sourwood is a native, deciduous, medium-sized tree, 40 to 60 feet (12-15
m) tall [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  It develops a slender trunk and small crown in dense
stands.  In the open it forms a short, often leaning trunk dividing into
several stout, ascending limbs [<a href="#32">32</a>].  The inflorescence is a raceme
emanating from a central axis.  The simple, alternate leaves are 4 to 7
inches (10-18 cm) long and variable in shape.  The fruit is a capsule
0.25 to 0.5 inch (6-13 mm) long containing many tiny seeds [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].
No information on the rooting habit of sourwood was found in the
literature.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Seed production and dissemination:  Estimated seed production ranging
from 1,850,000 to 5,500,000 seeds per pound (4,080,000-12,250,000
seeds/kg) has been reported [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  The fruits are shed in the fall
and the seeds are dispersed gradually throughout the winter by the
dehiscing capsule.  Sourwood seeds germinate well without special
treatment [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].

Seedling development:  Germination is epigeal.  Seedbed requirements for
sourwood have not been reported.  In the Piedmont, sourwood seed
germination and establishment may occur on litter and under partially
shaded conditions.  Techniques for sourwood seed collection, storage,
and germination have been described [<a href="#32">32</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Sourwood sprouts prolifically and persistently
from the stump and root crown [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  It is difficult to propagate
from cuttings; no reports were found of propagation from grafting [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
In the central Appalachian Mountains sourwood is most abundant on
subxeric open slopes and ridges occupied by chestnut oak (Quercus
prinus), white oak (Q. alba), scarlet oak (Q. coccinea), and Virginia
pine (Pinus virginiana).  It is less frequent on more mesic sites such
as coves and sheltered slopes.  Throughout this area sourwood is found
up to 5,000 feet (1,520 m) but rarely to 5,600 feet (1,710 m) in
elevation [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].

Sourwood grows throughout the Piedmont uplands.  It is also found along
Piedmont streams on well-drained lowland areas not subject to flooding.
In the Coastal Plain it is found on gently rolling areas.  Toward the
coast it is restricted to old dunes and well-drained slopes and ridges
above streams and swamp borders.  Sourwood is commonly found growing on
soils in the orders Ultisols, Inceptisols, and Entisols [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].

Other associates of sourwood in addition to the cover type species are
sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron
tulipifera), southern red oak (Q. falcata), red and sugar maple (Acer
rubrum and A. saccharum), shagbark, bitternut, pignut, and mockernut
hickory (Carya ovata, C. cordiformis, C. glabra, and C. tomentosa),
white ash (Fraxinus americanus), American beech (Fagus grandifolia),
eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida),
sassafras (Sassafras albidum), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana),
eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), and redbud (Cercis canadensis)
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative seral species.

Sourwood is shade tolerant.  In the Piedmont sourwood seedlings and
saplings are found in all stages of successsion from young pine (Pinus
spp.) stands to oak-hickory (Quercus spp.- Carya spp.)  forests.
Sourwood's response to release is not known [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Sourwood blooms from late June to August; the fruit ripens from
September through October [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Oxydendrum arboreum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Sourwood has the ability to sprout from the root crown or stump
following fire [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tree with adventitious-bud root crown/root sucker

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Oxydendrum arboreum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Low-severity fire typically top-kills sourwood [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  Oosting [<a href="#31">31</a>]
reports that a single high-severity ground fire completely eliminated
sourwood from a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) community in North Carolina.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Sourwood is usually an increaser following low-severity fire [<a href="#32">32</a>].
Following an early summer prescribed fire on the Sumter National Forest
in South Carolina, sourwood stem density increased from 33 stems per acre
(82 stem/ha) to 420 stems per acre (1,040 stems/ha) [<a href="#38">38</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
If used as a management tool, Trousdell [<a href="#39">39</a>] recommends one winter fire
followed by three summer fires as the treatment most effective in
controlling sourwood.
