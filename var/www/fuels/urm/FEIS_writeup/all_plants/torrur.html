<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Tortula ruralis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Tortula ruralis is a cosmopolitan species found in arctic, boreal,
temperate, and desert regions.  It is distributed throughout Canada,
much of the United States, Mexico, and the Pacific islands
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  It apparently is more common in western North America
than in the eastern provinces and states [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  The author has been
unable to determine if T. ruralis occurs in the southeastern United
States.

Tortula ruralis is widespread in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, North
and South Africa, South America, and Australia [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Tortula ruralis occurs in a wide variety of habitats, including
arctic-alpine tundra, wet and dry coniferous forests, grasslands,
sagebrush, and deserts [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  The author has been unable to
determine if T. ruralis occurs in southeastern ecosystems or in
broadleaf forests.

Although T. ruralis can be an important ground cover component, it
generally is not a dominant species.  However, the following publication
classifies T. ruralis as a dominant ground cover species in purple
pinegrass (Calamagrostis purpurascens) vegetation types in the Yukon
Territory:

Vegetation types and environmental factors associated with Foothills Gas
  Pipeline Route, Yukon Territory [<a href="#38">38</a>]

Species commonly associated with T. ruralis in sagebrush-grassland
habitats include basin big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp.
tridentata), Wyoming big sagebrush (A. t. ssp. wyomingensis), gray low
sagebrush (A. arbuscula ssp. arbuscula), bluebunch wheatgrass
(Pseudoroegneria spicata), Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis), cheatgrass
(Bromus tectorum), Thurber needlegrass (Stipa thurberiana), bottlebrush
squirreltail (Elymus elymoides), Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda), phlox
(Phlox spp.), broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), hawksbeard

<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Cryptogamic soil crusts, including crusts formed by T. ruralis, are an
important component of many arid rangeland ecosystems in the western
United States.  They are important in the reduction of soil erosion, and
facilitate vascular plant seedling establishment by improving water
penetration and reducing runoff [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Soils with high electrical
conductivity, high phosphorous, and high salt contents facilitate the
formation of cryptogam crusts [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Heavy grazing, especially during
seasons of low precipitation, high temperature, and persistent winds can
seriously damage or destroy crusts formed by T. ruralis and other
cryptogams.  During these seasons, T. ruralis is most likely dormant and
brittle, and very susceptible to trampling by livestock [<a href="#2">2</a>].  In Navaho
National Monument, Arizona, T. ruralis was reduced from 6.3 percent
cover in ungrazed areas to 1.0 percent cover in heavily grazed areas
[<a href="#6">6</a>].

In semiarid and arid grasslands of Canyonlands National Park, Utah,
cryptogams, including T. ruralis, are instrumental in the build-up of
organic matter and soil nutrients.  Cryptogam cover stabilizes soils
eroded by heavy winds and torrential rains, especially in undisturbed
areas [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Relative abundance of T. ruralis was "significantly
reduced" in formerly grazed areas, but was high in undisturbed climax
grasslands.  The ungrazed areas of the park had an average of six
cryptogam species per site, with a total cryptogram coverage of 38
percent.  The formerly grazed areas had an average of two cryptogam
species per site, with a total coverage of 5 percent.  This difference
suggests that cryptogam species such as T. ruralis may play a more
important role in the stability of desert grasslands than previously
recognized.  The surface soils of formerly grazed areas had less organic
matter, less available phosphorous, and higher calcium content due to
slow sheet erosion caused by a lack of protection from an established
cryptogam cover [<a href="#26">26</a>].

In sagebrush types in Idaho and Oregon, T. ruralis litter and cover may
exclude or retard the growth of perennial grasses such as bluebunch
wheatgrass, Thurber needlegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].
However, this may be because T. ruralis occurs on sites that tend to
have less organic matter accumulation, decreased cation exchange
capacity, and decreased total nitrogen compared to sites that support
the perennial grass species [<a href="#41">41</a>].

Drought and dessication tolerance of T. ruralis has been studied
extensively in order to determine if similar physiological mechanisms
will improve drought resistance of commercial crops [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  T.
ruralis can be dried to less than 20 percent of its original fresh
weight and will immediately resume protein synthesis upon rehydration
[<a href="#13">13</a>].  Metabolic activities will resume even after 70 years of
dessication [<a href="#34">34</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Tortula ruralis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Tortula ruralis is a short, erect moss that forms fairly large, loose to
dense tufts.  Stems are usually dichotomously branched and stand 0.4 to
1.6 inches (1-4 cm) high.  The conspicuous gametophyte is anchored to
the soil by rhizoids [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Tortula ruralis undergoes marked
morphological and color changes between wet and dry states.  When wet,
leaves are not twisted around the stem, and it is bright green.  When
dry, leaves twist around the stem, and it is red-brown in color
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  It is generally a xerophytic moss, and is highly drought and
dessication tolerant [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Tortula ruralis is dioecious, and undergoes a distinct annual
reproductive cycle [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  It also spreads vegetatively by forming
gemmae.  When gemmae detach and disperse to favorable sites, a new
gametophyte is formed [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Tortula ruralis spororphytes probably
also spread by fragmentation.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Tortula ruralis is found in a wide range of sites including, but not
limited to, sandy lake shores, rock, nunataks, and hummocks
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  It grows on rocks and soils of many types, but they
are most often calcareous [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Moisture regimes where T. ruralis
occurs vary from arid and semiarid to mesic, and it is found from low to
high elevations [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  On Ellesmere Island, Northwest Territories,
T. ruralis is found on high arctic uplands from sea level to 3,300 feet
(1,000 m) elevation [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

In western Montana, T. ruralis is part of the moss mats that invade
interstices between rocks on talus slides.  They play an important part
in talus succession.  The moss mats eventually form a carpet over the
rocks, stabilizing the talus formation.  The talus then colonized by higher
plants [<a href="#31">31</a>].  In sagebrush-steppe types in western Colorado, Bonham [<a href="#4">4</a>]
classifies T. ruralis as a stress-tolerant ruderal.

Tortula ruralis tolerates full sun to full shade [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  It is
abundant in climax grasslands [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  It is also found in climax
grand fir (Abies grandis)/queencup beadlily (Clintonia uniflora)
habitats in the Swan Valley, Montana [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Members of the T. ruralis
complex form climax moss associations in central Idaho forests [<a href="#39">39</a>].

Tortula ruralis had the following relative abundance and cover
percentage during successive stages of recovery from grazing in
Canyonlands National Park, Utah (first samples were taken 5 years
after grazing pressure had been eliminated) [<a href="#25">25</a>]:

              Year Sampled      Relative Abundance           Cover
______________________________________________________________(%)________
Ungrazed         1967                 9130                   18.0
Grazed           1967                  660                    1.35
Grazed           1977                 6900                    4.0


In Camp Floyd State Park, Utah, T. ruralis constituted 0.3 and 6.1
percent of the cover in areas not grazed for 7 and 20 years,
respectively [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
In New Mexico, twisted moss branches appear in mid-winter, lengthen
slowly through the spring, and rapidly through the summer.
Fertilization takes place in early winter.  Female gametophytes occur
from December to June but male gametophytes are rarely observed [<a href="#33">33</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Specific information on the fire ecology of T. ruralis is lacking.
However, poikilohydric plants such as T. ruralis dry quickly during
periods of low relative humidity because of their absence of roots and
water storage tissue, and low resistance to water loss.  It is
therefore assumed that T. ruralis is highly flammable under dry
conditions.

<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Information on the response of T. ruralis to fire is sparse.  One study
in Scotland reported that T. ruralis was present in burned heaths within
the first few years following fire [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Following a 1975 fire in a shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia)-black
greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus) community in Camp Floyd State Park,
Utah, an unnamed Tortula species was absent from burned sites for at
least 7 years.  The species had an average cover in unburned controls of
7.2 and 6.1 percent in 1980 and 1982, respectively [<a href="#23">23</a>].
