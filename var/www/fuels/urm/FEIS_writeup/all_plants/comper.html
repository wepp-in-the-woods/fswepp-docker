<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Sweetfern fruits are eaten by flickers [<a href="#7">7</a>].  It has limited use as food
and cover for cottontail rabbits and ruffed grouse [<a href="#23">23</a>].  In Minnesota
moose browse sweetfern in winter and spring, and white-tailed deer
browse it in winter only [<a href="#18">18</a>].  In oak forests of Pennsylvania
white-tailed deer browse sweetfern most heavily in winter and spring,
somewhat during fall, and not at all during summer [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Food values for sweetfern have been listed [<a href="#31">31</a>]:

Time/Place          crude prot.  crude fiber   fat    N-free extract

March/Mich.         13.3%        22.1%         5.6%   55.7%

Winter/Maine        10.8%         ---          ---     ---


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Prairie chickens and sharp-tailed grouse use sweetfern for nesting cover [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Because sweetfern fixes nitrogen and is drought tolerant, it is ideal
for erosion control on dry sandy banks, sand dunes, along roads, or
under powerlines [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  

Sweetfern colonized metal-contaminated soils near Sudbury, Ontario, 1
year following application of dolomite limestone [<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Sweetfern makes a good garden shrub because it maintains its 3- to
4-foot (1-1.3 m) height for a long time without pruning [<a href="#16">16</a>].  However,
it is difficult to propagate, and balled and burlapped plants often do
not survive.  Plants are best started with root cuttings [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Leaves
are used used for potpourri, and tea made from the leaves has been used
to relieve symptoms of dysentery [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Sweetfern is a host to sweetfern blister rust (Cronartium comptoniae),
which reduces growth of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) [<a href="#12">12</a>].  

Following logging sweetfern was more abundant on sites where operations
exposed bare mineral soil than on sites where slash was left [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Burning and disking following logging can stimulate the growth of
sweetfern so that it forms dense patches.  It can outcompete tree
seedlings under such circumstances [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium, V. myrtilloides) stands are
important for commercial crops in Canada and New England.  Sweetfern can
be a serious invader on these sites, but is also controlled easily with
chemicals such as picloram, dicamba, and 2,4-D [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Comptonia peregrina
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sweetfern is a low, deciduous, monoecious or dioecious shrub [<a href="#10">10</a>].  It
is drought and salt tolerant.  It grows from 1 to 4.5 feet (0.3-1.5 m)
high and has fragrant, pubescent foliage [<a href="#10">10</a>].  The alternate, simple
leaves are fernlike and 2.5 to 4.7 inches (6-12 cm) long [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  The
catkins are clustered at the ends of the branches and are 1.2 to 1.6
inches (3-4 cm) long [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Seeds grow in burlike heads, with four per
fruit [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sweetfern reproduces by rhizomes and seed, although it is difficult to
propagate by seed and some after-ripening may be necessary [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  It
spreads mainly by rhizomes, forming thickets in sun or partial shade
[<a href="#16">16</a>].  Sweetfern matures sexually in 2 to 3 years [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Seeds can
remain viable in the soil for as long as 70 years [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sweetfern grows in openings in coniferous forests in well-drained, dry,
acid, sandy or gravelly soils [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Because it fixes nitrogen, it
does well on disturbed sites or sites with sterile soil, such as
abandoned fields and pine barrens [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  In the Adirondack Mountains
of New York, it grows on limestone soils from 200 to 2,300 feet (61-700
m) elevation [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Sweetfern is a shade intolerant invader of newly opened canopies and
disturbed sites [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  It appeared in early seral vegetation
following logging of an old-growth eastern white pine (pinus strobus)
forest in Connecticut [<a href="#7">7</a>].  It has also invaded disturbed forests in
central Canada [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
In the upper Midwest sweetfern blossoms in April and May and fruits
ripen in autumn.  In Canada sweetfern blossoms from May through June and
seeds mature from July through September [<a href="#13">13</a>].  In the northeastern
United States seeds mature in August [<a href="#31">31</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Sweetfern colonizes newly burned sites primarily by sprouting from
rhizomes [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Small shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Rhizomatous shrub, rhizome in soil
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Comptonia peregrina
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire can either reduce or increase the frequency of sweetfern [<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
Plant composition was studied on the New Jersey Pine Barrens following
both wildfire and prescribed burning [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Sweetfern was not present on
the unburned control sites, but was found on burned sites the second and
third postfire years.  The conrol site had not been burned for more than
50 years.  Two other sites were burned 14 years and 16 years following
wildfire.  Sweetfern was not found on the 14-year-old site, but did
occur on the 16-year-old site the third postfire year [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Average frequencies of sweetfern were determined on pine barrens in
Wisconsin.  Two sites were subject to both wildfire and periodic
controlled burning.  Site One had not had wildfire for more than 4
decades.  Frequency of sweetfern on unburned plots of this site averaged
49 percent, while frequency on burned plots averaged 22 percent.  Site
Two had not experienced wildfire for more than 3 decades.  Average
frequency of sweetfern on unburned plots of Site Two was 73 percent,
while on burned plots it was 86 percent.  No fire history was given for
Site Three.  Sweetfern avergae frequency at this site was 41 percent on
unburned plots and 49 percent on burned plots.  Sweetfern average
frequency on Site Four, which had not had fire for 13 to 20 years, was
54 percent on unburned plots and 71 percent on burned plots [<a href="#36">36</a>].

Little bluestem stands in Connecticut, subject to periodic burning for
more than a decade, showed a fourfold increase in sweetfern compared to
control plots [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Sweetfern's presence seemed to enhance little
bluestem growth, probably because of sweetfern's nitrogen-fixing
ability.

Burning and clipping blueberry (Vaccinium spp.) stands in Ontario
resulted in increases of sweetfern (considered a weedy species under
these circumstances) in summer and autumn [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Plots treated in spring
showed only slight increases of sweetfern.


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Sweetfern increases following fire [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  In jack pine barrens of
Ontario, it sprouted following fires that burned as hot as 932 degrees
Fahrenheit (500 deg C) [<a href="#33">33</a>].  


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Following a May wildfire in northeastern Minnesota, sweetfern increased
in percent cover from postfire year 1 through 4 on three burned sites,
remained relatively unchanged in two burned sites, and showed slight
increases on two burned sites [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Percent occurrence of sweetfern was
determined for mixed conifer hardwood stands in northeastern Minnesota.
On Site One the fire occured in late April with little or no burning of
the soil.  Sweetfern increased from 23 percent occurrence during
postfire year 3 to 43 percent during postfire year 14.  On Site Two the
fire burned in mid-July with little or no soil burned, but the fire was
considered "hot."  Sweetfern increased from 57 percent occurrence during
postfire year 2 to 80 percent during postfire year 11 [<a href="#19">19</a>].
