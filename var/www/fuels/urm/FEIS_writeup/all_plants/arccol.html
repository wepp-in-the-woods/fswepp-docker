<b>ABBREVIATION : </b>
ARCCOL

<b>SYNONYMS : </b>
   Arctostaphylos tracyi Eastw.


<b>SCS PLANT CODE : </b>
   ARCO3


<b>COMMON NAMES : </b>
   hairy manzanita


<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of hairy manzanita is
Arctostaphylos columbiana Piper [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Varieties recognized by
some authorities are as follows [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>]:

     A. columbiana var. columbiana
     A. columbiana var. tracyi (Eastwd.) Adams

The latter taxon is a glabrous variant occurring in Humbolt County,
California.  Because it is an intrapopulational variant, Wells [<a href="#35">35</a>] has
named it A. columbiana forma tracyi (Eastwd.) Wells.  He also recognizes
a highly setose form of hairy manzanita:  A. columbiana forma setossima
(Eastwd.) Wells, which occurs in Mendocino County, California.

Hairy manzanita hybridizes with bearberry (A. uva-ursi) to produce A.
Xmedia Greene.  It also hybridizes with pinemat manzanita (A.
nevadensis) in the Mount Hood region of Oregon, where ranges of the two
species overlap [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Hairy manzanita is distributed in the Coast Ranges from Sonoma County,
California, north to Vancouver Island and Vancouver, British Columbia
[<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  The largest populations are in southwest Oregon [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Hairy

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Hairy manzanita is a component of understories of various western
coniferous forests [<a href="#20">20</a>].  It also occurs as scattered plants or in small
clusters interspersed with other shrub species in forest clearings
[<a href="#10">10</a>]. 

Overstory associates of hairy manzanita not listed in Distribution and
Occurrence include golden chinquapin (Chrysolepsis chrysophylla), bishop
pine (Pinus muricata), Bolander pine (P. contorta var. bolanderi), shore
pine (P. contorta var. contorta), pygmy cypress (Cupressus goveniana
spp. pygmaea), and grand fir (Abies grandis) [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].

Common shrub associates are Oregon-grape (Mahonia nervosa), salal
(Gaultheria shallon), whiteleaf manzanita (Arctostaphyloa viscida),
snowbrush (Ceanothus velutinus), deerbrush (C. integerrimus), and vine
maple (Acer circinatum) [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].

Herbaceous associates include beargrass (Xerophyllum tenax), Canada
horseweed (Conyza canadensis), darkblue penstemon (Penstemon
davidsonii), Oregon stonecrop (Sedum oregonese), and Ross sedge (Carex
rossii).  Parsley fern (Cryptogramma acrostichoides) is a common fern
associate [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Black bear, coyote, black-tailed deer, and various small mammals and
birds eat hairy manzanita fruit [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  The leaves and stems are
unpalatable to browsing wildlife and livestock [<a href="#28">28</a>].

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Hairy manzanita is planted as an ornamental [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Timber Management and Control:  Hairy manzanita competes with young
conifers in plantations and Christmas tree farms [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  It is highly
susceptible to aerosol application of 2,4-D or 2,4,5-T, which results in
nearly 100 percent kill in the Pacific Northwest [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Gratkowski [<a href="#10">10</a>]
reported 2,4,5-T as slightly more effective in southwest Oregon.

Cultivation:  Hairy manzanita is propagated from stem cuttings [<a href="#21">21</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arctostaphylos columbiana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Hairy manzanita is a native, evergreen, erect shrub.  Mature plants are
from 2.5 to 16.6 feet (0.8-5.0 m) high with a broadly spreading oval
crown supported by a single trunk.  Hairy manzanita lacks a lignotuber
[<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Bristly, glandular branchlets distinguish its foliage [<a href="#20">20</a>].
The often viscid fruit is a drupe containing 4 to 10 irregularly
separable nutlets [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Hairy manzanita seed falls beneath the parent plant or is
disseminated by animals.  The seedcoat requires scarification prior to
germination, which is accomplished either in the stomach of animals or
by fire [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Fire best scarifies the seedcoat and results in greater
rates of germination [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Charred wood leachate may further stimulate
germination of fire-scarified seed [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].

Vegetative:  All manzanitas are capable of layering [<a href="#5">5</a>], but hairy
manzanita probably layers only rarely because of its erect growth habit.
It does not sprout from the root crown [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Hairy manzanita grows in a variety of soil textures and parent
materials.  Soil pH typically ranges from 5.0 to 7.0 [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  It can,
however, tolerate extremely acid soils; it grows in dwarfed form in
podsol soils of the pygmy forest of Mendocino County, California.  At a
pH of 2.8 to 3.9, soils of the pygmy forest are some of the most acidic
known [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Hairy manzanita occurs at elevations up to 2,500 feet (762 m) in
California [<a href="#24">24</a>], up to 3,750 feet (1,143 m) in Oregon [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>], and up to
4,950 feet (1,509 m) in Washington [<a href="#34">34</a>].




<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Hairy manzanita is an initial or secondary colonizer of disturbed plant
communities.  It is commonly found in communities which develop after
removal of the forest overstory, such as the vine maple-parsley fern
community.  Hairy manzanita persists through later seres in the
understory of open-canopy forest.  It does not tolerate deep shade, and
does not occur in closed canopy old-growth forest [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Hairy manzanita flowers from March through May in California [<a href="#24">24</a>].  In
Linn County, Oregon, plants flower in early June and set fruit from mid-
to late June [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Seeds are dispersed from late summer until the
following spring [<a href="#3">3</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arctostaphylos columbiana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fire activates hairy manzanita seed by scarifying the seedcoat.
Oligosaccharides in charred wood leachate may further enhance rates of
postfire germination [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Shrub without adventitious-bud root crown
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire kills hairy manzanita [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Current information concerning hairy manzanita's response to fire is
limited to studies of its regeneration following clearcutting and slash
burning in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forest types.  It was
reported as establishing from seed after such forest management near
Blue River, Oregon [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Further details were not available.
Schoonmaker and McKee [<a href="#29">29</a>] reported postfire hairy manzanita seedling
recruitment on the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon.  Sites
were broadcast burned and planted with Douglas-fir seedlings.  No hairy
manzanita seedlings were found on transects at postfire year 2, but mean
transect cover value of hairy manzanita seedlings was 0.04 percent at
postfire year 5.  Mean transect cover value was greatest (0.15%) at
postfire year 15.

A comparison of hairy manzanita cover on burned versus adjacent unburned
plots was made near Oakridge, Oregon.  Fire treatment was broadcast
burning of slash.  At postfire year 9, hairy manzanita cover was 3.2
percent on burned plots and 0.3 percent on unburned plots [<a href="#30">30</a>].
