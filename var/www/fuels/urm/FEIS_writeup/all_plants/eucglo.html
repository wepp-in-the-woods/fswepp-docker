<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Eucalyptus globulus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Bluegum eucalyptus is native to Tasmania and southeastern Australia.  It
was introduced into California in 1856 and into Hawaii in about 1865.
It has naturalized in both states [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].  It is a fairly common
ornamental in Arizona but has not naturalized there [<a href="#7">7</a>].  The planted
range in California extends from Humboldt County south to San Diego
County, with best growth in the coastal fog belt near San Francisco.
There are numerous plantings in the Central Valley from Redding south to
Bakersfield and San Bernardino.  Hawaii has about 12,000 acres (5,000
ha) of planted and naturalized bluegum eucalyptus, almost all of them on
the islands of Hawaii and Maui [<a href="#7">7</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Most dense bluegum eucalyptus stands in California and Hawaii are almost
devoid of understory vegetation, except for a few hardy grasses.  In
Hawaii, firetree (Myrica faga) sometimes invades bluegum stands, and the
noxious passion fruit vine (Passiflora mollissima) has been found in
young bluegum eucalyptus coppice stands [<a href="#7">7</a>].

In its native habitat bluegum eucalyptus grows in pure stands and in
mixtures with many other eucalypt species.  In California, it has been
planted with forest redgum eucalyptus and river redgum eucalyptus (E.
camaldulensis).  In Hawaii, it has been planted with many other
eucalypts [<a href="#7">7</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Eucalyptus globulus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Bluegum eucalyptus is an important source of fuelwood in many countries.
It burns freely, leaves little ash, and produces good charcoal [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].
Plantations can be harvested for firewood every 7 years [<a href="#17">17</a>].  It is
also widely used as pulpwood [<a href="#42">42</a>].  The wood is unsuitable for lumber
because of excessive cracking, shrinkage, and collapse on drying [<a href="#43">43</a>],
but is used for fenceposts, poles, and crates [<a href="#33">33</a>].



<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Bluegum eucalyptus foliage is unpalatable to cattle, sheep, and goats
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].
  


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Bluegum eucalyptus is used for windbreaks, shelterbelts, and sight and
sound barriers along highways [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  After it becomes established,
however, it may suppress or eliminate other species [<a href="#7">7</a>].  


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Bluegum eucalyptus is widely planted as an ornamental throughout
California [<a href="#17">17</a>].  It is also a source of nectar for honey production
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].

Bluegum eucalyptus oil has numerous medical applications.  In
pharmaceutical preparations it has diaphoretic, expectorant,
insecticidal, and oestrogenic properties.  The oil has antifungal and
antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus,
and Escherichia coli. Eucalyptus oil is generally nonirritating,
nonsensitizing, and nonphototoxic to the skin.  When taken internally,
it may be toxic to the kidneys and can be a nervous system depressant
[<a href="#45">45</a>].

The oil is used as a flavoring agent in cold and cough medicines.  It is
used in disinfectants, antiseptic liniments, ointments, toothpastes, and
mouthwashes.  It is used by veterinarians for treating influenza in
horses, distemper in dogs, and septicaemia in all animals.

Bluegum eucalyptus oil is used as a flavor ingredient in boiled sweets
and food products such as beverages, dairy desserts, candy, baked goods,
gelatins, puddings, and meat products [<a href="#45">45</a>].  The cosmetic industry uses
it as a fragrance component in soaps, detergents, air fresheners, bath
oils, and perfumes [<a href="#45">45</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Bluegum eucalyptus is highly flammable and should not be planted near
homes and other structures [<a href="#27">27</a>].  For information regarding the
eradication of bluegum eucalyptus, see Fiedler [<a href="#14">14</a>], Groenendaal [<a href="#17">17</a>],
and Rice [<a href="#38">38</a>].

The leaves of bluegum eucalyptus release a number of terpenes and
phenolic acids.  These chemicals may be responsible for the paucity of
accompanying vegetation in plantations [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Natural fog drip from
bluegum eucalyptus inhibits the growth of annual grass seedlings in
bioassays, suggesting that such inhibition occurs naturally [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  At
least one leaf extract has been shown to strongly inhibit root growth of
seedlings of other species [<a href="#4">4</a>].  The frass from the chrysomelid beetle,
which feeds upon bluegum eucalyptus, is allelopathic to grasses at very
low levels [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Bluegum eucalyptus is used short-rotation fuel biomass plantations
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  The coppice method of regeneration is most common because
it allows, at least for a limited number of years, repeated harvesting
at short intervals and exploitation of exceptionally high early growth
rates [<a href="#35">35</a>].

In Hawaii, four 64-year-old coppice stands were studied 2 to 5 years
after logging.  Seventy to eighty percent of the stumps had sprouted.
All stands also had seedlings.  The seedlings made up more than 20
percent of the total number of stems, but contributed very little to
volume as they were usually suppressed by the sprouting stems [<a href="#42">42</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Eucalyptus globulus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bluegum eucalyptus is an introduced, deciduous tree that generally grows
from 98 to 180 feet (30-55 m) tall [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].  Some bluegums have attained
heights of 260 feet (80 m) in California [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Most height growth of
bluegum eucalyptus occurs within the first 5 to 10 years; 60 to 70
percent of total height growth is achieved by about age 10.  Bluegum
eucalyptus typically grows in dense monocultures [<a href="#42">42</a>].

The sclerophyllous leaves are 4 to 11 inches (10-30 cm) long [<a href="#10">10</a>].  The
flower clusters develop within an envelope formed by two bracteoles
which split and are shed, exposing the flower buds [<a href="#24">24</a>].  The fruit is a
woody capsule 0.25 to 1 inch (6-25 mm) in diameter [<a href="#24">24</a>].  The bark is
shreddy, peeling in large strips [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Bluegum eucalyptus generally does not form a taproot.  It produces roots
throughout the soil profile, rooting several feet deep in some soils [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Seed production and dissemination:  Flowers are pollinated by insects
and hummingbirds [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Seed set begins at approximately 4 to 5 years of
age.  Good seed crops are produced in most locations at 3- to 5-year
intervals [<a href="#7">7</a>].  The seeds of are relatively small and abundant [<a href="#24">24</a>].
Capsules open immediately on ripening, and the seed is dispersed by wind
within 1 to 2 months [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Dispersal distance from one 131-foot (40
m) tree, with winds of 6 mph (10 km/h), was 66 feet (20 m) [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Newly
released seeds germinate within a few weeks under suitable conditions.
Germination is epigeal.  Seed collections from individual trees in
California had highly variable germination rates, ranging from 2 to 80
percent within a 30-day germination period [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Soil-stored seed under
older stands often germinates prolifically following logging or other
disturbance [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Bluegum eucalyptus sprouts readily from the
bole, from stumps of all sizes and ages, from the lignotuber, and from
the roots [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  The lignotuber can live for many years in the soil
after stems die back [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Bluegum eucalyptus also reproduces by
layering [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bluegum eucalyptus grows best in mediterranean climates, characterized
by cool, wet winters and dry, warm summers [<a href="#37">37</a>].  In coastal California,
it does well with only 21 inches (530 mm) of annual rainfall accompanied
by a pronounced dry season, primarily because frequent fogs compensate
for lack of rain [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Bluegum eucalyptus grows well on a wide range of soils, but requires
good drainage, low salinity, and a soil depth of 2 feet (0.6 m) or more.
In California, it grows best on deep alluvial soils because of the
greater moisture supply [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Hawaiian soils supporting bluegum
eucalyptus are about 3 feet (0.9 m) deep.  They are usually acidic,
moderately well-drained, silty clay loams [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  

In California, bluegum eucalyptus occurs at elevations below 1,000 feet
(300 m) [<a href="#32">32</a>].  It occurs at 1,400 to 6,000 feet (425-1,800 m) in Hawaii
[<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].
   


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

In Hawaii and California, bluegum eucalyptus regenerates within and near
the edges of plantations.  It does not spread far and rarely invades
wildlands [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].  It has, however, invaded an oak woodland on Angel
Island in the San Francisco Bay [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Bluegum eucalyptus is shade intolerant; failure to regenerate within
forests in the absence of fire is related to low light intensities [<a href="#3">3</a>].
Bluegum eucalyptus is drought tolerant and somewhat frost hardy.  Frost
resistance increases with maturity [<a href="#7">7</a>].
  


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
In California, flowering occurs from November to April.  Fruit ripens
from October to March, about 11 months after flowering.  In Hawaii, some
trees flower throughout the year, but flowering is heaviest in February
and March.  Fruit ripens throughout the year [<a href="#7">7</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Eucalyptus globulus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Most eucalyptus communities in Australia have evolved in the presence of
periodic fire [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Bluegum eucalyptus is highly flammable, but is
seldom killed by fire.  The bark catches fire readily, and deciduous
bark streamers and lichen epiphytes tend to carry fire into the canopy
and to disseminate fire ahead of the main front [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Other
features of bluegum eucalyptus that promote fire spread include heavy
litter fall, flammable oils in the foliage, and open crowns bearing
pendulous branches, which encourages maximum updraft [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  Despite the
presence of volatile oils that produce a hot fire, leaves of bluegum
eucalyptus are classed as intermediate in their resistance to
combustion, and juvenile leaves are highly resistant to flaming [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Adaptations to fire include seedbanking, sprouting, and heat-resistant
seed capsules [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].  Seed capsules protect the seed for a critical
short period as the fire reaches the crowns; this protection delays
penetration of heat to the seeds.  Seeds were protected for about 4
minutes from a lethal rise in temperature when capsules were subjected
to a heat of 826 degrees Fahrenheit (440 deg C) [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Following all
types of fire, an accelerated seed shed occurs, even where crowns are
only subjected to heat scorch.

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Eucalyptus globulus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Crown fire's effect upon bluegum eucalyptus varies.  Because the stringy
outer bark is highly flammable and bark thickness is readily reduced by
fire, past fire frequency largely determines the relative protection
bark offers.  Repeated fire damage to bark before bark thickness has
been restored may result in top-kill, or at times, tree mortality.  If
bark is sufficiently thick, bluegum eucalyptus branches survive crown
fire and send out epicormic sprouts [<a href="#50">50</a>].  No studies quantifying bark
thickness with tree survival were found.
  


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Bluegum eucalyptus recovers well from fire [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Epicormic sprouting is
common in trees only scorched by fire.  It is also common in trees where
crown fire occurred but bark was thick enough to protect dormant branch
buds.  Heat-damaged bark is shed, and sprouting proceeds rapidly [<a href="#50">50</a>].
Top-killed trees sprout from the lignotuber.  Vigorous sprouting is
supported by food reserves stored in the root system and lignotuber [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Bluegum eucalyptus also establishes from seed after fire.  Some seed is
already stored in the seedbank.  Release of crown-stored seed is
triggered by shoot death, and crown-stored seeds are rapidly
disseminated after fire [<a href="#50">50</a>].
  
In 1929, a catastrophic fire burned a bluegum eucalyptus stand in
California.  The forest regenerated to a fully stocked condition.  In
November 1946, a second fire burned much of the same area.  Again, the
forest regenerated.  By 1983, it was a very dense uneven-aged stand [<a href="#33">33</a>].  



<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fuel buildup occurs very rapidly in unmanaged bluegum eucalyptus stands
in California [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Fuel reduction programs can reduce wildfire
hazard, as can the establishment of fuelbreaks [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  

In December, 1972, the San Francisco Bay Area experienced a severe cold
snap, resulting in extensive frost damage to bluegum eucalyptus trees
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Frost-killed leaves and twigs increased bluegum eucalyptus
litter ten-fold.  By early 1973, following a particularly hot, dry
summer and autumn, the litter combined with standing dead and damaged
bluegums constituted a major fire hazard [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Several fuel
reduction methods were proposed:  mechanical removal of trees, thinning
of present stands, and prescribed fire.  The first two alternatives are
commonly applied now in freeze-killed or damaged stands.  Broadcast
fires have been used with success in undisturbed areas under reasonably
moist (13-19% fuel moisture) weather conditions.  Spring fires have
reduced fuel loads up to 87 to 96 percent without damage to overstory
trees.  Prescribed burning has been widely applied to eucalyptus forests
in Australia to reduce fuel loads and prevent wildfires [<a href="#1">1</a>].
