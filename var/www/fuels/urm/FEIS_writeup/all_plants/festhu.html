<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Thurber fescue is a climax species in a number of nonforested and
forested communities.  On grassland sites it often occurs as the climax
dominant and has been used as a series indicator.  Common associates
include Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis), Arizona fescue (F.
arizonicus), Parry's oatgrass (Danthonia parryi), and American vetch
(Vicia americana).  Shrubland series using Thurber fescue as an
understory indicator include mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia
tridentata ssp. vaseyana), mountain silver sagebrush (A. cana ssp.
viscidula), and mountain snowberry (Symphoricarpos oreophilus).  Thurber
fescue is also an understory indicator in bristlecone pine (Pinus
aristata), Colorado blue spruce-Douglas-fir (Picea pungens-Pseudotsuga
menziesii), and aspen (Populus tremuloides) series.

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Although not highly palatable, Thurber fescue, due to its sheer
abundance, contributes significantly to the forage resource of many
mountain bunchgrass communities in the Colorado Plateau region [<a href="#21">21</a>].  In
its area of best development in Colorado, Thurber fescue forms dense
stands and often represents 53 to 94 percent of the total grass cover.
Dry herbage production on these sites is approximately 2,400 pounds per
acre (2,140 kg/ha); litter production varies from 6,000 to 14,000 pounds
per acre (5,350-12,490 kg/ha) [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability ratings of Thurber fescue vary considerably throughout its
range [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  Thurber fescue is generally moderately palatable
to cattle and horses, and unpalatable to sheep [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Plants are
palatable into the fall, at which time snow accumulations make
high-elevation rangelands inaccessible to domestic livestock.

The palatability of Thurber fescue to livestock and wildlife in Colorado
and Utah has been rated as follows [<a href="#7">7</a>]:

Waterfowl                    ----      Poor


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Compared to associated mountain grassland species, the nutritional
quality of Thurber fescue is moderately high.  The following percentages
of crude protein, phosphorus, and calcium for Thurber fescue at various
phenological stages were reported [<a href="#17">17</a>]:

                                       Nutrient
                                 crude protein        Ph          Ca
Phenological stage

seed ripening and dispersal          8.6             0.14        0.39
regrowth and dormancy                7.0             0.12        0.31


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The cover value of Thurber fescue is poor for pronghorn, elk, mule deer,
and waterfowl; and good for small mammals, small nongame birds, and
upland game birds [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Little detailed information is available concerning the use of Thurber
fescue for rehabilitation of disturbed sites [<a href="#8">8</a>].  It preformed poorly
in Utah reseeding projects [<a href="#29">29</a>], but Welsh and others [<a href="#30">30</a>] indicate that
it may ultimately prove quite valuable in reclamation work.  Thurber
fescue naturally occupies and stabilizes steep slopes which might
otherwise be barren or only sparsely covered with vegetation, and can
survive periodic low soil moisture conditions [<a href="#22">22</a>].  On sites to which
it is adapted, Thurber fescue generally spreads rapidly and is able to
persist because of its early and vigorous growth habit, abundant seed
production, and successful seedling establishment [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Thurber fescue
is recommended for seeding sites in the subalpine, alpine, and
mountain-brush zones [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Paulsen [<a href="#30">30</a>] reported 98 percent germination
within 21 days at 41 degrees Fahrenheit (5 deg C).  Germination is
typically enhanced following storage at 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.5 deg
C).


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Thurber fescue is sensitive to heavy grazing and has been largely
eliminated from many sites it once occupied.  Plants produce little
regrowth if grazed past the vegetative stage [<a href="#27">27</a>].  On mountain
grassland ranges in good condition, 40 percent utilization of the annual
growth of Thurber fescue is considered acceptable [<a href="#27">27</a>].  On sites
subjected to heavy cattle grazing, Thurber fescue is usually replaced by
Idaho fescue and assorted bunchgrasses on coarse-textured soils, and by
Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) on fine-textured or compacted soils
[<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  In contrast, Thurber fescue typically becomes the
understory dominant in aspen stands where prolonged sheep grazing has
resulted in the decrease of preferred forbs and smaller grasses [<a href="#3">3</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Festuca thurberi
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Thurber fescue is a robust, cool-season, native, perennial bunchgrass.
It is densely tufted and produces thick mats of persistent, dried sheath
and culm bases [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Culms are erect and typically grow from 15.7
to 37.4 inches (40-91 cm) tall [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Leaves are scabruous and mostly
basal; heights range from 12 to 18 inches (30-45 cm).  On undisturbed
sites plants can form large diameter bunches.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Thurber fescue regenerates primarily from seed [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Plants
typically produce abundant seed which germinates readily.  Dramatic
declines in seed production have been documented on mountain grassland
sites in Colorado following a warm, dry growing season [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Flowering
is enhanced under cool, moist conditions [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Although some autumn
germination occurs, the majority of seeds germinate in the spring soon
after snowmelt, when cool temperatures coincide with high soil moisture
conditions.  Results of laboratory studies indicate optimal germination
occurs at 41 degrees Fahrenheit (5 deg C); at this temperature, 98
percent of seed germinated within 21 days.  Seed storage at 40.1 degrees
Fahrenheit (4.5 deg C) appears to enhance germination somewhat.

Field trials indicate that seeds germinate equally well on both bare
soil and litter.  Seedling establishment is quite high following good
seed years, with increased survival under high moisture conditions.
Apparently Thurber fescue can survive low soil moisture conditions,
which spruce seedling cannot tolerate.  Thurber fescue seedlings are
not, however, as drought tolerant as seedlings of Idaho fescue.

Vegetative:  Vegetative expansion of tufts occurs through tillering.
Thurber fescue is capable of marked tiller production following
herbicide applications; incompletely killed plants were able to recover
pretreatment basal diameters within 4 years [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Tiller production
apparently increases under dry conditions.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Thurber fescue is a mesophytic bunchgrass that is most common in
mountain grassland communities throughout the Colorado Plateau region at
elevations between 8,000 abd 12,000 feet (2,440-3,720 m) [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  At
its lower elevational limits, Thurber fescue occurs with mountain big
sagebrush on drier sites and with mountain silver sagebrush on more
mesic sites at higher elevations.  At its upper elevational limits it is
often contiguous with subalpine herbland communities.  At intermediate
elevations Thurber fescue is a major component of an extensive mosaic of
nonforested communitites interspersed within aspen-spruce-fir forests.
Typical grassland sites include open parks, dry meadows, open slopes,
and broad, rounded ridgetops; open stands of spruce, aspen, and
ponderosa pine comprise the overstory of forested ecotonal sites
adjacent to Thurber fescue grasslands.

Thurber fescue is often locally abundant and sometimes occurs in nearly
pure stands on undisturbed sites.  It typically occupies deep,
well-drained soils on xeric exposures.  Although soil parent materials
are diverse, Thurber fescue appears to grow best on deep shale or
glacial till [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Plants usually occupy sandy loam soils but also do
well on heavier clay loams [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Site topography ranges from concave to
gently rolling.  Thurber fescue grows well on steep slopes (up to 30
degrees) and stabilizes sites which would otherwise support little
vegetative cover.

Some common grassland associates include Idaho fescue, Letterman
needlegrass (Stipa lettermani), aspen fleabane (Erigeron macranthus),
beauty cinquefoil (Potentilla pulcherrima), Fremont geranium (Geranium
fremonti), and Kentucky bluegrass.

Elevational ranges of Thurber fescue in several western states vary as
follows [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>]:

        from 6,500 to 12,200 feet (1,982-3,720 m) in Colorado
             10,00 to 11,100 feet (3,048-3,384 m) in New Mexico
             8,000 to 11,000 feet (2,440-3,354 m) in Utah




<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Self-perpetuating stands of Thurber fescue are characteristic of climax
or late seral mountain grassland communities.  Dense stands apparently
represent an edaphic climax in that soils typify a mature grassland
profile [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Thurber fescue is also indicative of climax conditions on
ecotonal shrubland and forested sites adjacent to Thurber fescue
grasslands.  Thurber fescue decreases in response to grazing pressure.
It is apparently a component of early seral situations following fire
due to residual plant survival [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Thurber fescue is well adapted to a short and cool growing season.
Plants initiate growth very early in the spring and produce new leaves
while still under snowpack [<a href="#26">26</a>], but growth is generally slow until late
June.  The following phenology was reported for mountain grassland sites
in Colorado [<a href="#21">21</a>]:

	leaf elongation      early June to mid-July
	flower development   late June to late-July
	seed maturation &    early Auguust to mid-September  
	    dissemination

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
The fire ecology and adaptations of Thurber fescue have not been widely
documented.  They are probably similar to that of the morphogically and
ecologically similar rough fescue, which is well adapted to periodic
burning. (See rough fescue (Festuca scabrella) write-up in FEIS).

<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Detailed information on the response of Thurber fescue to fire is scant.
Johnston and Hendzel [<a href="#15">15</a>] reported increased densities of Thurber fescue
4 years after a spring prescribed burn on a late seral aspen/Thurber
fescue site in Colorado.  Thurber fescue is apparently able to recover
quite rapidly following herbicide applications.  Research involving
herbicide treatments on mountain grassland sites in Colorado indicates
that partially killed plants are able to recover pretreatment basal
diameters within 4 years.  Plants responded to disturbance by dramatic
increases in tiller production [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Presumably postfire recover of
Thurber fescue is dependent upon residual plant survival.
