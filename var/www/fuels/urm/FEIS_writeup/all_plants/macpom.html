<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Maclura pomifera
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Osage-orange is native to a narrow belt in eastern Texas, southeastern
Oklahoma, southwestern Arkansas, and the extreme northwest corner of
Louisiana.  This belt includes portions of the Blackland Prairies, Chiso
Mountains, and the Red River drainage [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Osage-orange has been
introduced into most of the conterminous United States and has become
naturalized throughout much of the eastern United States and the central
Great Plains [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Native and naturalized populations of osage-orange occur in rich
bottomland forests and on sandy terraces.  On the Trinity River
floodplain in Texas, mostly small (less than 8-inch [20 cm] diameter)
osage-orange occurs in bottomland forests dominated by cedar elm (Ulmus
crassifolia), sugarberry (Celtis laevigata), green ash (Fraxinus
pennsylvanica), and western soapberry (Sapindus soponaria var.
drummondii) [<a href="#18">18</a>].  In Iowa, osage-orange occurs in a honey-locust
(Gleditsia triacanthos)-black locust (Robinia psuedoacacia)-boxelder
(Acer negundo)-elm (Ulmus spp.) forest [<a href="#15">15</a>].  On lower terraces of Salt
Creek in Illinois, osage-orange occurs in a bur oak (Quercus
macrocarpa)-hackberrry (Celtis occidentalis) forest [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Osage-orange
is also associated with white oak (Quercus alba), white ash (Fraxinus
americana), and red mulberry (Morus rubra) [<a href="#4">4</a>].

In Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alabama, osage-orange occurs with eastern
redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), black walnut (Juglans nigra), hickory
(Carya spp.), and elm [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Osage-orange that has escaped cultivation often occurs as thickets along
fencerows and ditches, in ravines, and in overgrazed pastures.  It
commonly occurs with honey-locust in disturbed areas [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Maclura pomifera
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Osage-orange wood is hard, durable, and resistant to decay.  It is
primarily used for fence posts [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Osage-orange provides shelter and cover for wildlife.  Small mammals and
birds use the thorny tree for cover.  The bitter-tasting, fleshy fruit
is generally not eaten, but some animals including squirrel, fox, red
crossbill, and northern bobwhite occasionally eat the seeds
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Seedlings and sprouts are browsed occasionally [<a href="#4">4</a>].
Downy woodpeckers use osage-orange as forage sites [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Osage-orange fruit and browse are generally not palatable [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The fleshy fruit of osage-orange is more than 80 percent digestible [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Osage-orange is used for soil stabilization and strip mine reclamation
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  It is adapted to most surface mine conditions but does better
in less acidic, well-drained mine soils.  It has a lower soil pH limit
of 4.5.  Osage-orange had a 33 percent survival rate 30 years after
planting on mine soils in Illinois and Indiana, and a 39 percent
survival rate after 30 years on mine soils in Ohio [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Osage-orange
is sensitive to soil compaction [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Early settlers of the Great Plains used osage-orange for hedgerows.  The
diffuse, thorny branches form impenetrable hedges which were used to
fence in livestock [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Osage-orange wood extractives are used for food processing, pesticide
manufacturing, and dye making.  The Osage Indians used the wood for dye
and bows.  The strong-smelling fruit repels cockroaches [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Osage-orange is planted as an ornamental.  There is an unusual thornless
male form which is clonally propagated [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Osage-orange is planted in shelterbelts and hedgerows of the Great
Plains.  It is planted alone or in a row adjacent to a row of evergreens
or taller hardwoods [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Osage-orange hedges are maintained as fences
by pruning [<a href="#24">24</a>].  While a favorite of the past, osage-orange hedgerows
are now replaced with species that provide more benefit to wildlife
[<a href="#14">14</a>].  Osage-orange is recommended for planting on deep, moist,
permeable soils and medium to shallow upland silty-clayey loams, sandy
loams, and loamy sands.  It is not recommended for sandhills or wet,
poorly drained soils [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Osage-orange hedges are often clearcut for posts.  Winter cuttings
produce the most vigorous stump sprouts which regenerate the hedge [<a href="#27">27</a>].
Three to five years after clearcutting, the new sprout stands should be
thinned to 240 stems per 100 meters.  The sprouts are susceptible to
fire and grazing [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Osage-orange is generally resistant to disease and insects; the only
serious affliction is cotton root rot (Phymatotrichum omnivorum) [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].
Eastern mistletoe (Phoradendron serotinum) occasionally parasitizes
osage-orange [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Hamel [<a href="#9">9</a>] describes herbicide application rates, methods, and seasons
for osage-orange control.  Triclopyr or picloram, applied with a
chainsaw girdling treatment, are effective against osage-orange [<a href="#17">17</a>].
Launchbaugh and Owensby [<a href="#12">12</a>] describe preferred osage-orange herbicide
control methods for Kansas.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Maclura pomifera
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Osage-orange is a small, native, deciduous tree that averages 30 feet (9
m) in height.  It has a short trunk and rounded crown.  Shade-killed
lower branches remain on the tree for years, forming a dense thicket.
Branches growing in full sun have sharp, stout thorns 0.5 to 1 inch
(1.3-2.5 cm) long.  Osage-orange has a large, round multiple fruit
composed of many fleshy calyces, each containing one seed.  Osage-orange
generally has a well-developed taproot; a tree in Oklahoma had roots
more than 27 feet (8.2 m) deep.  On shallow soils, roots spread
laterally [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Osage-orange reproduces vegetatively and by seed.  It is dioecious.
Female trees begin producing seeds at age 10 but are most productive
from age 25 to 65.  Good seed crops are produced nearly every year.
Seeds are disseminated by animals, gravity, and water.  Seeds have a
slight dormancy which is overcome by soaking in water for 2 days or
stratifying in sand or peat for 30 days.  Seed germination requires
exposed mineral soil and full light.  At 7 years of age, osage-orange is
about 8 feet (2.4 m) tall with a crown spread of about 6 feet (1.8 m)
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].

Seed collection, cleaning, storage, and planting techniques are
described [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].

Osage-orange sprouts vigorously from the stump [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Godfrey [<a href="#7">7</a>]
suggested that it also sprouts from the roots.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Osage-orange grows best in areas that receive 25 to 40 inches (640-1,020
mm) precipitation a year but tolerates a minimum of 15 inches (380 mm).
It is sensitive to cold and succumbs to winter-kill in the northern
Great Plains [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].

Osage-orange grows on a variety of soils but does best on rich, moist,
well-drained bottomlands.  It occurs on alkaline soils, shallow soils
overlaying limestone, clayey soils, and sandy soils [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  It can
occur on bottomlands which are seasonally flooded [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
The shade tolerance of osage-orange is not well defined.  It has been
listed as intermediate in tolerance [<a href="#32">32</a>] and intolerant [<a href="#4">4</a>].
Osage-orange grows in the subcanopy of bottomland forests [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>], but it
also invades overgrazed pastures and other open, disturbed sites with
eroding soil.  Osage-orange regenerates naturally on sunny sites but
grows when planted in dense hedges [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Osage-orange in remnant bottomland hardwood forests is negatively
associated with fragment size.  In other words, the smaller the area of
remnant forest, the more likely that osage-orange will occur there.
Rudis [<a href="#23">23</a>] suggested that fragmentation may promote and accelerate the
establishment of pioneer species and species adapted to disturbance.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Osage-orange generally flowers from April to June and the fruit ripens
from September to October [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>].  It flowers in mid-May in Kansas and
Nebraska [<a href="#28">28</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Small-diameter osage-orange are probably top-killed by most fires.
Depending on fire severity and root depth, they may be completely
killed.  Larger individuals may survive.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Osage-orange probably sprouts if top-killed by fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
The dead, persistent, lower branches of osage-orange may promote crown
fires.
