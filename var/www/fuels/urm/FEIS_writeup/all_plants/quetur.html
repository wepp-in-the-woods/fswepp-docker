The fully documented scientific name of shrub live oak is 
<i>Quercus turbinella</i> Greene (Fagaceae) [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>].  It is a member of the white oak subgenus <i>Lepidobalanus</i> or <i>Quercus</i> [41,64,77,].  Varieties are as follows [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>]:
<p>

<i>Quercus turbinella</i> var. <i>californica</i> (Tucker) L. Benson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California shrub live oak<br>
<i>Quercus turbinella</i> var. <i>turbinella</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shrub live oak<br><br>
  
Shrub live oak hybridizes with Gambel 
oak <i>(Q. gambelii)</i>: The hybrid is described as <i>Q. &#215 pauciloba</i> Rydb. [<a href="#49">49</a>]. Shrub live oak-Gambel oak hybrids are particularly evident in northern and southwestern Utah and in central Colorado [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>]. Alvord oak (Q. &#215 alvordiana Eastw.) results from hybridization of shrub live oak and blue oak <i>(Q. douglasii)</i> [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Shrub live oak also hybridizes with sand shinnery oak <i>(Q. havardii)</i>, Nuttall's scrub oak <i>(Q. dumosa)</i>, gray oak (<i>Q. grisea</i>), and valley oak <i>(Q. lobata)</i> [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>].  <br><br>

Welsh [<a href="#99">99</a>] divided Utah oaks into 3 complexes, one of which he identified as the 
shrub live oak (<i>Quercus turbinella</i>) complex.  According
to Welsh [<a href="#99">99</a>], there are "no apparent barriers to hybridization and intermediates are known
between nearly all (species)" within the complex.</p>

<p class="subframeText">

Shrub live oak grows in the mountains of southwestern Colorado 
through southern Utah and Nevada to southern California and northern 
Mexico [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>].  It extends eastward to the northwestern 
portion of the Trans-Pecos region of western Texas [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Shrub 
live oak is most abundant in the chaparral
of central Arizona [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  <i>Quercus turbinella</i> var. 
<i>turbinella</i> grows throughout most of the range of the 
species as a whole [<a href="#49">49</a>].  California shrub live oak grows 
from central San Benito County in California southeast in the inner South Coast
Ranges to the mountain slopes near the southern and western borders
of the Mojave Desert [<a href="#90">90</a>].
<p>

The northern distribution of shrub live oak is limited by 
spring freezes and summer moisture stress [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>]. 
It is strongly influenced by the "Arizona monsoon gradient," which generates 
summer precipitation in the Southwest.  Neilson and 
Wullstein [<a href="#57">57</a>] report that the frequency, intensity, and 
extent of late spring freezes, and intensity and 
extent of the "Arizona monsoon" appear to be the major factors
controlling successful sexual reproduction in shrub live oak.</p>
<p>

Shrub live oak-Gambel oak hybrids have been reported 
hundreds of miles north of the present-day range of shrub 
live oak in parts of northern Utah and central Colorado 
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>].  Macrofossil evidence suggests that shrub 
live oak migrated northward in the warmer altithermal 
(or hypsithermal) period during which the Arizona monsoon 
shifted [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].  Later climatic shifts to cooler temperatures 
presumably eliminated shrub live oak from this northern area, 
but the more cold-hardy hybrids survived in some protected 
areas [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].</p>

Shrub live oak generally provides relatively little browse for most
species of wildlife and livestock.  In many areas it is used heavily
only when other more palatable species are lacking [<a href="#70">70</a>]; however, shrub live oak is 
sometimes an important food source for deer and livestock [<a href="#8">8</a>].  In southern and central Arizona, 
it is considered to be a valuable browse plant because of its abundance and evergreen leaves [<a href="#94">94</a>].  Shrub live oak can be a valuable emergency winter food when snow is 
deep or when preferred foods are scarce [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Shrub live 
oak also provides an excellent source of emergency browse during 
droughts when other plants become desiccated and unpalatable 
[<a href="#94">94</a>].  Shrub live oak can survive heavy browsing and may remain as
"almost the only forage" on deteriorated ranges in Arizona 
[<a href="#35">35</a>].
<p>

The foliage of shrub live oak is utilized to at least some degree by a
number of big game species.  New,
succulent growth is the most palatable and is readily consumed [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].
New growth is described as "fair" forage for deer in Arizona.  In
some areas, deer may consume considerable amounts of foliage 
[<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>].  Use of shrub live oak by mule deer in the southern 
Rocky Mountains is described as "moderate" in winter and "light" in
summer [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Use of shrub live oak by desert 
mule deer is described as "low to high" in winter, "low" in spring,
"moderate to high" during summer, and "low" in the fall 
[<a href="#44">44</a>].  Desert bighorn sheep feed on shrub live oak
in Arizona [<a href="#82">82</a>].</p>
<p> 

Cattle, domestic sheep [<a href="#94">94</a>], and domestic goats use shrub live oak at least moderately [<a href="#7">7</a>].  In 
some Arizona locations, shrub 
live oak may become too dense for livestock and big game use [<a href="#70">70</a>].</p>
<p>

Acorns of shrub live oak and related species constitute an 
important source of mast for many small birds and mammals 
in the Southwest.  Acorns are utilized by the collared peccary, wild turkey, numerous 
rodents such as Abert's squirrel, geese, 
grouse, quail, scrub jays, and many other birds 
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>].  Scrub jays and many rodents collect and 
cache acorns of shrub live oak, thereby aiding in seed 
dispersal [<a href="#63">63</a>]. Mule deer, white-tailed deer, and cattle also consume acorns during the 
fall [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>].</p>
<p>

In the Southwest, scrub live oak cambium
is eaten by sapsuckers, porcupines eat the bark, and beavers consume the twigs [<a href="#97">97</a>].</p>

<p class="subframeText">
Palatability of shrub live oak to most species of wildlife and livestock
is relatively low in most seasons [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].  It is generally used 
only lightly by deer in Arizona [<a href="#65">65</a>] and most other big 
game species throughout its range.  New 
sprouts are most palatable and are browsed readily [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].  Domestic 
goats, however, frequently use it year-round 
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  In an Arizona chaparral study,
shrub live oak was the most preferred species of domestic goats 
during the first weeks after goats were released onto the 
range [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Shrub live oak is fairly palatable to cattle and 
domestic sheep in some areas [<a href="#94">94</a>].
<p>

Shrub live oak provides effective cover for a wide range of birds and
mammals.  Chaparral dominated by shrub live oak provides habitat for 
the peccary, California brown bat, ringtail, whitetail deer, Cooper's
hawk, screech owl, many songbirds, canyon tree frog, leopard frog,
and Mexican garter snake [<a href="#77">77</a>].  In central Arizona, mountain 
lion kills are sometimes hidden in shrub live oak 
thickets [<a href="#60">60</a>].  Shrub live oak provides cover
during 1 or more seasons for wildlife in Utah as

Shrub live oak is 
rated as having "high potential" for erosion control and 
for long-term revegetation projects, but it is of little value 
in short-term revegetation [<a href="#20">20</a>].
<p>

Under laboratory conditions shrub live oak can be propagated 
from softwood cuttings of stems with fully expanded leaves 
[<a href="#30">30</a>].  Average successful rootings of up to 75% have been 
attained under optimal conditions [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Best results were 
obtained when cuttings were trimmed to 2 to 3 inches (5-8 cm) 
and put in a rooting medium of 1:1 perlite to peat moss.  Details on propagation by cuttings are available [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].</p>

Exotic grass production increases in response to removal of shrub live 
oak.  On Arizona sites where shrub live oak was killed by 
herbicides and weeping lovegrass <i>(Eragrostis curvula</i>) 
seeded, the basal cover of weeping lovegrass was found to be inversely 
proportional to oak cover.  Where less than
50% of the shrub live oak cover was removed, the basal cover of
weeping lovegrass remained constant for 
3 years, but where more than 50% of the basal cover was removed, 
weeping lovegrass continued to increase during the 2nd and 
3rd years [<a href="#68">68</a>].

Shrub live oak may be difficult to control with herbicides [<a href="#69">69</a>].  
Repeated applications are often necessary [<a href="#87">87</a>].  Best results 
have been reported if herbicides are applied when subsoil at 
24 inches (60 cm) depth is moist or wet and when leaves are not 
senescent or falling [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Specific details on the effects

Shrub live oak is a clump-forming or clonal evergreen shrub 
or less commonly a small tree 
[<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>].  It typically grows from 3 to
8 feet (0.9-2 m) in height with stem diameters to 8 inches (20 cm) 
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>]; however, it can reach 15 feet (5 m) or 
more [<a href="#8">8</a>]. The somewhat leathery leaves 
are 0.5 to 1.6 inches (1.3-4 cm) in length, 0.3 to 0.9 inch 
(0.7-2.4 cm) in width [<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>].  Leaves persist through the winter [<a href="#93">93</a>].  Fruits 
of shrub live oak are slender, annual acorns 0.5 to 1 inch 
(1.3-2.5 cm) in length, with turbinate cups 
[<a href="#94">94</a>].
<p>

Belowground structure:  Root depths of over 25 feet (8 m) have been reported in parts of Arizona [<a href="#81">81</a>].  Roots and rhizomes may spread 16 feet (4.9 m) or more horizonally [<a href="#16">16</a>]. Shrub live oak forms colonies by sprouting from rhizomes [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>]. Thousands of individual stems may form from a single or only a few individuals [<a href="#8">8</a>]. Davis and Pase [<a href="#16">16</a>] report "what appears to be a relatively open stand of shrub live oak aboveground, may actually be a relatively closed system"
of overlapping roots and rhizomes.   The top foot of soil typically contains a 
dense network of small surface laterals that aid in the 
absorption of surface soil moisture.  In 
central Arizona, the greatest 
accumulation of belowground biomass occurred in the top 2 feet (0.6 m) 
of soil, with biomass decreasing with depth as follows [<a href="#16">16</a>]:</p>

<p class="subframeText">
Shrub live oak reproduces through both sexual and vegetative 
means. 
<p>

Sexual reproduction:  Shrub live oak produces small acorns which 
usually germinate and establish from late July through 
mid-September [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>].  Germination
often occurs shortly after acorn maturation and coincides with the
summer rainy season [<a href="#63">63</a>].  Under laboratory 
conditions germination capacity may reach 95% [<a href="#61">61</a>].</p>
<p>

Acorn production is largely dependent on the 
amount of precipitation received during the previous 
winter [<a href="#63">63</a>].  Dry summers may inhibit or retard acorn 
production [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].  In "good" years shrub live oak 
produces an abundance of acorns [<a href="#79">79</a>].  Total acorn 
failure, although rare, can occur [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>].  Total crop 
failures may occur when October-March precipitation is less than
15 inches (38 cm) [<a href="#63">63</a>].  Generally, good 
crops are produced at 3- to 5-year intervals [<a href="#61">61</a>].</p>
<p>

The vast majority of shrub live oak seedling mortality is 
apparently attributable to drought.  In an Arizona study, 
seedling mortality during the first spring drought period 
following germination was 53%.  Mortality rates appeared to 
decline by 3 years after germination [<a href="#63">63</a>].</p>
<p>

Shrub live oak acorns do not require a ripening period and 
frequently germinate while in storage.  Shrub live
oak acorns are characterized by a short period of viability, 
and seedbanking is unlikely.  Pase [<a href="#63">63</a>] reports 
"there is probably a negligible carryover of seeds from 1 year 
to the next."  Very few viable seeds remain 1 year after burial, due in large part to 
predation by insects, birds, and mammals [<a href="#63">63</a>].</p>
<p>

Acorns are dispersed by numerous birds and mammals which eat 
and/or cache the acorns.  Shrub live oak seeds tend to be 
somewhat heavy, weighing an average of 0.046 to 0.053 ounce 
(1.3-1.5 g) per seed [<a href="#30">30</a>], and are consequently not transported long 
distances by most seed-dispersing animals.  Scrub jays are particularly important 
dispersal agents.  These birds generally "plant" single acorns 
at depths of 1.5 to 2 inches (4-5 cm), a few feet to a 
hundred feet from the parent plant.  Rodents more
often cache multiple seeds, which can germinate and produce 
groups of 10 to 20 or more seedlings at a single location.  
Seedling distribution indicates that, at least in 
many of the central Arizona sites studied, scrub jays play 
a much more significant role as dispersers than do 
rodents [<a href="#63">63</a>].</p>
<p>

Seedlings are rarely encountered in the field [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>].  
Successful establishment is thought to require 15 inches (38 cm) or 
more of precipitation from October through March, followed 
by 10 inches (25 cm) or more from July to September 
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>].  These conditions are met in only 1
year out of 10 at many Arizona sites [<a href="#63">63</a>].  In laboratory 
experiments seedling roots grew to a depth of 1 foot (30 cm) 
prior to leaf development [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Plants only 12.9 inches (7.4 cm) 
in height had roots that extended to 21 inches (53 cm) 
in depth [<a href="#8">8</a>].</p>
<p>

Vegetative reproduction:  Shrub live oak tends to increase
more through rhizome sprouting than by seedling establishment [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>]. 
Shrub live oak sprouts vigorously 
after fire, application of herbicides, or mechanical treatment 
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>].</p>

Shrub live oak is particularly common on many 
low winter ranges in southern Utah and Nevada and in 
chaparral-desert grassland ecotones in Arizona [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>].
Shrub live oak often grows in scattered patches in swales and 
canyons [<a href="#94">94</a>].
<p>

Soil:  Shrub live oak grows well on dry hillsides and mesas and
tolerates a wide range of soil types [<a href="#94">94</a>].  Growth is best on sandy 
to clay loams [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Soils are often slightly acidic [<a href="#16">16</a>].  This 
oak is not restricted to deep soils and can grow on shallow, broken 
and fractured substrates [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>]. Soils are typically coarse-textured  
and poorly developed in shrub live oak chaparral [<a href="#24">24</a>].</p>
<p>

In eastern Yavapai County in central Arizona, soils developed 
from quartz diorite provide more 
favorable moisture regimes than do heavy clay soils
developed from volcanics.  In north-central Arizona, shrub 
live oak growing on less favorable, drier, sedimentary and 
volcanic substrates may be more susceptible to drought 
damage.  Where root penetration is
restricted, plants are more susceptible to damage from drought or 
fire [<a href="#79">79</a>].</p>
<p>

Climate:  Shrub live oak is drought tolerant and typically 
occupies drier and warmer sites than Gambel 
oak [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  In the northern part of its range, shrub live oak 
often grows on warm, dry, southern exposures [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Arizona 
chaparral is characterized by a biseasonal precipitation pattern with
summer and winter precipitation and spring and fall 
droughts [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Annual precipitation averages 16 to 25 
inches (410-640 mm) [<a href="#24">24</a>].</p>
<p>

Elevation: Ranges of shrub live oak are as 
follows [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>]:</p>

Shrub live oak may have climax or seral status.  This long-lived 
oak is considered to be an indicator of climax in parts of 
Arizona and New Mexico [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  During the 2nd and 3rd years 
after fire in shrub live oak-dominated chaparral in Arizona, 
forbs and grasses dominate.  Shrubs, 
including shrub live oak, assume prominence the 5th through 
7th year after disturbance, although it may take more than 
11 years for shrubs to reach preburn levels [<a href="#8">8</a>].  A typical

rain [<a href="#65">65</a>].
<p>

Fire regimes:  In Arizona chaparral dominated by shrub live oak, 
fire return intervals have been estimated at 74 to 100 years.  
At least 20 years may be required before
these sites can reburn [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Childers and Piirto [<a href="#10">10</a>] note

Shrub live oak is top-killed by fire [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>]. The degree of damage 
and subsequent mortality rate of shrub 
live oak following fire depends largely on fire intensity 
and severity, site characteristics that influence fuel

oak is difficult to kill by burning [<a href="#70">70</a>].<p></p>

Shrub live oak is more susceptible to fire-induced damage on 
drier, unfavorable sedimentary or volcanic substrates than on more
favorable sites and 
can occasionally be eliminated from these marginal 
sites by fire.  Evidence suggests that shrub live oak is especially difficult to 
kill on soils with relatively favorable moisture 
relationships [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].
<p>

Fires of high severity generally result in increased 
mortality.  Seedling survival tends to be higher following "light" 
fires [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].  Survival of 1-year old shrub live oak seedlings 
was as follows after fires in central Arizona chaparral [<a href="#64">64</a>]:</p>

A June wildfire in Arizona top-killed all shrub live oak present 
on the site [<a href="#18">18</a>].  In many 
areas annual burning may be necessary to 
eliminate or significantly reduce shrub live oak.  On 
some Arizona chaparral sites at least 5 consecutive annual 
burns were necessary to reduce stem numbers to below 
pretreatment levels [<a href="#70">70</a>].  <p></p>

important.  A "moderate population" of shrub

revegetating the area within 4 to 6 years after burning, herbicide
treatment, and reseeding with Lehmann (<i>Eragrostis lehmanniana)</i> or

In central Arizona chaparral 
communities, shrub live oak response depended in part on frequency
of burning [<a href="#70">70</a>].  After the first 4 of 5 annual burns, stem 
counts were still higher than pretreatment numbers and only 
after the 5th burn did stem numbers drop below preburn levels.  Burning at 2-year intervals failed to
reduce sprouting in shrub live oak.  After
3 treatments at 2-year intervals, live stems still numbered 
4.37 times the original number [<a href="#71">71</a>].  Results of this study follow [<a href="#70">70</a>]:

FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />
<p class="subframeText">
Davis and Dieterich [<a href="#17">17</a>] report "people experienced with
fire characteristics in Arizona oak chaparral have always 
maintained that chaparral either burns fiercely or does not 
burn at all."  A critical rate of spread threshold has been 
estimated at 20 feet per minute.  For fire to spread, 
conditions must be suitable for generating spread at or 
above that rate.  Minimum sustained spread of 1/4 mile per 
hour (22 ft/min) has been reported in prescribed burns [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Details 
are available on rate of spread in shrub live oak-dominated 
chaparral [<a href="#17">17</a>]. 
<p>

Flammability of shrub live oak is increased by preheating which
may cause chemical changes.  Detailed
information is available [<a href="#88">88</a>].</p>
<p>

Prescribed fire:  Prescribed fires have resulted in temporary
reduction of shrub live oak [<a href="#65">65</a>].  At some sites fuels are
sparse, and broadcast burning may nearly impossible [<a href="#70">70</a>].  Several
years may be needed for shrub live oak chaparral to produce enough fuel to carry a
fire.  Ten to 20 years may be required for shrub live to reburn at
some sites [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].  Herbicides may be applied prior to prescribed
burning to increase flammability and kill the tops of shrub live oak without removing
litter [<a href="#65">65</a>].  In an Arizona study, late summer application of 
'Dinoxol' (a mixture of 2 lbs/gallon (acid equivalent) of 
the butoxyethanol esters of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T herbicides)
killed 80% of the leaves and twigs.  Moisture content of
herbicide-killed leaves was 8 to 15% (oven-dry) compared with 85
to 97% for untreated leaves [<a href="#65">65</a>].  Shrub live oak leaves contain
approximately 6.2% volatiles [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Regressions have been 
developed for foliar moisture of shrub live oak [<a href="#48">48</a>].</p>
<p>

Grass production:  The production of introduced perennial grasses may
increase following fire in shrub live oak communities.  Productivity may be
increased for 5 to 7 years following fire.  In an Arizona study,
comparative production values by treatment were as follows [<a href="#87">87</a>]:</p>
<pre>            Perennial grass production

            Unburned-      Burned-        Burned-
            native         reseeded       reseeded-
                                          herbicide
1956 site     3 lb/acre    ----           280 lb/acre
1958 site    31 lb/acre    179 lb/acre    803 lb/acre
</pre>

The grasses increased in the preceding study were seeded 
exotics.  Native grasses were scarce prior to burning and thus, 
treatment did not produce increases in native grasses.

Grazing may have little impact on postburn cover of shrub live oak.  
Pond and Cable [<a href="#71">71</a>] reported the following results after a 1951 
fire in Arizona chaparral:

<pre>        Shrub live oak cover (%)

        grazed    ungrazed
1952    20.40     18.46
1956    33.93     30.27
1958    36.37     31.04
</pre>


Browse:  Shrub live oak is fairly palatable to browsers while in the
early sprout stage.  The value of shrub live oak to wildlife 
is thus enhanced by burning [<a href="#65">65</a>].
<p>

Soils:  Fire acts as a mineralizing agent quickly volatilizing the
litter and standing fuels of shrub live oak.  These compounds
then condense within the soil and on the soil surface.  Immediately
after a prescribed fire amounts of exchangeable ammonium and 
extractable phosphorus in the soil increased under shrub 
live oak [<a href="#62">62</a>].

Prescribed fire increased inorganic nitrogen in
the 0- to 2-cm soil layer under shrub live oak plants, mainly through increases
in ammonium concentration. Inorganic nitrogen in the 2- to 10-cm soil layer
did not change significantly. After fire, available phosphorus increased,
especially in the top 2 cm of soil.
