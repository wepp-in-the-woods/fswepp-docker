<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Black huckleberry occurs in upland pine (Pinus spp.), oak (Quercus
spp.), and mixed pine-oak forests, savannas, and barrens
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  It is native to dwarf pitch pine (Pinus
rigida)-oak forests of the New Jersey pine barrens [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Black
huckleberry is an indicator plant of northern savanna, a forest-prairie
transition community in Minnesota and Wisconsin [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Black huckleberry
occurs in black oak (Q. velutina) savannas in Indiana [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Black huckleberry is commonly present or dominant in peatland bog,
raised bog, and carr communities [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  It is present in the
lower shrub layer of a wetland shrub community in New York dominated by
common mountain-holly (Nemopanthus mucronatus) and highbush cranberry
(Vaccinium corymbosum) [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Black huckleberry frequently occurs with other ericaceous shrubs
including low sweet blueberry (V. angustifolium), hillside blueberry (V.
pallidum), mountain-laurel (Kalmia latifolia), sheep-laurel (Kalmia
angustifolia), wintergreen (Gaultheria procumbens), bearberry
(Arctostaphylos uva-ursi), rhododendrons (Rhododendron spp.), and
dangleberry (Gaylussacia frondosa) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].

Other plant associates not previously mentioned include sweetfern
(Comptonia peregrina), chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), sumac (Rhus
spp.), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), and eastern hophornbeam
(Ostrya virginiana) [<a href="#19">19</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Gaylussacia baccata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Black huckleberry provides food, shelter, and cover for wildlife.
Numerous birds including sharp-tailed grouse, greater prairie chicken,
bobwhite quail, wild turkey, mourning dove, catbird, and scarlet tanager
eat the berries [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Black bear, gray fox, and fox squirrel also
eat the berries.  White-tailed deer, snowshoe hare, and cottontail
rabbit browse stems lightly [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Black huckleberry was not highly preferred by white-tailed deer and
snowshoe hare [<a href="#50">50</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Black huckleberry is used for erosion control on sterile acidic sites [<a href="#19">19</a>].

In Lehigh Gap, Pennsylvania, black huckleberry cover and density were
less where soil was contaminated with heavy metals from a nearby smelter
than in uncontaminated areas [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Black huckleberry fruits are edible [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Black huckleberry is occasionally used in ornamental plantings [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Niering and Goodwin [<a href="#36">36</a>] recommend black huckleberry for right-of-way
clearings in Connecticut where trees interfere with powerlines.  Dense
black huckleberry thickets resisted invasion of trees for at least 15
years in a right-of-way from which trees were originally removed by
herbicide application [<a href="#36">36</a>].

Black huckleberry is recommended for restoration of the native dwarf
pitch pine-oak forests of the New Jersey pine barrens.  Black
huckleberry is a native component of this forest and provides long-term
stability, structural diversity, and wildlife benefits [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Propagation techniques are described for black huckleberry [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Equations for predicting black huckleberry biomass are available [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Gaylussacia baccata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Black huckleberry is a native, deciduous, upright shrub with a profusely
and stiffly branched dense crown [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  At maturity, it reaches 1
to 4 feet (0.3-1.2 m) in height [<a href="#52">52</a>].  The fruit is a fleshy drupe
containing around 10 seeds [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].

Aerial stems arise from branched rhizomes to form extensive black
huckleberry clones [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  The stems are usually 12 to 48 inches
(30-122 cm) apart on the rhizomes.  The woody rhizomes are usually 0.25
to 0.75 inches (0.6-1.9 cm) in diameter, but may be larger.  They are
generally confined to the humus layer and the top 1 inch (2.5 cm) of
soil.  If no humus layer exists, rhizomes are 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6
cm) deep in the soil.  Fibrous roots occur at the base of each aerial
stem.  Larger roots are generally confined to the same layers as the
rhizomes, but may extend as deep as 8 inches (20 cm) [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Black huckleberry regenerates by vegetative reproduction and seed.

Existing black huckleberry colonies extend their range and reproduce
after disturbance primarily by sprouting from rhizomes [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  In the
New Jersey pine barrens, black huckleberry averaged 36.2 dormant buds
per 3.9 inches (10 cm) of rhizome [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Destruction of aboveground
stems stimulates sprouting [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  A stem may grow up to 8 inches (20
cm) in height in the first growing season [<a href="#39">39</a>].  In a clearing dominated
by shrubs, a black huckleberry clone averaged 7.5 inches (19 cm) of
radial expansion a year [<a href="#36">36</a>].

Although seedlings are rare [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>], black huckleberry may colonize
new sites by seed.  Fruit production begins when black huckleberry stems
are 3 years old [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Heavy crops are produced occasionally [<a href="#41">41</a>].
Animals eat the berries, thereby dispersing the seeds [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Black
huckleberry may be self sterile [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Germination capacity increases
with stratification [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  Warm stratification for 30 days followed by
incubation at cold temperatures enhances germination [<a href="#55">55</a>].  In an oak
woods in which black huckleberry dominated the shrub layer, black
huckleberry seeds were not found in the seedbank by either germination
or visual search methods [<a href="#42">42</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Black huckleberry grows on a variety of sites from moist woodlands,
thickets, and bogs to dry rocky slopes and stable coastal dunes
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  It grows at sea level and in mountainous sites
approaching 4,000 feet (1,220 m) in elevation in the southern
Appalachian Mountains [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].

Black huckleberry grows in acidic, coarse textured, low nutrient soils
which are well drained [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  It is common on sandy outwash
plains of glaciated areas in the northeastern United States [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].
Black huckleberry often grows in shallow soils overlying noncalcareous
bedrock or hardpan [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  Because of its requirement for acidic
soils, it is rarely found in soil derived from calcareous rock [<a href="#5">5</a>].

In heathlands, black huckleberry is associated with pan development
[<a href="#47">47</a>].  In Nova Scotia, dense black huckleberry communities occupy
healthlands where the hardpan is more than 13.8 inches (35 cm) beneath
the surface [<a href="#48">48</a>].

Black huckleberry occurs in mature, consolidated, ombrotrophic bogs
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  In raised bogs along the Bay of Fundy, black huckleberry
occupies well-drained, dry sites where the watertable is generally about
16 inches (41 cm) beneath the surface [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Black huckleberry invaded stable black oak dunes in Indiana after a
humus layer had developed and soils were well leached [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Black huckleberry is intermediate in shade tolerance [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  It
frequently grows under open pine and oak canopies and forms dense shrub
layers in canopy gaps and clearings [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  Once established, black
huckleberry tolerates deep shade for a short time but growth is
inhibited.  As spruce (Picea spp.) and fir (Abies spp.) replace pine and
oak in the canopy, black huckleberry declines [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Shrub-carr
communities in central New York which include black huckleberry
represent an intermediate stage of succession between wet meadows and
wet forests [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Once established, dense thickets of black huckleberry resist invasion by
trees [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  With periodic fire, black huckleberry heath
communities in Nova Scotia are very stable [<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Leaf bud break and flowering of black huckleberry begin as early as May.
Flowering continues through June.  Fruits begin to mature by the end of
July and remain on the plant until September [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Gaylussacia baccata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Black huckleberry is fire tolerant.  Aboveground parts are destroyed by
most fires, but dormant rhizome buds usually survive and sprout [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].

Black huckleberry cover either increases, remains the same, or decreases
after fire, depending on rhizome depth, fire severity and frequency, and
associated plant community [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Low-severity fire encourages
prolific vegetative reproduction of black huckleberry [<a href="#30">30</a>].  However,
severe fire that burns the humus layer, where many of the rhizomes are,
can reduce or eliminate black huckleberry from a site.  Black
huckleberry may not recolonize a severely burned site for several
decades [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Frequent fire usually decreases black huckleberry cover,
probably because of inadequate time between fires to replenish root
resources [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Black huckleberry regeneration after fire is independent of aboveground
severity but not belowground severity.  Areas that burn frequently may
have low levels of humus, so rhizomes grow in the soil and are less
vulnerable to fire.  For instance, black huckleberry persists in
oak-pine barrens which typically experience severe crown fires [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Historically, the New Jersey pine barrens burned with severe crown fire
every 20 to 25 years [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Presently, these areas are burned by
low-severity prescribed fires.  Changes in black huckleberry densities
in pine barrens with the advent of fire management are unreported [<a href="#31">31</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Gaylussacia baccata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Most fires kill aboveground portions of black huckleberry [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Buds
on unburned, but heated aboveground stems are usually dead, indicating
that black huckleberry buds are very sensitive to heat.
Moderate-severity or severe fire that burns the humus layer may kill
many of the rhizomes, killing the plant [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Surviving rhizomes sprout from dormant buds following fire [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].
Sprouting depends on the release of hormonally suppressed buds following
the death of the dominant aboveground stem [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Sprouting of plants
top-killed by fire does not differ in vigor from sprouting of clipped
plants, indicating that heat is not a factor in stimulating sprouting
[<a href="#32">32</a>].

A single low-severity fire usually encourages prolific black huckleberry
growth [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Vigorous black huckleberry thickets with high stem
densities arise after low-severity fire [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Annual growth of black
huckleberry stems increased considerably in the first growing season
after a low-severity March fire in the New Jersey pine barrens.  The new
sprouts formed a closed canopy by August of the same year, but growth
rates diminished rapidly the second year [<a href="#32">32</a>].

Brayton and Woodwell [<a href="#6">6</a>] compared the response of black huckleberry to
light and heavy fire damage from a crown fire which occurred in
September.  The degree of fire damage was measured using several factors
including the amount of charcoal in the soil and the amount of litter
remaining.  At this Long Island, New York, site black huckleberry
rhizomes were generally in the humus layer and the top 1 inch (2.5 cm)
of the A1 soil horizon.  Where heavy damage occurred (a large amount of
charcoal, no litter, and no standing shrub stems), black huckleberry
sprouts were restricted to rhizomes that were 0.6 to 1.4 inches (1.5-3.5
cm) beneath the soil surface.  In areas with light damage, sprouts
originated from rhizomes 0 to 0.8 inches (0-2 cm) beneath the soil
surface.  The postfire density of black huckleberry was 11 stems per
square meter in the heavily damaged area and 72 stems per square meter
in the lightly damaged area.  The authors concluded that fire damaged
the perennating buds on rhizomes in the heavily damaged areas [<a href="#6">6</a>].

In a south-central New York oak forest, black huckleberry neither
increased nor decreased after a single spring fire when compared to
adjacent unburned communities [<a href="#49">49</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Effects of repeated burning on black huckleberry vary and may depend on
plant community and availiability of light.  Buell and Cantlon [<a href="#7">7</a>]
investigated the effects of fire frequency on an upland oak forest in
New Jersey with a well-developed shrub layer.  Low-severity prescribed
fires were conducted in the winter at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 10-, and
15-year intervals.  Black huckleberry showed long-term decline in percent
cover at fire intervals of 5 years or less.  Black huckleberry had 40
percent cover on unburned control plots and 3 percent cover on plots
burned annually for 10 years.

In a black oak savanna in Indiana, two plots were prescribed burned:
one plot was burned four times in 8 years (3 spring fires and 1 fall
fire) and the other plot was burned five times in 8 years (3 spring and
2 fall fires).  Black huckleberry decreased from prefire levels with
progressive fires [<a href="#2">2</a>].

In little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) grasslands in Connecticut
with up to 40 percent woody cover of clonal shrubs, black huckleberry
increased in cover with annual spring fires that were conducted while
plants were still dormant.  Cover of an established black huckleberry
thicket on one tract increased four times over prefire levels after 12
annual spring fires [<a href="#35">35</a>].  The ability of black huckleberry to increase
its cover on this site despite the high fire frequency may be related to
the high availability of light.  Black huckleberry takes advantage of
light with vigorous growth [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In New Jersey, biomass nutrient concentrations of a heath, shrub, and
herb vegetative group which included black huckleberry did not differ
depending on site fire history.  Sites which had burned by wildfire
(usually severe) did not differ significantly (P>0.05) from those that
had undergone prescribed burning (low-severity) or from the control
which had not burned for 53 years.  In addition, nutrient levels in the
humus were similar among sites despite differing fire histories [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Stergas and Adams [<a href="#45">45</a>] determined macronutrient concentrations, ash
content, heat content, and ash-free heat content for black huckleberry
foliage in four different-aged jack pine (Pinus banksiana) stands.  Ash
content ranged from 4.38 percent to 4.83 percent.

Litter depth did not affect black huckleberry stem production or growth
after fire or after clipping of stems to simulate fire [<a href="#32">32</a>].
