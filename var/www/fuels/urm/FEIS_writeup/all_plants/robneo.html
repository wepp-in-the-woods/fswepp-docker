<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
New Mexico locust grows in pure stands or as an understory species [<a href="#26">26</a>].
New Mexico locust is an understory dominant or codominant with Gambel
oak (Quercus gambelii) under spruce-fir (Picea engelmannii-Abies
lasiocarpa), white fir (A. concolor), and mixed-conifer forests
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  It is a minor component in most riparian forest and
scrubland community types within its range, and in one chaparral
association (Arizona oak-yellowleaf silktassel-Emory oak [Q.
arizonica-Garrya flavescens-Q. emoryi]) [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].

New Mexico locust is an indicator for habitat types or plant
associations in the following publications:

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Robinia neomexicana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
New Mexico locust wood is hard, heavy, and durable.  It has been used
for fence posts and fuel [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  It is of little use as lumber due to
its small size and limited distribution [<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
On disturbed sites, New Mexico locust offers good forage and cover for
livestock and wildlife [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  New Mexico locust is eaten by mule
deer, bighorn sheep, Gambel's quail, chipmunk, and porcupine [<a href="#56">56</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Both the flowers and foliage are preferred by cattle and deer [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].
Palatability of New Mexico locust in Utah is fair for cattle and horses
and good for sheep [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
New Mexico locust has fair energy value but usually has poor protein
value (however, see below) [<a href="#18">18</a>].  New Mexico locust leaves comprised 0.8
percent of the total diet of mule deer in Arizona in June [<a href="#54">54</a>].  Protein
and acid-detergent fiber were each 25 percent of the leafy material.
Digestible dry matter was 39 percent of the leaves.


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
In Arizona, New Mexico locust as a minor species with Gambel oak
noticeably contributed to elk summer thermal cover in a ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa)-white fir overstory [<a href="#7">7</a>].  The cover value of New
Mexico locust in Utah is rated as poor for pronghorn, elk, and
waterfowl; fair for mule deer and upland game birds; and good for small
mammals and small nongame birds [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
New Mexico locust is cultivated for erosion control [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].
Caution is advised when using New Mexico locust in recreation areas
because of its stout spines [<a href="#32">32</a>].

In San Dimas Experimental Forest, California, at an elevation of 500
feet (152 m), New Mexico locust bareroot stock was planted on road
fills.  Survival was 52 percent.  New Mexico locust made the most rapid
growth compared to all other species planted.  It has been fully tested
and is recommended for erosion control on sites at 500 to 6,000 feet
(152-1,829 m) in elevation with deep soil and in full sun[<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
New Mexico locust is cultivated as an ornamental [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  

The Hopi Indians have used it as an emetic and for treating rheumatism
[<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
New Mexico locust competes with conifer seedlings and saplings for
moisture and light [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Because of its rapid growth and prolific
sprouting, efforts are made to suppress New Mexico locust, especially
after timber harvest [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Brush competition is usually
detrimental to seedling or juvenile tree growth [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  However,
Coffman [<a href="#10">10</a>] showed that under adverse planting conditions, the highest
establishment rates of planted Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)
seedlings occurred under moderate or heavy cover of New Mexico locust
and Gambel oak.

Mechanical methods alone do not successfully control New Mexico locust
[<a href="#26">26</a>].  Gottfried [<a href="#26">26</a>] tested combinations of mechanical and chemical
control methods on New Mexico locust in central Arizona.  There was no
significant difference among the various treatments after 1 year.
However, 4 years after the combination treatment of (1) cutting stems
during dormancy, (2) painting stumps with 2,4-D, and (3) spraying
sprouts with 2,4,5-T, stems were reduced from 104 to 9.

Within 8 years of an 80-acre (32.4 ha) harvest of mixed-conifer forest
in Arizona, 20 acres (8.1 ha) were covered by New Mexico locust.  The
New Mexico locust plants were treated with picloram; 86 percent of the
plants were dead after 2 years [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Single applications of soil
herbicides may not elminate New Mexico locust due to delayed recovery of
plants and establishment of seedlings.  Therefore, follow-up spot
treatment is recommended [<a href="#13">13</a>].

In open ponderosa pine stands in northern Arizona, production values for
New Mexico locust were 3 pounds per acre (3.4 kg/ha) [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Ffolliott
[<a href="#22">22</a>] has developed models for predicting understory production in
ponderosa pine or mixed conifer forests of which New Mexico locust is a
component.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Robinia neomexicana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
New Mexico locust is a native rhizomatous, small tree or shrub that
grows from 3 to 26 feet (4-8 m) tall with a diameter of 4 to 8 inches
(10-20 cm) [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  It has a dense crown and thin bark
[<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  New Mexico locust has many stout spiny branches with pinnately
compound leaves that are 6 to 8 inches (15-20 cm) long [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Flowers
hang in dense clusters [<a href="#36">36</a>].  The fruit is a hairy legume about 3 inches
(7.6 cm) long containing several seeds [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
New Mexico locust reproduces asexually and sexually.  It sprouts from
stumps and root crowns [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  New Mexico locust spreads by rhizomes,
forming dense thickets [<a href="#49">49</a>].

New Mexico locust fruits open rapidly when mature [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Locust (Robinia
spp.) seeds have impermeable seed coats and must be scarified [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].
Olson [<a href="#42">42</a>] and Vines [<a href="#56">56</a>] outline nursery methods for New Mexico locust
propagation.  Seed stored in a cool dry place remained viable 1 to 4
years, which indicates that a short-lived seedbank could exist [<a href="#56">56</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
New Mexico locust is common in canyons, along streams or arroyos, on
terraces, talus slopes, and in coniferous forest understories
[<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  It is found on gentle to relatively steep slopes on all
aspects [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].  New Mexico locust occurs on a wide variety of
soils, ranging from clays to sandy loams derived from volcanic or
limestone parent materials [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Across its range, New Mexico
locust is found between 4,000 and 9,150 feet (1,219-2,789 m) in
elevation [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].

New Mexico locust occurs in semiarid continental climates with dry warm
springs, hot moist summers, and cold moist winters [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Across its
range, two major precipitation seasons exist, with 35 to 42 percent of
precipitation falling as rain in July and August [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Average annual
precipitation ranges from 15 to 30 inches (381-762 mm) [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].

Associated species not mentioned in Distribution and Occurrence are
listed below.  Associated trees are southwestern white pine (Pinus
strobiformis), Chihuahua pine (Pinus leiophylla var. chihuahuana), and
quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].  Common shrub
associates are Fendler ceanothus (Ceanothus fenderi), manzanita
(Arctostaphylos spp.), silverleaf oak (Quercus hypoleucoides), mountain
snowberry (Symphoricarpos oreophilus), and mountain-mahogany
(Cercocarpus spp.) [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Other associated species are Arizona
fescue (Festuca arizonica), mutton bluegrass (Poa fendleriana), and
western yarrow (Achillea lanulosa) [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

New Mexico locust is a seral species after overstory removal in
southwestern coniferous forests [<a href="#28">28</a>].  After disturbance in
mixed-conifer stands, New Mexico locust became dominant after 1 to 3
years of forb dominance [<a href="#28">28</a>].  New Mexico locust is shaded out when the
conifers overtop it in 15 to 20 years [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
New leaves of New Mexico locust begin growing in the spring.  Flowers
form April to July in the new leaf axils [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  Fruits ripen
September to October, and seeds disperse from September to December
[<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  Leaves abscise in autumn [<a href="#42">42</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Robinia neomexicana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Thin bark and moderate litter production probably make New Mexico locust
susceptible to fire [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Horton [<a href="#32">32</a>] stated that the succulent foliage
during the summer decreases the severity of fires in New Mexico locust
communities.  Postburn regeneration probably occurs via root crown and
rhizome sprouting.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tree with adventitious-bud root crown/root sucker

<pre>
<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Robinia neomexicana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire probably kills New Mexico locust aerial stems and seedlings.
However, the root crown can survive low- to moderate-severity fires
[<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Surviving New Mexico locust root crowns and rhizomes sprout following
fire [<a href="#8">8</a>].  From information about the rate of growth, it is probable
that postfire recovery via sprouting is good [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Two years after a
fire in north-central New Mexico, New Mexico locust, at a density of 240
plants per acre (593 plants/ha), had 295 sprouts per acre (729
sprouts/ha) with an average height of 15 inches (38 cm) [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Hanks and Dick-Peddie [<a href="#28">28</a>] evaluated the effects of elevation and
exposure on 11 burns aged 3 to 80 years in south-central New Mexico.
There was no trend in size or number of trees for New Mexico locust.
New Mexico locust was nearly ubiquitous on burned sites below 10,000
feet (3,048 m) by postfire year 2 or 3.

Potter and Foxx [<a href="#44">44</a>] looked at sprouting on a low-severity burn at
postfire year 2; a moderate-severity burn at postfire year 17; and a
high-severity burn at postfire year 100.  New Mexico locust had the
greatest number of sprouts per acre on the moderate-severity burn area
at postfire year 17.

In a pinyon-Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) woodland in
northwestern Arizona, shrubs were assessed at postfire year 20.  The
area had been seeded to introduced grasses.  New Mexico locust occurred
infrequently; the plants were assumed to be on-site survivors that had
sprouted [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
The use of fire to control New Mexico locust and improve conifer
regeneration has not been tested [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Potentially, fires occurring
more frequently than every 10 years would favor sprouting shrubs, such
as New Mexico locust, over nonsprouting shrubs [<a href="#59">59</a>].
