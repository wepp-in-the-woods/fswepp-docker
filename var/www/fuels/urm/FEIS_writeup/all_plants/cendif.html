The currently accepted scientific name for diffuse knapweed is <i>Centaurea diffusa</i>
Lam. (Asteraceae) [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>]. Hybridization with spotted knapweed (<i>Centaurea stoebe </i>ssp. <i>micranthos</i>) is
reported in at least 7 U.S. states [<a href="#70">70</a>], including Michigan [<a href="#126">126</a>]. The
hybrid is named <i> Centaurea</i> &#215 <i>psammogena</i>  Gayer [<a href="#70">70</a>]. For more information, see the <a href="https://www.centaurea.net/">Centaurea website</a>.

GENERAL DISTRIBUTION:</a>

<br />


Diffuse knapweed is native to grasslands and shrub steppes of the eastern Mediterranean and western
Asia [<a href="#66">66</a>] and was introduced into Central Europe and
North
America [<a href="#71">71</a>]. It is
thought to have been introduced to North America as a contaminant in alfalfa (<i>Medicago
sativa</i>) seed from Asia Minor-Turkmenistan or in hybrid alfalfa seed from Germany
[<a href="#58">58</a>]. The earliest record of
diffuse knapweed in North America is from an alfalfa field in Washington state in
1907 [<a href="#86">86</a>]. It is currently found from Yukon in the north, throughout most of western Canada,
east to Ontario. In the United States, the
primary range of diffuse knapweed is the western states, from Washington, Idaho
and Montana south to New Mexico and Arizona [<a href="#42">42</a>]. Maddox [<a href="#59">59</a>] notes
that diffuse knapweed is more common on the western side of the Great Basin, and
spotted knapweed is more common on the eastern side. Diffuse knapweed has also spread east into
several midwestern states and is found in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New
Jersey on the east coast [<a href="#42">42</a>]. The <a href="https://plants.usda.gov/">Plants</a>
database provides a distribution map of diffuse knapweed in the United States.

<p>
 The following table reflects estimates of spotted knapweed acreage as reported by
surveyed states or provinces in 1988 and again in 2000 (from [<a href="#20">20</a>]):

<p>
 Although
inventories are more common and more accurate in the year 2000 than in 1988, 50% of these states reported only
50% accuracy, while 31% reported 51 to 75% accuracy, and 2 states reported 75 to
100% accuracy [<a href="#20">20</a>].</p>


<p>
 The following lists reflect ecosystems and cover types in which
 diffuse knapweed is known or thought to be invasive. Diffuse knapweed occurs in
 some midwestern and eastern states and provinces, primarily along roadsides and in
 &quot;waste places&quot;, but it is unclear, from the available literature on
 these areas, which
ecosystems and cover types it occurs in. These lists are not,
 therefore,
 exhaustive, as the plant may be invasive in other types as well.</p>

Pacific Northwest: Diffuse knapweed is found primarily in the eastern part of Washington state,
on the northwest slopes of the Columbia
River Basin. Here it may be found in shrub steppe, natural grassland, and
dry forest steppe types [<a href="#87">87</a>]. Diffuse knapweed demonstrates superior invasiveness in
antelope bitterbrush (<i>Purshia
tridentata</i>)/bluebunch
wheatgrass (<i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i>) communities, with or without needle-and-thread
grass (<i>Hesperostipa comata</i>) in eastern Washington [<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>]. It may also be dominant in bitterbrush habitat types with or without an overstory of ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus
ponderosa</i>). Diffuse knapweed is also common in ponderosa pine/shrub, Douglas-fir/common snowberry (<i>Pseudotsuga
menziesii/Symphoricarpos albus</i>), and Douglas-fir/ninebark (<i>Physocarpus malvaceus</i>)
habitat types that have been cleared and either converted to pasture or support tree regeneration. Most dryland
pastures now dominated by diffuse knapweed
were previously dominated by Kentucky bluegrass (<i>Poa pratensis</i>). On the
east slope of the Cascades, diffuse knapweed can be found at middle to low
elevations from ponderosa pine and bunchgrass habitats into big sagebrush (<i>Artemisia
tridentata</i>)/bunchgrass types [<a href="#85">85</a>], where it may be found
with bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass (<i>Poa secunda</i>), Russian-thistle (<i>Salsola kali</i>), and cheatgrass (<i>Bromus tectorum</i>) [<a href="#96">96</a>].

<p>In Utah, the antelope bitterbrush/bunchgrass shrub steppe is
highly susceptible to invasion by diffuse knapweed [<a href="#85">85</a>].
</p>

<p>In Colorado, diffuse knapweed invades the shortgrass
steppe along the Front Range, including the foothills. Adjacent
montane zones and the lower elevation pinyon-juniper-oak (<i>Pinus-Juniperus-Quercus
</i>spp.)
brush zones are also
susceptible [<a href="#85">85</a>]. Diffuse knapweed is also found on upland sites in pinyon and
juniper woodlands in the interior west [<a href="#114">114</a>].
</p>

<p>In Montana, diffuse knapweed infestations are found primarily on
grasslands and fringe forest areas near Helena, Big Timber, and Ennis [<a href="#49">49</a>]. It is well adapted to open-forested areas, especially after logging or other
disturbances [<a href="#27">27</a>].</p>

Canada: The interior natural
grasslands and fringe forest areas of southern British Columbia and the
shortgrass prairies of Alberta and Saskatchewan are considered vulnerable to diffuse knapweed
invasion [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>]. Native
bunchgrasses may be replaced with annual grasses, sagebrush (<i>Artemisia</i>
spp.), and diffuse and spotted knapweed
[<a href="#80">80</a>]. Diffuse knapweed may be found with
bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue (<i>Festuca idahoensis</i>), bluegrasses (<i>Poa</i>
spp.), needle-and-thread grass, Columbia
needlegrass (<i>Achnatherum nelsonii </i>ssp.<i> dorei</i>), sand dropseed (<i>Sporobolus
cryptandrus</i>), and slender wheatgrass (<i>Elymus trachycaulus</i>)
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>]. In British Columbia, diffuse
knapweed is also found in areas supporting ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, antelope
bitterbrush, and ninebark communities. Diffuse knapweed has also established on dry
subzones of the ponderosa pine, interior Douglas-fir, montane spruce, and
interior cedar-hemlock biogeoclimatic zones in southern interior of British
Columbia. Here it may be found with Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus
contorta</i>), Engelmann spruce (<i>Picea engelmannii</i>), subalpine
fir (<i>Abies lasiocarpa</i>), and understory components
such as pinegrass (<i>Calamagrostis rubescens</i>), fireweed (<i>Epilobium
angustifolium</i>), and <i> Vaccinium</i>
spp. [<a href="#79">79</a>].

<br />

Diffuse knapweed is an exotic, annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial forb [<a href="#22">22</a>]. During the juvenile stage, diffuse knapweed is a rosette
with deeply divided basal leaves borne on short stalks on a central crown with a
taproot. At maturity diffuse knapweed produces 1 upright stem, rarely 2. Stems
are 1 to 3 feet (0.3-1 m) tall, with numerous, spreading
branches that give the plant a ball-shaped appearance and tumble-weed mobility
when broken off. Stem leaves on diffuse knapweed are stalkless, getting smaller and less
divided higher up the stem. Flowerheads are solitary or borne in clusters of 2
or 3 at the ends of branches. Diffuse knapweed flowerheads are 3-6 mm in diameter and
8-11 mm
long, excluding spines and flowers. Bracts are edged with a fringe of spines, with
a longer 1.5-4 mm, erect spine at the tip. Seeds are
achenes, 2-3 mm long with a plume of bristle-like hairs that vary from scalelike to 1/8 the
length of the seed [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].

<p>Once it is established, the highly competitive
diffuse knapweed can form monotypic stands. The competitive ability of diffuse
knapweed has been attributed to its being adept at depleting soil moisture [<a href="#108">108</a>],
to allelopathy [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>], and
to other competitive or interference mechanisms [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].

Diffuse knapweed reproduces by seed and is generally biennial. The plants begin
as low rosettes and may remain in this
form for 1 to several years, until they reach a critical size (e.g. root crown
diameter [<a href="#80">80</a>]), or stage of
development (e.g. leaf number). At this point
they respond to vernalization (i.e. low temperatures) by bolting,
flowering, setting seed, and dying. Thus, they may behave as annuals,
biennials, or short-lived perennials, a habit sometimes designated as
&quot;semelparous perennial&quot; [<a href="#116">116</a>].


<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Pollination:</b></font> Diffuse knapweed is primarily insect pollinated [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. Honeybees, bumble bees, and digger bees
are frequent diffuse knapweed flower
visitors [<a href="#39">39</a>]. Fertilization in diffuse knapweed requires cross-pollination between flowers on different plants. This can limit the reproductive success of isolated
individuals, but it also promotes
genetic diversity and may thereby improve competitive ability. Watson and Renney
[<a href="#128">128</a>] reported that diffuse knapweed is self-compatible, but the results of Harrod and Taylor
[<a href="#39">39</a>]
refute this assertion.</p>

<p>Considerable variation in seed production was
observed between sites and years in northeastern Washington; nonetheless, seed production
was estimated to be 1,000 times what would be necessary to maintain observed levels of infestation [<a href="#93">93</a>].
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed dispersal:</b></font> Dispersal of diffuse knapweed seed is mainly by wind. Seeds usually
remain in the flowerheads after they mature and break away from the receptacle.
Dispersal in the vicinity of the parent plant is facilitated by horizontally
placed seedheads that open at the top and release seeds as dehydration occurs
and plants sway in the
wind. Dispersal over longer distances occurs when plants are broken off at
ground level and tumble in the wind, dispensing seeds individually from the small opening at the top of the seedheads
[<a href="#128">128</a>]. This technique adapts well to &quot;hitchhiking&quot; on the frames of vehicles and
colonizing the bare shoulders of roads. Seeds may also be transported in mud
adhering to vehicles or shoes [<a href="#129">129</a>]. Plants bearing seeds may also be carried
in rivers and irrigation systems, thus colonizing the banks of waterways [<a href="#85">85</a>]. In British Columbia, logging trucks, off-road vehicles,
and trail bikes have greatly contributed to the spread of both spotted and
diffuse knapweed [<a href="#112">112</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed banking:</b></font> Evidence suggests that diffuse knapweed seed germination is distributed over time [<a href="#69">69</a>].
This may be considered as evidence of seed banking, although the length of time
that diffuse knapweed seeds remain viable in the soil seed bank is undetermined.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><i>Viability:</i></font> Seed viability information for diffuse
knapweed is scarce. In British Columbia , diffuse knapweed seed removed from seedheads at maturity exhibited 40%
germination;
25-day-old seed stored under dry conditions exhibited 68% germination; and seeds that overwintered in the
seedhead under field conditions exhibited 88% germination [<a href="#128">128</a>]. Watson
[<a href="#129">129</a>]
reports successful (93-95%) laboratory germination of 20-month-old seed stored at room
temperature [<a href="#138">138</a>]. Another laboratory germination test showed greater than 95% viability
of diffuse knapweed seeds, although germination values observed in the field
were &lt;70% [<a href="#93">93</a>]. 
</p>


<p>
<font face="Bell MT">
<i>
Germination:</i></font> Diffuse knapweed seeds germinate in spring
(May/June) or late summer/early fall (August/September), and develop into low-lying, tap-rooted rosettes
given sufficient moisture [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>]. Diffuse knapweed seeds germinated under
a wide range of environmental conditions simulated in the laboratory.
Germination of over 80% occurred between 55 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit (13-28 &deg;C) at optimum moisture
levels [<a href="#128">128</a>]. Diffuse knapweed seeds require more than 55% soil moisture to
initiate germination, with optimum emergence between 65 and 70% [<a href="#107">107</a>]. Diffuse knapweed seeds germinate best on the soil surface, with emergence rate decreasing as
seeding depth increases, and little to no emergence below 1 inch (2.5 cm) [<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>]. Spears and others
[<a href="#107">107</a>]
found diffuse knapweed seeds germinated equally well over the range of 0 to
100% canopy cover. Nolan and Upadyaya [<a href="#69">69</a>] observed 3 types of germination
behavior in diffuse knapweed with respect to light conditions: nondormant seeds
that
can germinate in the dark; light-sensitive seeds that germinate after exposure
to red light; and light-insensitive dormant seeds that do not respond to
exposure to red light. They concluded that bunchgrass rangeland and other
open canopy conditions provide favorable light conditions for diffuse knapweed
seed germination.
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seedling establishment:</b></font> Stannard [<a href="#108">108</a>] reports high seedling vigor in
diffuse knapweed, while Myers and Berube [<a href="#68">68</a>] indicate that the greatest
mortality in diffuse knapweed occurs between the seedling and rosette stages.
Seedling mortality is
highest during the summer and is largely related to moisture availability [<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>]. Once diffuse knapweed seedlings
establish as rosettes, they become very drought resistant [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Crowding of plants
is also a factor in seedling and
juvenile mortality, with mortality rates highest among the smallest rosettes, and
declining with size under crowded conditions. The proportion of diffuse knapweed
plants that
flower and produce seed each year (and subsequently die) increases with
available growing space [<a href="#80">80</a>]. Additionally, Powell [<a href="#80">80</a>] observed
that the majority of diffuse knapweed rosettes that died during the summer at 1 site in
British Columbia were infested with the larvae of the introduced biocontrol
beetle <i>Sphenoptera jugoslavica</i>, and suggested that the damage caused by
the larvae increased the susceptibility of rosettes to interference-related
mortality. Amount and pattern of rainfall are important for diffuse knapweed
survival. Wetting increases germination, but
when followed by drying (e.g. the wet-dry cycle occurring with the summer convective storms in British Columbia
ranges) seedling survival is diminished [<a href="#11">11</a>]. High spring precipitation
appears to
favor diffuse knapweed seedling establishment [<a href="#101">101</a>].</p>

Asexual regeneration:</b></font>  Diffuse knapweed can sprout from the root crown after

SITE CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Semiarid rangeland and dry open forest sites in the northwestern U.S. are subject to invasion
by diffuse knapweed, especially with disturbance. In British Columbia, density
of diffuse knapweed was significantly (p&lt;0.05) correlated with degree of soil
disturbance, but not with any soil chemical properties [<a href="#129">129</a>]. Disturbance also allows diffuse knapweed to invade a
wide range of
habitats [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>], where it can rapidly establish dense, often monotypic, stands. Disturbances may be as small as rodent activity or a single hailstorm
[<a href="#50">50</a>] and may not
be recent [<a href="#85">85</a>]. Typical disturbed sites
subject to diffuse knapweed invasion include transportation corridors, water
ways, gravel pits, and industrial areas [<a href="#88">88</a>]. Diffuse knapweed is also capable of invading
well-managed rangeland [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>].<p>Diffuse knapweed is tolerant of a wide range of total
precipitation and temperature conditions but does best in semiarid and arid conditions,
and is most competitive in areas receiving between 12 and 17 inches (305-432 mm)
of annual
precipitation [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>]. Diffuse knapweed is susceptible to flooded or
waterlogged conditions, and infestations stop abruptly with an increase in
soil
moisture near temporary and permanent streams. Irrigation can also eliminate
diffuse knapweed [<a href="#68">68</a>]. Diffuse knapweed is not competitive in
moist microsites such as gullies, depressions, and poorly drained
soils [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>]. Diffuse knapweed seeds require conditions near field capacity for
at least 4 days to begin germination. Seedling root growth in diffuse knapweed
may be sensitive to
saline conditions (electrical conductivity of 4 dS m<sup>-1</sup>). Seedling
root growth may also be sensitive to and germination delayed by water stress (osmotic potential of -0.5 mP or less)
[<a href="#45">45</a>].</p>

<p>
In eastern Washington, diffuse knapweed grows on all aspects and slope positions,
from flat to over 60% [<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>].
In the Gilpin range, British Columbia, knapweed is commonly found on south-facing
slopes below 3,000 feet (900 m) [<a href="#63">63</a>]. The following table provides some elevation

<p>Diffuse knapweed is commonly found on well-drained soils
such as sandy or gravelly loams or loamy fine sands, with coarse fragments from 0 to over
80% [<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>]. It is less competitive on shallow
soils (&lt; 15 inches (38 cm) deep) and very coarse textured soils such as sand
or loamy coarse sand, although it may thrive on these sites when disturbance
removes other vegetation [<a href="#87">87</a>]. It grows best on fertile, well-watered
Cryoborolls, mesic Argiudolls, and mesic Hapludolls in open and uncultivated
sites with summer drought [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>].

Diffuse knapweed is an early successional species that establishes best on
disturbed ground. Although diffuse knapweed seeds can germinate in the dark [69,107], diffuse knapweed plants do not grow
well in dense shade [85]. Diffuse knapweed can dominate a site over time and
persist in monotypic stands [100]. <a href="#69"></a><a href="#107"></a><a href="#85"></a><a href="#100"></a>

<br><br>


SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT">
</a>
</span>
<br />

The phenology of individual diffuse knapweed plants is highly variable and
dependent on climatic and site conditions such as moisture, temperature, and plant
density. Diffuse knapweed seedlings usually emerge under favorable conditions in spring and/or
fall and develop into
rosettes. Most root development occurs during this stage [128].
Rosettes respond
to a period of cold temperature (vernalization) and bolt when a critical
size or stage of development is reached [80,116]. Diffuse knapweed plants that complete their juvenile growth
by fall and overwinter as rosettes usually bolt in early May. Plants that do not
complete the juvenile stage by the end of fall remain as rosettes through the 2nd
year and may bolt during the 3rd year. Flower buds are formed in early June.
Flowering occurs
July through September [18,128] or
later as permitted by adequate moisture and mild temperatures [85]. Mature seeds are usually formed
by mid-August, followed by death of the plant. Dead plants break off at ground level
in the spring and tumble with the wind, spreading
seed as they roll [128].<a href="#128"></a><a href="#80"></a><a href="#116"></a><a href="#18"></a><a href="#128"></a><a href="#85"></a><a href="#128"></a><br><br>


Powell [80] found that under
conditions of severe crowding, a plant might not flower for 5 or more
years. Other exceptions include plants that germinate in early spring
that may flower the 1st year (&lt;1% observed) [93], and plants that continue to grow after producing seed to flower again the
following year, behaving as short-lived perennials [85]. <a href="#80"></a><a href="#93"></a><a href="#85"></a>

<br />

<font face="Bell MT">Fire adaptations:</font> Information on the fire
ecology and adaptations of diffuse knapweed to fire is lacking in the literature. Diffuse knapweed has a large, perennial taproot
that may survive fire if the root crown
is not killed. It also produces large quantities of seed that may survive fire. 

<p><font face="Bell MT">Fire regimes:</font> Diffuse knapweed
occurs primarily in bunchgrass and open ponderosa pine forest community types in
the northwestern United States and southern British Columbia.
The historical fire regimes of these communities were relatively frequent, low-severity surface
fires. Diffuse knapweed did not occur in these communities at the time in which these fire regimes were functioning,
but has established since fire exclusion began. It is unclear
how this type of fire regime might affect diffuse knapweed populations. It
is also unclear how the presence of diffuse knapweed might affect these fire
regimes, though it has been observed that closely related species, such as spotted
knapweed (see the <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/forb/censtom/index.html">spotted knapweed</a>
 summary in FEIS), do not carry fire
as readily as grasses [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>]. If this holds true for diffuse knapweed, dense infestations
may change the
fire regime by changing the fuel characteristics and reducing the fire
return interval at a given site.</p>

Although experimental evidence is lacking, a single, low-severity fire will
probably not kill diffuse knapweed unless it is severe enough to kill the root
crown. A low-severity fire will also probably not kill diffuse knapweed
seeds stored in the soil. It is unclear what effects a severe fire
would have on diffuse knapweed plants and seeds. Research in this area is needed.

PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE">
</a>
</span>
<br />

Diffuse knapweed may sprout from the root crown and/or establish from seed after
fire [85]. It is unclear how diffuse knapweed populations may respond to fire. Reports in
the literature are scarce and based primarily on speculation and second-hand
information, with little experimental evidence available. It can be assumed that the response of diffuse knapweed to fire will
vary with the nature of the prefire plant community, the timing and conditions of the burn, and the conditions of the
postfire environment. <a href="#85"></a>

<p>Harrod and others [<a href="#40">40</a>] suggested that fire might reduce the ability of
diffuse knapweed to produce seed in
the current year, since many bolting stems appeared to be reverted back to a rosette
stage after fire. This might allow grasses (which appear to be stimulated by fire) to
gain a competitive advantage [<a href="#40">40</a>]. A single fire in northern
Washington, however, increased the cover and density of both diffuse and spotted knapweed without enhancing desired
species [<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>]. Roche and Roche
[<a href="#85">85</a>] suggest that diffuse knapweed can resprout even after intense
wildfire at bolting or flowering stages, although they provide no experimental
evidence for this assertion. They further suggest that fire may damage desirable residual species
while stimulating knapweed (<i>Centaurea</i> spp.) populations. 
</p>

<p>Reproduction by abundant
seed gives
diffuse knapweed an advantage in fire-prone environments. Spotted knapweed seeds
demonstrate some resistance to high temperatures [<a href="#1">1</a>]. This may also be true for
diffuse knapweed. Diffuse
knapweed seeds may persist in the soil and germinate after fire. Where diffuse
knapweed plants are left standing, seeds may be present above ground as well. This &quot;aerial seed bank&quot; may or may not
be an
advantage after fire, depending upon the characteristics of the fire. Renney and Hughes
[<a href="#84">84</a>] suggest that burning shows some promise for diffuse knapweed control,
especially since the viability of seeds
held above ground in the seedhead is considerably reduced by heat, though
they give no reference to experimental evidence for this conclusion.&nbsp;Watson
[<a href="#129">129</a>] notes that seed collected from diffuse knapweed plants in an area burned
by a mid-August wildfire was not viable.

Fire as a control agent:</b></font> With very few examples in the literature
of the effects of fire on diffuse knapweed, it is not surprising to find mixed
opinions on the potential effectiveness of fire to control the plant. Control of
diffuse knapweed with a single fire is likely to be only temporary [85], because it is a perennial species that
produces abundant seed that spreads by tumbleweed action [84]. It is commonly suggested that fire may be used to remove plant debris
and improve herbicide efficacy, but again, there is no experimental evidence to
support this [22,85]. <a href="#85"></a><a href="#84"></a><a href="#22"></a><a href="#85"></a> 

<p>Others suggest that burning may be an effective means of
controlling diffuse knapweed in areas
where seasonal or occasional fires are part of the natural ecosystem [<a href="#16">16</a>].
Watson and Renney [<a href="#128">128</a>] cite Popova (1960) as reporting that fire provides effective control
of diffuse knapweed, with vigorous grass regrowth after burning in the Crimea.
Additionally, repeated burning of prairie and dune
sites in Michigan has proven to encourage growth of native vegetation
and reduce spotted knapweed density [<a href="#61">61</a>]. Repeated burns may also prevent new
seed production and eventually deplete the seed bank. 
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Postfire colonization potential:</b> </font>  
Diffuse knapweed has the potential to invade an area following fire. Fire
provides an ideal seedbed by removing shade and exposing mineral soil.
Therefore, if diffuse knapweed was present on or near the site prior to the fire, there
is potential for its establishment. It is a good idea to survey the surrounding
area for diffuse knapweed skeletons that may contain seed that could be
dispersed through tumbleweed action.

Diffuse knapweed is 1 of the introduced species mentioned as
&quot;taking over large tracts of logged, burned, or otherwise disturbed lands
in British Columbia&quot; [<a href="#119">119</a>]. 
</p>

<p>The USDA Forest Service's &quot;Guide to Noxious Weed
Prevention Practices&quot; [<a href="#120">120</a>] provides several fire management
considerations for weed prevention in general that apply to diffuse knapweed. Wildfire managers might consider
including weed prevention education and providing weed identification
aids during fire training; avoiding known weed
infestations when locating fire lines, monitoring camps, staging areas,
helibases, etc., to be sure they are kept weed free; taking care that equipment is weed free;
incorporating weed prevention into fire rehabilitation plans; and acquiring restoration
funding.
</p>

<p>When planning a prescribed burn, inventory the project area and evaluate
the cover and phenology of any diffuse
knapweed present on or adjacent to the site, and avoid ignition and burning in areas at high risk
for diffuse knapweed establishment or spread due to fire effects. Avoid creating soil conditions that promote weed
germination and establishment. Discuss weed status
and risks in burn rehabilitation plans.
</p>

To prevent
infestation, re-establish vegetation on bare ground as soon after fire as possible, using
either natural recovery or artificial techniques as appropriate to site
conditions and objectives. When reseeding after wildfires and prescribed burns, use only certified weed-free seed. Monitor the burn site and associated disturbed areas after the fire and the following spring for emergence of
diffuse knapweed, and treat to eradicate any emergent diffuse knapweed plants.
Regulate
human, pack animal, and livestock entry into burned areas at risk for weed
invasion until desirable site vegetation has recovered sufficiently to resist weed
invasion. Additional guidelines and specific recommendations and requirements are
available [120]. <a href="#120"></a>

IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE:

<a name="IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE">
</a>
</span>
<br />

Diffuse knapweed replaces traditional wildlife and livestock forage on range and pasturelands [19,63,68], and reports of its use
by grazing animals vary. Watson and Renney [128] report that while it is
not poisonous, the presence of diffuse knapweed in hay or on rangeland can decrease
feeding value to livestock and wildlife species. They also note that in
situations of overgrazing or drought, when fewer forage species are available, the flower shoots are
sometimes grazed while immature rosettes are not [128]. Although rosettes of the
1st year's growth are
nutritious and edible, they are difficult for cattle to eat because they are
closely appressed to the ground (Popova 1960 as cited by [99]). Mature knapweed plants are
coarse and fibrous and the spines on the bracts can be very irritating [99] or may even cause injury to
the mouths and digestive tracts of grazing
animals [128]. Diffuse knapweed is grazed by deer and
domestic sheep [99], and by elk and cattle, at least through the bolting
stage [85]. <a href="#19"></a><a href="#63"></a><a href="#68"></a><a href="#128"></a><a href="#128"></a><a href="#99"></a><a href="#99"></a><a href="#128"></a><a href="#99"></a><a href="#85"></a>

<p>
Miller [<a href="#63">63</a>] observed California and Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, white-tailed deer, mule deer, and
elk consuming diffuse and
spotted knapweed in the Gilpin range, and in the Robson/Syringa Park
area in British Columbia. Knapweeds are important forage for these animals in the winter
and early spring. In the Gilpin range, knapweed rosettes comprised 80% of
the diet of California bighorn sheep as the snow receded in January and
February, and
knapweed seedheads were the most common component of their diet when snow depth
exceeded 8 inches (20 cm). When snow did not restrict availability, knapweed rosettes and bluegrass
comprised 90% of the diet of mule and white-tailed deer during February and
early March. In the Robson/Syringa Park
area, Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep utilized
knapweed seedheads and basal rosettes throughout the year, while local deer and elk
populations foraged on knapweed rosettes in late fall/early winter, and again
when snow cover receded and spring greenup commenced. The impact of knapweed consumption on the
welfare of these animals, and
the effects of heavy utilization of rosettes need further
examination [<a href="#63">63</a>]. Harris [<a href="#34">34</a>] notes that deer in British Columbia
began eating knapweed seedheads as winter browse after the establishment of the <i>Urophora</i>
spp. seedhead flies, and that almost all the nutrition in these seedheads comes
from these insect larvae.
</p>

<p>Diffuse knapweed is a source of pollen and nectar for honey bees during
mid- to late summer when other sources are in short supply, and it is sometimes eaten by
pest grasshoppers during outbreaks [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>]. At high densities, grasshoppers
may consume large amounts of knapweed and reduce seed production [<a href="#25">25</a>]. Birds and
rodents,
including chipmunks, use diffuse knapweed seeds for food [<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. Chipmunks probably
cache some seed for later use [<a href="#86">86</a>].
</p>


PALATABILITY:


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="PALATABILITY">
</a>
</span>
<br />

Fielding and others [25]
observed that diffuse knapweed had low palatability to 2 generalist herbivore
grasshoppers, and suggested that this may confer a competitive advantage to
diffuse knapweed over other rangeland plants. They suggested that diffuse
knapweed palatability
may be related to varying concentrations of the compound cnicin in different plant parts
during different times of year. <a href="#25"></a> 

<p>
Palatability of diffuse knapweed to a foraging animal is
probably more closely related to its availability relative to other forage
plants [<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. 
</p>


NUTRITIONAL VALUE:


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="NUTRITIONAL VALUE">
</a>
</span>
<br />

Nutritional value of diffuse knapweed varies with the developmental stage of the plant and the season. Crude protein levels
of diffuse knapweed were measured at 18% in
the rosette stage, 11% in the bolt stage, 8% during bud and flowering stages, and 7%
at seed-ripe stage [85]. In the
Gilpin range, British Columbia, nutritional value of diffuse knapweed was
comparable to associated grasses in the area, with crude protein levels higher than crude protein in associated grasses at that
time [63]:<a href="#85"></a><a href="#63"></a><br><br>

Diffuse knapweed provides nectar and pollen for honey bees [128,129].
In laboratory tests, some extracts
from diffuse knapweed inhibited larval growth of variegated cutworms [91], while other extracts inhibited the growth of various plants
[106], suggesting a potential to develop pesticides and herbicides from these extracts.

IMPACTS AND CONTROL:


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="IMPACTS AND CONTROL">
</a>
</span>
<br />

<b><font face="Bell MT">Impacts: </font></b>Many environmental and economic losses
have been attributed to diffuse knapweed infestations. Examples include replacing wildlife and livestock forage on rangeland and pasture [19,36,63,68,101,128],
depleting soil and water resources [19,85,101],
displacing native species on wildlands [137], reducing biodiversity [19,101],
reducing land value [19,85], and disflavoring milk
[59]. <a href="#19"></a><a href="#36"></a><a href="#63"></a><a href="#68"></a><a href="#101"></a><a href="#128"></a><a href="#19"></a><a href="#85"></a><a href="#101"></a><a href="#137"></a><a href="#19"></a><a href="#101"></a><a href="#19"></a><a href="#85"></a><a href="#59"></a>

<p>The presence of knapweeds may be a symptom of range
degradation. Diffuse knapweed fills niches created by soil disturbance and
can also invade good condition range in the absence of grazing [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>]. Diffuse knapweed invasion can be insidious or rapid
and conspicuous [<a href="#50">50</a>].
</p>

<p> In a study conducted in
British Columbia, neither diffuse nor spotted knapweed inhibited the
growth or survival of conifer seedlings (lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir) [<a href="#79">79</a>]. Similarly, diffuse knapweed did not affect seed weight
in antelope bitterbrush at British Columbia and northern Washington sites [<a href="#47">47</a>]. Diffuse knapweed does, however, possess several traits
that give it an advantage over perennial grasses such as
intense competitiveness, rapid growth rates, large seed output, and extended
growing periods. Continuous seed rain and sequential seedling emergence
allow diffuse knapweed to occupy more microsites for seed germination, and to
maximize site dominance and eventually form monotypic stands [<a href="#100">100</a>]. Even under good range conditions, bluebunch wheatgrass
may offer little
resistance to knapweed invasion. Diffuse and spotted knapweed growing at
moderate densities among bunchgrasses in British Columbia were more vigorous than when growing
alone. Inhibition of the bunchgrasses may not occur until threshold densities of knapweed
are reached [<a href="#2">2</a>].
</p>

<p>Diffuse knapweed may suppress other vegetation by allelopathy
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>]. Diffuse knapweed contains varying concentrations of phytotoxic secondary compounds
[<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>]; however, the importance of allelopathy has been challenged since concentrations
of these compounds in soil are usually below
phytotoxic levels [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>]. Allelopathy may be
part of a more complex interference strategy that includes other specialized mechanisms unknown to the plant communities that it invades [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Control:</b></font>   Lasting control of diffuse knapweed requires proper
land management to maintain desired vegetation. It is important to define land use
objectives before developing management plans for invasive plants. Killing the
target plant is
not usually an adequate objective. An
understanding of basic diffuse knapweed biology (see the &quot;Botanical and Ecological
Characteristics&quot; section of this report) will help land managers choose
appropriate control tools and determine proper timing of their application according to
the plant's life cycle, as part of a long-term control program [<a href="#83">83</a>]. More information on
diffuse knapweed's
requirements for litter cover, soil moisture, and nutrient needs for establishment
and spread can enable managers to develop more effective integrated management programs
[<a href="#57">57</a>].
</p>

<p> For diffuse knapweed, a biennial or short-lived
perennial that reproduces by seed, control is very effective during the
1st
season of growth when the plant is in the rosette stage and prior to the
development of viable seed. A plan to prevent new seed production (e.g.
killing the plant or destroying the aboveground portion prior to seed set) can contain existing infestations.
To deplete the
existing seed bank, areas must then be monitored 2 to 3
times a year, for several years, and any new
rosettes destroyed. It is important to document the location
and densities of any diffuse knapweed stands or individual plants in order to record the
rate of spread of the infestation and
to know where to look for emerging seedlings and rosettes in following years [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>]. Steps must then be taken to prevent reinfestation
by cooperating with managers of adjacent land, and land along shared transportation and water
corridors, and by being aware of and preventing potential seed dispersal
vectors. For instance when diffuse and spotted knapweed were first found in Alberta in 1974,
an
eradication program was launched that included cooperation between provincial
and local government agencies and landowners.
By 1985, the infestation was reduced to scattered plants and remains so, to date. Early detection and
public awareness were keys to their success [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
Integrated weed management (IWM): </font>
The use of multiple control methods is
important when implementing any weed management system [<a href="#83">83</a>],
because multiple approaches can create a cumulative stress on the plant, thus reducing its ability to flourish and
spread. A combination of methods also provides some redundancy, in
case 1 type of control treatment is ineffective [<a href="#16">16</a>]. With combinations of treatments,
timing is critical
and must be customized to the plant community, present and desired, and to site
conditions [<a href="#21">21</a>]. Procedures that increase bare ground on rangeland without replacement
by desirable species are not
recommended [<a href="#22">22</a>].
</p>

<p>
 IWM is more than just combining 2 or more
methods to control a weed population; it is a long-term commitment to replace weed-infested plant
communities with more desirable plant communities in a way that is complementary
to the ecology and economics of the site. IWM is a multidisciplinary, ecological
approach for containing or controlling undesirable plant species using all
available methods, including education, prevention, physical or mechanical
methods, biological control agents, herbicides, cultural methods and other land management practices. The methods selected for control of
diffuse knapweed on a specific site will be determined by the land use objectives,
environmental factors, economics, the extent and nature of the infestation(s), and
the effectiveness of the control techniques on diffuse knapweed [<a href="#83">83</a>]. Sheley and others
[<a href="#102">102</a>] suggest using a generalized objective such as developing
an ecologically healthy plant community that is weed resistant and meets other
land-use objectives such as livestock forage, wildlife habitat, or
recreation. A weed-resistant plant community is comprised
of diverse species that occupy most of the niches [<a href="#22">22</a>]. Once the desired plant community has been determined, an integrated weed management strategy can be
developed to direct succession
toward that plant community by identifying key mechanisms and processes directing plant community
dynamics (site availability, species availability, and species performance) and
predicting plant community response to control measures [<a href="#98">98</a>].
</p>

<p>Prior to deciding which control measures are most
appropriate, a land manager should: 1) inventory and assess the land to determine the size of the infestation(s); 2) assess
non-target vegetation in the management area; 3) determine soil types, climatic
conditions, and important water resources; and 4) determine the limitations of
various control methods [<a href="#83">83</a>]. Also
necessary for a successful IWM program is cooperation between all private
and public
landowners and government agencies that manage land in the area [<a href="#22">22</a>].
Additional components in any
integrated weed management program are sustained effort, monitoring and
evaluation for several years,
and the adoption of improved strategies [<a href="#99">99</a>].
</p>

<p>Some
examples of combined approaches are presented within the following sections. Managers are encouraged to use combinations of
control techniques in a manner that is appropriate to the site objectives,
desired plant community, available resources, and timing of application.
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Prevention:</font> Preventing the
spread of diffuse knapweed is the most economically and
ecologically effective management strategy [<a href="#99">99</a>]. Prevention is
achieved by minimizing soil disturbance on range and other noncrop lands,
early detection and treatment of newly established plants, eradication of small infestations before they spread,
containing large infestations, and
preventing seed dispersal. Seeding desirable perennial grass species on areas disturbed by
logging, fire, construction,
mining or other activities can help prevent diffuse knapweed invasion [<a href="#22">22</a>]. Renney and Hughes
[<a href="#84">84</a>] suggested in 1969 that much of the knapweed infestation could
be contained if transportation corridors (highways, roads and trails) could be
rid of the plants.
</p>

<p> Proper grazing management is essential to
the maintenance of a competitive, desirable plant community that can slow
diffuse knapweed encroachment [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>]. To minimize weed
invasion, grazing systems should alter the season of use, rotate or combine
livestock types and pastures, and allow grazed plants to recover before being
regrazed [<a href="#22">22</a>]. In eastern Washington, the establishment of diffuse knapweed was enhanced when defoliation of
bluebunch wheatgrass exceeded 60%, suggesting that defoliation above this level
reduced the competitiveness of the grass. Diffuse knapweed density did not initially increase on
a similar crested wheatgrass site,
but after a year it increased when crested wheatgrass was defoliated by 80-100%.
Although
this study indicates that moderate defoliation does not accelerate diffuse
knapweed invasion,
disturbances associated with grazing, such as trampling and exposed mineral
soil, were not examined [<a href="#101">101</a>].
</p>

<p>Public
awareness of the identity and characteristics of diffuse knapweed and support
of local weed management programs can help prevent seed dispersal. Driving,
walking, biking and trailing animals through infested areas must be avoided.
When vehicles have been in weed-infested areas, it is important to wash the undercarriage
before driving through uninfested areas [<a href="#22">22</a>]. Additionally, use
only certified weed-seed free seed and hay for livestock before entering the
backcountry, and avoid grazing livestock on
knapweed-infested
sites during flowering and seeding. When this cannot be avoided, it is important
to hold livestock for 7 days
before moving to uninfested pastures [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#138">138</a>].
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Physical or mechanical:</font>  Physical
and mechanical approaches to diffuse knapweed control include hand pulling, digging, tilling,
disking, and cutting or mowing. Physical removal of, or damage
to diffuse knapweed plants may offer some degree of control depending on the timing
and frequency of treatment, the condition of desired vegetation and the degree of soil disturbance
imposed by the treatment itself. The Salmon River Restoration Council
provides an example of nonchemical spotted and diffuse knapweed
control in the Salmon River watershed in northern California, using physical and
mechanical control techniques such as hand pulling and digging, propane torching, mulching with black
plastic (solarization), and mowing [<a href="#46">46</a>]. See their website, <a href="https://www.srrc.org/">SRRC</a>,
for detailed information on this program.
</p>

<p>Control of diffuse knapweed by hand pulling is
feasible for scattered diffuse knapweed plants or in areas where
other control methods are not feasible and sufficient hands are available. It is important to remove the entire taproot with as little soil
disturbance as possible [<a href="#137">137</a>]. Diffuse knapweed rosettes cut just below the crown regrew 38% of
the time, while only 4% of those cut 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm) below the crown
resprouted [<a href="#85">85</a>]. Pulling works best when done 3 times
per year. Begin by removing diffuse knapweed plants in spring, taking care to get
a &quot;lethal portion&quot; of the root. This is easiest done when soil is moist. Pull again
in June to remove bolting plants before they flower and set seed. Finally,
pull plants just before seed dispersal, taking care to remove plants from the
site and dispose of them in a manner that ensures seeds are not dispersed [<a href="#137">137</a>]. After
5 years of this regimen
using volunteers in Oregon to control small populations of diffuse
knapweed scattered amongst native plants,
average density of diffuse knapweed plants was reduced 98%. About 10 personhours
are then required each season to monitor and
remove the few dozen plants that sprout from the seed bank. For larger
infestations, a combination of chemical and mechanical control can be used. In
Oregon and Colorado, diffuse knapweed was sprayed with picloram in the spring, followed
later in season by mechanical removal of plants that were missed with
herbicides, with good results [<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#136">136</a>]. In some cases, however, hand pulling may
not be effective. On a
Colorado rangeland, hand pulling twice a year failed to control diffuse knapweed
probably because the root tended to break off
near soil surface. Additionally, plants on nearby experimental
plots were allowed to seed, and
just a few diffuse knapweed plants can repopulate a large area [<a href="#95">95</a>]. Hand pulling twice for
2 consecutive years
in west-central Colorado was expensive and provided only 0 to 35% diffuse and spotted knapweed control,
respectively, after 3 seasons, and increased bare ground [<a href="#21">21</a>].
</p>

<p> Mowing diffuse knapweed can reduce seed production
or alter phenological development, and can reduce weed competition during establishment of
newly seeded grasses. A long-term program in
which only bolted plants are cut for several consecutive years can reduce number and cover of
diffuse knapweed plants, or in some cases it can severely damage or disturb surrounding vegetation and
make
the area more susceptible to knapweed infestations [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#138">138</a>]. Because diffuse knapweed is an
obligate outcrosser, seed production can be
greatly reduced when diffuse knapweed is mowed prior to flowering [<a href="#40">40</a>]. Mowing diffuse knapweed in
British Columbia at the bud stage and again at flowering reduced
the number of plants producing seed by 77 to 99% compared to unmowed plants.
Mowing treatments also reduced germination of seeds by about 79%.
Energy remaining
in the cut plants may be adequate for seeds to develop. Plants mowed early in the
growing season produce few viable seeds; however, mowed plants usually
resprout and flower again [<a href="#128">128</a>]. Seeds are then produced late
in the season and are, therefore, likely to escape attack by
biocontrol insects.
In Washington state, 22% of plants mowed to a 2-inch (5 cm) height
each month of the growing season (April through October) were still growing 4
years later [<a href="#85">85</a>].</p>

<p>Diffuse knapweed is intolerant of cultivation and
irrigation and is generally not
considered a problem on cultivated land [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. Cultivation in combination with reseeding competitive
perennial grasses may minimize reinvasion by the knapweeds [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].&nbsp;

</p>

<p>Biological control efforts for
diffuse and spotted knapweed began in 1970, and since that time 13 biocontrol
agents have been released in North America [<a href="#54">54</a>]. Several introduced biological control agents
occur in high numbers at sites in Washington, Oregon, and Montana, where diffuse knapweed
populations appear to be decreasing [<a href="#105">105</a>]. The combined effects of 2
knapweed seedhead flies (<i>Urophora</i> spp.) on diffuse knapweed has reduced
the dry weight of the attacked plants by 74%, reduced the average seed weight by 18%,
and reduced seed production by 95% [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>]. At 1 site in British Columbia, the
combined attack by the 2 <i>Urophora</i> species and the root beetle <i>Sphenoptera
jugoslavica</i> resulted in a 98%
      reduction in seed numbers [<a href="#37">37</a>]. Although the
insects reduce seed numbers, diffuse knapweed plants still produce enough seed to maintain population
levels [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>]. Throughout the
northwestern United States, <i>S. jugoslavica</i> is well established on diffuse knapweed
and causes noticeable stunting of plants, but no measurable impact on plant density,
while the weevil <i>Larinus minutus</i> is having a serious impact on plant growth and density at
many locations
[<a href="#111">111</a>]. It appears that none of these agents,
alone or in combination, effectively controls diffuse knapweed populations. They may,
however, be useful in integrated control programs by weakening the plants
and/or reducing seed output enough to make the plants more susceptible to
herbicides, prescribed fires, or other control techniques [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>].
</p>

<p>Site characteristics may be an important consideration in
the successful establishment of biocontrol agents [<a href="#113">113</a>].
For example, seedhead flies may be most effective under site conditions that are
marginal to diffuse knapweed survival [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Infection of diffuse
knapweed by mycorrhizal fungi increased the suitability for infestation by <i>S. juogoslavica</i> 
[<a href="#35">35</a>]. Other
considerations for biological control include not only the potential effects on
nontarget plant species, but also the complex indirect effects agents can have
on native communities, as exemplified by the case study of spotted knapweed gall
flies and deer mice [<a href="#76">76</a>]. For more detail, see the Knowledge Base Summary on <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/forb/censtom/index.html">spotted knapweed</a>.

<p>In addition to insect agents, 2 fungal pathogens are
known to damage diffuse
knapweed under certain conditions. <i>Puccinia jaceae</i> attacks the leaves,
and <i>Sclerotinina sclerotiorum</i> attacks the crowns of diffuse knapweed
[<a href="#77">77</a>]. These fungi are still being studied and are not cleared as biocontrol agents
[<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>].
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Grazing:</font>  The use of grazing animals to control
invasive rangeland species is discussed by Olson [<a href="#72">72</a>]. Control of diffuse
knapweed populations with grazing has received little attention. It is often
suggested that
grazing is not effective for diffuse knapweed because diffuse knapweed is unpalatable [<a href="#138">138</a>] and because ground disturbance created by grazing animals creates ideal seedbeds for further invasion [<a href="#16">16</a>]. Piper and others [<a href="#77">77</a>] suggest that livestock grazing of diffuse knapweed in
early spring can reduce seed production. One study in Colorado found that cattle readily grazed diffuse
knapweed and negatively influenced diffuse knapweed
population dynamics [<a href="#9">9</a>]. Diffuse knapweed is
more likely to be grazed by domestic sheep during the rosette through bud stage (when it
is green and succulent), or when it is the
only plant available (when associates are dormant) [<a href="#85">85</a>]. Roche and Roche [<a href="#85">85</a>]
suggest that methods of utilizing diffuse knapweed can be
patterned after programs designed for spotted knapweed and yellow starthistle. Timing relative to the development stages of both the weed and associated
vegetation is critical to achieve the desired selectivity. Early and late-season grazing
appear to be most effective for spotted knapweed control with sheep (early season
to reduce flower production and late season to reduce density of young plants)
[<a href="#31">31</a>].
Olson and others [<a href="#74">74</a>]
found that 3 summers of repeated sheep grazing negatively impacted spotted
knapweed but
minimally affected the native grass community. 
</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT">
Chemical: </font> Herbicides are
effective in gaining initial control of a new invasion or a severe infestation
of diffuse knapweed,
but are rarely a complete
or long-term solution to weed management [<a href="#13">13</a>].
Herbicides are more effective on large infestations of diffuse knapweed when incorporated into long-term management plans that include replacement of weeds
with desirable species, careful land use management, and prevention of new
infestations [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>]. Control with herbicides is temporary, as it does not change
conditions that allow infestations to occur [<a href="#137">137</a>]. See the <a href="https://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/handbook.html">Weed Control Methods Handbook</a> for considerations on the use of herbicides
in natural areas and detailed information on specific chemicals.
</p>

<p>
Diffuse knapweed plants are easily killed by any of several properly used
herbicides. However, because diffuse knapweed produces abundant, long-lived seed, the impact of nonresidual
herbicides is reduced in the long-term [<a href="#86">86</a>]. As of 1999, several herbicides are registered for control of
diffuse knapweed on rangeland, with varying degrees of residual activity for
control of later germinants. In order of decreasing residual effects, the
following herbicides control diffuse knapweed: picloram, clopyralid, clopyralid
+ 2,4-D, and 2,4-D [<a href="#85">85</a>], and glyphosate. The effectiveness of a residual herbicide varies with
application
rate and method, soil texture, soil organic matter, and precipitation pattern [<a href="#86">86</a>]. Best results from herbicides are usually when the
knapweed is in the rosette stage [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>]. Backpack sprayers or wick applicators are recommended
over spray booms or aerial applicators to minimize damage
to nontarget plants [<a href="#16">16</a>].
</p>

<p>Several researchers have compared different rates,
application times and combinations of herbicides for diffuse knapweed control
[<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>]. Others have examined
herbicide use combined with reseeding of desirable plants [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>], effects
on nontarget plants [<a href="#96">96</a>], as well as herbicide compatibility with
biocontrol agents [<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>] and
grazing [<a href="#60">60</a>]. Some researchers recommend mowing or burning prior to herbicide application
to increase rates of efficacy [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>].
</p>

<p> Fertilizer may effectively stress diffuse knapweed
by enhancing competition where conditions are drier than optimal; it may not be
effective under moister conditions [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>]. It has also been suggested that
inducing bolting under field conditions by application of gibberellic acid can
be
timed so that fewer seeds are produced and winter kill is increased. Gibberellic acid
can also be used to synchronize the appropriate stages in the life cycles of diffuse
knapweed and biocontrol
agents. However, induction of bolting of this type under field conditions remains to be
demonstrated [<a href="#123">123</a>].
</p>

<p> A study designed to compare 5 control treatments on diffuse knapweed (burning, cultivation, picloram, seeding of smooth
brome (<i>Bromus inermis</i>) (another weedy, exotic species), and
nitrogen fertilization, alone and in combination) in
northeastern Washington was carried out for 8 years. When precipitation was at or
above normal, the combination of herbicide and fertilizer produced maximum weed
control and forage production, whereas fertilization alone stimulated both grass and knapweed, producing
more knapweed than grass. Picloram alone decreased diffuse knapweed for 2 years,
with knapweed returning the 3rd year, and grass production remaining higher on
all sprayed plots through the 5th
year. As single treatments, burning and cultivation
provided only fleeting control of diffuse knapweed, with weed production equal
to or greater than untreated controls after the 1st year. When all 5 treatments
were
combined, grass production peaked the 3rd year after treatment and then
declined during 3 subsequent drought years. Diffuse
knapweed reestablished completely on all of the plots 8 years after
treatments, in the absence of grazing or clipping. The authors attribute reinvasion to 3 years of
drought and to small plot size, which allowed reseeding from adjacent plots [<a href="#85">85</a>]. In a similar study in west-central Colorado, researchers compared hand pulling,
mowing, herbicides, and the root weevil <i> Cyphocleonus achates</i> alone and in
combination for the control of spotted and diffuse knapweeds. The only increases in grass cover were with treatments including
herbicides. Herbicides provided the most cost effective
and efficacious control of the knapweeds over multiple years with the greatest
increase in grass cover. Insects alone and combined with herbicides may prove cost effective for long
term management of knapweed if insects establish and maintain suppression of
weed populations [<a href="#21">21</a>].
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Cultural:</font> No matter what method is used to kill diffuse knapweed plants, reestablishment
of competitive plant cover is imperative for long-term control [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>]. Fertilization
and reseeding with competitive, adapted species is often necessary in
areas without a residual understory of desirable plants [<a href="#83">83</a>]. Revegetation with aggressive
desirable species has been shown to inhibit reinvasion of knapweeds [<a href="#22">22</a>], especially with the help of effective
biological control agents and carefully prescribed grazing practices [<a href="#85">85</a>]. Vegetative
suppression is applicable both after knapweed control and before knapweed
establishment [<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>].</p>

<p> No single species will suppress diffuse knapweed on all
sites at all times. Species effectiveness depends on site conditions including soil type, moisture, slope, and aspect
[<a href="#22">22</a>]. Species that remove water from the rooting zone of
diffuse knapweed during seedling establishment are most effective [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>]. Larson
and McInnis [<a href="#55">55</a>] found some wheatgrasses (Triticeae) capable of decreasing knapweed
density in northeastern Oregon. On British Columbia rangeland, 11 years after
treatment with picloram,
diffuse knapweed density was high in non-seeded plots, moderate (1/3 density of
control) in plots seeded to Russian wildrye (<i>Psathyrostachys juncea</i>), and very low in
plots seeded to crested wheatgrass (<i>Agropyron cristatum</i>) [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Hubbard [<a href="#41">41</a>] also
found crested wheatgrass effectively suppressed the invasion of diffuse knapweed.
In a 2-year study in Oregon, a diffuse knapweed infestation was disked in the spring and
seeded to 'Covar' sheep fescue (<i>Festuca ovina</i>), 'Ephraim' crested wheatgrass,
'Paiute' orchardgrass (<i>Dactylis glomerata</i>), and
'Critana'
thickspike wheatgrass (<i>Elymus lanceolatus</i>). Orchardgrass and
thickspike wheatgrass controlled knapweed establishment during both years of the
study [<a href="#56">56</a>]. At one site in northeastern Washington,
'Durar' hard fescue (<i>Festuca trachyphylla</i>) limited diffuse
knapweed reinvasion more effectively than did smooth brome
or orchardgrass [<a href="#85">85</a>]. A long-term study to identify the species best suited to seeding semiarid
rangeland sites in northeast Washington indicated that hard fescue was
the most aggressive competitor, and that crested wheatgrass taxa provided the
highest yields [<a href="#32">32</a>].</p>

<p> While these aggressive species can be effective at suppressing diffuse
knapweed, it is important to consider the implications of using 1 exotic to suppress
another. Native species may be best
for maintaining or achieving biodiversity that is site specific. Unfortunately,
there is little success reported for suppressing invasive
species with native species. Idaho fescue seedlings were planted on preserve land in
Oregon; however, survival was low, and the low density plantings failed to further reduce
knapweed numbers [<a href="#137">137</a>].</p>

The
same cultural practices will have different effects on knapweed suppression under different climatic
regimes. Crested wheatgrass
provided very good long-term suppression in a
region of British Columbia that receives 8 inches (200 mm) mean annual
precipitation, but poor suppression on a
site with 13 inches (330 mm) mean annual precipitation [11].
Site preparation prior to seeding will also affect results. Fagerlie [24] suggests that treatment with picloram in association with grass
seeding is more successful for grass establishment than disking for seedbed
preparation. Herbicide selection is also an important consideration, since
seeded species will vary in susceptibility to different chemicals [24]. Maxwell and others
[60] found spraying with picloram to be successful at
controlling knapweed, while interseeding had little impact on knapweed cover and
grazing negated treatment effects. <a href="#11"></a><a href="#24"></a><a href="#24"></a><a href="#60"></a>
