<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Dandelion is a preferred food of domestic sheep grazing on mountain
meadows [<a href="#83">83</a>] and is readily eaten by cattle on rough fescue (Festuca
scabrella) prairies in Alberta [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Dandelion is commonly eaten in the
spring by sharp-tailed grouse [<a href="#89">89</a>].  It is a minor component of bighorn
sheep diets in the Upper Yellowstone Valley [<a href="#63">63</a>] and is an important
food for pocket gophers on mountain grasslands of Colorado [<a href="#132">132</a>].
Dandelion is an important source of nectar and pollen for bees in Alaska
[<a href="#96">96</a>].  Dandelion is consumed by deer and elk in the spring, summer, and
fall in meadows of the Rocky Mountains [<a href="#73">73</a>].

In Yellowstone National Park, dandelion is an important food for grizzly
bears in summer.  Peak use in in June [<a href="#82">82</a>].  Leaves, stems, seeds, and
flowers were found in grizzly and black bear scats in Glacier National
Park [<a href="#65">65</a>].

In Alberta, black bears browse on earlier phenological stages of
dandelion (spring and early summer) because of the higher nutrient
quality.  Dandelion is one of the dominant species found in spring bear
scats [<a href="#52">52</a>].

During prenesting through incubation of greater prairie chicken broods
(April-May) on the Sheyenne National Grasslands in North Dakota,
dandelion flowers were one of the primary diet items.  Individual fecal
samples contained up to 96 percent dandelion flowers during April and
May [<a href="#106">106</a>].

Dandelion is one of the favored foods of sage grouse in the spring,
summer, and fall in Nevada.  Of all meadow forbs consumed, dandelion
contributed 82 percent to spring forb diets [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].  

In British Columbia, deer consumed dandelion at significantly higher
(P<0.05) rates on harvested lodgepole pine sites than on unharvested
sites [<a href="#28">28</a>].
    


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Dandelion is more palatable to wildlife and livestock in prebloom stages
than in postbloom stages [<a href="#81">81</a>].  It is poor to fair in palatability on
ponderosa pine sites throughout the West [<a href="#85">85</a>].

Palatability ratings for dandelion from selected western states are as
follows [<a href="#37">37</a>]:

                              UT     CO     WY     MT     ND

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Protein content of dandelion exceeds the minimum requirement needed for
body maintenance for deer in ponderosa pine communities [<a href="#94">94</a>].  Dandelion
meets the nutritional requirements of beef cattle in Alberta [<a href="#16">16</a>].
Protein and manganese content increase from early June to early July,
when it is harvested on ranges in Alberta.  By late September, protein
content decreases significantly [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Chemical composition (in percent) of dandelion from an irrigated pasture
during 1986 was as follows [<a href="#16">16</a>]:

                       June 3       July 7       September 24       Average

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Dandelion has low short-term and long-term revegetation potential on
disturbed sites.  Erosion-control potential is low [<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The Gwich'in Athabaskan Indians of Fort Yukon, Alaska frequently eat the
leaves of dandelion in salads or boil and eat them [<a href="#54">54</a>].  Roots of
dandelion can be ground and used as a mild laxative or to treat
heartburn.  Tea and wine can be made from flowers [<a href="#140">140</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Dandelion is an invader species that commonly inhabits overgrazed
rangelands [<a href="#85">85</a>].  Dandelion availability for deer decreases on
cattle-grazed sites [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Dandelion meets the nutritional requirements of beef cattle and is
readily grazed by them [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Producers may want to control dandelion in
irrigated pastures to restrict seed movement to adjacent land where
dandelion may be undesirable [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Dandelion is a threat in upper forest and alpine zones of western
Montana because of its ability to invade little disturbed or undisturbed
native vegetation through seed dispersal [<a href="#133">133</a>].  In Montana, dandelion
seedlings compete with conifer seedlings on forest sites.  Grass seeding
on these sites will eventually decrease the dandelion population in 4 to
5 years [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Clearcuts and thinning of forests stimulates dandelion production.  Sage
grouse and deer populations benefit from increased production of
dandelion [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Sage grouse habitat loss due to development and
postdevelopment land use can be minimized by regulation of livestock on
important adjacent nondeveloped lands [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Dandelion can be readily controlled with 2,4-D.  It is most effective to
spray in early spring before first bloom.  Sites should not be mown for
3 to 5 days before spraying or 1 to 2 days after [<a href="#92">92</a>].

Strip spraying in Idaho in relatively high annual precipitation (13
inches [33 cm]) areas benefits sage grouse brood-rearing habitat due to
quick recovery of dandelion and other forbs.  Average cover of dandelion
in sprayed areas was 17.2 percent, whereas average cover in nonsprayed
areas was 11.2 percent [<a href="#23">23</a>].

A decrease in the population of dandelion occurs where pocket gophers
are present.  When gophers were removed, dandelion population increased
by 50 percent in 2 years on mountain grasslands and meadows of Colorado,
Utah, and Oregon [<a href="#42">42</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Taraxacum officinale
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Dandelion is an introduced, cool-season, perennial forb [<a href="#140">140</a>].  It has a
thick taproot up to 6 inches (15.2 cm) long [<a href="#135">135</a>].  Stems are very short
and wholly underground, producing a rosette of leaves at the ground
surface.  Leaves are 2 to 16 inches (5-40 cm) long [<a href="#134">134</a>].  The flower
heads are solitary at the end of naked, hollow stalks.  Stalks can reach
heights up to 2 feet (60 cm) [<a href="#126">126</a>,<a href="#135">135</a>].  One head contains from 100 to
300 flowers [<a href="#126">126</a>].  Seeds of dandelion are topped by a parachute of
bristles that aid in dissemination [<a href="#55">55</a>].

Dandelion forms vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal associations
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].
    


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Dandelion reproduces apomictically through parthenogenesis [<a href="#62">62</a>].  Plants
develop from unfertilized gametes.  Dandelion is an aggressive seed
producer and reproduces mainly from seed [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Seeds travel a
considerable distance because of the parachuting effect produced by the
spreading pappus.  In a tallgrass pairie in Iowa, achenes of dandelion
were blown by the wind several hundred meters from the nearest source
population [<a href="#98">98</a>].

Dandelion creates a long-lived seedbank [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>].  In a seedbank of a
ponderosa pine community in Washington, viable dandelion seedlings
emerged from litter and soil samples in greenhouse germination trials.
Seed density of spring samples was 160 seeds per square yard (133
seeds/m sq) and of autumn samples was 60 seeds per square yard (50
seeds/m sq) [<a href="#99">99</a>].  Seeds of dandelion were viable up to 5 years in soil
samples from Montana [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Seed germination on a control plot in
Wisconsin was inhibited by thick mulch.  Light mulch that remained on a
mowed plot also reduced germination [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Germination was highest on a
burned plot [<a href="#36">36</a>].

Vegetative:  Dandelion sprouts from the caudex after disturbance
[<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Dandelion tolerates a wide range of site and soil conditions, but it
most commonly occurs in disturbed areas such as cut-over or burned
forests, avalanche areas, overgrazed ranges, and marshy floodplains
[<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>].  It also occurs sites on highway and railroad rights-of-way,
waste places, old fields, pastures, and lawns [<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>].

Dandelion occurs on soils that vary from thin layers above permafrost in
the subarctic to deep loams in the western United States [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>].  Soil
texture ranges from clays and clayey loams to sandy loams.  Dandelion
does poorly on dense clay soils, saline soils, and acidic soils [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Dandelion occurs on flat to rolling topography or moderate to steep
slopes [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  It is found from sea level to high alpine elevations
[<a href="#126">126</a>].  Regional elevational distributions are as follows [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>]:

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

Dandelion is an important colonizer following vegetation disturbances in
temperate climates throughout North America [<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>].  Although the role
of dandelion as an early seral species does not change, the length of
time dandelion populations are present varies among ecosystems.
Dandelion enters a disturbed community and rapidly becomes abundant.  It
may achieve a peak in dominance within 2 to 3 years [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Holland
found dandelion to be a transitory colonist of marsh habitats in
Massachusetts; it was found for 10 years after the disturbance and then
disappeared [<a href="#53">53</a>].

Dandelion was one of the earliest colonizers after tree havesting in a
maple-beech-birch ecosystem in Michigan [<a href="#32">32</a>].  On an abandoned farmland
in Arizona, dandelion was one of the predominant species following
winter precipitation [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Dandelion was a pioneer species on a
brine-killed forest site after elimination of brine discharge on the
site in the spring of 1982 [<a href="#7">7</a>].  On a Douglas-fir clearcut in Colorado,
dandelion was a dominant species in the understory the second year after
cutting but was not present in the initial community [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Dandelion is
not a member of the climax plant community on rangelands since it cannot
withstand competition for moisture, nutrients, and light with the climax
vegetation.  It invades these areas after the preferred species have
been removed by overgrazing [<a href="#85">85</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Dandelion is one of the earliest spring bloomers on western rangelands
[<a href="#134">134</a>].  It flowers from March to late fall in most states and will
flower throughout the year in warmer areas [<a href="#126">126</a>].  General first
flowering dates are from April 28 to May 19, and sometimes earlier in
some locations [<a href="#116">116</a>].  By mid-June, dandelion has reached its maximum
bloom stage, and the seeds from earlier flowering dates are mostly
disseminated.  By mid-July, all seeds are disseminated [<a href="#40">40</a>].

Reported dates for anthesis in some states are as follows [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>]:

Utah                             April-July
Colorado                         April-August

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Dandelion is a component of diverse ecosystems in boreal and temperate
regions with variable fire regimes.  Dandelion is primarily adapted to
fire through its prolific production of wind-dispersed seed [<a href="#123">123</a>].  Site
colonization after fires occurs in many forested areas because of
dandelion's persistent, viable seedbank [<a href="#1">1</a>].

<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Dandelion generally establishes during the first or second postfire
year.  It usually increases in frequency after fire [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  One
year after a spring burn (May 24, 1983) in Galena Gulch, Montana,
dandelion showed a 50 percent increase in frequency, but by the second
year showed only a 47.5 percent increase over the preburn level [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Dandelion increased in frequency following a fire in 1974 in a Scotch
pine forest in Scotland, but by postfire year 4, frequency started to
decrease.  Maximum frequency occurred at 3 years after fire [<a href="#119">119</a>].
Dandelion frequency was greater in burned than in unburned oak
communities in Utah [<a href="#74">74</a>].  Following a prescribed fire in a Douglas-fir
stand in south-central Idaho, dandelion frequency increased
significantly by postfire year 2.  Prefire frequency was 8 percent; at
postfire year 1 frequency was 4 percent; and at postfire year 2
frequency was 24 percent [<a href="#78">78</a>].

In the Hedges Mountain area of the Helena National Forest, Montana, a
sagebrush/rough fescue habitat type was burned in spring (May) and fall
(September).  Preburn and postburn community types, as named by the
dominant species, were compared.  Following the spring burn, bluegrass
and dandelion were the dominant species during both postfire years 1 and
2.  Following the fall burn, the dominant species during postfire year 1
were bluegrass, mountain brome (Bromus marginatus), and dandelion.  By
postfire year 2, dandelion was no longer a dominant; the site was
dominated by bluegrass, Wood's rose, and common snowberry [<a href="#109">109</a>].

A fire on June 28, 1977 in Montana in a rough fescue community minimally
disrupted reproduction and carbohydrate production of dandelion.  Its
frequency increased slightly on burned sites by the summer of 1978 [<a href="#6">6</a>].

In the timbered breaks along the Missouri River in central Montana,
dandelion was favored by big game animals every postfire year except
year 28.  At postfire year 17 dandelion was found at high frequencies.
First peak in frequency occurred at postfire year 4 [<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Late spring burning in the tallgrass prairies of Kansas reduced
dandelion cover compared with burning at earlier dates.  In shortgrass
prairies of western Kansas, dandelion was less affected by dormant
season (fall and winter) burns than by spring burns [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Burning to
decrease cover of dandelion on rangelands should be done in the spring
after growth initiation.  Annual burning in March or November in
Nebraska resulted in the highest total cover of dandelion.  Burning in
April decreased cover [<a href="#46">46</a>].

Following logging, bulldozing, and slash burning, dandelion will
establish in the open spots [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Dandelion competes with tree seedlings on burned sites.  Grasses
aerially seeded on burns may compete with and displace dandelion.  After
4 to 5 years of grass seeding on sites in Montana dandelion populations
eventually decreased [<a href="#14">14</a>].
