<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Mescalbean sophora wood has no commercial value [<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Mescalbean sophora is eaten by few animals.  Rock squirrels eat the
flowers [<a href="#10">10</a>].  


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Mescalbean sophora is unpalatable to livestock [<a href="#10">10</a>].  


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Mescalbean sophora leaves, flowers, and seeds contain several alkaloids,
which make them poisonous to humans and animals [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Data from a
nutritional analysis of mescalbean sophora plants from the Edwards
Plateau region of Texas are presented below [<a href="#11">11</a>]:

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Mescalbean sophora is easily propagated from seed but not from cuttings
[<a href="#21">21</a>].  Container-grown plants are easily transplanted [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Mescalbean sophora is a widely used landscape plant in Texas, New
Mexico, and Arizona [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Plants are used as small specimen trees,
and in hedges, screenings, and mass plantings [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Container-grown
nursery plants are readily available for transplanting.  Because the
seeds are toxic to humans, they are sometimes removed from plants in
landscape settings before they mature.

The brightly colored seeds are very hard and were used by Indians as
trade items and in necklaces and other jewelry [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  The narcotic
properties of the seeds were exploited by Indians, who ground the seeds
and mixed the powder with mescal beverages to produce a powerfully
intoxicating drink [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Mescalbean sophora seeds are found in Mexican good-luck charms.  These
charms consist of a small pouch that contains a magnet with iron
filings, cereal grains, and the seeds of native plants [<a href="#23">23</a>].  

Mescalbean sophora flowers are a source of nectar for honey bees [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Toxicity:  The seeds of mescalbean sophora are highly toxic to humans.
Symptoms of poisoning, which appear within 1 hour, include nausea,
violent and bloody vomiting, headaches, vertigo, confusion, fever,
excessive thirst, cold sweat, respiritory problems, followed by
convulsions and death [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Mescalbean sophora's seeds, leaves, and flowers are poisonous to cattle,
sheep, and goats [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Cattle are most susceptible to poisoning by
leaves, while goats and sheep are more tolerant.  Affected animals often
recover if placed on a high-quality diet 22].

Pests:  Plants are primarily pest-free, except for infestations by
caterpillars of a moth in the family Pyralidae.  Caterpillar
infestations of mescalbean sophora have been controlled biologically
with a strain of bacteria (Bacillus thuringensis), which causes the
caterpillars to sicken and die [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Insecticide sprays such as Sevin or
diazinon may also be useful [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Control:  Plants are susceptible to phenoxy herbicides and are usually
killed with one moderate application [<a href="#18">18</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Sophora secundiflora
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Mescalbean sophora varies in size from a small shrub 3.3 feet (1 m) tall
to a slender tree up to about 33 feet (10 m) tall [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  This
evergreen has upright branches, velvety twigs, and 4- to 6-inch-long
(10-15 cm) pinnately compound leaves containing 5 to 13 leaflets [<a href="#28">28</a>].
Violet-colored flowers occur in showy, 2- to 4.75-inch-long (5-12 cm)
terminal racemes [<a href="#28">28</a>].  The fruit is an oblong, brown, pubescent, 1- to
5-inch-long (2.5-12.5 cm), hard and woody, indehiscent pod that is
somewhat constricted between the seeds [<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (microphanerophyte)
   Burned or Clipped State:  Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Regeneration of mescalbean sophora is primarily sexual.  Plants produce
abundant seed; each seed pod contains one to eight seeds.  The
bright-orange to scarlet-red seeds are 0.5 inch (1.25 cm) long, globose
to oblong, and hard and bony [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Fresh seeds reportedly germinate
readily, requiring no scarification [<a href="#21">21</a>].  However, seeds have a hard
seed coat, and older seeds must have this protective covering scarified
before germination can occur.  Under laboratory conditions, soaking
seeds for 15 minutes in concentrated sulfuric acid resulted in 72
percent germination [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Seeds germinate over a wide range of
temperatures.  The highest germination was at constant temperatures of
68, 77, and 86 degrees F (20, 25, 30 C) and at alternating temperatures
of 59 and 77 degrees F (15-25 C) and 68 and 86 degrees F (20-30 C) [<a href="#7">7</a>].
In the field, seedlings and freshly germinated seed were observed in
late October after heavy rainfall [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Most plants sprout after damage to the aboveground portion of the plant,
such as by fire [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Mescalbean sophora occurs in most mountain systems of western Texas and
southern New Mexico [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Here it is usually found in limestone soils
and occurs as scattered plants in canyons, on slopes, and along cliffs
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  In the Del Norte Mountains of western Texas, mescalbean sophora
is found on canyon slopes with paper shell pinyon (Pinyon remota),
smooth sotol (Dasylirion leiophyllum), evergreen sumac (Rhus virens),
mexican buckeye (Ungnadia speciosa), brickellias (Brickellia spp.), and
agarito (Mahonia trifoliolata) [<a href="#3">3</a>].  In the Del Norte Mountains, it is
also found in riparian deciduous woodlands with little walnut (Juglans
microcarpa), desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), western honey mesquite
(Prosopis glandulosa var. torreyana), and splitleaf brickellia
(Brickellia laciniata) [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Mescalbean sophora occurs as scattered individuals in brushy vegetation
across the Edwards Plateau and Rio Grande Plains of Texas [<a href="#19">19</a>].  In
these regions it is also common in riparian deciduous forests dominated
by Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana), American sycamore (Platanus
occidentalis), netleaf hackberry (Celtis reticulata), live oak (Quercus
virginiana), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), pecan (Carya illinoensis),
and Mexican ash (Fraxinus berlandieriana) [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Mescalbean sophora is considered a "secondary invader" of rangelands
following brush control and burning [<a href="#7">7</a>].  



<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Plants generally flower in March and April [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  The pods mature in
September [<a href="#28">28</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Mescalbean sophora sprouts (presumably from the root crown)
following top-kill by fire [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>].  Research is needed to determine
whether fire will crack the hard seed coat of mescalbean sophora seeds
and promote germination.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Sophora secundiflora

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Most fires presumably top-kill mescalbean sophora if sufficient fuels
are available to sustain a hot fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Information concerning the response of mescalbean sophora to fire is
scant.  Ahlstrand [<a href="#1">1</a>] studied 3- to 7-year-old burns in the Guadalupe
Mountains and reported that mescalbean sophora "reproduced and grew from
vegetative sprouts after burning."  It reportedly becomes abundant after
fire and mechanical brush control on rangelands in central Texas [<a href="#22">22</a>].
