<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of white ratany is Krameria grayi
Rose & Painter [<a href="#20">20</a>].  The genus Krameria was named in honor of the
Austrian botanist Henry Kramer [<a href="#29">29</a>].  IT has been included in the
families Leguminosae (Fabaceae), Polygalaceae, and Krameriaceae [<a href="#11">11</a>].
Dhillon [<a href="#6">6</a>] concluded, based on the vascular anatomy of the flower of
range ratany (Krameria parvifolia), that the genus Krameria belongs in
the family Polygalaceae.

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
White ratany is an important forage for all classes of livestock [<a href="#27">27</a>].
It is one of the most important browse species for mule deer (Odocoileus
hemionus) and desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana) in the
Sonoran Desert [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Black-tailed jack rabbits (Lepus
californicus) rely almost exclusively on white ratany during the winter
[<a href="#12">12</a>].

The seeds of white ratany comprises up to 5 percent of the diet of
scailed quail (Callipepla squamata) in southeastern New Mexico [<a href="#5">5</a>].
  


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
White ratany is relished by all classes of livestock [<a href="#27">27</a>], mule deer,
and desert bighorn sheep [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  The relish and degree of use shown by
livestock and wildlife species for white ratany in several western
states has been rated as follows [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>]:

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The Pima Indians used an infusion of the roots to treat skin irritations
and sores.  The roots also provided them with a reddish-yellow dye [<a href="#29">29</a>].
The Seri Indians used an infusion of the flowers to treat an upset
stomach and diarrhea, and an infusion of the stems with the bark removed
was used to make "the blood very red".  The stems, dried and ground,
were applied to sores [<a href="#8">8</a>].

White ratany's roots are commercially important in the production of
aniline stain [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
White ratany decreases in response to grazing [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Blydenstein and
others [<a href="#2">2</a>] found that after 50 years of protection from grazing on a
site in the Sonoran Desert white ratany showed the greatest increase in
density.  Goldberg and Turner [<a href="#10">10</a>] confirmed these findings and added
that recovery from grazing is a slow process.  Even when protected from
grazing white ratany will not increase in density until favorable
moisture regimes occur.

Under heavy grazing pressure white ratany produces phenolic acids
(cinnamic and salcyclic acids) to reduce herbivory by reducing the
palatability [<a href="#31">31</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Krameria grayi
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
White ratany is a native, perennial, densely branched, deciduous shrub
from 12 to 24 inches (30-60 cm) tall.  The leaves are alternate and
simple.  The fruit is one-seeded, globose, indehiscent, thick walled and
spiny [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].

The roots form grafts with members of the same or different species,
forming protocooperation or a parasitic relationship [<a href="#29">29</a>].  This
relationship may help explain white ratany's drought resistance.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (nanophanerophyte).
   Burned or Clipped State:  Cryptophyte (geophyte).


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
White ratany reproduces sexually by seed.  In years with high soil
moisture it will flower twice, in the spring and again in the fall [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
White ratany's habitat is the desert environs, where it occupies sandy
to rocky flats, bajadas, and washes [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Soil:  White ratany occurs in Alfisol, Aridisol, and Entisol soil orders
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].

Climate:  White ratany inhabits the fringe between cool and warm
deserts.  In the northern portion of its range the precipitation is
received primarily during the winter, whereas in the southern portion it
is received in the summer.  The mean rainfall is 10.8 inches (27.4 cm),
with an evapotransporation rate of 85 inches (216 cm) [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>].

Elevation:  White ratany generally grows at elevations ranging from
1,000 to 4,000 feet (303-1,212 m) [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
White ratany is a climax component of the creosotebush-tarbush
(Flourensia cernua) plant association.  This plant association has been
termed a "super climax".  After a disturbance, the site is recolonized
by same species present in the predisturbance vegetative community.
These species then persist until the next disturbance [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
White ratany begins active growth in early April; flowering may start in
late April to early May; and fruiting may begin in late May to early
August, depending on latitude and elevation [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Krameria grayi
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
White ratany is partially or completely top-killed by fire [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
White ratany's well-developed root system allows the plant to exploit
the decreased albedo, and increased water and nutrient availability
after a fire to recover density quite rapidly.  However, cover values
remain lower in the open shrub microhabitat than in the more mesic tree
microhabitat.  Revovery is moisture dependent.  With high soil moisture
or in a more mesic microhabitat, postfire cover can be greater than
prefire cover [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Loftin [<a href="#16">16</a>] found that white ratany resprouted rapidly after a fire in
an Arizona Uplands desert scrub site in the Sonoran Desert and returned
to prefire levels within 35 months.  He reported the following preburn
and postburn density levels and cover values in an open shrub and a tree
microhabitat [<a href="#16">16</a>]:

                    Density (number of plants per hectare)                
Micro-                           Time (months postburn)

                      Cover (square meters per hectare)        
Micro-                           Time (months postburn)
habitat        Preburn   Postburn      5     11    12    29   35 

Open shrub     100       75            44    60    29    63    56
Tree            39       21             6    31    63    60   107


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
When prescribing a fire treatment, soil moisture must be considered as one
of the crucial aspects of white ratany's recovery [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].
