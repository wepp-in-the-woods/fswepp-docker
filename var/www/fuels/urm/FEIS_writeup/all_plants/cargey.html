Elk sedge commonly occurs in dry coniferous forest types. Forest types in which elk sedge occurs include those dominated by
ponderosa
pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>), Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>), whitebark
pine (<i>Pinus albicaulis</i>), grand fir (<i>Abies grandis</i>), quaking aspen
(<i>Populus tremuloides</i>), subalpine fir (<i>Abies lasiocarpa</i>), Engelmann
spruce (<i>Picea engelmannii</i>), and lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i>).
For more information refer to the table under 
&quot;<a href="botanical_and_ecological_characteristics.html#Site Characteristics">Site Characteristics</a>
&quot; in the BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS section of this summary. Elk sedge is often a codominant
in
habitat types naming pinegrass (<i>Calamagrostis rubescens</i>) as the dominant understory species, as in the
aspen/pinegrass&nbsp; type in eastern Idaho, western Wyoming, and northern Utah [<a href="#102">102</a>] and
conifer/pinegrass types in the Blue Mountains of Oregon [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>], Idaho [<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>], and Montana [<a href="#108">108</a>].&nbsp;Elk sedge is also a component of shrublands dominated by
Gambel oak (<i>Quercus gambelii</i>) [<a href="#87">87</a>] and sagebrush (<i>Artemisia
spp.</i>)&nbsp; [<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#140">140</a>], as well as some grassland and alpine communities [<a href="#138">138</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>].</p>

Elk sedge is a native upland sedge that grows 6 to12 inches (15-50 cm) tall [<a href="#69">69</a>].&nbsp; Elk sedge grows from branched underground rhizomes and produces an
extensive network of fine roots [<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>].&nbsp; A single elk sedge plant
may have a root system 4.5 feet (1.4 m) wide and 6 feet (1.8 m) deep [<a href="#129">129</a>].&nbsp;Elk sedge rhizomes grow at a depth of&nbsp;
0.6 to 2 inches
(1.5 to 5 cm) [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>]. Leaves and
stems grow in bunch form or are more loosely clustered [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>].&nbsp;Leaves grow 2 or 3 to a culm
[<a href="#141">141</a>] and are 0.04 - 0.14 inch
(1-3.5 mm) wide, flat or nearly so,
leathery, and evergreen [<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#146">146</a>].&nbsp;<p>
Elk sedge is easily recognized by its few-flowered, solitary spikes. The spike has a
slender staminate part bearing male flowers above the 1-3 pistillate (female) flowers, which are distinctly separate
and bear scales with a short awn at the tip [<a href="#89">89</a>]. Each
spike bears 1-3 perigynia in which large seeds are tightly encased [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#146">146</a>].</p>

Elk sedge regenerates primarily asexually by spreading from underground
rhizomes, but also reproduces by seed [<a href="#131">131</a>].</p>

Seed production:</font>   </b>Elk sedge produces few seeds [<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>], generally 1 per flowering
spike, and those produced have low viability [<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>]. Seed production
often increases following disturbance [<a href="#95">95</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Seed dispersal:</b></font>  Elk sedge has no apparent means for seed dispersal [<a href="#129">129</a>], but relies on seed stored in soil and asexual
reproduction.</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Seed banking:</b></font>  Elk sedge seeds are stored in soil [<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>]. Steele
and Geyer-Hayes rated viability at 56%
[<a href="#128">128</a>], although viability probably varies with conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Germination:</font>  </b> Seed stored in soil
germinates well following clearcutting and scarification, and can also germinate
on mineral soil after burning [<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. Seeds may not be able to germinate after being exposed to very high
temperatures. In a study in Yellowstone National Park, seeds of elk sedge were collected from soil and subjected to
1-hour heat treatments of 122, 212, or 302 degrees Fahrenheit (50, 100, or 150 <font face="Times New Roman"><sup>o</sup>C)</font>.
Seeds germinated after treatments of 122 and 212 degrees Fahrenheit (50 and 100 <sup>o</sup>C)
but did not germinate at 302 degrees Fahrenheit (150 <sup>o</sup>C) [<a href="#30">30</a>].&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

SITE CHARACTERISTICS:</a>

<br />

 Elk sedge is common at moderate to high
elevations from foothills to timberline. It occurs in dry montane forests
and woodland sites, on open slopes, in drier mountain meadows and grasslands&nbsp; [<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>], and less frequently in sagebrush [<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#149">149</a>] and Gambel oak shrublands
[<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>].&nbsp;It grows more commonly on exposed hillsides or in open
grasslands and woodlands than on more densely forested sites [<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>].&nbsp;Elk sedge occurs&nbsp;
primarily on well-drained sandy, gravelly, or rocky soils&nbsp; [<a href="#141">141</a>]
derived from a variety of parent materials.

<p>Elk sedge requires from 12 to 20 inches
(305-508 mm) of yearly precipitation and tolerates
temperatures down to -28 degrees Fahrenheit (-33 <font FACE="Times New Roman">�C)</font>
 [<a href="#142">142</a>]. However, it has been on sites with average
precipitation up to 30 inches (750 mm) in Washington [<a href="#20">20</a>]
and up to 45 inches (1,145 mm) in Oregon [<a href="#32">32</a>]. Heyerdahl and others [<a href="#67">67</a>] list elk sedge
as a component of the understory in forest stands generally growing on low
slope,
south-west aspect sites with well-drained soils. This probably describes the majority of sites on which elk sedge
grows, but site conditions vary even within the same ecosystems
among different geographical areas. It may, therefore, be most helpful to describe site characteristics
within the various ecosystems and areas in
which elk sedge occurs.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Northern Rocky Mountain forested sites:&nbsp;Elk sedge is a component of the understory in several forest types of the
northern Rocky Mountains. The following table provides examples of the wide

<p> Intermountain forested sites:&nbsp;Elk sedge is an important herbaceous understory species in relatively open
forested sites of the Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon and southeastern
Washington [<a href="#58">58</a>]. In this area,&nbsp; elk sedge is found on sites receiving
from 8 to 45 inches (200-1,145 mm) precipitation [<a href="#32">32</a>].&nbsp;Throughout its
range, elk sedge
generally grows on relatively dry sites on sandy to loamy textured well-drained soils, often derived
from basalt or granite, sometimes with an ash component. At higher elevations it grows on
sandy to loamy textured soils derived from basalt, granite, and tuff (compacted
volcanic ash) [<a href="#58">58</a>]. Soils at its lower elevation range in this area are loams and silty
loams derived from ash, loess, and basalt. Topik [<a href="#136">136</a>] lists
elk sedge as an indicator of &quot;harsh&quot; conditions or site types on the eastern slope of the Cascade Mountains in
Washington.&nbsp; Elk sedge was generally found in this area on fairly flat ground (2-34% slope) at
2,750 to 4,000 feet (838-1,219 m)
elevation, and was associated with grand fir and pinegrass. Sites
supporting the grand fir/elk sedge association were hot and dry, with cold
winters and relatively short growing seasons. Elk sedge was also
found in the Palouse region of southeastern
Washington, predominantly on north-east-facing slopes [<a href="#6">6</a>]. Elk sedge
may form a dense sod layer on previously-logged sites on
the eastern slopes of the Cascade Mountains in west-central Washington, where precipitation
averages approximately&nbsp;30 inches
(750 mm) per year [<a href="#20">20</a>].</p>



<p>Shrub-dominated sites: Elk sedge is less common in shrub-dominated habitat types than in forested
types, but&nbsp; occurs over a range of conditions within shrub types. Elk sedge
is a minor component of shrub-steppe habitat types in north-central Colorado. Average precipitation on
these shrub-steppe sites is 14 to 15.6 inches (350-390 mm) per year, distributed fairly
evenly throughout year, half occurring as snow [<a href="#135">135</a>]. Elk sedge occurs but is rare
on dry slopes in sagebrush scrub and open woodlands in California
[<a href="#104">104</a>]. It also occurs in sagebrush
communities on south
slopes in
the Sawtooth Mountains of central Idaho [<a href="#140">140</a>] and in mountain big sagebrush (<i>A.
t. </i>ssp.<i> vaseyana</i>) communities above 7,000 feet (2,130
m) on steep southeasterly slopes in the
Hells Canyon National Recreation Area on the Oregon-Idaho border [<a href="#76">76</a>]. Elk sedge is a component of the shrub-dominated ninebark/snowberry/elk
sedge community type in Umatilla River Drainage in the Blue Mountains of northeast
Oregon [<a href="#18">18</a>]. Elk
sedge has also been documented in Gambel oak shrubland in Colorado on sites with gentle (0-30%) slopes on
both north and south exposures, with approximately&nbsp;22 inches (560 cm) precipitation
[<a href="#87">87</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grassland and alpine sites: Elk sedge occurs in mountain grasslands interspersed among timber stands in
the Rocky Mountains. These areas are characterized by
long, cold winters and relatively cool summers. Precipitation ranges from 20 to
40 inches (510-1020 mm) and occurs mostly as snow, which may cover the ground from October to
May [<a href="#138">138</a>]. These areas have soils resembling prairie soils,
with a thick A horizon rich in organic matter. Elk sedge is
codominant with&nbsp; Idaho fescue (<i>Festuca idahoensis</i>) in very
productive grass-sedge communities at about 7,000 feet (2,130 m)
in the Seven Devils
Mountains in northeast Oregon and western Idaho [<a href="#76">76</a>]. These
grass-sedge communities occur primarily among scree slopes on the steep mountainsides.&nbsp;Elk sedge
has also been documented on dry alpine sites in the Beartooth Mountains of south-central Montana
[<a href="#143">143</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<p>Riparian areas: Elk sedge is an upland plant but was reported as a component of riparian vegetation at drier sites studied in the Centennial Mountains of Idaho
[<a href="#40">40</a>]. </p>

Elk sedge is relatively
shade-tolerant [<a href="#108">108</a>] compared to other upland sedges, and in some cases seems to grow more
vigorously with a light canopy cover. In a study
conducted in the Blue Mountains of Oregon, elk sedge growing in open areas was
more stressed, with shorter, lighter green leaves drying at the tips, than plants
growing under a
mixed conifer overstory [<a href="#31">31</a>].&nbsp;Other studies in the Blue Mountains
reported that cover of elk sedge declines with increased tree canopy cover and
poorer range condition [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].&nbsp;Disturbance is part of the
equation as well. Cholewa [<a href="#27">27</a>] reported that cover and
frequency of elk sedge was lower in logged and grazed plots than in undisturbed
climax plots.&nbsp;Response of elk sedge to grazing pressure is also discussed
under &quot;<a href="management_considerations.html#Other Management Considerations">Other
Management Considerations</a>&quot; in the MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS section
of this summary.<p>The presence of elk sedge as a dominant species often indicates a late
successional stage. Aspen/elk sedge and conifer/elk sedge types are generally considered stable
climax types in the northern Rocky Mountains and Intermountain region of the
United States [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. For example, elk sedge is considered a late-seral to climax species in Douglas-fir
habitat types of central Idaho [<a href="#129">129</a>].&nbsp;Elk sedge
also occurs as an understory codominant with pinegrass in mature stands of the Douglas-fir/ninebark/pinegrass community type,
which is a theoretical climax
forest in conditions of fire suppression [<a href="#13">13</a>].&nbsp;In the Palouse region of
southeastern Washington and adjacent areas of Idaho, stands dominated by elk
sedge represent a topo-edaphic climax association [<a href="#6">6</a>].
Elk sedge is listed as an important species in climax subalpine fir and spruce eastside forests in Oregon and Washington
[<a href="#75">75</a>].&nbsp;<p> In some site types elk sedge is considered mid-seral. For
example, the presence of an elk sedge layer indicates mid-seral conditions in the
subalpine fir/beargrass (<i>Xerophyllum tenax</i>) habitat type in northern
Idaho and northwestern Montana [<a href="#121">121</a>].&nbsp;The aspen/chokecherry/elk sedge
type in Utah can be climax, or may be seral to the subalpine fir/Oregon grape (<i>Mahonia
repens</i>) type in northern Utah or the subalpine fir/elk sedge type in
southern and central Utah [<a href="#105">105</a>]. The aspen-lodgepole pine/elk sedge
type in Idaho is seral to the lodgepole pine/pinegrass type [<a href="#102">102</a>].<p> In habitat types where elk sedge is the dominant herbaceous species, it is
often 1st to sprout following fire [<a href="#119">119</a>]. It is also dominant
in early successional stages following fire in spruce-fir forests of Colorado [<a href="#29">29</a>]. Elk sedge may depend on fire to lower competition from other plants. Hall
[<a href="#59">59</a>]
cited prevention of understory burning as the cause of decreased elk forage
provided by pinegrass and elk sedge in mixed conifer/pinegrass communities in
northeastern Oregon. Further information about the response of elk sedge to fire
can be found under &quot;<a href="fire_effects.html#Plant Response To Fire">Plant
Response To Fire</a>&quot; in FIRE EFFECTS.<p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT">
SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Elk sedge sprouts early in the spring, making use of soil moisture while there is little
competition from other plants, and may go dormant if soil moisture is
depleted [<a href="#128">128</a>]. Vegetative shoots are produced from &quot;semi-woody&quot; rootstalks during the
1st growing season. They emerge in early spring the following year, then remain green for at least 2 years [<a href="#122">122</a>].
Leaves generally remain green all winter, especially under snow [<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>], although cover of elk sedge may be
reduced in areas where snow persists until late June [<a href="#133">133</a>]. Elk sedge flowers in late
spring to early summer, from April to July [<a href="#39">39</a>], but most
commonly in May and June [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>].

<font face="Bell MT">Fire adaptations:</font> Elk sedge is often one of the 1st species to recolonize or grow back after a
fire [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>] because
it is able to resprout from underground rhizomes [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>] or recolonize from seeds stored in soil
[<a href="#124">124</a>].&nbsp;Elk
sedge is generally slower to recover after severe burns than after lower
intensity fires [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>]. The <a href="fire_effects.html"> FIRE
EFFECTS</a> section contains more detailed information about the
response of elk sedge to fire.

<p><font face="Bell MT">Fire regimes:</font> &nbsp;Elk sedge occurs in
vegetation types with a variety of fire regimes. Heyerdahl and others [<a href="#67">67</a>] assigned habitat types to
Heinselman fire regimes in a multiscale study in the interior western United
States. The habitat types or community types in which elk sedge is a codominant occur
mainly within Heinselman fire regimes 2 (frequent light surface fires with 1-25
year return interval) and 3 (infrequent, severe surface fires with a greater than
25 year return interval). Elk sedge is also an
important component of several types that occur within fire regime 1
(infrequent light surface fires with a greater than 25 year return interval) and
4 (short interval return crown fires with 25-100 year return intervals).</p>

<p>Habitat types, community types, and phases are grouped into &quot;fire
groups&quot; for given geographic areas, based on their presettlement fire
regimes, response of dominant tree species to fire, and successional patterns. The fire group assigned to a given type may vary among
geographic areas because of floristic, climatic, and ecological differences
among areas. The fire groups are ordered in a gradient of
conditions from warmest, driest habitat types at low elevations, through cold
habitat types at high elevations, to warm, moist habitat types of montane and
lower elevations [<a href="#124">124</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elk sedge occurs as an understory dominant in warm, dry to moderate Douglas-fir
forests. Generally the fire regime for these forests was characterized by
frequent, nonlethal surface fire in presettlement times with relatively
few stand-replacing fires [<a href="#123">123</a>]. Elk sedge is also listed as a component
of the vegetation in types within higher elevation fire groups, including
persistent lodgepole pine with a history of frequent, widespread stand-replacing
fires; dry lower subalpine forests, which are characterized by a history of
stand-replacing fires occurring at intervals of 52 to 200 years or more; moist
lower subalpine forests that developed under less frequent and less uniform
fires; and upper subalpine types with a history of mixed-severity fires with
return intervals of 60 to 300 years [<a href="#124">124</a>]. In eastern Idaho and western Wyoming, elk sedge is a dominant
species in the understory of forests developed under a wider variety of fire
regimes. These forest types include&nbsp;certain moist Douglas-fir types
with fire return intervals of 15 to 100 years and low-severity fires to severe
stand replacing fires; persistent lodgepole pine community types with
low-intensity ground fires or stand-replacing fires; mid- and lower
elevation subalpine forests with fire return intervals of 50 to 350 years but
generally greater than 100 years; and cold, upper subalpine and timberline
habitat types where fires are infrequent (50-300 year return intervals) and
stand-replacing fires are rare [<a href="#22">22</a>]. In Utah elk sedge occurs in warm, dry ponderosa pine habitat
types with a history of frequent fires (less than 50 year return interval),
drier Douglas-fir habitat types with a variety of fire regimes, quaking aspen habitat and community
types established after fire, and habitat types with persistent lodgepole pine
stands that are perpetuated or maintained by fire occurring at intervals of 22
to over 300 years [<a href="#23">23</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p>Several references [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>] have described elk sedge as a prominent understory component in
areas with low-intensity, frequent burns. In some areas fire suppression has
allowed tree canopy to increase, which has resulted in a decrease in elk sedge
cover. One of the best-known examples of this phenomenon is in forests of the
Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon. These dry Douglas-fir and grand fir forests with undergrowth dominated by
pinegrass and elk sedge apparently developed
with a history of frequent (10-15 year return interval), low-intensity fires
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>].&nbsp;The open canopy and grassy
understory of elk sedge and pinegrass in mixed-conifer forests of the Blue
Mountains in northeastern Oregon were maintained by frequent, low-intensity
fires&nbsp;prior to European settlement [<a href="#2">2</a>].&nbsp;Fire suppression has led to
greater canopy cover,
resulting in lower understory cover, of which elk sedge is a major component [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>]. Elk sedge is also a component of the herbaceous understory in
Douglas-fir/western
larch forests in the northern Rocky
Mountains, which historically experienced frequent fires, and in subalpine fir
forest, with long
(100-300 yr) fire intervals [<a href="#57">57</a>].&nbsp;Elk sedge also occurs in the Engelmann
spruce/subalpine fir/elk sedge habitat type, in which high intensity, stand-replacing
fires are common [<a href="#147">147</a>].</p>
<p>Fire regimes for elk sedge sites are generally related to the dominant tree or
shrub species occurring with elk sedge. The following table summarizes
additional information about fire regime intervals for the dominant species and communities
with which elk sedge is found.</p>

<br />

Elk sedge has a high degree of resistance to
fire [<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>] because of its ability to resprout from
underground rhizomes. After a fire in lodgepole pine forest in Yellowstone
National Park, elk sedge plants that had been top-killed and reduced to brown stubble
patches produced new shoots the next year from rhizomes and roots that survived the fire
[<a href="#134">134</a>].&nbsp;<p>



<span class="subframeName">
<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT">
DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Sources do not specify that severe fire kills elk sedge, but some sources report that elk sedge
cover decreases after severe or relatively intense fire, or imply that some plants are
killed by fire. For example, Turner and others [<a href="#139">139</a>] specify elk sedge
demonstrated a negative relationship between sprout density and fire severity,
implying fewer plants survived more severe fires to resprout after the
fire. Zimmerman [<a href="#152">152</a>] found cover of elk sedge was generally much lower on
burned plots than unburned plots. Taylor [<a href="#134">134</a>] reported that &quot;a few <i>Carex
</i>plants survived the fire&quot; in a study area in which elk sedge made up a
&quot;significant&quot; part of the flora.</p>
<p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE">
PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:</a>
</span><br>
Elk sedge often increases or invades after a fire [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>], sometimes flowering and producing seed the year after a fire
[<a href="#134">134</a>]. However, the ability of elk sedge to recolonize or regrow
after a fire seems to depend largely on severity of the fire. Elk sedge sprouted more heavily in light surface burn areas than in severe
surface burns or areas burned by crown fires in Yellowstone National Park in
Wyoming [<a href="#139">139</a>]. According to another study in Wyoming, elk sedge cover was higher in plots
after moderate burns than on
unburned and severely burned plots. However, elk sedge was one of the most important
postfire species in the
severe burn, as well as one of the most abundant species in the moderate burn
sites [<a href="#41">41</a>]. In central Idaho, Geier-Hayes [<a href="#53">53</a>] found that elk sedge cover was lower on plots clearcut and broadcast
burned than on unburned clearcut plots. This effect was greatest at the highest
elevation site, which also was subjected to the highest intensity burn. The
ability of elk sedge to recolonize from seeds in the soil at
burned sites may also be affected by fire severity. Seeds collected from burned
sites in Yellowstone National Park and subjected to heat treatments survived temperatures of
212 degrees
Fahrenheit (100<font FACE="Times New Roman">� </font> C)
for many sites, but never survived a treatment of&nbsp; 302 degrees
Fahrenheit (150<font FACE="Times New Roman">� </font> C). The number of
seeds per area for elk sedge was generally higher in unburned vs. burn sites; survival in burned areas varied among habitat types [<a href="#30">30</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<p>Response of elk sedge after fire in different habitat types is dependent
largely on fire severity. On a site in the dry phase of the Douglas-fir/ninebark type in western Montana,
elk sedge decreased in cover 5 years after
stand-replacing wildfires and clearcuts with broadcast burning. In other
habitats and phases it generally increased in cover after low severity broadcast
burning, clearcutting, or scarification [<a href="#13">13</a>].&nbsp;In Douglas-fir
forest in south-central Idaho, elk sedge decreased after a severe prescribed
burn [<a href="#96">96</a>]. Elk sedge was absent from the plots 1 year after the fire, and
after 7 years had grown in to roughly half its preburn cover.&nbsp;Elk sedge
recovered quickly on recently burned areas in the Douglas-fir/elk sedge/mountain
snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos oreophilus</i>) type in Idaho but decreased in higher elevation sites after a severe burn [<a href="#119">119</a>]. Elk sedge cover and frequency decreased in burned stands in the
Douglas-fir/ninebark habitat type in northern Idaho [<a href="#27">27</a>].&nbsp; In warm, dry
grand fir sites in northeastern Oregon, per cent cover of elk sedge
increased within 5 years after moderate and severe burns [<a href="#77">77</a>].&nbsp;Elk sedge cover decreased after severe burns on Douglas-fir sites in the
same area, but increased after low severity burns. Arno [<a href="#10">10</a>] found that
elk sedge cover often decreased with increasing intensity of burn in plots within
shelterwood cuts in ponderosa pine forests with no-burn, low-consumption, and high consumption
treatments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frequency of occurrence and canopy cover of elk sedge were similar on all
plots in a study that compared vegetation among plots not recently
burned, burned in 1932, and moderately and severely burned in 1974 in Grand
Teton National Park in Wyoming [<a href="#17">17</a>].&nbsp;In Yellowstone
National Park, density of elk sedge shoots following fire was affected by patch size of burns, but
this effect could be related to fire severity, as larger
burned areas are more likely to have burned with more intensity [<a href="#139">139</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<p> Response of elk sedge to fire may be affected by competing understory
species.&nbsp;Bunchgrasses resprouted more successfully than elk sedge when sampled 1 year
after a burn in Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado [<a href="#46">46</a>]. Canon [<a href="#26">26</a>] reported that
relative cover of elk sedge compared to forbs was lower on burned vs. unburned plots in aspen stands.&nbsp;In
contrast, Johnston and Hendzel [<a href="#78">78</a>] found that elk sedge was able to recover quickly
after fire in conifer/aspen stands in Colorado, and dominated the understory in several plots.</p>

FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>

<br />

Fire appears to be an important environmental influence on elk sedge and may be
a tool useful for improving its forage production. Fire suppression, combined
with grazing, has caused an increase in conifer density and a reduction in elk
sedge and pinegrass cover in&nbsp;forested sites in the Blue Mountains in
Oregon [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].&nbsp;However, under frequent burning, elk sedge can persist
and increase under natural range conditions with 25% to 40% utilization every
year [<a href="#60">60</a>]. Decreasing the amount of duff on the
forest floor is one function of fire beneficial to elk sedge. In both warm and
cool aspect stands, elk sedge percent cover was several times higher where
duff depth was under 0.4 inch (1cm) than in areas with a duff layer over 0.4 inch
(1cm) deep [<a href="#56">56</a>].

IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE:</a>

<br>Sources do not all agree on the value of elk sedge for livestock and
wildlife forage. The forage value of elk sedge varies with conditions, but often
has more to do with its availability than its palatability. Elk sedge
provides valuable spring forage because it is one of the earliest forage
species available on the lower ranges [<a href="#141">141</a>] and in dry forested sites in early spring when
other palatable graminoid species and forbs are dormant [<a href="#136">136</a>].&nbsp;

<p>Use of habitat types with elk sedge: Some habitat types in which elk
sedge is codominant provide good forage for livestock and wildlife. The aspen/elk sedge
habitat type in Colorado, the undergrowth of which is strongly dominated by elk
sedge, provides fair summer-fall range for large ungulate wildlife species and
cattle.&nbsp; Forage production in this type varies
from 400 to 800 pounds per acre (450-900 kg/ha) [<a href="#71">71</a>]. Stands
in the subalpine fir/elk sedge habitat type in Montana are used moderately by
deer and elk in summer [<a href="#108">108</a>]. Livestock forage value in
these stands is low.&nbsp;The Douglas-fir/elk sedge
habitat type has moderate potential
for forage production for livestock, and moderate to high potential for forage
for wildlife where it occurs near or on winter range [<a href="#83">83</a>].&nbsp;</p>



<p> Use in relation to fire:  There is little information available about
forage use specifically of elk sedge on burned sites. According to one study conducted in the
Caribou National Forest in Wyoming, elk
sedge was used by elk primarily on burned sites [<a href="#26">26</a>].&nbsp;Fire suppression has
reduced the habitat suitability and use by livestock and wildlife of forest
types in the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon with elk sedge as a major
understory component. For example, fire-maintained ponderosa pine/pinegrass
stands produce 500 to 600 pounds per acre (540-650 kg/ha) of forage in elk sedge and pinegrass under 50% tree canopy cover.
Where fire suppression has allowed fir to replace pine and the canopy cover to
increase to 80%, forage production has decreased to 50 to 100
pounds per acre (55-110&nbsp; kg/ha)
[<a href="#59">59</a>].&nbsp;</p>



<div class="subframeContent" 
<span class="subframeName">
<a name="PALATABILITY">
PALATABILITY:</a>
<br />


Sources vary regarding the palatability of elk sedge to livestock and
wildlife. The USDA Plants Database indicates elk sedge has low palatability for browse
and forage [<a href="#142">142</a>]. Other sources list elk sedge as highly palatable to livestock and
moderately-highly palatable to sheep in summer [<a href="#129">129</a>]. The palatability rating for
elk sedge in the interior northwest is from poor to fair for sheep and from fair
to fairly good for horses and cattle, primarily due to its early sprouting in
the spring, its abundance, and its ability to remain green throughout the season. In Pacific
Northwest sites where it occurs in greater abundance,
elk sedge has a palatability rating of fair to good for sheep and from fairly
good to very good for cattle and horses [<a href="#141">141</a>].
<p>Elk sedge is highly palatable to elk
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>] but less palatable to deer [<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>]. Austin and others [<a href="#14">14</a>] reported that elk sedge was highly rejected by deer. In
the Flathead National Forest of Montana, elk sedge was&nbsp;
highly palatable to elk relative to other species in the plant associations in
which it occurred [<a href="#48">48</a>]. In this case, palatability was defined by the
proportion of available forage used.&nbsp;Black bear
find elk sedge highly palatable in spring; palatability then declines
throughout the year [<a href="#129">129</a>].</p>
<p>

<span class="subframeName">
<a name="NUTRITIONAL VALUE">
NUTRITIONAL VALUE:</a>

</span>

<br />


In general, elk sedge has fair nutritional
value expressed as energy and protein.&nbsp;

Elk sedge
provides good food value for elk, fair food value for mule deer, fair food value
for whitetail deer, poor food value for birds, and fair to good food value for
small mammals [<a href="#39">39</a>]. Skovlin
 [<a href="#122">122</a>] rated elk sedge highest for sustained nutrient supply of the forage plants
analyzed in that study.</p>
<p>Seasonal variation:  The nutritional value of elk sedge fluctuates
seasonally, but fluctuations are less severe in elk sedge than in many other
species due to its evergreen nature. The protein content in elk sedge is
highest in spring [<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>] and declines by September. Phosphorus levels by late September were only minimally adequate
for livestock nutrition requirements, but calcium was still adequate [<a href="#105">105</a>]. Skovlin [<a href="#122">122</a>] reported that crude protein levels declined
less in elk sedge than in other species, and phosphorus and calcium levels remained fair to
good.&nbsp;Kreuger and Bedunah [<a href="#84">84</a>]&nbsp;found lower carbohydrate levels
in elk sedge roots in early spring than in the fall, indicating that elk sedge uses these carbohydrate reserves for respiration in
winter.</p>
<p>Management effects on nutritional value: Nutritional value of elk
sedge may be affected by grazing, silvicultural practices, and fire. In a study of
domestic sheep grazing effects on understory
species in northeastern Oregon, in vitro&nbsp;dry matter digestibility was higher in ungrazed
plots than on plots grazed by sheep. Light spring grazing resulted in higher crude protein content in elk sedge the
following winter [<a href="#31">31</a>]. According to this same study, elk sedge under a conifer
overstory had higher crude protein levels than plants of the same species
occurring in openings. Krueger and Bedunah [<a href="#84">84</a>] reported that total nonstructural
carbohydrate levels in elk sedge roots were higher in forested sites than in
adjacent clearcuts. Crude protein levels in elk sedge were similar between burned vs.
unburned plots in aspen stands in Wyoming [<a href="#26">26</a>].

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="COVER VALUE">
COVER VALUE:</a>
</span>
<br />

 Elk sedge has poor cover value for wild
ungulates, poor to fair cover value for upland game birds, poor to good cover
value for non-game upland birds, and fair to good cover value for small mammals
[<a href="#39">39</a>]. Vegetation types with elk sedge dominating the understory often have low
structural diversity and species diversity. For example, fire-maintained open ponderosa
pine
forests with pinegrass and elk sedge understory provide less value for pileated
woodpeckers than forests developing under fire suppression because of the lack
of snags housing carpenter ants for food and understory trees providing cover in the
fire-maintained forests [<a href="#60">60</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a study of avian communities in riparian zones in Idaho, cover of elk sedge was significantly higher (p =
0.01 or p= 0.05) in plots
where certain bird species were observed, including mountain chickadee,
ruby-crowned kinglet, yellow-rumped warbler, western tanager, pine siskin, and
dark-eyed junco [<a href="#40">40</a>]. In this case the bird observations may
be indicating an environmental gradient, rather than preference for elk sedge,
as elk sedge was less common in plots where more water-dependent bird species
were observed.

<a name="VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES">
VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES:</a>
&nbsp;
</span>
<br />

 Elk
sedge has an extensive system of fine roots, making it effective at stabilizing soil
[<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>].&nbsp;However, elk sedge rhizomes may be damaged easily in scarification [<a href="#73">73</a>]. Elk sedge is
valuable for rehabilitating disturbed
sites because it can tolerate high soil moisture stress and high soil
temperature [<a href="#81">81</a>].&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> Elk sedge often increases in
cover after disturbance [<a href="#136">136</a>,<a href="#152">152</a>] by resprouting from
rhizomes and seeding [<a href="#95">95</a>]. Elk sedge is
highly resistant to trampling [<a href="#109">109</a>] and is able to increase in cover within a few
years after disturbance from trampling [<a href="#33">33</a>].&nbsp; See the &quot;<a href="fire_effects.html">FIRE
EFFECTS</a>&quot; section for
information about the response of elk sedge after fire.


<br> <br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Elk sedge is very drought-resistant [<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>] and can out-compete tree
seedlings partially through low moisture requirements [<a href="#142">142</a>] and early use of plant available water in soil.&nbsp;Elk sedge competes strongly with tree seedlings and other plants due
to its extensive rhizome and root system [<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. On dry forest sites elk sedge and other graminoids may
inhibit tree and shrub regeneration by depleting soil moisture before seedlings
are established [<a href="#129">129</a>]. On sites where elk sedge
forms a dense sod layer, elk sedge can prohibit natural
regeneration or seedling growth of conifers unless sites are scarified [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elk sedge in ponderosa pine forest range lands is highly susceptible to
logging disturbance, such as that resulting from skidder use, because its
rhizomes are easily displaced [<a href="#52">52</a>]. Grass cover, of which elk sedge was a major
component, was drastically lower 1 year after logging than before logging in ponderosa
pine forests of eastern Oregon and Washington, but was restored nearly
to original levels by 7 years after logging [<a href="#49">49</a>]. In contrast to these reports, cover of elk sedge was lower on untreated
plots than on plots that had undergone various silvicultural treatments in the Swan Valley of
Montana [<a href="#47">47</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<p>The response of elk sedge to chemical site preparation treatments varies with
the compound used. Cover of elk sedge was higher in stands treated with slashing, spraying with
glyphosate, and spraying with&nbsp; triclopyr ester as site preparation and
conifer treatments, compared to untreated plots. The stand treated
with both glyphosate and 2,4-D had a lower canopy cover of elk sedge than the
untreated plot, but had no plant kill of elk sedge [<a href="#63">63</a>]. Cover of elk sedge did
not show any significant change after application of Tordon and Transline [<a href="#112">112</a>].</p>
<p>Riegel and others found that growth of elk sedge in ponderosa pine forests is
limited by nitrogen and water [<a href="#113">113</a>] and is controlled largely
by competition for nutrients and water by tree roots [<a href="#114">114</a>].
In a separate study, elk sedge growth increased after nitrogen and potassium fertilization, up to
a treatment level of&nbsp; 200 pounds per acre (220 kg/ha) [<a href="#81">81</a>].&nbsp;</p>



<p>Utilization considerations:<b> </b>Studies do not all agree on the effect of grazing on elk sedge forage
production. In Douglas-fir/ninebark, elk sedge cover was essentially the
same in grazed and ungrazed plots, but production in grazed plots was twice
that in ungrazed plots [<a href="#151">151</a>]. In contrast, elk sedge under heavy
stocking produced 74% less plant material than it did when it was protected from
grazing [<a href="#50">50</a>].</p>
<p>Overgrazing over several decades has caused understory community composition to
shift in many western forests, including a decrease in elk sedge cover as it is
replaced with more grazing-tolerant grasses. Elk sedge withstands grazing well
because it reproduces from underground rhizomes and
forms dense tufts or sod; however, continued heavy use can eventually
lower elk sedge cover [<a href="#141">141</a>]. Driscoll [<a href="#42">42</a>] found elk sedge vigor, as indicated by flowering stalk
production, was significantly lower on plants with 40% and 60% of their
herbage removed, compared to plants with 20% removed.
Because significant changes in vigor were noticeable in just 3 years, he indicated that heavy grazing over several years is
likely to reduce cover of elk sedge. Elk sedge
may be replaced by forbs and pasture grasses in some areas in the intermountain
West that have
been heavily grazed by domestic sheep in the past, and in some cases may be absent
from the understory altogether [<a href="#119">119</a>]. Because it often decreases under
heavy grazing pressure, elk sedge is an indicator of good range condition where it is dominant in the
understory&nbsp;below ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir in the Blue Mountains of
northeastern Oregon and southeastern Washington [<a href="#58">58</a>]. Under heavy grazing
pressure elk sedge is often replaced by pasture grasses in the Douglas-fir/ninebark
habitat type of the northern Rocky Mountains [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>] and in quaking aspen/elk sedge sites [<a href="#103">103</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some cases elk sedge may respond favorably to grazing. Powell [<a href="#109">109</a>] stated that heavy grazing
by domestic sheep would cause an
increase in cover of elk sedge relative to the variety of palatable forbs
present in the understory of the quaking aspen/Fendler meadowrue (<i>Thalictrum
fendleri</i>) community type in Colorado.&nbsp; Zimmerman [<a href="#152">152</a>] found that livestock grazing had no adverse
influences on the reproduction of elk sedge, and that cover of elk sedge was the
same in grazed and ungrazed stands in the Douglas-fir/ninebark habitat type in
 Idaho. However, frequency of elk sedge was slightly higher
in grazed stands.
