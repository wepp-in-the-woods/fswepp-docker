<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name for black tupelo is Nyssa
sylvatica Marsh [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Tupelo is divided into two commonly recognized
varieties which are differentiated by habitat:  black tupelo (Nyssa
sylvatica var. sylvatica) occurs on light-textured soils of uplands and
stream bottoms and swamp tupelo (N. sylvatica var. biflora) occurs on
heavy organic or clay soils of wet bottomlands [<a href="#44">44</a>].  This report

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Black tupelo wood is used mainly for lumber, veener, paper pulp, and to
some extent for railroad ties [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  The veneer is used mainly for
boxes, crates, baskets, furniture, and interior woodwork.  Because of
its toughness, black tupelo is also used for flooring, rollers in glass
factories, blocks, gunstocks, and pistol grips [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Black tupelo sprouts are commonly browsed by white-tailed deer but lose
palatability with age [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  The fruit is high in nutrients and is
eaten by a variety of birds and mammals [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Stumps sprouts of black tupelo are reported to be a moderate to high
palatability browse to white-tailed deer [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Percent mean nutrient values of black tupelo on unburned plots in
southern pine forests were as follows [<a href="#36">36</a>]:

                                  N-free

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Black tupelo provides cavity and nesting sites for a variety of birds
and mammals [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Because of its straight bole, shapely crown, and attractive autumn
foliage, black tupelo is often planted as an ornamental.  Bees utilize
the nectar from the flowers of black and swamp tupelo to produce honey
[<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Silviculture:  Seedling establishment of black tupelo is best
accomplished by the shelterwood method.  Regeneration can also be
accomplished by clearcutting if it follows a good seed fall or if
advanced regeneration is already established [9,18,].  Silvicultural
practices for regenerating black tupelo have been described [<a href="#25">25</a>].

Animal damage:  Due to the high palatability of seedling and sprouts,
black tupelo can be eliminated or greatly reduced when deer populations
are high [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Insects and diseases:  The two most important insects that attack black
tupelo are the tupelo leaf miner (Antispila nyssaefoliella) and the
forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria).  Infestation of these
insects cause growth loss and occasional mortality.  Fire scars often
serve as entry points for a large number of heart rot fungi [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Control:  Black tupelo and other hardwoods often compete with loblolly
and shortleaf pine (Pinus taeda and P. echinata) stands for water and
light, reducing their growth and development [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Basal tree
injections of black tupelo with the herbicide DOWCO 23 was reported to
be the most effective, resulting in ninety-nine percent crown kill [<a href="#34">34</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Nyssa sylvatica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Black tupelo is a medium- to large-sized, native, deciduous tree,
frequently 60 to 80 feet high (18-24 m) [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  In the forest it
typically has a dense foliage with a conical crown on an erect trunk
which extends continuously into the top.  The simple, alternate leaves
are leathery, and densely clustered at the branchlets.  The small
greenish white flowers are borne singly or in capitate clusters.  The
bark is reddish brown and broken into deep irregular ridges and
diamond-shaped plates.  On old trunks, the bark may be an inch (2.5 cm)
or more thick [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Swamp tupelo (var. biflora) develops a long
taproot and a swollen base [<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Seed production and dispersal:  Seed production in black tupelo is
highly variable while swamp tupelo is a prolific seed producer [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].
Viability of swamp tupelo seed, which averages 60 percent, increases as
the season progresses [<a href="#44">44</a>].  The principal dissemination agents are
gravity and birds [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Birds consume the fleshy fruits and seed are
passed through the digestive tract [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  The fruits are not
persistent and fall shortly after ripening in late summer or fall.
Seeds not dispersed by animals generally fall to the ground near the
tree and remain dormant in the litter or are transported by water
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].

Seedling development:  Under natural conditions, seed overwinters on
cool, damp soil and germinates the following spring.  Both varieties
appear to require nearly full sunlight for optimum early growth.  Black
tupelo, however, will tolerate more overhead competition and can exist
on unfavorable sites.  Swamp tupelo is much less adaptable [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Both black tupelo and swamp tupelo will sprout
from the stump following disturbance.  Smaller black tupelo stumps
sprout readily while larger stumps sprout occasionally.  Sprouts arise
from suppressed buds and are concentrated near the top of the stump
[<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

Stump sprouts can produce seeds at 2 years of age.  Thus, if the seed
crop fails or unfavorable weather conditions prevent a good crop of
seedlings from becoming established, sprouts can provide a seed source
[<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Black tupelo is adapted to a wide variety of sites, from the creek
bottoms of the southern Coastal Plain to altitudes of 3,000 feet (915 m)
in North Carolina.  Black tupelo will tolerate brief spring flooding on
alluvial sites and is common on the relatively dry upper and middle
slopes in the Appalachian Mountains.  On the drier uplands, black tupelo
will survive but with a slower growth rate [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Swamp tupelo is
found in and on the banks of swamps, ponds, and estuaries of the Coastal
Plain, and in low coves and seepages which remain wet year-round
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

Common tree associates of both varieties are:  black cherry (Prunus
serotina), dogwood (Cornus florida), hickory (Carya spp.), oak (Quercus
spp.), eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria),
swamp cyrilla (Cyrilla racemiflora), and redbay (Persea borbonia)
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Black tupelo is usually found with a mixture of other species.  It is
classed as tolerant of shade and rarely attains overstory dominance but
is usually grows in the intermediate crown class on most sites.
Intermediate black tupelo stems respond favorably to release from
overtopping vegetation.  Seedlings grow slowly under a fully stocked
stand.  When the canopy is removed, about 25 percent or more can be
expected to respond with relatively rapid height growth.  At the time of
disturbance large numbers of new seedlings can become established.
Swamp tupelo is classed as intolerant of shade and will not develop
unless released [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Black tupelo and swamp tupelo flower in the spring when the leaves are
nearly grown.  Fruits develop over the spring and summer and ripen early
to late fall depending on latitude and climate.  General timing of
flowering, and fruit ripening and dispersal for the two varieties is as
follows [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>]:

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Nyssa sylvatica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Black tupelo is well adapted to fire.  Older trees have thick bark and
relatively high moisture content [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Swamp tupelo sites are usually
quite wet and fire is only a factor during periods of extended drought
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Although aboveground portions of young black tupelo are
top-killed by fire, the species typically survives by sprouting from the
root crown or caudex [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].

<pre><center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Nyssa sylvatica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
The effects of fire on black tupelo depends on the size of the
individual and severity of fire.  Most fires typically top-kill black
tupelo.  However, hot fires during dry periods can cause mortality and
deformity [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].

On the Atlantic Coastal Plain, prescribed summer fires caused some
top-kill in black tupelo up to 4 inches d.b.h (10 cm).  Top-kill
averaged 50 percent for trees 2 inches (5 cm) d.b.h. [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
Fire wounds can serve as entry points for various heart rot fungi [<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
When top-killed by fire, black tupelo sprouts prolifically, with each
individual producing several sprouts [<a href="#44">44</a>].  In a study conducted in the
southern Appalachians, trees 1 to 4 inches (2.5-10 cm) d.b.h. sprouted
quickly following a once-over braodcast burn [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fire can be a useful management tool for controlling black tupelo and
other hardwoods.  Depending on the season and type of treatment,
repeated burning over a long period of time has been reported as an
effective control of black tupelo [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  Riebold [<a href="#47">47</a>] suggests annual
winter prescribed burns for controlling black tupelo and other hardwoods
up to 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) d.b.h.  Black tupelo will sprout, but the
sprouts can be killed by repeated winter fires before they reach 1 to 2
inch (2.5-5 cm) d.b.h.

Repeated summer fires in the early growing season when the leaves are
fully expanded is also a very effective method of weakening and
eventually killing black tupelo [<a href="#11">11</a>].
