<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Prosopis pubescens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Screwbean mesquite is largely confined to valley bottomlands and its
distribution often follows major water courses.  In New Mexico and
Texas, screwbean mesquite occurs along the Rio Grande from the Big Bend
area northward to the town of Bernardo in central New Mexico [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].
Farther west it occurs in northern Baja California, throughout much of
southeastern California, southern Nevada, eastern Arizona, and extreme
southwestern Utah [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Its distribution is continuous along the
Colorado River from about 50 miles (80 km) south of the Mexican-U.S.
border northward to the Virgin River near Overton, Nevada [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].
Along the Virgin River, screwbean mesquite occurs northward to the
Arizona-Utah border.  Along the Gila River, screwbean mesquite has a
continuous distribution eastward to midway between Florence and Kelvin,
Arizona [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Along the Salt River, it occurs from the Salt River-Gila
River confluence eastward to the Salt River Indian Reservation.

A disjunct population occurs in the San Joaquin Valley of California.
These plants became established between 1870 and 1890, probably from
livestock-transported seed left along railways [<a href="#20">20</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
In general, screwbean mesquite only becomes a dominant or codominant in
woodlands or scrublands along riparian zones.

Associated trees and shrubs include saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissima),
western honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa var. torreyana), velvet
mesquite (P. velutina), seepwillow (Baccharis glutinosa), arroweed
(Tessaria sericea), quailbush (Atriplex lentiformis), seepweed (Suaeda
torreyana), skunkbrush sumac (Rhus trilobata), and wolfberry (Lycium
andersonii) [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Along the Rio Grande, saltgrass (Distichlis
spicata) and alkali sacaton (Sporobolus airoides) are common understory
grasses [<a href="#8">8</a>].

</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Screwbean mesquite is cut for firewood [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Mesquite wood is easily
sawed and split, is dry and heavy, ignites readily, and produces intense
heat [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Screwbean mesquite is used locally for fenceposts and tool
handles [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
The sweet-tasting bean pods of screwbean mesquite are high in protein
and sugars and are avidly eaten by most livestock [<a href="#10">10</a>].  The fruit crop
annually provides an abundant and nutritious food source for numerous
wild animals.  In general, mesquite (Prosopis spp.)  seeds and beans
form an important part of the diet of mice, kangaroo rats, woodrats,
chipmunks, ground squirrels, rabbits, skunks, quail, doves, ravens, the
porcupine, racoon, coyote, collared peccary, white-tailed deer, mule
deer, wild turkey, and mallard [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  Small rodents such as
woodrats, kangaroo rats, and pocket mice derive a large portion of their
diet from mesquite seeds [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Screwbean mesquite seeds are regularly
eaten by the roadrunner and numerous species of quail [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].

Screwbean mesquite browse does not appear to be a particularly important
wildlife food.  Locally, screwbean mesquite browse is important to mule
deer in California [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Jackrabbits probably consume large quantities
of the leaves and bark, as they do with other mesquites (Prosopis spp.)
[<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The sweet, nutrituous seed pods of screwbean mesquite are highly
palatable to all classes of livestock and to numerous small and large
wildlife species.  For both livestock and wildlife, the palatability of
the leaves and twigs appears to be relatively low to moderate. 


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Mesquite pods are nutritious.  The thick and spongy pericarp is high in
sugars and the seeds contain large amounts of protein.  

Nutritional information concerning screwbean mesquite fruit and seed is
presented below [<a href="#3">3</a>]:

               % water   % protein   % fiber   % ash   % sugar

whole pod       5.9        11.0       17.0      3.8      25.0
seeds           7.4        26.0       ----      ---      ----


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Screwbean mesquite tends to form thickets, which presumably provide
needed security cover for large wildlife species like desert mule deer.

Riparian communities dominated by screwbean mesquite provide important
habitat for numerous bird species during both summer and winter [<a href="#30">30</a>] and
essential nesting cover for numerous bird species [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Screwbean
mesquite dominated bosques also provide favorable habitat for numerous
small mammals such as pocket mice, deer mice, kangaroo rats, and
woodrats.  Many rodents place their burrows under the protective cover
of mesquite shrubs [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Screwbean mesquite was an important food item of Southwestern Native
Americans.  The beans were ground into flour which was used to prepare
cakes and breads [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  Various refreshing drinks were made from the
sweet pods.  Screwbean mesquite also provided fuel, shelter, weapons,
tools, dyes and paints, medicines, cosmetics, baskets, furniture,
clothing, rope, glue, and many other every day items [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Prosopis pubescens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Screwbean mesquite is a deciduous, thorny shrub or small tree with
slender branches.  Plants range from 6.5 to 33 feet (2-10 m) tall.  The
trunk diameter on larger trees often reaches about 8 to 12 inches (20-30
cm) [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  The smooth, thick, gray to reddish brown bark separates in
long strips [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Single or paired, sharp, straight, white thorns occur
at the base of the leaf stalks and are about 0.33 to 0.5 inch (8-12 mm)
long [<a href="#38">38</a>].  The alternate, bipinnately compound leaves are 1.5 to 3
inches (3.8-7.6 cm) long and contain five to eight pairs of leaflets
which are 0.25 to 0.38 inch (6-10 mm) long and 0.13 inch (3mm) wide
[<a href="#28">28</a>].  The yellow flowers occur in 2-inch-long (5 cm) cylindrical spikes
[<a href="#32">32</a>].  The fruit is a yellow to brown, 1- to 2-inch-long (2.5-5 cm) pod,
which is tightly coiled into a springlike cylinder.

Screwbean is easily distinguished from other common mesquites, such as
velvet mesquite (P. velutina), honey mesquite (P. glandulosa var.
glandulosa), and western honey mesquite (P. glandulosa var. torreyana),
by its odd, screwlike pods and its considerably smaller leaves which
have comparatively few, small leaflets [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Screwbean mesquite reproduces sexually by producing an abundance of
seeds.  Information regarding this species' vegetative regenerative
capabilities is lacking.  Other mesquites (Prosopis spp.) commonly
sprout from buds located on an underground stem following injury to the
aboveground portion of the plant [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].

Seed production:  Mesquite flowers are pollinated by insects,
predominately bees [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Screwbean mesquite's fruit production is
probably rather consistent from year to year because plants are often
found in riparian situations where they have access to subsurface water.

Seed dispersal:  Mesquite pods are dispersed primarily by domestic and
wild animals.  A large percentage of mesquite seeds pass through the
digestive tracts of domestic animals intact and viable [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Many
species of rodents collect and store mesquite beans in caches and
uneaten seeds commonly.  Mesquite pods may be carried downslope by
running water [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Seed viability and germination:  Mesquite seeds contain a bony,
protective endocarp.  Scarification of this hard seedcoat must occur
before the seed can germinate.  Scarification occurs naturally when
seeds pass through the digestive system of animals.  Seeds remaining in
pods not consumed by animals remain dormant until the seedcoat is broken
by weathering.  Seeds remain dormant for long periods.  Sixty percent
viability was reported for 44-year-old velvet mesquite seeds taken from
herbarium specimens [<a href="#36">36</a>].

Seedling establishment:  Mesquite seeds must be covered with a small
amount of soil or dung for seedlings to become established.  Seeds that
germinate on the soil surface usually die [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Screwbean mesquite is generally restricted to river bottoms,
floodplains, washes, oases, and irrigation ditches where it tends to
form thickets [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].

Shade tolerance:  Screwbean mesquite apparently has moderate shade
tolerance which allows plants to grow beneath cottonwoods (Populus spp.)
[<a href="#8">8</a>].

Soils:  Screwbean mesquite occurs on many soil textures, including
gravels, sands, sandy-loams, and clays [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  It often occurs on
saline soils [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Elevation:  Elevational ranges for the following Southwestern states are
given below [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>]:

        below 4,000 feet (1,219 m) in AZ
        below 2,500 feet (762 m) in CA
        from 2,400 to 5,450 feet (730-900 m) in UT


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Screwbean mesquite flowers in the spring.  The fruits mature between
July and October and fall from the plant in autumn [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
The underground regenerative structure of screwbean mesquite has not
been described.  Other mesquites of the American Southwest contain
numerous dormant buds on an underground stem [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  In general, these
buds are sufficiently insulated to survive the heat of most fires.  

Riparian communities that have become dominated by saltcedar are highly
flammable.  One study of saltcedar stands along the lower Colorado River
found that of 25 stands surveyed, 21 had burned within the past 15 years
[<a href="#42">42</a>].  Although screwbean mesquite may survive these fires, it recovers
slowly and is quickly overgrown by the saltcedar.  With an increasing
frequency of fire, screwbean mesquite will eventually be replaced
[<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].

<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Vogl and McHargue [<a href="#39">39</a>] report that plants not killed by fire resprout
weakly.  They further state that following a fire in a southern
California oasis, a "dense stand" of screwbean mesquite and western
honey mesquite was found under California palms (Washingtonia filifera)
within 10 to 15 years.  It is unclear whether these plants were
established from seed or from individuals which survived the fire.
