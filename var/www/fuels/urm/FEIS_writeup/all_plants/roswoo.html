<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Wood's rose is browsed by livestock and big game from spring through
fall.  Moderate use by mule deer and elk has been reported [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Game
and livestock strongly prefer this shrub in the spring when the leaves
appear [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Porcupines and beavers also browse the leaves [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Wood's rose hips persist on the plant through much of the winter.  Many
birds and mammals are sustained by these dry fruits when the ground is
covered with snow [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  In Cache Valley, Utah, Wood's rose hips
provide a high-energy food for wintering mule deer [<a href="#47">47</a>].  Rose hips are
a favorite food of squirrels [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Wood's rose hips are sometimes eaten
by coyotes and bears [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Livestock and big game find Wood's rose leaves palatable from spring
through fall [<a href="#50">50</a>].  The palatability of Wood's rose to livestock and
wildlife species in several western states has been rated as follows
[<a href="#11">11</a>]:

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Wood's rose leaves are considered fair to good livestock forage,
particularly for sheep [<a href="#23">23</a>].  In North Dakota, the protein content of
leaves and twigs combined were found to be sufficent to meet the
maintenance requirements of sheep and cattle during the growing season.
Calcium percentages met the requirements for sheep and cattle for the
entire year [<a href="#12">12</a>].  In the Black Hills of South Dakota, Wood's rose
leaves contained good phosphorus percentages in the spring and retained
adequate levels into the fall.  However, the stems of rose were below
the 0.16 percent phosphorous level recommended as minimal for pregnant
ewes.  Stems were slightly deficient in phosphorous requirement during
the winter [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Of the species studied, Wood's rose produced the
greatest amount of dry matter, but because of lower digestibility and
crude protein content, it will probably not support as many deer per
unit area as other browse species on the site [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Wood's rose hips are a high source of digestible energy.  Digestible
energy levels in the diet of deer might be increased by planting rose
stock that produces heavy crops of hips [<a href="#47">47</a>].  Rose hips are moderately
high in crude protein during winter [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The dense thickets formed by Wood's rose along field borders and stream
courses are used for nesting and escape cover by many birds and small
mammals [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  The degree to which Wood's rose provides
environmental protection during one or more seasons for wildlife species
has been rated as follows [<a href="#11">11</a>]:

                         CO      MT      ND      UT      WY

Waterfowl               ----    Good    Poor    ----    Poor


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Wood's rose extensive rhizomes, and good survivability and revegetation
characteristics even on harsh sites makes this species an effective tool
in erosion control [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  It has also been suggested as a useful
species for revegetation on high pH and lime soils [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Wood's rose is
used to revegetate disturbed sites along streambanks and seeps, and
shows promise for road cut revegetation in western Montana and northern
Idaho [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].

Following planting on a road cut, Wood's rose increased by sprouting
from the roots to the extent that it became difficult to distinguish
individual plants.  The proliferation of flowers and fruits observed on
Wood's rose indicate that establishment of new plants from seed may also
occur [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Of the species studied, Wood's rose demonstrated the best
survivability and regeneration characteristics [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Wood's rose also
appears to be a good species to plant with seeded grasses on untreated
acid mine spoils in California.  The survival and growth of Wood's rose
was not reduced by grass competition [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Good results have been obtained with hardwood cuttings, direct seeding
and transplanting trials.  Native seed is available [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Native americans made extensive use of Wood's rose roots, stems, leaves,
flowers, and hips for foods and therapeutic materials.  The hips are a
source of vitamin C and are dried for use in flavoring teas, jellies,
fruitcakes, and puddings [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  The flowers provide a source of
pollen for honey bees [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Wood's rose is used as an ornamental near
homes to attract birds and other wildlife [<a href="#50">50</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Wood's rose has a fairly high tolerance to browsing.  It is susceptible
to various leaf spots, as well as to leaf rusts, gray mold, powdery
mildew, common gall, and stem cankers [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  The principal forest
insect pests of Rosa spp. are California tent caterpillar (Malacasoma
californicum), rose leaf hopper (Edwardsiana rosae), and a subspecies of
western tussock moth (Orgyia vetusta spp. gulosa) [<a href="#21">21</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rosa woodsii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Wood's rose is a native, cool-season, fast-growing, long-lived perennial
bushy shrub [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  It attains a height of 1.5 to 6 feet (0.5-1.8
m).  The stems have prickles which are straight or slightly curved and
0.2 to 0.3 inch (0.06-0.09 m) long [<a href="#44">44</a>].  The leaves are from 0.8 to 2.4
inches (2-6 cm) long [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Wood's rose has rhizomes and shallow,
fibrous roots that branch frequently [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte
   Chamaephyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction:  Rosa spp. generally first flower and produce seed
when they are 2 to 5 years old.  Good crops are usually produced every 2
years.  Seeds of Wood's rose are injested with the fruit and dispersed
in the droppings of birds and mammals [<a href="#21">21</a>].  The seeds have a seed coat
dormancy and require warm or cold stratification.  Seed viability ranged
from 44 to 64 percent for seed collected in northern Alberta [<a href="#24">24</a>].  The
seeds remain viable for 2 to 5 years [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Seeds will germinate within
30 to 40 days [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Wood's rose spreads vegetatively through
underground rhizomes, sprouting from the root crown, and layering
[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Wood's rose occurs on bluffs, dry grassy slopes, and on sandhills
throughout the prairies.  It is also found on riverbanks and clearings
in boreal and subalpine forests [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  It is common on disturbed
sites throughout the eastern slopes of the Rocky mountains and is
especially prevalent along roadsides and south-facing cutbanks [<a href="#24">24</a>].
Wood's rose is found throughout the Great Basin but prefers rather moist
sites along streams or in seepage areas along fences.  When conditions
are favorable, nearly impenetrable thickets of Wood's rose are formed
along some mountain streams [<a href="#35">35</a>].

Soils:  Wood's rose is adapted to a wide range of soil types and
textures.  Growth is generally best on moderately fertile, well-drained
clay loam, sandy loam, or sandy soils [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  It is also adapted to a
broad range of moisture conditions but tends to favor moist,
well-drained soils that are present in riparian ecosystems [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Wood's
rose is tolerant of moderately acid to weakly basic soils [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Shade tolerance:  Wood's rose flourishes in moderate shade to full
sunlight and therefore grows well on all aspects [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Climate:  Wood's rose is seldom found where the average annual
precipitation is less than 12 inches (260 mm) [<a href="#6">6</a>].  It is variable in
hardiness and climatic tolerance.  It will grow in moderate climates as
well as alpine environments, which suggests that some plants can
tolerate a cold, snowy climate with a short growing season [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].

Elevational range:  The elevational range of Wood's rose in several
western states is as follows [<a href="#11">11</a>]:

           Utah:  3,500 to 7,500 feet (1,062-2,275 m)
           Colorado:  3,500 to 11,700 feet ((1,062-3,549 m)
           Wyoming:  4,000 to 8,300 feet (1,213-2,518 m)
           Montana:  3,500 to 6,600 feet (1,062-2,002 m)

Associated species:  Wood's rose is commonly found associated with the
following species:  western snowberry (Symphoricarpos occidentalis),
common chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), hawthorn (Crataegus spp.),
serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa
pratensis), fowl bluegrass (P. palustris), quackgrass (Agropyron
repens), big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), western river alder
(Alnus incana), virginsbower (Clematis ligusticifolia), golden currant
(Ribes aureum), coyote willow (Salix exigua), cheatgrass (Bromus
tectorum), beardless wildrye (Elymus triticoides), sweet scented
bedstraw (Galium triflorum), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), and
Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense) [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Wood's rose is an aggressive pioneer of abandoned fields, disturbed
sites, gullies, and land cuts and fills [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  It is moderately shade
tolerant and therefore can persist as an understory species in mid-seral
to climax communities.  In northwestern Montana, Wood's-rose-dominated
community types represent a disturbance-induced seral stage of the
ponderosa pine/red-osier dogwood (Pinus ponderosa/Cornus stolenifera)
and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)/red-osier dogwood habitat types
[<a href="#7">7</a>].  In many cases Wood's rose occurs as a dominant or codominant
understory species within stands dominated by cottonwood (Populus spp.),
ponderosa pine, and Douglas-fir [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Additionally, in the Black Hills
of South Dakota, Wood's rose occurs as part of the dominant vegetation
in the subclimax chaparral which occurs as an intermediate zone along
the eastern foothills, between the mixed prairie and the montane forest
and eastward along the stream valleys [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Wood's rose generally flowers from late spring to midsummer.  However,
date of flowering varies considerably according to elevation and
exposure [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  The rose hips ripen during late summer and fall [<a href="#35">35</a>].
Hips generally remain on the plant throughout the winter [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rosa woodsii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Wood's rose is moderately fire tolerant and is usually favored by
low-severity fire.  It can persist after low- to moderate-severity fire
because of its ability to sprout from undamaged or buried root crowns
and rhizomes [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  It occasionally germinates from on-site or
off-site seed sources after fire [<a href="#51">51</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Small shrub, adventitious-bud rootcrown
   Rhizomatous shrub, rhizome in soil

Wood's rose is typically top-killed by fire [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  Root crowns and
underground rhizomes survive low- or moderate-severity fires [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].
However, the shallow root crowns of Wood's rose are susceptible to
injury, and populations consequently decrease following high-severity
fire [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>



<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Wood's rose recovery varies with fire severity.  Top-killed plants will
sprout from the root crown and underground surviving rhizomes
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Reproduction from seed is rarely observed after fire.
When seedlings are observed in a burn area, their rate of growth is slow
compared to that of other species [<a href="#51">51</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
In, Wood's rose doubled in abundance by postfire year 2 [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Following
a moderate- to high-severity fire at Manning Basin northeast of
Montpelier, Idaho, Wood's rose recovered to near preburn densities by
postfire year 2 [<a href="#8">8</a>].  The first growing season after a spring burn in an
aspen-conifer stand, west Boulder River, Montana, the density per acre
of Wood's rose showed significant increase.  The average height for
Wood's rose following the first postburn growing season was about half
or less of their average preburn height [<a href="#19">19</a>].  One year following a
high-severity fire in a northern Arizona ponderosa pine forest, postfire
biomass of Wood's rose was only about 0.25 that of prefire levels [<a href="#46">46</a>].
