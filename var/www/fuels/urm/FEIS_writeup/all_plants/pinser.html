The currently accepted scientific name of pond pine is <i> Pinus serotina</i> Michx
(Pinaceae) [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>]. Pond pine hybridizes with pitch pine (<i>P. rigida</i>),
longleaf pine (<i>P. palustris)</i>, and
loblolly pine (<i>P. taeda</i>). Due to pond pine's late pollination season,
hybridization with pitch pine and longleaf pine is rare [<a href="#24">24</a>]; however,&nbsp;hybridization
with loblolly pine is common throughout southern
Delaware [<a href="#64">64</a>].

Pond pine is distributed from Cape May, New Jersey, southward through the
coastal plains of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia to central Florida and southeastern Alabama
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>], and is occasionally found in Mississippi and southeastern
Texas [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>]. The <a href="http://plants.usda.gov/">PLANTS database</a>
provides a distributional map of pond pine. Pond pine was introduced to England in 1713 where it still exists, although very rare [<a href="#49">49</a>].

Pond pine dominates the overstory of many swamps
  and other poorly drained areas that usually have striking changes in
  groundwater levels and are frequently subject to fires during dry periods [<a href="#20">20</a>]. 
  Pond pine occurs in a variety of coastal plains habitat
  types. Associates of pond pine in wet pine forests include swamp tupelo
  (<i>Nyssa sylvatica</i>), water oak (<i>Quercus nigra</i>), baldcypress (<i>Taxodium
  distichum</i>), pondcypress (<i>T. d. </i>var.<i> nutans</i>),
  sweetbay (<i>Magnolia virginiana</i>), live oak (<i>Quercus virginiana</i>),
  loblolly-bay (<i>Gordonia lasianthus</i>), and redbay (<i>Persea borbonia</i>)
  [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>]. Tree species associated with pond pine in savannas of
  the coastal plain include longleaf pine, loblolly pine,
  and slash pine (<i>P. elliottii</i>) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>]. Although pond
  pine usually dominates pocosin overstory, red maple (<i>Acer rubrum</i>),
  sweetbay, and redbay may codominate [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].&nbsp;
  The wettest flatwoods of the longleaf pine communities are generally
  dominated by pond pine with loblolly-bay and a dense shrub layer [<a href="#55">55</a>].<br><br>

The economic value of pond pine is variable. Some consider pond pine a
commercially valuable species [<a href="#40">40</a>] as a timber source [<a href="#36">36</a>].  However, others have
determined pond pine has low economic value as a pulpwood source [<a href="#20">20</a>].  The wood is course-grained, resinous, and of fair quality.  Pond pine is apt to have more defects than other southern pines on the market, largely due to
its susceptibility to red heart disease which substantially reduces its lumber value [<a href="#8">8</a>] and may make it more susceptible to fire damage [<a href="#66">66</a>]. Pond pine has not been
widely cultivated, due to its "low" economic value
[<a href="#59">59</a>]. 

<p>
Pond pine is the principal commercial species of the pocosins of North Carolina. According to Besse<i> </i>[<a href="#6">6</a>], in 1952 the tree occurred on approximately 2 million acres of the
coastal plain of North Carolina and the total board foot volume was 1.75 billion
board feet. On wet sites characteristic of present day pond pine forests, yields are comparatively low, and logging costs are high.  Observations indicate that growth rates of pond pine may be
25% to 33% lower than loblolly pine where the species grow together [<a href="#66">66</a>].

Bottomland forests, in which pond pine is found, tend to be among the most productive habitats for wildlife, with surface water that moderates temperature extremes and serves as escape habitat.
There is a predominance of broad-leaved evergreen plants in the understory and mast-producing trees in the overstory
that provide an abundance of branch cavities and mast for over-wintering migrant birds
[<a href="#56">56</a>]. Animals found in pond pine habitat in North Carolina include the marsh rabbit, silver-haired bat, eastern cottontail, grasshopper mouse, meadow vole, black bear, long-tailed weasel, and bobcat [<a href="#15">15</a>].

<p>Pocosins, in which pond pine dominates the overstory, serve as habitat for the specialized swallowtail, Hessel's hairstreak butterfly,
the rare pine barrens tree frog, the eastern diamondback rattlesnake (endangered
in North Carolina), and the federally endangered American alligator. Pocosins are also refuges for native species such as black bear, white-tailed deer, and smaller mammals such as the bobcat, marsh rabbit, and gray squirrel [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  The endangered red-cockaded woodpecker inhabits mature pond pine in pocosins [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>].
</p>

<p>Pond pine often dominates the flatwoods habitat that supports various populations of
birds and small mammals such as the cotton rat, cotton mouse, and short-tailed shrew.  Avian densities are low throughout the year with some increase in winter due to the influx of migratory winter residents.  No mammal is exclusive to the flatwoods, although the fox squirrel is highly characteristic of flatwoods with open understory.  Three large mammals native to Florida use flatwoods: white-tailed deer, black bear, and the endangered Florida panther [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Pond pine is an important cover species for the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker
[<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>].  The red-cockaded woodpecker usually inhabits pond pine trees between the ages of 30 to 170 years
old; in South Carolina and Mississippi, however, they primarily use 54 to 119 year old pond pine trees
[<a href="#30">30</a>].
Trees must be infected with heart rot disease that softens the wood and allows
red-cockaded woodpeckers to excavate roost and nest cavities [<a href="#52">52</a>].

Seedlings of pond pine were planted on cleared shrub oak areas in South Carolina. The average survival was 72% after 2 years.  Although pond pine is characteristically a wet site species, it showed good early response on this relatively dry site [<a href="#68">68</a>].

Subsequent to regional timber removal in early development of the Southeast, pocosin ecosystems have generally been considered of low economic value for agriculture, although they have recently
been recognized as a source of peat
[<a href="#65">65</a>].

OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>

<br />

The draining of pond pine habitats has created much controversy.  The southern forested wetlands are home to a wide variety of endangered, threatened, and candidate plant and animal species.
It is thought that these species, along with pond pine,&nbsp; may be jeopardized&nbsp;
if the wetlands are drained [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>]. In general, forested wetlands comprise about 60% of all the
U.S. wetland areas (exclusive of deepwater habitats, such as submerged grasslands and
lake bottoms),
and loss of forested wetlands acreage is particularly high. From 1940 to 1980, forested wetlands areas were decreasing at an annual rate of 0.3% nationally [<a href="#1">1</a>].&nbsp;  

</p>

<p>
Today humans are changing the flatwoods ecosystem, which is important to pond
pine, in 2 major ways:  the destruction of stands in favor of alternative land uses such as crops, improved pastures, and urban
development; and the alteration of various ecosystems and community
characteristics by management practices associated with timber, pulpwood, and cattle production.
It is predicted that if current trends continue, extensive future alterations and declines will occur [<a href="#2">2</a>].  However, an opposing view states that pond pine may respond favorably to drainage.
Although pond pine is most frequently found on poorly drained lands, the species
can make excellent growth on mineral soils or on land that is not continuously
waterlogged. In an eastern North Carolina site, basal area and height growth of pond pine was nearly doubled by drainage [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Pond pine is a relatively small tree that grows to 82 feet (25 m) tall by 2.6
feet (0.8 m) dbh with open and irregular crowns. Its needles are 4
to 8 inches (10-20 cm) long, 0.06 to 0.8 inches (1.5-2.0 mm) wide, with long tapering tips, in bundles of
3 or sometimes
4. Seed cones are persistent and frequently remain closed for several years.
Seed cones are stalked but later may become sessile or imbedded as branches enlarge.
Branches are moderately stout and may have clusters of needle bundles on the trunk. Winter buds are
0.2 inches (5 mm) in diameter and usually coated with hardened resin. The seed, including the wing, is
1.0 to 1.2 inches (2.5-3 cm) long and the wing is 0.3 inches (7 mm) wide. Pond
pine has medium-thick basal bark, a moderate to high and open crown, and moderately
open stands. The root systems of pond pine seedlings are
superficial [<a href="#6">6</a>], and mature trees have a &quot;medium&quot; rooting habit
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>]. Pond
pine sprouts from the base and roots after fire or other damage [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]
and produces epicormic branches after fire damage [<a href="#60">60</a>].&nbsp;

The specific epithet of pond pine, <i>serotina</i>, means "late" and refers to the delayed opening of
cones. Cones often persist for 2 to 8 years, giving the tree the appearance of being a prolific seed producer
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>]. All pond pine cones are probably closed when they first mature [<a href="#79">79</a>]. 
Viability does not decrease in cones that 
remain closed for as long as 3
years [<a href="#8">8</a>]. Cones older than 5 years
may open individually following weathering and insect depredations; 
sound seed may be sparse in cones more than 5 years old [<a href="#79">79</a>]. Seed is released from older, open cones of pond pine during 2 seasonal periods: 
April through September&nbsp; and October through January
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].&nbsp; Regeneration of pond pine is hampered by 2 problems under average
conditions. First, serotinous pond pine cones often require heat to open
the scaled cones, and 2nd, continual moistness of the organic soil
provides an excellent growth medium for intense competitors such as other trees,
evergreen brush, and switchcane (<i>Arundinaria gigantea</i> ssp. <i>tecta</i>) [<a href="#16">16</a>]. 

<P> Pond pine cones open and release seeds soon after exposure to heat from fire.
Intensity of heat does not adversely
reduce viability of seeds. Even badly charred cones release seeds that are capable of germination. Mature cones can be opened by exposure to&nbsp;
333 to 336 <sup>o</sup>F (167-169 <sup>o</sup>C) dry heat for 20 seconds or by immersion in boiling water for a similar period [<a href="#8">8</a>]. Optimum stratification of pond pine seeds is 30 days at 33-41<sup>o</sup>F
(0.5-5 <sup>o</sup>C) in a moist medium [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>]. Germination occurs in 24 days [<a href="#5">5</a>].
Pond
pine seeds germinated in a nursery were unable to survive full saturation
conditions [<a href="#46">46</a>].&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

<P> Among pine species, pond pine is somewhat unique in that it usually resprouts after
being damaged by disturbance [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. Seedlings or saplings usually sprout prolifically when cut, and older trees will sprout vigorously along the stem and branches
even after intense
scorching and defoliation by fire. These sprouts come from dormant buds in the axils of primary needles of young seedlings.
Buds are dormant and are protected by bark. When the tree is injured, these buds resume growth and may give rise to clusters of buds and numerous short shoots
[<a href="#8">8</a>]. In pocosins, seedlings of pond pine sprout prolifically, and stands up to sapling size are primarily
reestablished by sprouting
[<a href="#29">29</a>].&nbsp;However, 1 study showed that most seedlings on pond pine plots, which were completely burned, did
not resprout [<a href="#66">66</a>]. Evidence suggests that pond pine may not resprout
indefinitely, and that frequent burning of any age pond pine stand may kill it
[<a href="#26">26</a>]. </P>

SITE CHARACTERISTICS:</a>

<br />


Pond pine is found on a variety of sites in the southeastern United
States. Pond pine occupies the wettest sites within the wet pine type. It is found in swamps, pond borders, and pocosins, characterized by undrained peat
soils and/or wet, sandy flats. Pond pine grows extensively in the broad, poorly
drained interstream areas of peaty soils in the lower coastal plains of North
Carolina. Further south, it is found on wet pine flatwoods (pine forests on poorly drained soils) and
savannas of the lower coastal marine terraces and in bays and ponds throughout
the coastal plain [<a href="#25">25</a>].<P>In eastern North Carolina, pond pine usually occurs on wet flats and
extensive, poorly drained evergreen shrub bogs called pocosins. These
pocosins have organic
soils varying from 1 to 25 feet (0.3-7.6 m) deep [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].&nbsp; Pocosins are highmoor, ombrotrophic bogs dominated by a
continuous shrub cover 3.3 to 13 feet (1-4 m) high with scattered emergent trees, usually pond
pine [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>]. Pond pine is the only &quot;important&quot; pocosin tree,
probably because of recurrent fire.&nbsp;Pocosins apparently
represent the lower limit of site quality tolerated by pond pine [<a href="#66">66</a>].

<P>A pond pine-slash pine association occurs in peaty swamps. Peaty swamps
contain surface water
only during a part of the growing season. Coniferous trees
or shrubs, including many ericaceous species, exist in these swamps. Frutescent and herbaceous plants are also numerous.
Peaty swamps
are found on poorly drained, flat, interstream areas of lower terraces in
the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains [<a href="#57">57</a>].&nbsp; </P>

<P>Pine flatwoods is one of the most
common vegetation types in Florida, and can be dominated by pond pine [<a href="#50">50</a>].
Flatwoods with a pH less than 4.5 are usually dominated by pond pine and those
with pH above 4.5 by slash pine or longleaf pine
[<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>]. Pond pine is a principal tree species characteristic of this wet
pine type that is found in the coastal plain physiographic province from
Delaware south to Florida and west to eastern Texas, primarily in the flatwoods
of the outer marine terraces. Representative sites include boggy, nonriver
flatlands; poorly-drained, seasonally-wet coastal flatlands; and lowlands adjacent to ponds,
streams, and other wet areas. Soils range widely in texture from clay to
sand. Moisture conditions are influenced by an impermeable clay soil layer that
resists downward movement of water. Poor drainage limits aeration of
the soils on many sites and peat mats commonly develop over mineral
surfaces.&nbsp;Acidic conditions prevail on most sites [<a href="#25">25</a>]. </P>

<P>The bay forest type, occurring exclusively in the Coastal Plain physiographic
province ranging from Maryland to southeastern Texas, is restricted to coastal
depressions or floodplains where saturated conditions prevail. Soils are
usually organic, highly acidic and low in&nbsp; nutrient availability [<a href="#47">47</a>]. Bay
swamps, dominated by the redbay-sweetbay association, are characterized by a more or
less dense growth of evergreen trees, including pond pine [<a href="#57">57</a>].&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Other sites that include pond pine are cypress-swamp tupelo (<i>Nyssa
biflora</i>) and cane (<i>Arundinaria </i>spp.). On a cypress-swamp tupelo site, pond pine is most abundant where standing water or poor
drainage renders the habitat more acidic [<a href="#4">4</a>].&nbsp;Pond pine is often the overstory of cane
habitats that generally occur on organic soils having fair internal drainage and 40% to 50%
organic matter content in the upper 4 inches (10 cm) of soil, and a species composition
of 70% to 100% reeds [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

<P>Pond pine has excellent growth on better drained
mineral soils, but the faster, earlier growth of slash and loblolly pine usually
restricts it to a subordinate position on such sites [<a href="#25">25</a>]. Pond pine is
relatively tolerant to waterlogging. Mature trees can tolerate prolonged
flooding, but growth is slow. Pond pine also endures poor soil aeration and high
acidity, and is confined mostly to ponds and bays of interstream areas [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Another site characteristic important to maintenance of pond pine is the
unique climate of the southeastern United States. Weather patterns in the
Southeast spawn more
lightning storms than in any other region of North America. The lightning fire
season begins in early spring, is often most prevalent in May or June, then
tapers off in July and August through early fall. The large majority of
fires in the Southeast are caused by lightning [<a href="#38">38</a>].</P>

SUCCESSIONAL STATUS:</a>

<br />

The successional status of pond pine is somewhat controversial. Traditional ecological succession and climax concepts
tend to place many of the fire-dependent vegetation types, such as pond pine, as "subclimax"
types [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>]. However, others believe the fire-dependent systems are relatively stable "climaxes" under a burning regime, if, historically,
fire was a natural part of the environment
[<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>]. Walker [<a href="#81">81</a>] considers pond pine climax vegetation in pocosins since the tree is maintained in the absence of fire and regenerated as a consequence of fire.
The bay swamps, many of which contain pond pine, are considered climax by some, since the southern white-cedar swamps revert to
redbay-sweetbay when protected from fire; however it is stated that the hydric communities
&quot;can not be considered climax because none are controlled by climate [<a href="#57">57</a>].

<P>Fire is an important aspect of succession in many habitat types in which pond pine is
found. The long-term perpetuation of flatwoods, sand-pine scrub, pocosins, and savannas
are tied to fire. Species diversity is highest immediately following fire and generally decreases thereafter [<a href="#13">13</a>].&nbsp;</P>

<P>Flatwoods ecosystems, along with the rest of the southeastern pine forests,
have been classified as fire subclimax within the deciduous forest region [<a href="#2">2</a>]. Pine flatwoods are considered to be fire maintained but, without fire, they ultimately give way to hardwoods [<a href="#50">50</a>].&nbsp;Pond pine flatwoods, if unburned, can develop either to bayheads or to mixed hardwood swamps [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>]. Pond pine communities of North Carolina possess little herbaceous vegetation and are often changed by fire into shrub swamps in which pond pine occurs
only as scattered relicts among the fire resistant shrubs [<a href="#57">57</a>]. Human
alteration of natural fire frequency is thought to be the most common cause of
successional change in flatwoods [<a href="#2">2</a>].&nbsp;</P>

<P> Pocosins, often with pond pine overstory, generally can be viewed
as intermediate successional communities.&nbsp; They are often maintained in a
subclimax stage by fire and hydroperiod, with the mature vegetational stages
being suppressed for long periods on the wettest sites but developing relatively
quickly on drier sites [<a href="#15">15</a>].&nbsp;</P>

<P> The bay forest type, occurring exclusively in the
Coastal Plain physiographic province, frequently reverts to pond pine or Atlantic white-cedar after
severe fires [<a href="#47">47</a>].&nbsp;If the original stand of southern white-cedar is destroyed, together with
seed stored in the upper layer of peat, succession is toward a type in which pond pine predominates in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina
[<a href="#35">35</a>]. With recurrent fire, the bay swamp, pond pine-slash pine wetlands, and Atlantic white-cedar bog may revert to shrub bogs [<a href="#47">47</a>].&nbsp;It should be noted, however, that the shallow marsh is characterized by a mineral soil, and could not arise in a peaty area without aggradation
of inorganic sediments
[<a href="#57">57</a>]. The patchwork nature of evergreen bay forests is related to their extreme susceptibility to fire, after which they may revert back to any one of several freshwater, hydric vegetative cover types depending on the intensity of the burn and depth to the water table during and following the burn [<a href="#47">47</a>].&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P> Frequency of fire also determines the successional stage of many
southeastern swamp forests. Serotiny of species such as pond pine may be
selected for in regimes where fires are spaced with a frequency which allows maturation but does not
&quot;unreasonably exceed&quot; this. Too frequent firing could eliminate
pond pine from
an area altogether [<a href="#26">26</a>] and produce a grass-sedge bog or savannah [<a href="#8">8</a>]. Wells [<a href="#84">84</a>] observed that fires started by
Native Americans, and later even more frequently by European settlers, began to change stream-head swamp forests of the southeastern United States into grass-sedge bogs or savannahs. Under burning at least every decade, the native deciduous forest largely disappeared or became dominated by pond pine.
With more frequent burning the pines were replaced by fire-resistant shrubs or shrubby trees with the ability to sprout from stumps or roots. Under annual fires, the shrubs practically disappeared and were replaced by grasses, sedges, and many bulbous herbs.
These nearly treeless areas were called
sub-tropical savannahs. Under reduced frequency of fires, savannahs revert to shrubby pocosins, and under no fire, savannahs and pocosins rapidly return to swamp forest.</P>

<p>Excluding fire, primary factors affecting plant succession in any hydric area are
aggradation of the level of the substratum by inorganic and organic sediments, with consequent lowering of the water table and subsequent increase in oxygen tension above that level
[<a href="#57">57</a>]. On organic soils subject to prolonged flooding, longleaf and slash pine are replaced by pond pine communities. Pond pine assumes dominance in Virginia and the Carolinas on the wettest sites and on organic soils [<a href="#25">25</a>].
On mineral soils, pond pine is in an intermediate stage of plant succession,
where it may grow in pure even-aged stands until harvesting or mortality removes the dominant
trees [<a href="#8">8</a>].&nbsp;</p>

The minimum seed-bearing age of pond pine is between 4 and 10 years; however, cone production usually begins when pond pine seedlings
are approximately 10 years old [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  The tree flowers between March and April
[<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>], and pollen flight and female flower receptivity occur in late March in Florida and about 1 month later in North Carolina
[<a href="#8">8</a>]. Cones ripen in September or October [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>], and seed dispersal is often in the spring, but as cones are serotinous they may remain closed for several months or years.
Interval between large seed crops is 1 year
[<a href="#36">36</a>].

FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS:</a>

<br />

Pond pine has adaptations that not only allow it to exist, but to thrive in
frequent fire regimes
[<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>]. Requirements for fire adapted species such as pond pine are (1) bare mineral or exposed substrate for seed germination, (2) removal of toxic or
allelopathic chemicals or disease-causing conditions, (3) reproductive structures requiring fire to disperse propagules,
and (4) ability to vegetatively reproduce by root suckering, stump sprouts or epicormic stems [<a href="#54">54</a>].&nbsp;Pond pine readily sprouts after fire, both from root collar and stem,
and is one of the conifers most able to endure fire defoliation [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>]
because it also produces epicormic branches [<a href="#60">60</a>]. Other characteristics of pond pine that contribute to its fire resistance include:
medium-thick&nbsp; basal
bark; moderate-to-high and open crown; moderately open stands; and medium rooting habit
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].<br><br>

Many
southeastern habitats have fire regimes with frequent fire. Fires recurring at intervals of 20 to 40 years have long been recognized as an integral part of the ecology of pocosins dominated by pond pine [<a href="#87">87</a>].
The high incidence of fires in longleaf pine communities, which often contain pond pine, is related to their high flammability, a consequence of the volatile oils and resins in longleaf pine needles and wiregrass
that is common in the understory.  However, human fire suppression has reduced the high natural occurrence of fire in this habitat.  Noss [<a href="#55">55</a>] stated that an immediate priority for longleaf sites is to
reestablish the natural regime of summer fires.&nbsp;Wet pine forests, which include pond pine,
depend on fire for their continued
existence [<a href="#25">25</a>]. Pond pine can be found in wet savannahs in North Carolina that are dependent on fire to eliminate encroaching forests and to remove grass and sedge foliage
that casts a heavy shade and can lead to a loss of smaller grasses and
forbs which grow between pine clumps [<a href="#80">80</a>].

<p>  
Pond pine communities are wet and nutrient-poor and are most susceptible to fires during droughts that allow the organic soils to dry.
The large amount of
fuel produced by the
understory makes fires severe. However, all dominant species sprout readily and
the shrub layer grows to its former height in just a few years. In the wetter, shrub-dominated slash pine and pond pine wetlands,
presettlement
fire frequency was probably 10 to 30 years.  Frequency in these types depends on occurrence of drought conditions sufficient to increase the flammability of the understory to where it will burn readily.  Such fires are intense and usually burn all
aboveground vegetation, especially in pond pine woodlands [<a href="#25">25</a>].
Burning may be severe in both swamps and marshes during prolonged periods of low rainfall.  In
fresh-water marshes, in which pond pine occurs, fires cause little damage when surface water is present, but may destroy all the marsh dominants as well as the component animal life,
such as beaver and muskrat, during drought years when the water table is well below the marsh surface [<a href="#57">57</a>].</p>

Pond pine is well adapted to fire [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>] and is one of the conifers
most able to endure fire defoliation [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].&nbsp;Because of pond pine's
ability to resprout, mature trees are only killed by the most severe fires
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>]. An immediate effect of fire on pond pine is the opening of serotinous cones
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>]. Burning also may result in a considerable enrichment of most available nutrients [<a href="#87">87</a>] in pond pine dominated habitats.

The data of Wilbur and Christensen [<a href="#87">87</a>], suggest that pocosin peats are deficient in
nutrients, particularly phosphorus.  Burning resulted in considerable enrichment of most available nutrients, and some amelioration of the prefire phosphorus deficiency.
They believe these nutrient changes
are responsible in part for increased
postfire production. However, increased fertility following fire was short-lived, and by
the 2nd growing season concentrations of most nutrients were back to prefire levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>  Not only were mean concentrations of particular nutrients elevated following fire, but spatial variation in those concentrations was also increased.  This was particularly true for nitrogen and phosphorus.  Thus, high and low nutrient patches were created in an area characterized by uniformly low
prefire nutrient concentrations.  This redistribution of resources might lead to the creation of patches of high and low production within
a bog [<a href="#87">87</a>].

<a name="PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE">

<br />

Wildfire has been responsible for the rehabilitation of pond pine stands in the
past [<a href="#16">16</a>] because of pond pine's successful regeneration after the disturbance
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. Seedlings sprout from dormant buds near the root collar after being top-killed by a low intensity fire [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>], and mature trees resprout from buds along the bole, main
branches and root crowns [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>]. Pond pine also reproduces after fire by the opening of serotinous cones
and subsequent seed release [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>].

</p>

<p class="subframeText">
<span class="subframeName">
<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE">

<br />

Mature trees sprout vigorously from protected buds along the bole, main branches, and root
crowns [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>], and are only killed by severe fires [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>]. Repeated fire would favor pond pine over loblolly pine because of pond pine's ability to sprout vigorously [<a href="#42">42</a>]. However, one study suggests that the ability to resprout is generally restricted to seedling and saplings [<a href="#45">45</a>]. After a fire burned through a pine scrub on Cumberland Island in Georgia, tree mortality was very high (95-100%) in plots where pond pine was a strong dominant.  Pond pine seedlings found in the first 2
postburn seasonal samples did not survive [<a href="#18">18</a>].

<p> Heat generated by a ground fire is usually of
sufficient intensity to open the serotinous cones of pond pine [<a href="#6">6</a>]. Pond pine cones do not
characteristically remain closed for longer than 4 to 5 years [<a href="#79">79</a>], and observations suggest that
cones open rapidly on felled trees during
midday on clear summer days [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>] when the outside temperature may be sufficient to open the cones. Seeds up to 14 years old have been germinated [<a href="#83">83</a>]. Pond pine cones germinate best after a burn on soil that is moist.  This may be because the root system of pond pine is superficial and the seedlings many not be able to obtain enough water to survive in dry conditions [<a href="#6">6</a>].</p>

<p>  Fire removes competition, exposes the soil and causes the seed of
pond pine to fall. Volume of seed caught in traps averaged about 3,000 sound seed per acre per year for undisturbed and unburned seed tree stands.
From 2 uncut but burned stands
the average was 53,000 sound seed/acre over a 6-week period following the burn
[<a href="#16">16</a>].  After a fire on Cumberland Island, Georgia, pond pine, loblolly pine, and slash pine reseeded where the pine canopy was killed
[<a href="#9">9</a>].</p>

<p>  
Season of burning is largely determined by availability of ignition sources and seasonal variation in fuel flammability.  A major factor affecting flammability is seasonal variation in moisture.  Seasonal variation in the dead-to-live
ratio is also important in shrub bogs [<a href="#14">14</a>]. Low-severity winter fires are valuable in preparing favorable seedbeds for establishment of pine seedlings and in partially controlling
associated hardwoods [<a href="#43">43</a>]. Most wildfires in the pocosins occur during the early spring and before the evergreen vegetation has increased its moisture content through spring growth
[<a href="#44">44</a>].</p>

</p>

<p class="subframeText">
<span class="subframeName">
<a name="FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

The range of ecological processes and conditions that recurring fire initiates, terminates,
or continues in wet pine forests can not be duplicated by any other disturbance
[<a href="#25">25</a>]. In the absence of fire, adequate regeneration of pond
pine is not obtained [<a href="#6">6</a>]. Fire is usually considered to be most damaging to pond
pine in the pond pine ecosystems where it is infrequent and intense. Lowering of
the water table in pocosins will
&quot;undoubtedly&quot; increase the frequency of fire due to increased
frequency of dry periods [<a href="#13">13</a>].&nbsp;


<p> Fire exclusion is an unrealistic management
objective for sustaining ecological communities, such as those containing pond pine, that are adapted
to and dependent upon recurring fires to maintain balance. Prescribed burning
is a more reasonable management goal as it approximates natural processes
inherent to a fire region.&nbsp; Under natural conditions, frequent fires
maintain vegetation, recycle nutrients, and drive vegetation cycles
[<a href="#76">76</a>].&nbsp;However, because seedlings are either
killed outright or set back by fire during their early years, prescribed burning
is not recommended for most pine species until they are at least 9.8 to 13 feet
(3- 4 m) tall [<a href="#75">75</a>], and too frequent burning of pond pine at any age may eliminate the species from
an area altogether [<a href="#26">26</a>].

</p>
<p>
Prescribed fire appears to be a potentially valuable tool in the management of pond
pine by promoting seed fall from the serotinous cones and in preparing the
seedbed. Fires of sufficient intensity to achieve these results, however,
are usually difficult to control and tend to burn deeply into the organic
soil. The problem has become more acute in the past 10 years because of increased commercial importance of
pocosins as pulpwood and timber
processing areas [<a href="#85">85</a>]. Following harvest of mature pines, flatwoods sites
are often prepared for pine regeneration by use of prescribed fires. Objective of this burning is to consume as much surface litter and remaining
understory biomass as possible, creating a site easy to plant by machine and
removing potential competing vegetation. Burning is also often used in
established stands to reduce potential for hazardous fire in young stands
and to control disease and insect pests [<a href="#2">2</a>].&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Although recommendations for optimum season of burns of southeastern forests
are somewhat
contradictory, Streng, Glitzenstein, and Platt [<a href="#71">71</a>] concluded that growing
season burns do not reduce growth or survival of pines more than do dormant
season burns; therefore, growing season prescribed burns can be conducted without undue
fear of creating damaging fires.

</p>
<p>
In North Carolina pocosins, growth and vigor of pond
pine seedlings are much better on burned-logged areas than on burned-unlogged. It is speculated that there is less root and top competition for seedlings on
the burned-logged areas. Seedlings that germinate during the 1st, 2nd,
or 3rd years following logging and burning have the best chance of surviving
competition with the brush [<a href="#6">6</a>]. Although logging opened up the tree
canopy of a Coastal Plains pond pine forest, it did not significantly affect seedling establishment.
Rate of seedling establishment was extremely low on unburned sites regardless of logging
treatment [<a href="#66">66</a>].&nbsp;

</p>
<p>
Grazing of pond pine habitats without a fire disturbance may be beneficial to
pond pine establishment,
although grazing after a fire may reduce the number of pond pine
seedlings. The average number of new pond pine seedlings per acre that became established in grazed and ungrazed plots before and after fire disturbance in the southern Coastal Plains follows [<a href="#66">66</a>]:

Evidence indicates that both grazing and fire substantially influenced seedling establishment, although the effect of fire was of much greater magnitude than that of grazing.  On unburned areas grazing increased seedling establishment, but not enough for adequate
regeneration of pond pine.  Where grazing occurred before an intense burn, it tended to decrease the fire effect, but the interaction of grazing with burning was not apparent on a
low-severity burn [<a href="#66">66</a>].&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

 Disturbance of the surface litter by the trampling of cattle apparently increased
 chances for pond pine seed to reach an environment suitable for germination and growth.
 Accompanying reduction of competing herbage may also have been a contributing factor.
Fire was more effective, however, for providing a favorable seedbed.  Grazing contributed to the mortality of very small
 seedlings, but had little effect after they were 1 foot (0.3 m) tall. On the grazed plots mortality averages 13% higher than
 on unprotected plots for seedlings in the 1 to 6 inch (2.5-15.2 cm) height class, and 6% higher for the 7 to 12
 (18-30.5 cm) inch height class. The higher mortality under grazing is probably due largely to trampling rather than
 browsing.  Browsing damage was seldom encountered, but some trampling damage to small seedlings was observed, especially along cattle
trails [<a href="#66">66</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<p>

The fires in this study killed practically all seedlings in the plots affected.  Although it
is generally accepted that pond pine
usually resprouts after being burned, small seedlings may not always have this ability. On plots
that were completely burned over, all seedlings were
killed. This may be due to the severity of the fire. These plots had burned 4 years earlier also, so most of the seedlings were less than 2 feet tall and not more than 4 years old.  As a result of cattle trails and limited fuels, some grazed plots did not burn completely, and on those about
33% of the seedlings survived with some damage to the tips
[<a href="#66">66</a>].</p>

Pond pine (<i>Pinus serotina</i>) was the dominant overstory tree on the burn, averaging 1,250 stems/acre (3,100/ha).  About 64%
of the forested area was well-stocked with 13-year-old pond pine that regenerated after a burn 14 years earlier.  Another 13%
contained poorly or medium-stocked, 13-year-old pond pine.  The remainder was comprised of reproduced pond pine from a burn
5 years earlier and older trees that survived the burn 14 years previous.  In addition, 5,000 acres (2,025 ha) of marsh, 5,000 acres (2,025 ha) of low, open pocosin, and 1,200 acres (490 ha) of species other than pond pine also burned.
The 13-year-old pond pine averaged 16 feet (4.9 m) in height and 2.9 inches (7.4 cm)
dbh. Its principal associates were redbay (<i>Persea borbonia</i>) and sweetbay (<i>Magnolia virginiana</i>), which together averaged 13 feet (4 m) in height, 1.6 inches (4.1 cm)
dbh, and 220 stems/acre (550/ha). The weight, height, and blowup potential for
5 of the more common fuel types burned in this fire follow.

Analysis of this fire does not describe the phenological state of pond pine at time of
disturbance.  According to other studies of pond pine seasonal development in North Carolina, it is likely that it was actively growing and had just begun to flower [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].

<br />

Dare County, where this fire occurred, is a sparsely populated peninsula comprised primarily of pocosins and marshland.
Elevation of this site is 10 feet (3 m) above mean sea level. Most of the area is managed for forest production. A network of drainage canals and woods roads
is the only interruption in an otherwise unbroken expanse of fuel. At the time of the fire, the conditions were low humidity (below 60
%),&nbsp;
winds 15 to 20 mph (7 to 9 m/sec.), and full sunshine. The temperature reached 70
<sup>o</sup>F (21 <sup>o</sup>C) on the day the fire began.

<br />

The 29,300-acre (11,860-ha) Air Force Bomb Range fire was a dangerously explosive, blowup fire.
The fire exhibited several blowup features including
high-density, short-distance spotting, a well-developed convection column, and rates of spread exceeding 2
mph (2.2 m/sec.) during a 4 hour period with a maximum of almost 5 mph (2.2 m/sec.) during one 4 mile (6.4 km) run. The fire traveled 14 miles (22.5 km) prior to the passage of a cold front, then changed direction, and ran an additional 6 miles (9.7 km) as a
postcold-frontal fire. The fire crowned through more than 15,000 acres (6,070 ha) of pond pine during a 20 hour
period and eventually burned 29,300 acres (11,860 ha) of timber and nonforested watershed.

Pond pine typically sprouts readily from both the root
crown and bole, and such sprouting was expected to occur after the Air Force Bomb Range fire. Defoliation by wet-season fires generally has little effect on the survival of pond pine and causes only a temporary reduction in height and diameter growth. However, observations
1 year after the fire did not follow expectations. Although no numbers were recorded, it was noted that a much lower percentage of trees sprouted from the bole than had been expected. The lack of bole sprouts is
1 more indicator of the high intensities and severities associated with this fire. However, a high proportion of trees sprouted profusely from the root collar. The degree of basal sprouting suggests that a well-stocked stand of pond pine will again occupy the burned area, but the loss of 13 years' growth must be considered more than a temporary setback in a 50-year
rotation.  </p>

When this study was completed in 1973, researchers believed that further work was needed to 
adapt the National Fire Danger Rating System to this area.
Most federal land managers in the area now
burn pocosins periodically to perpetuate pocosin communities and reduce fuel loads.
Prescriptions are designed to meet objectives without igniting the organic soil [<a href="#77">77</a>].
