<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name for desert gooseberry is Ribes
velutinum Greene [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  It is a memeber of the gooseberry family
(Grossulariaceae).  Kartesz [<a href="#30">30</a>] recognizes the following two varieties:

R. v. var. goodingii (M. E. Peck) C. L. Hitchc. (Gooding's gooseberry)
R. v. var. velutinum Greene (desert gooseberry)

A third variety of desert gooseberry may be described based on specimens
collected in the Salmon River Canyon, near the mouth of Panther Creek,
Idaho [<a href="#29">29</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Desert gooseberry occurs in sagebrush and mountain brush communities,
coniferous forests, and woodlands in the Great Basin and adjacent
mountains.

In addition to the plant associations and cover types listed in
preceding slots, desert gooseberry occurs in the desert gooseberry/basin
wildrye (Leymus cinereus) community along the northern periphery of Lava
Beds National Monument, California [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Species commonly associated with desert gooseberry but not previously
mentioned include California red fir (Abies magnifica), white fir (A.
concolor), mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), sugar pine (Pinus
lambertiana), whitebark pine (P. albicaulis) Jeffrey pine (P. jeffreyi),
Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), singleleaf pinyon (Pinus
monophylla), serviceberry (Amelanchier spp.), spiny hopsage (Grayia
spinosa), cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus
spp.), broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), wax currant (Ribes
cereum), bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides), western
needlegrass (Stipa occidentalis), and horsebrush (Tetradymia spp.)
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Desert gooseberry is fair to poor forage for livestock.  Deer,
chipmunks, scrub jays, and magpies consume its fruit [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Rodents burrow at the base of desert gooseberry; the roots and stems of
desert gooseberry help stabilize the walls of their tunnels [<a href="#32">32</a>].

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Gooseberries (Ribes spp.) are used for making jam, jelly, and pie [<a href="#15">15</a>].
Some western Indian tribes used gooseberries for making pemmican [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Desert gooseberry is an alternate host for white pine blister rust
(Cronartium ribicola) which infests five-needled pines.  Tree mortality
from white pine blister rust is generally less in dry than in moist
climates [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Because of their association with the rust, Ribes spp.
have been targets of various eradication efforts; however, these efforts
have not been successful in the western states [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ribes velutinum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Desert gooseberry is a native, deciduous, nonrhizomatous [<a href="#29">29</a>] shrub
growing from 3.3 to 6.6 feet (1-2 m) tall [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Its stout, rigid
branches are usually pubescent.  The orbicular, three- to five-lobed
leaves are 0.2 to 0.8 inch (0.5-2 cm) long and at least as wide [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].
Racemes are three- to five-flowered.  Hirsute berries are 0.2 to 0.32
inch (0.5-0.8 cm) in diameter [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Desert gooseberry reproduces by seed and sprouts from the root crown
following disturbance or fire [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].

Ribes spp. generally begin fruiting after 3 years [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Many seeds fall
beneath the parent plant; they are also dispersed by birds and animals.
Fallen seeds may remain viable in the soil and duff for many years
[<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  Seed germination is generally enhanced by scarification and
mineral soil [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].

The burrowing activity of rodents creates soil mounds at the base of
desert gooseberry plants.  Aerial stems that become buried by the mounds
continue to grow and develop roots at stem nodes [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Desert gooseberry generally occurs on dry, rocky foothills, mountain
slopes, or ridges in coarse, loamy soil [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>] at elevations ranging
from 2,310 to 8,250 feet (700-2,500 m) [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  At Lava Beds National
Monument, desert gooseberry grows on basalt outcrops and slopes of
cinder cones [<a href="#4">4</a>].  In singleleaf pinyon-Utah juniper (Juniperus
osteosperma) woodlands of Nevada and California, desert gooseberry
occurred with significantly (p<.05) greater frequency on north and east
slopes than south and west aspects [<a href="#10">10</a>].

In the White Pine Mountains of White Pine County, Nevada, desert
gooseberry is near its southern distribution.  Climate is semiarid with
a mean annual precipitation of 9.6 inches (240 mm).  Most precipitation
falls in the form of snow in early spring and short-duration
thunderstorms during summer.  The mean annual temperature is 44 degrees
Fahrenheit (6.8 deg C).  The frost-free period is rarely greater than
100 days [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Desert gooseberry is somewhat shade tolerant.  It sometimes grows under
forest canopy, but it occurs most often and grows most vigorously on
open sites.  In the Shoshone Range of western Nevada, desert gooseberry
occurred as an understory species in curlleaf mountain mahogany
(Cercocarpus ledifolius) communities where canopy cover approached 100
percent [<a href="#17">17</a>].  At Lava Beds National Monument, desert gooseberry was a
dominant overstory shrub on basalt outcrops [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Desert gooseberry can be found in all successional stages of
pinyon-juniper woodlands.  In Nevada and California, it occurred burned
and unburned sites with 95 percent constancy.  Percent frequency of
desert gooseberry in various seral stages was as follows [<a href="#10">10</a>]:

seral stage     early     early-mid     mid     mid-late     late

postfire year     1          4-8       15-17      22-60    unburned

% frequency       25          72        48          59        56

Median percent cover of desert gooseberry was less than 20 percent.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
The specific phenology of desert gooseberry was not described in the
literature.  Ribes spp. generally flower from April to June.  The fruit
of Ribes spp. generally ripens June to September [<a href="#15">15</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ribes velutinum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Severe fire that consumes the entire organic mantle probably kills
desert gooseberry and may destroy soil-stored seeds [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Desert
gooseberry survives some fires by sprouting from the root crown
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Desert gooseberry is probably favored by low- to
moderate-severity fire because germination of soil-stored seed is
generally enhanced by scarification in Ribes spp. [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].

In pinyon-juniper woodlands, where desert gooseberry often occurs,
wildfire was a major force in maintaining understory species during
presettlement times.  Wildfires occurred every 10 to 90 years [<a href="#36">36</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ribes velutinum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire top-kills or kills desert gooseberry.

In White Pine County, Nevada, desert gooseberry was present in trace
amounts before prescribed burning in the spring, but it was not present
after burning in postfire years 1 and 2.  Fire conditions were not
described [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Desert gooseberry sprouts from the root crown after low- to
moderate-severity fire and seedlings may establish after fire.

Near Reno, Nevada, desert gooseberry has been described as a "vigorous"
sprouter [<a href="#31">31</a>].  A summer wildfire burned a big sagebrush (Artemisia
tridentata)/Thurber needlegrass (Stipa thurberiana) community.  In
postfire year 1 desert gooseberry occurred at a density of 0.06 to 0.08
plants per square meter; "virtually all" plants survived the fire and
sprouted.  No desert gooseberry seedlings established the first year
[<a href="#31">31</a>].  In Nevada and California, desert gooseberry occurred on 1- to
60-year old burned sites.  The origin of desert gooseberry (seedlings
or sprouts) on these sites was not specifically mentioned but the
authors described desert gooseberry as a "root-sprouting shrub" [<a href="#10">10</a>].

At Lava Beds National Monument, a July 1973 wildfire burned through a
bunchgrass community containing a small island of trees and shrubs,
including desert gooseberry.  In 1977, a July prescribed fire was
conducted in a similar community that also included desert gooseberry.
The wildfire followed a month with no rain and low humidity.  The
prescribed fire followed a month with high rainfall (2.04 inches [51
mm]).  Fire conditions for both fires were as follows [<a href="#24">24</a>]:

                          1973 wildfire         1977 prescribed fire

Fire severities were not described.  In postfire year 1, average desert
gooseberry frequency was less than 1 percent for all treatements
(wildfire, prescribed burn, and controls).  The cover, average height,
and percent of dead branches in individual desert gooseberry crowns were
slightly less on the wildfire site in postfire year 1 than on adjacent,
unburned sites.  Average values for desert gooseberry follow; standard
deviations are in parentheses:

                        Percent cover       Height        Percent dead 
                                             (cm)            crown

1973 wildfire             0.2 (0.6)       81.3 (19.3)      19.3 (16.8)
unburned control          0.4 (1.1)      118.8 (26.6)       5.5 (38.5)

1977 prescribed fire      0.1 (0.8)       75.0 (21.2)      89.5 (13.4)


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
At Silver Knoll, north of Reno, Nevada, mounds are formed at the base of
desert gooseberry by the burrowing activity of rodents.  The mounds may
protect the sprouting root crowns of desert gooseberry, making them
difficult to reduce with fire.  One year after a fire, desert gooseberry
plants were sprouting in whorls from burned stems even though they had
been completely top-killed by fire [<a href="#32">32</a>].

In Nevada and California, desert gooseberry occurred on 1- to 60-year
old burned and unburned sites.  Eight out of 21 burns had been seeded
with grasses, including standard crested wheatgrass (Agropyron
desertorum), intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium), and
smooth brome (Bromus ineris).  Desert gooseberry showed no preference
for seeded or nonseeded sites [<a href="#10">10</a>].
