<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name for yellow sedge is Carex
pensylvanica Lam. [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Based on morphological, cytological, ecological, and geographical
differentiation, Crinn and Ball [<a href="#11">11</a>] divided the Carex pensylvanica
complex into two eastern species, Carex lucorum Willdenow ex Link and
Carex pensylvanica Lamarck, and one western species with two subspecies,
Carex inops Bailey subsp. inops and Carex inops Bailey subsp.
heliophila (Mack).

Yellow sedge hybridizes with Carex communis Bailey and Carex umbellata
Sckuhr [<a href="#16">16</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Yellow sedge is found in upland plains habitats usually dominated by
grasses.  Consequently, it is of secondary importance in those habitats
[<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].

It is dominant in meadows of the Great Lakes region and common in forest
understories [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].

In New England, yellow sedge is often dominant in hardwood forest
understories [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Yellow sedge provides cover for migratory waterfowl and sandhill cranes.
Ducks use yellow sedge for nesting material and some cover [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Yellow
sedge also provides nesting habitat, cover, and dancing grounds for
sharptail grouse and prairie chickens [<a href="#20">20</a>].

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
In Wisconsin, yellow sedge serves as nesting cover for prairie chicken,
sharptail grouse, and mallards.  Migratory waterfowl and sandhill cranes
also use yellow sedge habitat for cover [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Yellow sedge commonly establishes on disturbed sites through vigorous
rhizome production.  Yellow sedge invades burned and/or clearcut sites,
forming pure stands [<a href="#1">1</a>].  


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Yellow sedge increases in response to grazing [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Yellow sedge is a strong competitor and slows invasion of trees and
shrubs [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Deep plowing will break up mats of yellow sedge without
killing it, and assist tree seedling establishment and growth [<a href="#4">4</a>].

To reestablish native prairie vegetation and eliminate weedy species
from the Hempstead Plains of New York, mowing, controlled burning, and
chemical means are being used [<a href="#27">27</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carex pensylvanica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Yellow sedge is a native, low-growing, grasslike rhizomatous plant
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  The long and narrow leaves are 4 to 18 inches (10-45 cm) in
length, approximately the same height as the stems.  There are usually
two to four cauline leaves [<a href="#11">11</a>].  The rhizomes are cordlike and variable
in length [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].  They are usually found in the top 4 to 5 inches
(10-13 cm) of soil [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Yellow sedge occurs in clustered, resilient, persistent tufts [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].
It is characteristically found in extensive, pure stands [<a href="#8">8</a>].
  


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Yellow sedge regenerates primarily by vegetative means [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Its long
rhizomes allow it to spread out and colonize nearby open areas.  The
short rhizomes are responsible for tuft or mat formation [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Yellow sedge is wind pollinated and reproduces by seed; however,
seedlings are rare [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Yellow sedge is common in forest understories and in open meadows
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  The topography is generally flat or gently rolling with slopes
rarely exceeding 10 percent [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].

Yellow sedge occurs on well-drained sites, with soils ranging from clay,
silty clay loam, sandy loams, to alluvial deposits [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Some
soil types are slightly acidic, relatively infertile, and may be of
coarse or fine texture [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

Yellow sedge occurs in a wide range of climates.  It does best in dry
deciduous forests and grasslands or other dry, open areas [<a href="#3">3</a>].  It is
also relatively shade tolerant [<a href="#11">11</a>].  In the Appalachian Mountains
average annual precipitation is 54 inches (134 cm), but precipitation in
the savannas and prairies in the Midwest is lower [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

Below is a listing of elevations at which yellow sedge occurs
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>]:
                      feet                  meters
Connecticut         4,300-7,000             1,590-2,593
New York              900-1,700               274 - 518
North Dakota        2,100-2,300               630 - 690
Michigan              910-1,205               275 - 365
West Virginia       1,100-1,200               330 - 690

Yellow sedge is associated with blueberries (Vaccinium spp.) and
huckleberries (Gaylussacia spp.) in many habitats [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  In prairies
of the Midwest and East, common associates are big and little bluestem
(Andropogon gerardii var. gerardii and Schizachyrium scoparium),
Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis), western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum
smithii), blue grama grass (Bouteloua gracilis), and threadleaf sedge
(Carex filifolia) [<a href="#38">38</a>].  In the Lake and New England states, it is
dominant in forest understory, and associated with jack pine (Pinus
banksiana), oaks (Quercus spp.), pines (Pinus spp.), blueberries and
huckleberries (Vaccinium spp. and Gaylussacia spp.), sugar maple (Acer
saccarum), and basswood (Tilia americana) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative seral species

Yellow sedge is found in seral and climax communities.  It is usually
dominant in early seral stages, and surrounding shrubs and trees are
slow to invade [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Yellow sedge is a strong competitor in jack pine community types.
Yellow sedge increases on unburned, clearcut sites.  This increase
results in meadow dominance.  These carex meadows are labeled
"regressive succession" because their apparent stability may inhibit
further succession.  This is unique to lower north Michigan [<a href="#1">1</a>].

The Big Woods of Minnesota appear to be expanding at the expense of the
prairie.  This expansion can be controlled by implementing prescribed
fires [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Xeric oak forests established from logging and repeated burning of
presettlement pine in Michigan appear to be experiencing regressive
succession.  This is caused by failure of clearcutting and other
silvicultural methods to regenerate the oak forest stands.  The
regressive succession is toward pine or savannalike communities
dominated by yellow sedge [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Yellow sedge appears to be more
detrimental to black oak reproduction than to white oak [<a href="#30">30</a>].

In the literature, there was no indication or implication that yellow
sedge was a problem or needed to be controlled.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Yellow sedge is a cool-season plant, and it makes one of the earliest
spring appearances of the Carices [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Growth begins in shoots
formed the previous autumn and early winter.  Yellow sedge leaves are
apparently functional during the winter, summer, and fall [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].

Yellow sedge flowers between mid-April and mid-May in southern Ontario
and in Iowa [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  On the prairies, flowers of yellow sedge are
easily seen because the other grasses have not yet started to grow [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Maximum growth occurs during the cool, early part of the growing season
before other prairie grasses begin growth.  Yellow sedge completes its
life cycle before the onset of summer drought [<a href="#34">34</a>].  It is possible that
early flowering is an adaption to light requirements [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Shoots emerge in the fall [<a href="#5">5</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carex pensylvanica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fires typically top-kill yellow sedge.  In the plains, the heat of
combustion is confined entirely to the surface, thus not damaging the
rhizomes [<a href="#21">21</a>].  However, yellow sedge does not do well after hot fires
because its roots and rhizomes do not penetrate deep into the soil [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Yellow sedge exploits fire-generated gaps in the litter layer through
aggressive clonal propagation [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Recovery is usually within 1 or 2
years [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Seed germination also occurs but is rare.  There is no
information regarding fire stimulation of seed germination.

In lower north Michigan, yellow sedge is less dominant on burned sites
than on clearcut sites.  Fire does not appear to result in "regressive
succession" (See Successional Status slot) [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Some sources report
yellow sedge as a fire persister [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Others report yellow sedge as a
fire decreaser or increaser [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
The information regarding postfire response of yellow sedge is
contradictory.  In oak woods, increases in yellow sedge following
burning have been reported; these increases may have been related to an
increase in soil pH [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Yellow sedge is abundant following
prescribed fires where trees and shrubs have failed to sprout [<a href="#10">10</a>].  In
central Minnesota, nominal decreases in yellow sedge were reported [<a href="#22">22</a>].
At a site in North dakota, there were no significant increases or
decreases in comparison to unburned stands [<a href="#15">15</a>].
 


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In restoration of prairie vegetation, burning every 3 to 5 years
discourages woody vegetation and encourages grasses and forbs, including
yellow sedge.  Mid to late summer fires appear to benefit cool season
graminoids the most.  Spring fires do not benefit yellow sedge and can
be more harmful to wildlife and more explosive than summer fires [<a href="#7">7</a>].
