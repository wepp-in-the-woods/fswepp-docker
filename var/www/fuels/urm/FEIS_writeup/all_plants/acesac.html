<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of sugar maple is Acer saccharum
Marsh.  Sugar maple is highly variable genetically and taxonomic
controversy abounds.  Some taxonomists recognize two to six varieties,
but others recognize these entities as forms or subspecies [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].
Several ecotypes or races, each exhibiting clinal variation, have also
been delineated [<a href="#30">30</a>].

Florida maple (A. barbatum), chalk maple (A. leucoderme), and black
maple (A. nigrum) hybridize and intergrade with sugar maple and are
often included in the sugar maple complex [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  Some authorities
recognize these taxa as subspecies of sugar maple [<a href="#46">46</a>], but most
delineate them as discrete species.  Sugar maple hybridizes with red
maple (A. rubrum) in the field, and with bigleaf maple (A. macrophyllum)
under laboratory conditions [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Acer X senecaense Slavin is a hybrid
derived from an A. leucoderme x sugar maple cross [<a href="#39">39</a>].  A. skutchii is
closely related to sugar maple and is treated as a subspecies by some
taxonomists [<a href="#46">46</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Sugar maple grows in a wide variety of plant communities throughout
eastern North America.  It is a dominant or codominant in many northern
hardwood and mixed mesophytic communities.  Common codominants include
beech (Fagus grandifolia), birch (Betula spp.), and American basswood
(Tilia americana).  Sugar maple has been listed as a dominant or
indicator in the following community type (cts), ecosystem associations
(eas), dominance types (dts), and plant association (pas)

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Acer saccharum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Sugar maple wood is tough, durable, hard, heavy, and strong [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  It
is well suited for many uses and is commonly used to make furniture,
paneling, flooring, and veneer [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  It is also used for gunstocks,
tool handles, plywood dies, cutting blocks, woodenware, novelty
products, sporting goods, bowling pins, and musical instruments
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Sugar maple is commonly browsed by white-tailed deer, moose, and
snowshoe hare [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].  In Nova Scotia and New Brunswick,
white-tailed deer and snowshoe hare use is heaviest during the winter
[<a href="#71">71</a>].  The red squirrel, gray squirrel, and flying squirrels feed on the
seeds, buds, twigs, and leaves of sugar maple [<a href="#30">30</a>].  The porcupine
consumes the bark and can, in some instances, girdle the upper stem
[<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Sugar maple is at least somewhat palatable to deer in most areas.
Samaras are palatable to squirrels and many other small mammals.


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The nutrient content of sugar maple browse varies by plant part and by
phenological development [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Starch content is highest in early fall
and lowest in winter.  Sugar maple leaves average 1.81 percent calcium,
0.25 percent magnesium, 0.75 percent potassium, 0.11 percent phosphorus,
0.67 percent nitrogen, and 11.85 percent ash by dry weight [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Unlike
many plants, the leaves of sugar maple typically contain relatively high
levels of calcium, magnesium, and potassium when they are shed in autumn
[<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Numerous species of songbirds nest in sugar maple.  Cavity nesters such
as the black-capped chickadee excavate nest cavities or utilize
preexisting cavities [<a href="#33">33</a>].  The common flicker, pileated woodpecker, and
screech owl also nest in maples [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Sugar maple has potential value for rehabilitation of disturbed sites.
It can be propagated by seed, which averages 7,000 per pound (15,400/kg)
[<a href="#30">30</a>].  Early spring plantings generally produce the best results [<a href="#30">30</a>].
Sugar maple can also be propagated vegetatively by budding, grafting,
air-layering, or by rooting stem cuttings [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Sugar maple is the primary source of maple sugar and syrup [<a href="#30">30</a>].  The
maple syrup industry is important throughout much of eastern North
America and accounted for more than 100 million dollars in trade during
1989 [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Maple sugar and syrup were used as trade items by many
Native American peoples [<a href="#75">75</a>].  Sugar maple is an attractive shade tree
and is widely planted as an ornamental [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  It is sometimes used in
shelterbelt plantings [<a href="#54">54</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Damage:  Sugar maple is susceptible to wind damage and to damage caused
by ice storms and winter freezes [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  De-icing salts often damage
sugar maples which grow along roadways.  Individuals within the
overstory are susceptible to air pollutants such as sulfur oxides,
nitrogen oxides, chlorides, and fluorides [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Sugar maple is
susceptible to logging injuries which frequently permit the entrance of
decay [<a href="#30">30</a>].

Insects/disease:  Sugar maple is host to numerous insects including bud
miners, aphids, borers, and defoliators such as the gypsy moth, tent
caterpillar, linden looper, and cankerworms [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  Cankers, root rot
(Armillaria spp.), and wilt also affect sugar maple.  Since the early
1900's, this species has been periodically affected by a condition known
as maple decline [<a href="#52">52</a>].  Increases in die-back have been observed in many
parts of the Northeast since 1982 [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Causes of maple decline are
unknown, but acid rain and other pollutants are possible contributors
[<a href="#74">74</a>].  Trees already weakened by pollutants may be increasingly
susceptible to root rot and tent caterpillar infestations [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Maple
decline may be accentuated by a series of unusual climatic events; large
diameter trees are most susceptible [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Silviculture:  Past exploitation has resulted in the degradation of many
sugar maple stands [<a href="#19">19</a>].  However, in some areas, high-grading of oaks,
hickories, and walnuts, has actually produced a proportional increase in
sugar maple [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Shelterwood harvests and progressive strip cut
methods are often applied to mixed hardwood stands which include maple
[<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  For best growth of sugar maple, the residual canopy left after
the first shelterwood cut should admit approximately 40 percent light
[<a href="#31">31</a>].  A two-cut shelterwood system "cannot guarantee natural
regeneration" in stands which are less than 40 years in age.

Chemical control:  In general, sugar maple is resistant to foliar
herbicides [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Studies indicate that Tordon may be effective in
controlling sugar maple [<a href="#25">25</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Acer saccharum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sugar maple is a deciduous tree which reaches 90 to 120 feet (27-37 m)
in height and 30 to 36 inches (76-91 cm) in d.b.h. [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  Extremely
large specimens have reached more than 130 feet (40 m) in height and
more than 5 feet (1.5 m) in d.b.h. [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Sugar maple is long-lived and
plants can survive for 300 to 400 years [<a href="#30">30</a>].  The bark is light gray to
gray-brown and becomes deeply furrowed and rough with age [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Twigs
are a shiny, reddish-brown [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Sugar maple is relatively deep-rooted,
with many extensively-branched laterals [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].

Sugar maple is monoecious or dioecious [<a href="#68">68</a>].  Small, greenish-yellow
flowers are borne in tassellike clusters or racemes [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  Each
drooping cluster contains 8 to 14 flowers [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  Fruit is a paired,
papery-winged samara which averages 1 inch (2.5 cm) in length [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>

   Burned or Clipped State:  Chamaephyte
   Burned or Clipped State:  Hemicryptophyte
   Burned or Clipped State:  Cryptophyte (geophyte)


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sugar maple reproduces through seed and by vegetative means.  

Seed:  Sugar maple possesses extremely effective outbreeding mechanisms
[<a href="#70">70</a>], and flowers are readily wind pollinated [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Minimum
seed-bearing age is 30 to 40 years [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  Forty- to sixty-year-old
trees with 8-inch (20 cm) d.b.h. produce light crops, whereas 70- to
100-year-old trees with d.b.h. of 10 to 14 inches (25-36 cm) produce
moderate seed crops [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Large fluctuations in annual seed crops have
been reported [<a href="#70">70</a>].  Seed production is partly dependent on genetic
factors, and some trees produce an abundance of flowers nearly every
year [<a href="#42">42</a>].  In north-central Wisconsin, good or better crops are
produced at 1- to 4-year intervals [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Elsewhere in the United
States, good crops occur at 2- to 5-year intervals, and in Canada, at 3-
to 7-year intervals [<a href="#30">30</a>].  In good crop years, 264 seeds per meter
square may be produced [<a href="#38">38</a>].

Seed dispersal:  Seed is primarily dispersed by wind [<a href="#54">54</a>], which can
carry the relatively large seeds for up to 330 feet (100 m) [<a href="#30">30</a>].
However, most seeds do not travel more than 49 feet (15 m) from the
forest edge [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Some sugar maple seed may also be dispersed by water
[<a href="#54">54</a>].

Seed banking:  Sugar maple seed can remain viable for up to 5 years when
properly stored [<a href="#30">30</a>].  However, few seeds persist in the seed bank for
more than 1 year [<a href="#38">38</a>], and sugar maple is not considered an important
seed banker [<a href="#51">51</a>].

Seedling establishment:  Seedling recruitment varies annually; periodic
high seedling densities may function as a predator avoidance mechanism
[<a href="#70">70</a>].  In favorable years seedling recruitment may reach 18.7 seedlings
per meter square, but in poor years no seedling recruitment occurs [<a href="#38">38</a>].
Seedlings can survive for long periods when suppressed beneath a forest
canopy and respond quickly to release.  Seedlings in very dense young
stands may survive for only 5 years, but in stands where trees average
10 inches (25 cm) or more in d.b.h., seedlings commonly persist for many
years.  Initial seedling growth is slow [<a href="#30">30</a>], and mortality is often
high [<a href="#70">70</a>].

Vegetative regeneration:  Sugar maple is a prolific sprouter in the
northern part of its range, but at the southern edge of its range, it
sprouts less vigorously than associated hardwoods [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Stump-sprouting
and root-sprouting are moderately common [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Layering occasionally
occurs [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sugar maple most commonly occurs in rich, mesic woods but also grows in
drier upland woods [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  It grows in level areas or in coves and
other sheltered locations on adjacent lower slopes [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Sugar
maple is often associated with stream terraces, streambanks, valleys,
canyons, ravines, and wooded natural levees [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  It is
occasionally found on dry rocky hillsides [<a href="#32">32</a>].  At the western edge of
its range, sugar maple grows as scattered canopy seed trees or as
abundant seedlings in protected ravines and relatively mesic
north-facing slopes [<a href="#77">77</a>].

Sugar maple is a major species in seven SAF cover types and is common in
17 others [<a href="#30">30</a>].  It is a prominent component of mesic hardwood forests,
Great Lakes pine forests, spruce-fir forests, and northern hardwood
forests [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].  Sugar maple forms pure stands but also grows mixed
with other hardwoods and scattered conifers [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Common associates
include American basswood, yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), black
cherry (Prunus serotina), red spruce (Picea rubens), white spruce (P.
glauca), beech, eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), eastern hemlock
(Tsuga canadensis), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), white oak (Q.
alba), and yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulifera) [<a href="#30">30</a>].

Understory associates:  Understory associates of sugar maple are both
varied and numerous.  Common shrub associates include beaked hazel
(Corylus cornuta), Atlantic leatherwood (Dirca palustris), redberry
elder (Sambucus pubens), alternate-leaf dogwood (Cornus alternifolia),
dwarf bush-honeysuckle (Diervilla lonicera), Canada yew (Taxus
canadensis), red raspberry (Rubus idaeus), and blackberries (Rubus
spp.).  Springbeauty (Claytonia caroliniana), large-flowered trillium
(Trillium grandiflorum), anemone (Anemone spp.) marsh blue violet (Viola
cucullata), downy yellow violet (V. pubescens), Solomons-seal
(Polygonatum pubescens), false Solomons-seal (Smilacina stellata), sweet
cicely (Osmorhiza spp.), adderstongue (Ophioglossom vulgatum),
jack-in-thepulpit (Arisaema atrorubens), clubmosses (Lycopodium spp.),
and largeleaf aster (Aster macrophyllus) [<a href="#30">30</a>].

Soils:  Sugar maple can grow on a wide variety of soils [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>], but
typically grows best on deep, moist, fertile, well-drained soils [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].
It grows on sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, silty loam, and loam [<a href="#30">30</a>].
Sugar maple is commonly associated with alluvial or calcareous soils
[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>] but also grows on stabilized dunes [<a href="#75">75</a>].  This tree is
intolerant of flooded soils [<a href="#3">3</a>] and generally grows poorly on dry,
shallow soils [<a href="#30">30</a>].  In parts of New England, sugar maple commonly grows
on soils rich in organics [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Sugar maple occurs on strongly acidic
(pH=3.7) to slightly alkaline (pH=7.3) soils but grows best where soil
pH ranges from 5.5 to 7.3.  Soils are derived from a variety of parent
materials including shale, limestone, and sandstone [<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].

Elevation:  In the southern and southwestern portions of its range,
sugar maple generally grows at intermediate elevations [<a href="#30">30</a>].
Generalized elevational ranges by geographic location are as follows
[<a href="#30">30</a>]:

Location                Elevation

s Appalachian Mtns.     3,000 to 5,500 feet (910-1,680 m)
Lake States             up to 1,600 feet (490 m)
n New England           up to 2,500 feet (760 m)
New York                up to 2,500 feet (760 m)


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Sugar maple is very tolerant of shade and can persist for long periods
beneath a dense forest canopy [<a href="#30">30</a>].  It is noted for its ability to
quickly occupy gaps created in the forest canopy [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].  A bank of
abundant seedlings reamins suppressed until gaps are created by windfall
or other disturbances [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Seedlings and saplings typically respond
vigorously and rapidly to release and can overtop competitors such as
northern red oak.  Openings or gaps in the canopy allow more nutrients,
light, and water to become available [<a href="#37">37</a>].  In many areas, sugar maple
is a dominant species in gaps created by dying American elms [<a href="#56">56</a>].

Sugar maple is generally regarded as a late seral or climax species in
many eastern deciduous forests [<a href="#57">57</a>].  However, as Parker and Sherwood
[<a href="#58">58</a>] note, the "long-term dynamics of eastern deciduous forests are not
well understood."  Throughout much of the Upper Midwest, sugar maple
codominates climax stands with American basswood, or yellow birch
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  In the absence of disturbance, forests composed of jack
pine, eastern white pine, eastern hemlock, yellow birch, or red pine are
replaced by sugar maple and American basswood [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].  However, it
should be noted that disturbances, particularly fire, were common in
eastern deciduous forests in presettlement times.  In some locations,
succession to sugar maple-American basswood stands may have taken as
long as 650 years [<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Growth initiation of sugar maple varies geographically [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Flower
buds generally begin to swell prior to the development of vegetative
buds and generally emerge 1 to 2 weeks before the leaves appear [<a href="#30">30</a>].
Male and female flowers mature at slightly different rates, which
promotes cross-pollination [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Fruit ripens approximately 12 to 16
weeks after the flowers appear [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].  Fruit begins to fall
approximately 2 weeks after ripening [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Flowering and fruiting dates

Leaves turn yellow to orange or deep red in the fall [<a href="#6">6</a>] and generally
drop just after seeds have fallen [<a href="#30">30</a>].  At the southern edge of the
species' range, dead brown leaves tend to remain on the trees through
much of the winter [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Trees from the northern portion of the
species' range become dormant earlier than do those from the South [<a href="#42">42</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Acer saccharum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Sugar maple typically increases in the absence of fire [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Seedlings
occasionally sprout, but postfire establishment occurs primarily through
an abundance of wind-dispersed seed.

Central States:  Fire has played an important role in deciduous forests
of the central and eastern United States [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>].  Fire suppression has
favored sugar maple and other northern hardwood species, while
fire-tolerant species such as white oak, northern red oak, and Shumard
oak (Quercus shumardii) have experienced declines [<a href="#55">55</a>].  Dramatic
increases in sugar maple during the past 48 years in central hardwood
forests have been attributed to fire suppression [<a href="#65">65</a>].  Sugar maple was
formerly nearly absent in areas of central Missouri which bordered the
fire-prone prairies [<a href="#55">55</a>].  Since settlement times, it has increased as
mean fire intervals have declined.

The Southeast:  Fire was a major influence in presettlement forests of
the Southeast [<a href="#73">73</a>].  Increased fire suppression in this region has also
favored shade-tolerant hardwoods, such as sugar maple, and has resulted
in a decrease in oaks [<a href="#73">73</a>].

Northeast:  Mean fire intervals are typically long in most northern
hardwood forests.  In New England, fire is a less important disturbance
agent than windthrow or insect infestations [<a href="#22">22</a>].  In northern hardwood
stands in Maine and New Hampshire, mean fire intervals in presettlement
forests ranged from 230 to 4,970 years [<a href="#22">22</a>].  In New Brunswick, fire
rotations have been estimated at 625 years in both sugar maple-yellow
birch-fir and sugar maple-eastern hemlock-pine forests [<a href="#22">22</a>].  In
hardwood stands in parts of New Hampshire, sugar maple has been
increasing [<a href="#45">45</a>].

Great Lakes Region:  Northern hardwood forests of the Great Lakes Region
lie between the fire-prone savanna and prairie communities to the south
and west [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Fires in these forests were presumably fairly common in
presettlement times but may have occurred at intervals which exceeded
the lifespan of individual trees [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Shade-tolerant species, such as
sugar maple, commonly assume dominance in the absence of fire in Great
Lake's hardwood forests.  Where fire frequencies are high, aspen and
paper birch (Betula papiferya) are common dominants [<a href="#69">69</a>].  In
presettlement times, sugar maple was typically absent from portions of
the North Woods which burned at frequent intervals [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by wind; postfire yrs 1 and 2

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Acer saccharum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Sugar maple is sensitive to fire [<a href="#13">13</a>].  The thin bark is easily damaged
by even light ground fires [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Curtis [<a href="#12">12</a>] reported that "cambial
injury occurs even in trees that show little external damage."  Large
trees occasionally survive light fires and may exhibit visible fire
scars [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Hot fires can kill existing regeneration [<a href="#49">49</a>].

Sugar maple commonly occurs in mesic closed canopy forests that are
relatively resistant to ground fires, particularly during the winter and
spring when litter is usually moist [<a href="#12">12</a>].  In the summer, flammable
litter (generally deciduous leaves) is often scarce or absent.  Greatest
fire hazard occurs in dry years during October, after the leaves have
fallen [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Fires which occur during this time period are occasionally
severe and can kill the entire stand.  In a Tennessee loblolly pine
stand, DeBruyn and Buckner [<a href="#14">14</a>] reported 85 percent mortality in sugar
maple following a fall burn when fuels were very dry.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Sugar maple sprouts poorly after fire [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Mature trees that have been
top-killed by fire do not sprout, small saplings occasionally sucker
[<a href="#12">12</a>].  Although sprouting is common in young sugar maples following
mechanical disturbances, it is relatively uncommon after fire.  Sugar
maple reestablishes through seedling sprouts and seedlings [<a href="#49">49</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fuels/flammability:  The average ash content of dead sugar maple leaves
collected in two Michigan counties was documented as follows [<a href="#47">47</a>]:

               Wexford Co.       Ingham Co.
