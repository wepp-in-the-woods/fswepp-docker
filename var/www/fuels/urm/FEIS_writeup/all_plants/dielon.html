<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The accepted scientific name for bush-honeysuckle is Diervilla lonicera
Mill.  It is a member of the honeysuckle family (Caprifoliaceae).  There
are no accepted subspecies.  A variety with hairy leaf undersides occurs
in Ontario, northern Wisconsin, and northern Minnesota: D. l. var.
hypomalaca Fern. [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].

Bush-honeysuckle is closely related to southern bush-honeysuckle (D.

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Bush-honeysuckle is not named as an understory dominant or indicator in
published classifications.  It is found in a variety of cover types and
has a number of plant associates.  The most widely distributed shrub
associates of bush-honeysuckle include beaked hazel (Corylus cornuta),
alternate-leaf dogwood (Cornus alternifolia), speckled alder (Alnus
rugosa), American green alder (A. viridis ssp. crispa), checkerberry
wintergreen (Gaultheria procumbens), and blueberries (Vaccinium spp.).
Herbaceous associates include wild lily-of-the-valley (Maianthemum
canadense), bigleaf aster (Aster macrophyllus), and wild sarsaparilla
(Aralia nudicaulis).  Bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinium) is often
associated with bush-honeysuckle in the understory of some cover types;
bush-honeysuckle is also found on bracken fern-dominated grasslands in
northeastern Wisconsin [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Diervilla lonicera
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Bush-honeysuckle provides winter browse for moose, and winter and summer
browse for white-tailed deer [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Leaves and twigs are eaten by
woodland caribou, but bush-honeysuckle is not an important component of
the woodland caribou diet [<a href="#10">10</a>].
 
Sharp-tailed grouse consume the vegetative buds.  Bush-honeysuckle
provides brood cover for sharp-tailed grouse in Wisconsin [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Bush-honeysuckle is preferred by white-tailed deer in late summer [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Seed-tree cuts or clearcuts in red pine (Pinus resinosa) communities
often result in a dense growth of shrubs, including bush-honeysuckle.
Bush-honeysuckle increased in density following logging in a balsam fir
(Abies balsamea)-paper birch (Betula papyrifera) stand near Duluth,
Minnesota [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Leaving more of the canopy when logging reduces the
amount of shrub growth [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Bush-honeysuckle competes with lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium
angustifolium) after fire-pruning of lowbush blueberry fields [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Bush-honeysuckle is susceptible to foliar sprays of 2,4-D [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Bush-honeysuckle is probably resistant to browsing; on Isle Royale,
Michigan, it was found in higher densities in control plots than in
moose exclosures [<a href="#38">38</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Diervilla lonicera
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bush-honeysuckle is a native, deciduous small shrub that usually grows
from 2 to 4 feet (0.6-1.2 m) tall [<a href="#15">15</a>].  The branches run close to the
ground, ascending slightly.  The fruit is a dry, woody, dehiscent
capsule [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Asexual: Bush-honeysuckle reproduces from rhizomes, forming
widely-scattered clumps or patches [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

Sexual: Bush-honeysuckle is insect pollinated.  Its most important
pollinators in Michigan are bumblebees.  It is self-incompatible;
successful seed set requires pollination by insects that have travelled
from another clonal patch, which is usually some distance away [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bush-honeysuckle is common on exposed, rocky sites and on dry to mesic,
well-drained soils [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  In northern Michigan, it is found in open,
sandy thickets, woodlands, and jack pine (Pinus banksiana) plains [<a href="#40">40</a>].
It is best developed on dry, infertile soils in cool climates [<a href="#7">7</a>].

In the Adirondack Mountains of New York, bush-honeysuckle is found from
elevations of 100 feet (30 m) to 4,050 feet (1,234 m) [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative seral species

Bush-honeysuckle is relatively insensitive to differences in light
intensity [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Its abundance in jack pine communities usually remains
relatively constant for a long time but declines in older (approximately
80 years of age) stands [<a href="#3">3</a>].  In jack pine-balsam fir community types,
bush-honeysuckle is most common on sites that have been cleared and/or
burned within the past 30 to 50 years [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
The peak flowering season for bush-honeysuckle is from early June to
early July, but flowers have opened as late as August in Michigan
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  The fruit matures and releases seeds in September [<a href="#8">8</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Diervilla lonicera
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Bush-honeysuckle sprouts from the rhizomes following top-kill by fire.
Regeneration depends on initiation of growth from dormant buds on
protected stem portions and rhizomes [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous shrub, rhizome in soil
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Diervilla lonicera
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Cool surface fires top-kill bush-honeysuckle [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Bush-honeysuckle rapidly regenerates after fire, though no sexual
structures are produced the first postfire growing season [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Seeds of
bush-honeysuckle were found only on old burns in Petersham,
Massachusetts, which suggested a possible period of heavy fruit
production approximately 13 years after fire [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].

Bush-honeysuckle abundance is usually unchanged by fire; abundance in
postfire communities is dependent on bush-honeysuckle prefire density
and the response of its competitors [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  Bush-honeysuckle increased
slightly in cover (from 1 to 2.2 percent) after a prescribed fire in a
jack pine community in Minnesota [<a href="#2">2</a>].  In a Minnesota jack pine stand
where both logging and prescribed fire were conducted, bush-honeysuckle
frequency decreased the first postfire year but returned to prefire
levels by the second growing season.  Its frequency declined slightly in
the fourth year [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Following prescribed fire in a red pine-white pine
(Pinus strobus) community in Ontario, bush-honeysuckle increased in stem
number but not frequency, with an overall increase in biomass [<a href="#30">30</a>].

After wildfire in jack pine types in northern Minnesota,
bush-honeysuckle regenerated better on sites that had burned in summer
as compared to sites that had experienced a spring wildfire [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Loomis and others [<a href="#26">26</a>] measured the moisture content of a number of
upper Midwest understory shrubs and herbs, including bush-honeysuckle;
this information can be used for a number of fire management
considerations.
