<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arctostaphylos viscida
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Whiteleaf manzanita is useless as livestock browse but is a valuable
source of food for wildlife.  Various chaparral animals including black
bear, coyote, dusky-footed woodrat, and brush rabbit eat manzanita
fruits.  Birds such as Merriam's turkey, dusky grouse, and band-tailed
pigeon also consume the fruits [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Black-tailed deer sometimes browse
older leaves in the winter, but they prefer sprouts or seedlings [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability of whiteleaf manzanita leaves is rated as poor for
goats, sheep, cattle, and black-tailed deer [<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Whiteleaf manzanita provides poor quality browse [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  The protein
content of manzanita leaves ranges from 6 percent in December and
January, when deer are most likely to consume them, to 8 percent in
August and September.  Black-tailed deer need a minimum of 7 percent
protein in their diet for normal maintenance [<a href="#6">6</a>].  


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Whiteleaf manzanita often forms dense stands that provide good cover and
nesting sites for small birds and mammals [<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The fruits of whiteleaf manzanita can be used to make jelly [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Native
Americans used the fruits to make cider [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Timber:  Whiteleaf manzanita allelopathically inhibits growth of conifer
seedlings [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) production can
be increased, however, if planted in cleared whiteleaf manzanita
brushfields.  Some of the fungi (Azospirillum spp.) which form
ectomycorrhizal associations with whiteleaf manzanita will infect
Douglas-fir roots once whiteleaf manzanita hosts are removed.
Douglas-fir seedling survival rates have increased by 50 percent when
planted in cleared whiteleaf manzanita brushfields, as opposed to other
types of chaparral brushfields. [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Control:  Whiteleaf manzanita can be controlled by aerial applications
of 2,4-D, glyphosate, or picloram in May or June [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  It can also be
controlled by prescribed burning (see Fire Management Considerations).

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arctostaphylos viscida
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Whiteleaf manzanita is an erect, long-lived, native evergreen shrub.  It
ranges from 3 to 13 feet (1-4 m) high, with spreading branches covering
an average area of 16 square feet (1.5 sq m).  Its bark is continually
shed [<a href="#36">36</a>].  The leaves, pedicels, and fruits are often glandular-viscid.
Its fruit is a drupe containing hardcoated seeds [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  The
laterally spreading, shallow roots usually penetrate less than 8 inches
belowground (20 cm) [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Whiteleaf manzanita reproduces by seed [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Seeds are
dispersed by animals and can remain dormant in seedbanks for decades
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Seeds require scarification prior to germination.  This may
occur by heat, mechanically, or chemically [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Seeds require
overwinter stratification after scarification has occurred [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Seeds
are produced annually, although production slows during drought years
[<a href="#39">39</a>].  Seedling mortality is low [<a href="#33">33</a>].

Vegetative:  All manzanita species can regenerate by layering [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Whiteleaf manzanita is typically found on dry, sunny slopes [<a href="#37">37</a>].  

Climate:  Whiteleaf manzanita occurs in a mediterranean climate, with
mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

Elevation:  Whiteleaf manzanita occurs at elevations of 500 to 5,000
feet (152-1,524 m) [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Soil:  Whiteleaf manzanita grows in shallow, rocky, sandy soil [<a href="#31">31</a>].
Some populations have adapted to serpentine soil [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Whiteleaf manzanita is shade intolerant [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].  It is both a resisdual
colonizer and a survivor in disturbed communities [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  Whiteleaf
manzanita communities are sometimes seral to coniferous forest or oak
woodland [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Manzanita chaparral, however, is considered a temporally
and spatially stable community, and is often described as climax or
pyric climax [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Whiteleaf manzanita flowers from February to April [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Fruits appear
in early summer and ripen in late summer or early fall.  Seeds are
dispersed from late summer until the following spring [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Growth
begins in February and ceases in June with the onset of summer drought
[<a href="#24">24</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arctostaphylos viscida
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Plant adaptations:  Whiteleaf manzanita establishes after fire by
fire-stimulated germination of dormant seeds stored in the soil
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

Fire ecology:  Whiteleaf manzanita has various morphological adaptations
which encourage fire.  During drought, the plant undergoes branch
die-back, which contributes to fuel loading.  Continuous shedding of
bark adds additional fuel [<a href="#36">36</a>].  The surface-to-volume ratio of leaves
and twigs are perfectly scaped for maximum air circulation, resulting in
more complete burning of the plant and adding to fire intensity [<a href="#20">20</a>].
Additionally, leaves and twigs contain flammable oils and terpenes [<a href="#40">40</a>].
Philpot [<a href="#40">40</a>] has reported the heat value of whiteleaf manzanita leaves
and twigs at 8,942 Btu per pound (4,973 cal/kg).

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arctostaphylos viscida
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Intense fire kills whiteleaf manzanita [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Fire-activated seeds germinate during the first postfire growing season
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Seedling success rates are good.  Whiteleaf manzanita
stands are dense by postfire years 3 or 4 [<a href="#24">24</a>], and generally remain so.
Nine years following a fire in Yuba County, California, the combined
density of whiteleaf manzanita and its codominant, deerbrush (Ceanothus
integerrimus), was 6,523 plants per acre (16,118/ha) [<a href="#33">33</a>].  By postfire
year 10, these dense stands of whiteleaf manzanita have reached sexually
maturity [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Timber and grazing:  Annual prescribed burning can convert whiteleaf
manzanita brushfields to timber or pastureland if the site is otherwise
suitable.  Yearly fires prevent whiteleaf manzanita seedlings from
maturing and gradually reduce the residual seed stock.  Eventually,
whiteleaf manzanita is eradicated from the site [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Safe
conditions exist for a late winter or early spring burning if each of
these elements is within the following range [<a href="#19">19</a>]:

                  Element                       Intensity
                                              low       high

          fuel stick moisture (%)              15         5
          relative humidity (%)                58        26
          wind speed (mi/h)                     0        10
          air temperature (degrees F)          40        84        

Fire suppression:  Fire suppression in whiteleaf manzanita chaparral
results in unnaturally high fuel levels.  This eventually results in
severe wildfires that are extremely difficult to contain.  Prescribed
burning is recommended for reducing fuel loading in whiteleaf manzanita
communities [<a href="#20">20</a>].
