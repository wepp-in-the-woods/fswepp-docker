<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Gray dogwood is one of the dominant shrubs in the oak-hickory
(Quercus-Carya) forests of the northeastern United States.  Common
codominants include maple-leaved viburnum (Viburnum acerifolium) and
Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia).  Other common associates
of gray dogwood include American hazel (Corylus americana), beaked
hazelnut (C. cornuta), chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), smooth sumac
(Rhus glabra), and red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cornus racemosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
In Missouri, Ohio, and Illinois, gray dogwood is one of the most
important forage plants for white-tailed deer [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  The seeds and
buds are a favorite food for ring-necked pheasant and northern bobwhite
in southern Michigan [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Gray dogwood thickets provide cover for a variety of birds and mammals
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Gray dogwood is well adapted for revegetating disturbed sites.  It is
easily established by direct seedling and grows rapidly [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  It has
been successfully planted for revegetating highway corridors in Wisconsin
and coal mine spoils in the eastern United States [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Gray dogwood has been planted for ornamental purposes because of its
showy flowers, fruits, and attractive fall coloring [<a href="#2">2</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cornus racemosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Gray dogwood is a native, deciduous, rhizomatous shrub, usually from 4
to 10 feet (1.2-3.0 m) high.  It sometimes becomes a small tree up to 27
feet (8 m) high [<a href="#17">17</a>].  It has ascending stems and branches that often
form impenetrable dome-shaped clusters or thickets [<a href="#4">4</a>].  The leaves are
2.5 to 4.0 inches (6.0-10 cm) long, and the flowers are borne in open,
irregular cymes.  The individual fruits enclose a single stone and occur
in clusters [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Gray dogwood reproduces both sexually and asexually.  It begins
producing seed at about 4 to 5 years of age and produces an abundant
amount of seed every year.  Gray dogwood reproduces vegetatively by
sprouting from underground rhizomes [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Gray dogwood grows on a variety of sites within its range.  It is found
in meadows, open woodlands, riparian zones, along roadsides, and forest
margins.  It grows best on rich, moist, well-drained soils, but will
also grow on mineral-rich limestone bedrock and rock outcroppings.  In
Appalachian oak-hickory forests, it usually occurs on open ridgetops and
south- and west-facing slopes [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].



<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Gray dogwood is an early to mid-seral species [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  It is most
common in understories of mixed, open forests and grows best in moderate
to full sunlight [<a href="#18">18</a>].  In southwestern Wisconsin, aboveground growth
rates of gray dogwood were greater in open habitats than in forest
understories [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Gray dogwood flowers from May through July, with fruits maturing from
August through October [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Leaves emerge in early April and abscise
in late October [<a href="#13">13</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cornus racemosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Postfire regeneration strategies of grey dogwood are not documented in
the literature.  It probably survives fire by sprouting from rhizomes.
It also produces an abundance of soil-stored seed [<a href="#23">23</a>], which may
germinate after fire.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous shrub, rhizome in soil
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<pre>
<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cornus racemosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Aboveground plant parts are often killed by fire [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  The
underground rhizomes probably survive all but severe fires that remove
duff and heat the upper soil for extended periods of time.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Percent cover of native shrubs, including gray dogwood, decreased
following fire in a bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) savanna in east-central
Minnesota [<a href="#26">26</a>].

In a study of postfire plant response in four plant communities in
central New York, gray dogwood frequency on 17 burned plots averaged 62
percent at postfire year 1.  Frequency on unburned plots was 62 percent [<a href="#25">25</a>].
