Common juniper is possibly the most widely distributed tree in 
the world [<a href="#78">78</a>].  This circumboreal species occurs across North 
America, Europe, northern Asia and Japan [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>].  Common juniper is 
almost completely circumpolar within the exception of a gap 
in the Bering Sea region [<a href="#65">65</a>].  It is 
widespread in North America beyond the northern limit of trees, 
occurring from western Alaska and British Columbia to 
Newfoundland, Greenland, and Iceland [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>].
Common juniper extends southward through New England to the 
Carolinas and westward through northeastern Illinois, Indiana, 
northern Ohio, Minnesota, and Nebraska to the western mountains of 
Washington, California, Arizona, and New Mexico [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>].

Common juniper is an indicator in a number of forest and 
shrubland habitat types and community types.  It grows as an 
understory dominant with ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>), 
Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>), lodgepole pine 
(<i>Pinus contorta</i>), limber pine (<i>P. flexilis</i>),
white fir (<i>Abies concolor</i>), Engelmann spruce (<i>Picea engelmannii</i>), 
white spruce (<i>P. glauca</i>), quaking aspen (<i>Populus tremuloides</i>), 
blue spruce (<i>Picea pungens</i>), whitebark pine (<i>Pinus albicaulis</i>), 
subalpine fir (<i>A. lasiocarpa</i>), or Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine (<i>P. aristata</i>).
<p>  

Common associates in northern Utah include common snowberry 
(<i>Symphoricarpos albus</i>), gooseberry currant 
(<i>Ribes montigenum</i>), Oregon-grape (<i>Mahonia repens</i>), 
hairy telegraphplant (<i>Heterotheca villosa</i>), timber 
milkvetch (<i>Astragalus miser</i>), silvery
lupine (<i>Lupinus argenteus)</i>, Thurber fescue 
(<i>Festuca thurberi</i>), elk sedge (<i>Carex geyeri</i>), and 
bottlebrush squirreltail 
(<i>Elymus elymoides</i>) [<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>].  Common juniper is listed as a 
codominant indicator species in the following classifications:</p>

Wild ungulates generally eat only trace amounts of common 
juniper.  Deer and mountain goats
browse common juniper to at least a limited extent in some areas
including Wyoming and Montana [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>].  
Levels of use are typically greatest during the
winter or early spring.  Common juniper can be important 
winter mule deer food during some years in parts of the Black 
Hills [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>].  It is also used consistently
through the winter months by white-tailed deer in the Swan Valley of Montana
[<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>].  Caribou have been observed feeding on common
juniper after fire [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Moose feed on common
juniper "sparingly" in northern Michigan [<a href="#94">94</a>].  It also
receives some light summer use by mountain goats in Montana 
[<a href="#111">111</a>].  In northern Canada, barren-ground caribou 
browse "fairly often" on common juniper where lichen growth is 
poor [<a href="#69">69</a>].  Hares browse common juniper in parts of Ontario where
use may range from low to high [<a href="#26">26</a>].
<p>

Domestic livestock rarely utilize common juniper.  The foliage may be
poisonous to domestic goats, although livestock in parts of Europe have
reportedly been fed sprays of common juniper with no ill effects [<a href="#131">131</a>].</p>
<p>

Cones of most junipers are eaten by many species of birds and
mammals.  Numerous animals, including the American robin and
black-capped chickadee, feed on the cones of common juniper 
whenever they are available.  American robins frequently 
consume large numbers of cones during the spring and fall [<a href="#101">101</a>].
In eastern Ontario, cones provide food for cedar and Bohemian 
waxwings [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Wild turkeys also feed on
cones of common juniper [<a href="#27">27</a>].</p>

<p class="subframeText">
Common juniper is a native, evergreen shrub or columnar tree 
[<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#136">136</a>].  Throughout most of North America, common juniper most 
often grows as a low, decumbent mat-forming shrub reaching up to 4.9 feet (1.5 m) in
height and 7.6 to 13.1 feet (2-4 m) across [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>].  In parts of New
England common juniper occasionally grows up to 25 feet (7.6 m) in
height, and a treelike growth form is reportedly common in 
Europe [<a href="#78">78</a>].  Height at maturity can range from 2 to 50 feet 
(0.6-15.3 m) [<a href="#66">66</a>].  At polar limits, common juniper grows as a
dwarf shrub in forest tundra [<a href="#65">65</a>].
<p>

The bark of common juniper is thin, shreddy or scaly, often exfoliating
into thin strips [<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>].  Twigs tend to be yellowish or green when
young but turn brown and harden with age [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>].  Leaves are 
simple, stiff and arranged in whorls of 3 [<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>].  Younger leaves tend to
be more needlelike whereas mature leaves are scalelike [<a href="#88">88</a>].</p>
<p>

Male strobili are sessile or stalked, and female strobili are made up
of green, ovate or acuminate scales [<a href="#123">123</a>].  Berrylike cones are red at
first, ripening to a glaucous bluish-black [<a href="#66">66</a>].</p>
<p>

Morphological characteristics including growth form differ somewhat
according to variety.  General botanical characteristics by variety are
as follows [<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#136">136</a>]:</p>

Common juniper is typically dioecious but occasionally monoecious 
[<a href="#128">128</a>].  Seed usually matures during the second growing season 
[<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>,<a href="#136">136</a>], although there have been some reports of cones 
maturing within only one season [<a href="#128">128</a>].
<p>

Common juniper produces large cone crops at irregular intervals 
[<a href="#66">66</a>].  Cones are ovoid to ellipsoid [<a href="#123">123</a>] and contain 1 to 3 
seeds [<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>].  Germination rates for common juniper seed 
are relatively poor and defective seed may also be relatively 
common.  Pack [<a href="#97">97</a>] reported that up to 60% of common juniper 
seeds examined were defective.  In northwestern Quebec, the majority 
of seeds produced by "older" plants (94.8%) were non-viable. 
A majority of seeds produced by "younger" plants (80%) 
were viable.  Approximately
40 to 60% of "older" plants were sterile [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Under 
harsh conditions, female plants may
decrease reproductive efforts and less viable seed is 
produced [<a href="#83">83</a>].</p>
<p>

Germination and seedling establishment of common juniper
is "difficult" [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  Ideal germination
conditions are moist, compact soil with sufficient oxygen
diffusion [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Germination has been reported to range from 7 to 75%, depending
on the specific treatment and seed source [<a href="#66">66</a>].</p>
<p>

Juniper seeds have a semipermeable and thick 
seedcoat with a dormant embryo [<a href="#97">97</a>].  Common juniper seed requires a period of warm temperatures 
followed by a period of cold temperatures lasting approximately
7 months [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Generally the 
germination rate of seeds that are
not afterripened is only around 1% [<a href="#97">97</a>].  High temperatures,
alternating temperatures, freezing and thawing, removal of the 
seedcoat, or the application of hydrogen peroxide, dilute acids,
carbon dioxide, or light had little influence on the germination 
of juniper seeds.</p>
<p>

Steele and Geier-Hayes [<a href="#121">121</a>] report that common juniper seed is dispersed by
animals and not stored in the soil.  However, Major and Pyott
[<a href="#80">80</a>] report that common juniper seed persists in cropped 
soils in California.  Seeds of common juniper are 
dispersed by gravity, water, birds, or
mammals.  Digestive processes apparently do not harm most 
juniper seeds and may actually enhance germination [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  
Birds are the most important dispersal agents of common 
juniper [<a href="#31">31</a>].  More than 60 to 85%
of common junipers present in the sand dune region
surrounding Lake Michigan are believed to have originated from
bird-disseminated seed.  Birds also contribute to the spread of
common juniper into old fields of New England [<a href="#101">101</a>].  Rosen [<a href="#109">109</a>]
reports that domestic sheep may also serve as a dispersal agent since
junipers are often associated with sheep driveways.  Strong winter
winds can push seeds across frozen snow cover [<a href="#109">109</a>].</p>
<p>

Increases observed in seedling numbers during certain periods
are the result of favorable conditions for establishment.  
Establishment is more likely in open spaces between older shrubs 
and may be favored by grazing [<a href="#109">109</a>].</p>
<p> 

Common juniper does not sprout after foliage is removed.  
However, adventitious root development can occur when branches come in contact
with the ground become buried.  In
the subarctic, plants are often buried at least partially, and production
of adventitious roots may aid in water and nutrient intake.  
A higher proportion of common juniper cuttings 
from northern populations rooted as compared with southern cuttings.  Cuttings from female shrubs may exhibit better
rooting potential than cuttings from male plants [<a href="#63">63</a>].</p>

Common juniper can grow on a wide range of sites.  It grows on 
dry, open, rocky, wooded hillsides, sand terraces, maritime escarpments,
and on exposed slopes and plateaus throughout its range 
[<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>].  
Common juniper grows along dunes or on dune heath in 
coastal areas of the Northeast and inland along the Great 
Lakes [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>].  It has spread into abandoned fields
and pastures in New England [<a href="#101">101</a>] and the upper Midwest during the 
past century.  In the southeast it is found on isolated 
mountains [<a href="#2">2</a>].  
<p>

This species grows on a variety of soil types including 
acidic and calcareous sands, loams, or marls [<a href="#9">9</a>].  It is 
tolerant of ultramafic soils [<a href="#85">85</a>].  In 
much of Europe common juniper is restricted to 
well-aerated soils somewhat deficient in both nitrogen 
and phosphorus.  Growth on different 
soil types is rated as follows [<a href="#32">32</a>]:</p>

Common juniper is intolerant of
shade and is usually found in open environments [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Common juniper is often regarded as a colonizing plant but
reaches maximum abundance on harsh, stressed environments in
which competition is lacking [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>].  Common juniper occurs as an 
important understory 
species in a number of climax communities within the southern
Rocky Mountains including some Douglas-fir, subalpine fir, limber pine,
Engelmann spruce, and blue spruce stands [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>].  Common 
juniper becomes prominent in many high-elevation spruce-fir forests 
in Colorado as much as 100 years or more after fire or 
other disturbance [<a href="#21">21</a>].  In the boreal forest of eastern Canada,
however, common juniper begins to decline after approximately 70 years 
after disturbance.  On harsh open sites,
it can persist for much longer which creates patchy habitats
[<a href="#31">31</a>].
<p>

Common juniper is described as a seral
species in common juniper/bearberry <i>(Arctostaphylos uva-ursi) </i>communities of the southwestern
Yukon where it is ultimately replaced by spruce <i>(Picea</i> spp.) 
and buffaloberry <i>(Shepherdia canadensis)</i> [<a href="#34">34</a>].  In Arizona and Colorado, common
juniper is prominent in seral stands with Oregon-grape [<a href="#36">36</a>] and in the northern Rocky Mountains, it occurs in
late seral stands in Douglas-fir/ninebark (<i>Physocarpos malvaceus)</i> 
and Douglas-fir/Rocky Mountain maple <i>(Acer glabrum)</i> 
habitat types [<a href="#121">121</a>].  
It is prominent in old-field or 
"early settlement" communities of New England, but it 
"disappears" from areas maintained in timber 
[<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  In 
pitch pine <i>(Pinus rigida)</i> communities of New England,
common juniper replaces initial colonizers such as lichens, 
blueberries <i>(Vaccinium</i> spp.), and grasses, and is in turn, 
replaced later in succession by pitch
pine [<a href="#87">87</a>].  In black spruce communities of northern
Saskatchewan, common juniper is most prevalent in secondary
successional stages occurring from 11 to 30 years after disturbance 
[<a href="#113">113</a>].  In Michigan, common juniper is a colonizer on
dune blowouts [<a href="#96">96</a>].</p>

<p class="subframeText">
Common juniper begins leader elongation in the spring.  
"Flowering" or cone development dates vary somewhat according to 
geographic location, but cone development generally occurs from April through June [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].  
Generalized cone development dates by state are as follows [<a href="#32">32</a>]:

Wyoming        April         May
</pre>

Strobili form during June or July, and these 
structures fuse, generally during the 2nd year, to produce 
a berrylike cone [<a href="#123">123</a>].  Cones ripens from August through October of the 2nd or, 
more rarely, 3rd year.  Cones generally remain on the 
plant for at least 2 years [<a href="#66">66</a>], with dispersal occurring in 
August of the second season [<a href="#126">126</a>].  In the Canadian subarctic, 
cones are initiated in autumn and open the following year when
pollination occurs.  Male strobili are
shed while the female cones are enlarging and fertilization occurs
during the 2nd year.  Seeds mature
during the 3rd year [<a href="#63">63</a>].

<P>Common juniper is generally described as &quot;susceptible&quot; to
fire [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>]. It is described as being &quot;not equipped with fire-surviving
regeneration properties&quot; [<a href="#81">81</a>]. Foliage is resinous and very flammable
[<a href="#31">31</a>]. The degree of damage received increases with progressively greater
fire severity. In eastern Canada, older common juniper often survive fires
of low severity. Some fire regimes allow common juniper to survive
several fires [<a href="#31">31</a>].</P>

<P>Where common juniper is killed by fire, some seeds may survive
in the soil on-site and germinate when conditions become favorable. Other
seed is brought to the site by bird [<a href="#25">25</a>] or, less commonly, mammal
dispersers. These factors contribute to slow postfire reestablishment
on many sites. </P>

IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT:</a>

<br />
<p class="subframeText">

Common juniper is generally killed or seriously damaged by fire 
[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Patchy fires may allow individual 
plants to survive in protected areas such as on rocky cliffs.  More 
rarely, portions of a lightly-burned plant may survive.  The amount 
of damage this species incurs increases with increasing 
fire severity [<a href="#120">120</a>]. 
<p>

In
the boreal forest of Quebec, at least 37% of common junipers 
survived fire.  Although the dominant fire regime here is 
crown fires or "important surface fires covering large areas," 
common juniper often survives on sites made up of exposed bedrock
or where protected by lakes and island complexes.  Survival 
can occur if fire affects only part of an area or where fires are of low 
intensity.  In some cases, fires of
low intensity "can allow sections of the plant to survive and
reproduce vegetatively" [<a href="#31">31</a>].</p>

In a Scottish study, common juniper was killed by 1,472 <sup>o</sup>F 
(800 <sup>o</sup>C) heat treatment when heath was burned.  
Plants made only "feeble
regrowth" when burned at 1,112 <sup>o</sup>F 
(600 <sup>o</sup>C).  However, following
treatment at 752 <sup>o</sup>F (400 <sup>o</sup>C), new shoots were
produced [<a href="#82">82</a>].<p></p>

<p class="subframeText">
Common juniper does not sprout after disturbance.  Surviving
individuals serve as sources of seed for adjacent areas.  Postfire regeneration is more frequent in proximity to 
existing populations of common junipers [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Regrowth can 
generally take place after fire if some of the basal branches 
remain alive [<a href="#82">82</a>], which only occurs in fires of low severity 
or where spread is patchy.
<p>

Common juniper also reestablishes after fire through off-site seed 
dispersed by birds or mammals.  Poor seed dispersal from existing
stands along with low germination rates can explain why some 
favorable sites are not readily occupied by common juniper [<a href="#31">31</a>].</p>
<p>  

It is possible that seed protected by overlying 
soil can survive at least some fires.  After low-severity fires, 
some seed may germinate.  However, Mallik and Gimingham [<a href="#82">82</a>] 
observed that high temperatures did not increase germination 
in common juniper seed and little seed germinated after 
fire.</p>

Following "light" (less than 50% litter reduction) fires
in forested areas of western Montana, burned sites often 
exhibit minimal shrub damage and have at least some 
surviving common juniper [<a href="#120">120</a>].  Common juniper averaged 6.7% 
cover 3 years after a 
light burn in Montana [<a href="#120">120</a>].  Laboratory heating experiments on 
common juniper plants from Scottish heath showed that growth could

Most fires kill common juniper [<a href="#25">25</a>], leading to the 
slow postfire recovery typical of this species.  In northern
Canada, common juniper is generally absent from burned areas, but
may grow in small refugia within burned areas [<a href="#69">69</a>].
<p>

Postfire recovery of common juniper is generally slow.  The following

<p class="subframeText">
In a north-central Colorado study of fire behavior in 
quaking aspen stands, common juniper patches burned 
more intensely and released more heat than adjacent
herbaceous areas.  A caloric analysis of
5 foliage samples yielded an average low heat content of 5064
kcal/kg.  Common juniper fuels
tended to be deeper and heavier than herbaceous fuels and flames
were longer and deeper in common juniper patches.  Fire 
removed almost all litter, standing herbs, and common
juniper foliage, leaving only bare branches.  The 
moisture of green common juniper foliage averaged
112% of oven dry weight on 2 burns [<a href="#117">117</a>].  Fuel loading for
common juniper can be estimated as follows:


<pre>branch load (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) = .000191* crown height above duff
(cm) ** 2.135

foliage load (kg)   = 6.456* crown volume (m<sup>3</sup>) ** 1.93</pre>


In xeric red pine <i>(Pinus resinosa)</i> communities of northern Canada, an understory
of low sweet blueberry (<i>Vaccinium angustifolium),</i> lichen, and common
juniper creates a low and discontinuous fuel load.  Fires 
in these communities tend to have an irregular pattern of 
intensity that is largely dependent on the distribution of
fine fuels.  Intense crown fires are unlikely here [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Flames were longer in juniper than in herbaceous cover and more fuel
was consumed on juniper plots.  Burned out juniper plots produced
more aspen suckers than corresponding herbaceous plots.  More heat
