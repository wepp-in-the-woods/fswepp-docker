<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Threadleaf sedge forms a climactic climax with needle-and-thread grass
(Stipa comata) in protected areas of Theodore Roosevelt National Park
(TRNP) [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) dominates unprotected
areas which have been heavily grazed.  Some consider the presence of
blue grama an indication of xeric soils [<a href="#14">14</a>], but the majority believe
that blue grama replaces threadleaf sedge as a result of overgrazing
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  An edaphic climax of wheatgrass (Agropyron spp.)/sedge
(Carex spp.) also occurs in Theodore Roosevelt National Park.

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carex filifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Threadleaf sedge provides excellent forage for several livestock and
wildlife species, although production is very low [<a href="#25">25</a>].  It provides
extremely valuable early spring growth and remains palatable throughout
the growing season [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Threadleaf sedge is an important winter
and spring forage for both elk and bison [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  It is also one of the
five main forages of the black-tailed prairie dog [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Domestic
animals such as cattle, sheep, and horses also use this species [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Although palatability varies widely with location, it is generally fair
to good for livestock and wildlife [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Young plants are preferred, but
threadleaf sedge maintains high palatability throughout the growing
season [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Palatability has been rated at 70 percent for cattle
[<a href="#21">21</a>].

The relish and degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife species for
threadleaf sedge in several western states has been rated as follows
[<a href="#7">7</a>]:

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The nutrient content of threadleaf sedge has been reported as follows
[<a href="#18">18</a>]:

  (Protein is more digestible in fresh grass than in overripe grass).

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
The ability of the root system of this species to hold soil in place
makes it an ideal candidate for controlling wind- and water-induced soil
erosion.  It exhibits good growth on moderate slopes and fair growth on
steep slopes.  Erosion-control potential has been rated high for
Colorado, and medium for Utah, Montana, Wyoming, and North Dakota.
Long-term revegatation potential has been rated medium for Utah,
Wyoming, Montana, and North Dakota [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Limited seed availability restricts the use of this plant.  Native seed
harvests would be costly due to the low seed production, and currently
no commercial sources are available.


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Food:  American Indians used culm bases as food during famines [<a href="#25">25</a>].

Drought tolerance:  Threadleaf sedge has value as a drought-tolerant
species [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Threadleaf sedge decreases under heavy grazing pressure.  Reproduction
is almost entirely from seed, so if the stand is grazed so closely that
no seed production occurs, it will soon deteriorate [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Plants lose vigor when overgrazed and are eventually replaced by blue
grama and buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides), which are more resistant
to close grazing [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carex filifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Threadleaf sedge is a perennial, native, cool-season grasslike plant
with a densely caespitose growth habit [<a href="#25">25</a>].  It reaches up to 12 inches
(30 cm) in height.  Its root system binds the soil more firmly than that
of most grasses.  Although very small, (1 mm or less in diameter) roots
occur in enormous numbers.  Root systems extend farther laterally (as
far as 15 inches [38 cm] away from the plant) than vertically [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Plants are monoecious; male flowers occur on the upper portion
of the floret and female flowers on the lower portion.  Fruits are
triangular achenes [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Flowers are often damaged by frost, preventing
seed production [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Vegetative:  Threadleaf sedge can reproduce vegetatively by rhizomes,
but this is uncommon.  The majority of reproduction is by seed [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Threadleaf sedge is typically found on dry soils of open prairies and
rolling hills.  It can grow on moist sites but not in shallow water or
swamps [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Threadleaf sedge generally occurs on the upper slopes of
hills but can occur on all aspects [<a href="#14">14</a>].  It usually grows in full
sunlight, although fair stands sometimes occur in the shade [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Soils:  Threadleaf sedge is generally found on deep, loamy soils in
meadows and shallow rocky soils on slopes [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Production is fair to
good on all soil types except clay to dense clay.  Optimum production
occurs on sandy loams and loams with a depth of 10 to 20 inches (26-51
cm) [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Elevation:  The elevational range is wide due to the wide distribution
of the plant.  In the Northwest and Canada it can be found within
several hundred feet of sea level, but in the Southern Rocky Mountains
it occurs at timberline (12,000 feet [3,658 m]) and has been reported at
13,000 feet (3,958 m) in Colorado [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Threadleaf sedge decreases in response to heavy grazing and is
eventually removed from the plant community.  In Nebraska it was
identified as a codominant with needlegrass (Stipa spp.) in a
mixed-prairie climax community.  Under grazing pressure, needlegrass
decreased and was replaced by blue grama.  With continued heavy grazing,
buffalograss replaced threadleaf sedge [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Results of a study in southwestern North Dakota showed cover of
threadleaf sedge was significantly higher within exclosures than without
[<a href="#2">2</a>].  Blue grama appeared to replace threadleaf sedge.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Seasonal development varies slightly according to elevation.  Growth
starts in late March to early April in North Dakota [<a href="#21">21</a>], early April in
Nebraska [<a href="#27">27</a>], and April in Colorado [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Flowering occurs from May to
June in North Dakota, late April in Nebraska, late April to May in
Colorado, May in Wyoming [<a href="#7">7</a>], and April to July in Montana [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Seed
dissemination starts the first of June in Nebraska and mid-May in
Colorado.  Seed dispersal is completed by the end of July in North
Dakota.  The plant is dried by early to mid-November in Colorado.

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carex filifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Threadleaf sedge is generally able to survive fire due to basal
meristems protected by soil and/or damp litter [<a href="#30">30</a>].  The low, dense
growth habit allows for good continuity of fuel, which enhances fire
spread [<a href="#24">24</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carex filifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Threadleaf sedge has been alternately reported as severely damaged or
minimally damaged by fire.  Degree of damage depends in part on season
and intensity of the fire, and postburn precipitation.  Of several
publications listing threadleaf sedge as severely damaged by fire, only
one was a report of an actual prescribed burn [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  The fire
was described as a "hot, clean burn" [<a href="#17">17</a>].



<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Threadleaf sedge recovers vegetatively, with surviving portions of the
plants sending up new growth.  Establishment occurs readily at any time
following fire, with no adverse effects from competition with surviving
plants of the same or other species.  Reproductive maturity is usually
not reached until the second year following the burn [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Postfire
seed production is often prolific, possibly due to increased nutrients
and available soil moisture [<a href="#1">1</a>].  An upland site with below average
productivity took 1 to 3 years longer to recover following fire than
more productive sites did [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Low postburn precipitation may delay full recovery until postfire year 2
or 3 or longer, depending on the severity of the burn [<a href="#30">30</a>].  In South
Dakota, productivity was increased by burning in April and October when
precipitation was above average but was reduced when postburn
precipitation was low [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Threadleaf sedge which was burned by a
low-severity fire and which received adequate precipitation after the
burn recovered relatively quickly (2 to 4 years after the fire).
However, severe burns may cause more lasting effects, requiring 12 to 15
years for the plant community to recover [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Season of burn may also
affect postfire response.  In Montana threadleaf sedge was relatively
unaffected by spring burning but reduced by fall burning [<a href="#22">22</a>].  However,
in western North Dakota there was no reduction 4 years after a late
summer burn, 3 years after a fall burn, or 3 months after a spring burn
[<a href="#8">8</a>].  Therefore, if postfire precipitation is adequate, it appears that
light- to moderate-severity fires (particularly spring fires) often
cause only minimal damage to threadleaf sedge.


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Prescribed burning to reduce sagebrush often involves plant communities
with abundant threadleaf sedge.  After burning, careful grazing
management should be implemented to ensure full recovery of the plants
[<a href="#20">20</a>].  To maintain a good stand, plants should not be burned during
periods of drought, and burn severity should be light to moderate [<a href="#2">2</a>].
If late summer grazing is desired, burning threadleaf sedge in the fall
or spring may allow leaves to remain on the plants longer than they
would on unburned plants [<a href="#32">32</a>].  This provides forage later in the
season.

<b>CASE NAME : </b>
Northern Great Plains/Yield and Cover/Prescribed Burning



<b>REFERENCE : </b>
White, R. S.; Currie, P. O. 1983 [<a href="#32">32</a>]



<b>SEASON/SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION : </b>
Fall - 2nd week in October/severity not reported
Spring - April 3/severity not reported



<b>STUDY LOCATION : </b>
Livestock and Range Research Station - Miles City, Montana



<b>PREFIRE VEGETATIVE COMMUNITY : </b>
Three communities were involved in this study:  western wheatgrass
(Pascopyrum smithii), blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis, and threadleaf
sedge.  Communities were relatively uniform, with pure stands of each of
the three species.  This minimized errors in yield and cover
measurements that frequently occur when grass separation is required.



<b>TARGET SPECIES PHENOLOGICAL STATE : </b>
Fall burn:  Threadleaf sedge was dormant.
Spring burn:  Prior to onset of spring growth.



<b>SITE DESCRIPTION : </b>
Soils of the study sites ranged in texture from loam to silt loam.  All
had good drainage and high fertility.  Topography was level.
Precipitation for the site is approximately 13.4 inches (34 cm)
annually, with 60 percent received between May and August.  During the
postburn growing season, precipitation was near normal for June, but
below normal for July and August.



<b>FIRE DESCRIPTION : </b>
Fires were confined by panels constructed of angle-iron and sheet metal.
Plot size was sufficiently large (3 x 3 m) to approximate burning under
natural conditions.



<b>FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES : </b>
Yield:  Spring burning of threadleaf sedge yielded about the same amount
of herbage through June as the unburned control.  In contrast, fall
burning showed about the same peak season yields, but until mid-June,
yields were significantly lower than both the control and spring-burned
plots.  This resulted in 25 percent less herbage production on the
fall-burned treatments.

Basal Cover:  Burning treatments substantially reduced the litter
component and increased the proportion of bare soil in the threadleaf
sedge community.  Spring burning resulted in the highest threadleaf
sedge cover, but there were no significant differences among other
treatments.



<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS : </b>
If grazing is needed in early June, neither spring nor fall burning
should be undertaken.  Plants on burned treatments never outyielded
those on the control at that time.  Spring or fall burning may
effectively stimulate forage production for the rest of the grazing
season.  Available moisture must be considered before burning.  Periods
of drought place stress on the plants, making them less likely to
recover from the burn.
