</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Bur oak is harvested for timber from bottomlands of Iowa and Illinois
[<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Bur oak provides food and cover for wildlife species [<a href="#40">40</a>].  The foliage
is a common and important constituent of cattle diets in the Black
Hills, South Dakota [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  Foliage is also an important food for
white-tailed deer in the Black Hills [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Cattle, horses, and sheep
eat the seedlings [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Many birds and mammals eat bur oak acorns including squirrels, deer,
wood ducks, blue jays, and cows [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Rodents and blue jays
frequently cache the acorns for later use, thereby facilitating seed
dispersal.



<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Bur oak is somewhat palatable to many species of wildlife and domestic
livestock.  It provides forage during much of the year for both mule
deer and cattle in the Black Hills of South Dakota [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Average
comsuption for cattle in the Black Hills was [<a href="#38">38</a>]:

                June       13.2%
                July        8.7%
                August     12.2%
                September  12.4%   

Cattle may prefer browsing bur oak.  Although cover of bur oak at one
South Dakota site was only estimated at 1.5 percent, it comprised 12.2
percent of the cattle's diet in August [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Young seedlings may be
palatable to cattle, horses, and sheep [<a href="#34">34</a>].

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Bur oak has been widely tested for use in rehabilitation.  It has been
successfully planted on coal spoils in the north-central and northern
Great Plains, and in the Western Interior Coal Province which
encompasses Missouri, Kansas, and Oklahoma [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Bur oak may be either
seeded or transplanted onto disturbed areas.

Seeds should be planted in groups of two or three, 0.5 to 1 inch (1.2 to
2.5 cm) deep, at a density of 900 to 1,000 per acre.  Recommended
spacing is 6 feet by 6 feet by 7 feet (1.8 m x 1.8 m x 2.1 m).  Acorns
average 45 percent germination with 75 seeds per pound [<a href="#40">40</a>]. 

Acorns are frequently stratified under cold moist conditions for 1 to 2
months prior to planting [<a href="#40">40</a>], although stratification is not required
[<a href="#45">45</a>].  Direct seeding is usually carried out during the fall in the
Western Interior Coal Province [<a href="#40">40</a>], although seed may be planted in
either the spring or fall.  Seed may be hand broadcast, hand drilled, or
mechanically broadcast.  Mulching aids the germination of seed planted
in the fall [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Most seed germination occurs during the fall, but
Quercus macrocarpa var. olivaeformis typically germinates during the
spring [<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Bur oak is extremely tolerant of city smoke and other air pollutants
[<a href="#43">43</a>].  It has been widely planted in Minneapolis and other urban areas
[<a href="#39">39</a>], and is commonly planted as a shade tree in many other areas of the
United States [<a href="#42">42</a>]. 


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Bur oak sprouts vigorously following cutting of pole-size or smaller
trees.  Larger trees may also produce some sprouts [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Chemical
control of bur oak is difficult [<a href="#44">44</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus macrocarpa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bur oak is a spreading, deciduous, large shrub to large tree [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].
On eastern forested sites, it is typically a large tree and reaches up
to 100 feet (31 m) in height and 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 m) or more in
diameter [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Bur oak grows best on the rich bottomlands of southern
Illinois and Indiana, where it may reach 170 feet (52 m) with a diameter
of 6 to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1 m) [<a href="#34">34</a>].  On rocky bluffs with thin soil and
at the north and west ends of its range, bur oak more commonly grows as
a small tree or large shrub [<a href="#20">20</a>].  On poor soil along the top of bluffs
at the western edge of its range, it often forms dense thickets of low
straggling shrubs which may reach only 1.7 to 3.3 feet (5 to 10 dm) in
height [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Twigs are thick and corky [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  Branches are low and stout, and the
crown is generally open, broad, and round [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Leaves are variable,
although generally large (2-10 in [5-25 cm] long), and deeply divided
into five to nine rounded lobes [<a href="#14">14</a>]. 

Staminate flowers are borne in small, pendant catkins, and solitary to
few pistillate flowers are in the leaf axils.  Fruits are relatively
large acorns up to 2 inches (5.1 cm) in length.  They are partly or
entirely enclosed in a fringed or "mossy" cap [<a href="#40">40</a>].

Roots have great tensile strength [<a href="#41">41</a>].  The well-branched, widely
spreading roots allows growth in dry areas [<a href="#41">41</a>]. 

Bur oak is slow growing and long lived, sometimes reaching 200 or 300
years of age [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>]. 


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Bur oak reproduces both sexually and vegetatively.  Trees are wind
pollinated [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Pollen from one tree germinates better on the stigmas
of a second tree, favoring cross-pollination [<a href="#46">46</a>].

Minimum seed-bearing age is 35, with optimum seed production occurring
between 75 and 150 years of age [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Acorns are produced in abundance
every 2 to 3 years with light crops in intervening years [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Seeds
mature within 1 year [<a href="#46">46</a>].  When conditions are favorable, acorns
germinate immediately after dropping from the tree [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Seed is
dispersed primarily by gravity and small mammals, with water playing a
lesser role [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Although most bur oak acorns germinate in the fall,
acorns of Q. m. var. olivaeformis, a northern variety, usually germinate
in spring [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Germination under laboratory conditions ranged from 45
to 99 percent, although much variation has been noted [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  The
acorns do not have a dormancy period [<a href="#40">40</a>].

Acorns are extremely vulnerable to predation by insects, small birds and
mammals, and unless germination is rapid, few seeds survive [<a href="#25">25</a>].
Studies in Iowa uplands have shown that bur oak germination is best when
litter is removed.  Litter-covered acorns appear to be more
vulnerable to rodents, insects, and fungus [<a href="#46">46</a>].

Under laboratory conditions, acorns are generally pretreated by 1 to 2
months of stratification prior to planting and are subjected to
alternating temperatures of 68 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit (20-30 deg C)
[<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Stratification is apparently not required for good
germination, however.  Seed is stored over winter in a cool, moist place
at 33 to 40 degrees F (0.6-4 degrees C) [<a href="#45">45</a>].

Under some conditions, bur oak produces plural-seeded acorns which
result in poor germination or weak and misshapen seedlings [<a href="#7">7</a>].  The
production of plural-seeded acorns is believed to be genetically
controlled, although modifications brought about by environmental
conditions may also contribute to their production [<a href="#3">3</a>].  High
production of plural-seeded acorns at a particular site may result in
decreased seedling production.

Bur oak taproots grow rapidly.  They reach approximately 9 inches (22.9
cm) before leaves unfold [<a href="#41">41</a>].

In many areas, relatively few seedlings are produced from acorns [<a href="#34">34</a>],
and vegetative regeneration is much more common.

Bur oak sprouts vigorously after fire or other disturbance.  It sprouts
prolifically from the root crown when the main stem is damaged [<a href="#28">28</a>];
however, stump sprouting has also been well documented [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].
Pole-sized or smaller trees sprout well after burning or cutting,
although the quality and form of sprouts is described as "relatively
poor" [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Larger trees also produce some sprouts.  The relationship
between the size, age, and vigor of the parent and its ability to sprout
is unknown [<a href="#46">46</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bur oak grows in a range of habitats from upland woods to valley floors
[<a href="#11">11</a>].  It occurs throughout the southern hardwood forests and through
much of the northeastern hardwood forests [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Bur oak is a prominent
constituent of oak-basswood (Quercus spp.-Tilia americana) forests,
upland oak-hickory (Quercus macrocarpa, Q. borealis, Carya cordiformis,
and Ostrya virginia) forests, mixed-oak communities (Quercus spp.), and
is transitional to sugar maple-basswood (Acer saccharum-Tilia americana)
communities of the upper Midwest [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  This species commonly forms
nearly pure savannas, occasionally interspersed with white oak (Quercus
alba).  Bur oak savannas were formerly much more abundant, but have
declined due to grazing and fire suppression [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Soils: Bur oak tolerates a wide range of soil types.  It commonly grows
on medium to somewhat coarsely-textured soils, and more rarely on clays.
It is well adapted to fairly acidic (>4.0 pH) to moderately basic,
nonsaline soils [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Optimum soil depth is greater than 20 inches (51
cm) [<a href="#7">7</a>].  It thrives on the moist flats and bottomlands along the Ohio
River and grows well on shallow uplands and bluffs on soils derived from
limestone [<a href="#40">40</a>].

Moisture regime: Bur oak is well adapted to growth on moist, rich
bottomlands with sufficient, but not excessive, amounts of water [<a href="#34">34</a>].
It is intolerant of flooding and may be killed by floods during the
growing season [<a href="#40">40</a>].  It grows in areas receiving 15 to 40 inches (38 to
102 cm) maximum annual precipitation but does best where maximum annual
precipitation averages 30 to 40 inches (76 to 102 cm) [<a href="#43">43</a>].

Associates: Species commonly growing in association with bur oak
include boxelder (Acer negundo), black ash (Fraxinus nigra), white ash
(F. americana), red maple (Acer rubrum), shellbark and bitternut
hickories (Carya laciniata, C. cordiformis), American elm (Ulmus
americana), hackberries (Celtis spp.), eastern cottonwood (Populus
deltoides), black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), basswood (Tilia
americana), northern red oak (Q. aborealis), northern pin oak (Q.
ellipscidalis), white oak (Q. alba), and swamp white oak (Quercus
bicolor) [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].

Elevation: Elevational ranges of bur oak are as follows [<a href="#6">6</a>]:

         from    3,200 to 3,500 ft (976 to 1,068 m) in MT
                 3,200 to 3,200 ft (976 to 976 m) in WY


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Bur oak may have climax or seral status depending on the site.  In many
dry, exposed areas of Wisconsin, it is a climax species.  It is also a
climax species in most areas of the Black Hills [<a href="#32">32</a>].

Bur oak is an early seral species in many mesic forest habitats of
Wisconsin [<a href="#32">32</a>].  In many areas, this species, which is moderately
intolerant of shade, is replaced by more shade-tolerant hardwoods [<a href="#40">40</a>].

Bur oak is a pioneer at prairie margins [<a href="#40">40</a>], and is a pioneer or early
seral species after fire in the Black Hills [<a href="#32">32</a>].  In parts of Minnesota
where fire is suppressed, bur oak is replaced by maple (Acer spp.) or
basswood (Tilia americana) communities [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Bur oak flowers shortly after leaves develop, but prior to or early in
the period of major stem expansion [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Initiation of flowers and
leaves in the spring is not closely related to temperature [<a href="#1">1</a>].
Flowering usually begins in April in the South, but may not begin until
June in the North [<a href="#40">40</a>].  In North Dakota, trees flowers from May through
June [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Acorns ripen from August to November [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Most seed
dispersal takes place from August to September [<a href="#45">45</a>].  The following
sequence of phenological development was recorded during a 6-year
observation period in northeastern Minnesota [<a href="#1">1</a>]:

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Bur oak bark is thick and fire resistant [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Larger trees often
survive fire [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Bur oak sprouts vigorously from the stump or
root crown after fire [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  It sprouts most prolifically from
pole-size or smaller trees, although larger trees may produce some
sprouts [<a href="#46">46</a>].

In many areas, bur oak communities may be favored by fire [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].
Without fire, seedlings of bur oak are unable to compete with other,
more shade-tolerant species [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Bur oak communities may be replaced by
more shade-tolerant maple-basswood (Acer spp.-Tilia spp.) forests with
in the absence of fire [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Smaller bur oaks can be reduced or
eliminated by frequent burning if sufficient fuels are available [<a href="#29">29</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus macrocarpa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Bur oak has a thick, fire-resistant bark at maturity [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Although
seedlings are often killed by fire, older trees generally survive [<a href="#31">31</a>].
A hot, fast fire in Minnesota oak savanna removed litter and resulted in
a dark charred surface, but did not kill mature trees [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Small grass
fires are relatively common in some bur oak savannas, and typically
kill only young trees [<a href="#31">31</a>].  In parts of northern Minnesota, mature oaks
are usually killed only by "severe" fire [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Seedlings may be killed by annual burning where adequate fuels are
present [<a href="#29">29</a>].  In some locations in Wisconsin, up to 10-year intervals
between fires may be necessary in order for fuel build-up to reach the
point where fires are hot enough to eliminate bur oak seedlings [<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Bur oak sprouts from stumps or root crowns, even when severely damaged
by fire [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Pole-size or smaller trees sprout vigorously when burned,
but sprouting of larger trees is often less vigorous.  With the
exception of seedling sprouts, the quality and form of bur oak sprout
stems are relatively poor [<a href="#46">46</a>].

Bur oak is generally favored by fire [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  It sprouts vigorously when
old growth maple-basswood (Acer spp.-Tilia spp.) forests are removed by
fire [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  In many locations, unless fire or other disturbance occurs,
the bur oak seedlings are unable to compete with more shade-tolerant
species [<a href="#25">25</a>].  On some sites in the Black Hills, bur oak sprouts may
compete well with ponderosa pine seedlings (Pinus ponderosa), and pine
encroachment of the burned-over area is often very slow [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Bur oak
may grow to a large size after fire because of its competitive advantage
on these sites [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Annual burning on sites where trees are relatively large and adequate
fuels are present can prevent bur oak from increasing [<a href="#29">29</a>].  On other
sites, an interval of up to 10 years between fires may be necessary to
allow for the build-up of sufficient fuels for fire to reduce oak trees
to shrubs and eliminate tree seedlings [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Bur oak retained preburn
densities following fire in Wisconsin pine barrens, although hot fires
did reduce oak average size.  Average frequency of bur oak on burned
plots was 28 percent and was 16 percent on unburned plots [<a href="#39">39</a>].
