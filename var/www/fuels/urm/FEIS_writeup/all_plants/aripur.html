<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of purple threeawn is Aristida
purpurea Nutt. [26, 32,60,61].  Varieties are as follows:

A. purpurea var. longiseta (Steud.) Vasey   Fendler or red threeawn
A. purpurea var. nealleyi (Vasey) Allred   blue threeawn
A. purpurea var. parishii (A.S. Hitchc.) Allred   Parish's threeawn [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>] 
A. purpurea var. purpurea Nutt.   purple threeawn [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>]
A. purpurea var. wrightii (Nash) Allred   Wright's threeawn [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>]

The typical variety of purple threeawn is referred to several times in
this report.  Since both the species as a whole (A. purpurea) and the
typical variety (A. purpurea var. purpurea) share the same common name
("purple threeawn"), the typical variety will be preceded by its
scientific name in parentheses when it is discussed in this report.
Otherwise, "purple threeawn" refers to the species as a whole.

Listings of common plant associates of purple threeawn follow.

Southern Idaho:  Associates in Fendler threeawn/Sandberg bluegrass (Poa
secunda) communities include cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), Japanese
brome (B. japonicus), Kentucky bluegrass (P. pratensis), and common
yarrow (Achillea millefolium) [<a href="#51">51</a>].

Eastern Colorado:  Common plant associates in Fendler threeawn/blue
grama-buffalograss (Bouteloua gracilis-Buchloe dactyloides) communities
include sand scurfpea (Psoralidium lanceolatum), slimflower scurfpea (P.
tenuiflorum), and plains pricklypear cactus (Opuntia polyacantha) [<a href="#39">39</a>].

Southern Arizona:  Fendler threeawn associates in desert grassland of
the Huachuca Mountains include gramas (Grama spp.), crinkle-awn
(Trachypogon secundus), Arizona threeawn (Aristida arizonica), purple
muhly (Muhlenbergia rigida), and Texas timothy (Lycurus phleoides) [<a href="#57">57</a>].

purpurea var. purpurea) in a redberry juniper (Juniperus
pinchotii)-mixed grassland community of northeastern King County, Texas,
include fragrant sumac (Rhus aromatica), littleleaf sumac (R.

</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Livestock:  In most regions, forage value of purple threeawn is only
poor to fair [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  The long awns irritate and cause abscesses in
the mouths and nostrils of grazing animals.  Livestock generally avoid
purple threeawn for most of the year when other forage is available.  In
areas where purple threeawn is abundant, livestock may make moderate use
of it in spring before awns develop and in fall and winter after seed
shatter [<a href="#56">56</a>].  In some areas of the southern Great Plains, cattle prefer
purple threeawn in winter because it is one of few plants that remain
green all season [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Small mammals:  In a Colorado study, purple threeawn was one of a
variety of grass species grazed by white-tailed jackrabbit [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Black-tailed prairie dog graze purple threeawn lightly [<a href="#18">18</a>] but do not
prefer it [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Purple threeawn is often one of the few grasses
remaining in areas severely disturbed by prairie dogs [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Purple threeawn is generally unpalatable due to its spike-like awns,
which can injure grazing animals.  It may be grazed to some extent
before seedheads are produced and after seed shatter [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Livestock
may graze new purple threeawn growth after fire [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Dyksterhuis [<a href="#13">13</a>]
reported that on post oak-blackjack oak (Quercus stellata-Q.
marilandica)/buffalograss communities in the Cross Timbers region of
Texas, cattle grazed purple threeawn only in December and January.
However, cattle on desert grassland of the Jornada Experimental Range,
New Mexico, grazed Fendler threeawn in all months of the year except
January and February [<a href="#42">42</a>].

Wildlife:  Bison on blue grama-buffalograss prairie in northeastern
Colorado commonly grazed Fendler threeawn in March and August.  In June,
Fendler threeawn was a preferred grass [<a href="#44">44</a>].  

The degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife species for
purple threeawn is rated as follows [<a href="#11">11</a>]:

Purple threeawn tends to increase with grazing.  In east-central Texas,
mean (+/- SE) purple threeawn percent cover on long-term protected sites
(39 years of cattle exclusion) and long-term grazed sites (30 years of
continuous heavy cattle grazing) was as follows [<a href="#2">2</a>]:
                  ______________________________________
                  |Long-term protected|Long-term grazed|

Threeawns (Aristida spp.) may remain important constituents of some
rangelands even after grazing is stopped or reduced.  On grama
(Bouteloua spp.) grassland on dry mesas of the Santa Rita Experimental
Range, southern Arizona, cover of blue threeawn and spidergrass (A.
ternipes var. hamulosa) on sites ungrazed for 25 years was about half
that of blue threeawn and spidergrass cover on sites in various stages
of grazing recovery.  Grama spp. cover was 36 percent on sites protected
for 25 years, and threeawn cover was 14 percent.  Canfield [<a href="#4">4</a>] suggested
that on dry mesas of Arizona, a grama-threeawn mixture may be indicative
of rangeland in good condition.

Awns of purple threeawn often catch in the fleece or hair of livestock,
causing injury and lowering the value of the fleece or hide [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Aristida purpurea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Purple threeawn is a warm-season, native perennial bunchgrass
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  It is a mid-grass, with 6- to 12-inch (15-30.5 cm) culms.
Leaves primarily grow in basal tufts, but there are a few culm leaves.
The inflorescence is a panicle.  Florets have sharp-pointed lemmas with
stiff, hairy calluses and three-parted awns.  Awns are 1 to 5 inches
(2.5-13 cm) long [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  Roots are moderately deep.  On widely
scattered sites on short- and mixed-grass prairies from South Dakota to
Kansas, Weaver [<a href="#58">58</a>] found that maximum depth of purple threeawn roots
averaged 4 feet (1.2 m).

Purple threeawn is highly competitive during droughts lasting only a few
years [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  It tends to decrease during periods of extended drought.
In eastern Colorado during the drought of 1931-1937, Fendler threeawn
nearly disappeared from the Fendler threeawn/blue grama-buffalograss
communities it once dominated.  It reestablished during the 1940's, a
decade when regional precipitation was mostly above normal [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Purple threeawn regerates by seed and by tillering [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Seed crops
are usually plentiful [<a href="#53">53</a>].  With adequate summer and fall rainfall,
plants in the Southwest may produce two seed crops:  one in spring and
one in fall [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  Second seed crops are rare, however, because
late-season rains are seldom abundant enough to support a second seed
crop [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Upon seed shatter, the seed falls nears the parent plant or
is dispersed by animals when the long seed awns catch on their hides
[<a href="#56">56</a>].  The combination of divergent awns and a sharp-pointed callus
promotes rapid penetration of seed into soil [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Purple threeawn
apparently maintains a persistent seedbank [<a href="#35">35</a>].  

Seed usually germinates in spring, but may germinate in fall in warm
climates.  There is no light requirement [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>], but high
temperatures are required for germination.  In northern locales,
temperatures high enough to stimulate purple threeawn germination
generally occur only in spring on flats and low-elevation, south- and
west-facing slopes [<a href="#15">15</a>].  In the laboratory, 3-month-old seed from
southeastern Montana showed optimum germination at 69 degrees Fahrenheit
(20 deg C).  Older seed germinated best at 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 deg
C).  Temperatures below 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 deg C) and above 86
degrees Fahrenheit (30 deg C) inhibited germination.  Neither
stratification nor light had significant effects on germination [<a href="#14">14</a>].
Seed from southern Idaho showed 92 percent germination within 10 days
with day/night temperatures of 109 and 43 degrees Fahrenheit (43 and 23
deg C).  Germination was less than 5 percent after 30 days at room
temperature.

Seedlings rapidly grow deep roots.  Greenhouse seedlings attained a
primary root length of 19 inches (37 cm) in 30 days, then began
developing secondary roots that grew downwards with little lateral
development.  Purple threeawn seedlings may not tolerate wet soils.
Purple threeawn seedlings subjected to 1 week in saturated soil followed
by 3 weeks in soil at field capacity showed no growth during the 4-week
period.  In contrast, bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata)
seedlings did not grow during saturation but grew well when soil
moisture was at field capacity [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Purple threeawn is most common on coarse-grained, xeric soils [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].
In the Intermountain region, it often dominates grassland communities on
gravelly or sandy soils [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Purple threeawn is also common on
disturbed sites such as roadsides and railway rights-of-way [<a href="#28">28</a>].  In
Colorado and the Southwest, purple threeawn is a relatively minor
species generally confined to xeric sites.  It is also described as a
minor species in the Pacific Northwest, usually occurring on sandy and
gravelly soils [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Although purple threeawn generally grows on rocky or sandy soils, it may
occur on soils of other textures [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Tisdale [<a href="#51">51</a>] reported that in
canyon grasslands of southern Idaho, the Fendler threeawn/Sandberg
bluegrass community type occurred on sandy to silty loams that were
deeper and lower in organic matter and pH than soils of surrounding sand
dropseed (Sporobolus cryptandrus)/Sandberg bluegrass communites.

Elevational ranges of purple threeawn in several states are as follows:

Arizona - 1,000 to 5,000 feet (305-1525 m) [<a href="#28">28</a>]
California - below 6,600 feet (2,000 m) [<a href="#26">26</a>]
Colorado - a few specimens have been collected from 5,300 to 6,800 feet
           (1,615-2,070 m) [<a href="#24">24</a>]; actual elevational range may be greater
Idaho - below 2,800 feet (853 m) [<a href="#15">15</a>]
Utah - 2,700 to 7,655 feet (820-2,320 m) [<a href="#61">61</a>]


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Purple threeawn is seral on most sites but is a component of stable
plant communities on some sites.  It is one of the first grasses to
establish on abandoned fields and other disturbed sites [<a href="#25">25</a>].  In
creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) communities of southwestern Nevada, it
was more common on disturbed sites than on undisturbed sites [<a href="#20">20</a>].  In
eastern Washington, it invaded and dominated an adandoned roadway in a
bluebunch wheatgrass-sand dropseed habitat type [<a href="#31">31</a>].  In northeastern
Arizona, purple threeawn was one of the first grasses to colonize
volcanic cinders [<a href="#15">15</a>].

In Intermountain grasslands and shortgrass prairie, purple threeawn is
generally a minor component of undisturbed plant communities protected
from livestock grazing [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Purple threeawn tends to increase with
heavy grazing and may persist after livestock grazing has stopped
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Bluebunch wheatgrass-sand dropseed-purple threeawn communities
of the Oregon-Idaho border are stable, covering expansive areas where
grazing was historically heavy [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Purple threeawn sometimes
dominates stable communities on undisturbed sites, however.  Daubenmire
[<a href="#9">9</a>] described a Fendler threeawn-Kentucky bluegrass community in eastern
Washington as a possible "edaphic climax."  In eastern Colorado, a
stable Fendler threeawn/blue grama-buffalograss community develops on
sandy loam soils within what is otherwise buffalograss-blue grama
prairie on clay [<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Purple threeawn generally grows in spring and early summer [<a href="#25">25</a>].  In
southern Idaho, it began growth in late March and flowered in mid-June.
Seeds reached milk-dough stage in mid-August and dehisced in September.
Plants stayed green all summer and did not put on new growth with fall
rains [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Similar development is reported in southeastern Montana
[<a href="#14">14</a>] and on Colorado shortgrass steppe [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Fendler threeawn had two growth periods on the Chihuahuan Desert of
southwestern New Mexico.  It first began growth in mid-March, flowered
in mid-April, and set mature fruit in May.  A second period of growth
occurred from mid-July through mid-September [<a href="#34">34</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Aristida purpurea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Purple threeawn is generally reduced by fire for several growing
seasons.  Wright and others [<a href="#63">63</a>] found that purple threeawn cover
usually decreased after fire on the southern Great Plains.  Purple
threeawn cover was not greatly reduced by fire, however, when winter and
spring precipitation was 40 percent or more above normal.

Purple threeawn recovers from fire by tillering [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>].  It
probably also establishes from seed after fire.  It is a seedbanking
species [<a href="#35">35</a>] with seeds stored below ground, where they are insulated
from heat damage by fire [<a href="#63">63</a>].  New seeds are probably added to the
seedbank soon after fire, since seeds from off-site plants are readily
dispersed by animals [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Also, fire may stimulate seed production in
surviving plants.  Trlica and Schuster [<a href="#52">52</a>] reported that Fendler
threeawn subjected to prescribed fire produced a large seedcrop the
second growing season after fire (see PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE).

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Aristida purpurea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Threeawns (Aristida spp.) are readily harmed by fire because their
rootcrowns are close to or above the soil surface [<a href="#63">63</a>].  Purple threeawn
cover is generally reduced by fire [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>].  Purple threeawn produces
relatively large, densely culmed, fine-leaved bunches.  Since it is
grazed very little, litter usually accumulates around bunches.  Wright
and Bailey [<a href="#63">63</a>] stated that bunchgrasses with this growth habit may
continue to burn for 2 or 3 hours after fire has passed.  Such prolonged
burning transfers heat downward and damages roots.  Basal cover may be
greatly reduced or plants may be killed.  Fire-induced mortality varies,
however.  Evans [<a href="#15">15</a>] reported that only a few purple threeawn were
killed by spring prescribed fire in southern Idaho.  Small purple
threeawn bunches were killed by a second fire 2 years later.  Large
bunches were not killed by repeated burning but split into several small
bunches.

<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Fire reduced blue threeawn in a desert mountain shrub community near Big
Bend National Park, Texas.  Wildfire burned the community in November,
1975.  Prefire vegetation was dominated by sotol (Dasylirion
leiophyllum), lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla), blue threeawn, and
sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula). Precipitation was above average
in postfire years 1 and 2.  At postfire year 2, blue threeawn cover on
burned plots averaged 0.42 percent while blue threeawn cover on adjacent
unburned plots averaged 4.09 percent.  Grasses and succulents had
decreased at the expense of forbs and subshrubs.  Forb and subshrub
cover on burned plots was 650 percent greater than on unburned plots
[<a href="#3">3</a>].

Wright's and purple threeawn (Aristida purpurea var. purpurea) were
slightly to greatly reduced for at least two growing seasons following
chaining and burning in a redberry juniper (Juniperus erythro- 
carpa)-mixed grassland community in King County, Texas.  In 1979
or 1980, plots were chained, chained and broadcast burned in March, or
left untreated (control).  Fine fuel loads averaged 2,264 lbs/acre
(2,573 kg/ha) in 1979 and 1,327 lbs/acre (1,508 kg/ha) in 1980.  Weather
conditions were:  relative humidity 25 to 40 percent, temperature 68 to
78 degrees Fahrenheit (20-26 deg C), and winds 7.7 to 14.4 miles/hour
(12-24 km/hr).  Fire spread was "excellent" in both years, with nearly 100
percent coverage.  Precipitation following the 1979 fire was above
average; drought followed the 1980 fire.  Combined yield of Wright's and
purple threeawn was [<a href="#47">47</a>]:

Prescribed fire on the Texas Technological College Research Farm near
Amarillo had little effect on Fendler threeawn size but stimulated
seedstalk production.  Six plots were used.  Two plots were burned in
fall, 1965 (1 with and 1 against the wind); two plots were burned in
spring, 1966 (1 with and 1 against the wind); one plot was burned
summer, 1966 (with the wind); and one plot was not burned (control).
There were no significant differences in soil moisture between plots at
the time of the fall or spring fires.  Basal diameters of Fendler
threeawn plants decreased between 1966 and 1967 on plots burned 2 years
in succession, but either maintained or increased in size on the
unburned control plot and plots burned only once the previous year.
Height and seedstalk production decreased between 1966 and 1967
regardless of treatment.  Relative to the control plot, fire had little
effect on seedstalk numbers the first growing season after fire.
However, in the second growing season (1967), Fendler threeawn seedstalk
numbers were greater on all burned plots compared to the control plot.
Average seedstalk production and average maximum height of Fendler
threeawn was [<a href="#52">52</a>]:

Fendler threeawn was reduced following wildfire in a cheatgrass stand in
north-central Utah.  Vegetation had been sampled at the end of the 1955
