<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The accepted scientific name for California hazel is Corylus cornuta
Marsh. var. californica (A. DC.) Sharp [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  The genus Corylus
comprises 15 species, most of which occur in Asia.  Corylus cornuta is
the only species native to the United States [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Corylus cornuta is
distributed across North America.  Corylus cornuta var. californica is
the Pacific Coast entity of the species [<a href="#5">5</a>]; C. cornuta Marsh. var.
cornuta (beaked hazel) is a shrub occupying the eastern range of the
species [<a href="#17">17</a>].  There are two recognized forms of C. cornuta var.
californica [<a href="#5">5</a>]:

        C. cornuta var. californica forma californica
        C. cornuta var. californica forma glandulosa (Boivin)
                        stat.nov.(C. cornuta var. glandulosa Boivin).

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Corylus cornuta var. californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
California hazel occurs in California, Oregon, Washington, and British
Columbia [<a href="#26">26</a>].  In California it occurs along the Coast Range from Santa
Cruz County northward along the coast to Del Norte County, eastward
through Siskiyou County, and southward in the Sierra Nevada to Tulare
County [<a href="#22">22</a>].  In Oregon and Washington it occurs mostly west and
occasionally east of the Cascades [<a href="#13">13</a>].  In British Columbia it occurs
on the lower mainland and on Vancouver Island [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Intermediate forms of C. cornuta var. californica x C. cornuta var.
cornuta may occur in the Fraser Canyon and Columbia Forest Region of
British Columbia [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Corylus cornuta var. californica forma glandulosa is frequently found
along the Pacific Coast.  It is more frequent than C. cornuta var.
californica forma californica on southern Vancouver Island but becomes
scarcer inland [<a href="#5">5</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Corylus cornuta var. californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>



<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
In some localities, California hazel is browsed extensively by livestock
and wildlife; in others it is scarcely used.  Utilization depends on the
relative palatability and abundance of associated vegetation in a given
area [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  In California, it is considered of slight importance as
browse for mule deer [<a href="#28">28</a>].  In western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla)-red
alder (Alnus rubra) forests in Oregon and Washington, it provides good
big game browse [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Birds consume the buds and catkins [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Nuts of California hazel are a staple food of the Steller's Jay,
chickaree, Townsend's chipmunk, Allen's chipmunk, golden-mantled
squirrel, and digger squirrel [<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability of California hazel ranges from fair to poor for most
livestock and wildlife species [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
California hazel is valuable as a soil binder on steep slopes [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The edible nuts of California hazel have a sweet flavor and are commonly
collected [<a href="#26">26</a>].  The glandular hairs (spiculae) on the nut husk
(involucre) have been used as a remedy for parasitic intestinal worms
[<a href="#26">26</a>].  Native peoples used the slender 1- and 2-year-old twigs for
basket making [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Beaked hazel has long been recognized as a major deterrent to the
successful regeneration of upland conifers [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Heavilin [<a href="#14">14</a>], however,
reported that California hazel shrubs up to 16 feet tall did not appear
to deter succsessful establishment and growth of Douglas-fir
(Psuedotsuga menziesii) seedlings planted under them.

Chemical application is an effective method for control of California
hazel.  Most herbicidal applications to this shrub result in good
top-kill; resulting root sprouts are less than one-third of the original
plant height after two growing seasons [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Heavy browsing by deer can stimulate beaked hazel to produce basal
sprouts or suckers.  A 1952 clipping experiment produced similar results
[<a href="#12">12</a>].  Total twig production was increased for 3 years under heavy
clipping, but thereafter began to decline.  Light clipping had little
impact on growth [<a href="#12">12</a>].  The response of California hazel to clipping
would probably be similar to that of beaked hazel.  California hazel,
however, does not have the ability to sprout from lateral root suckers.

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Corylus cornuta var. californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
California hazel is an erect, deciduous, native, perennial shrub, or
occasionally small tree [<a href="#17">17</a>].  It is multistemmed and loosely spreading,
averaging 5 to 12 feet (1.5-4 m) in height.  It can exceed 20 feet (6 m)
in height and develop a treelike form with a singular trunk.  The bark
is smooth.  The twigs are brown, slender, and zigzagged.  The current
year's twigs are hairy.  Staminate flowers are borne in pedent catkins
on the previous year's twigs.  Pistillate fowers are borne singularly
from small rounded buds and have bright red stigmas.  The fruit is a
round, smooth nut with a very hard shell.  It is enclosed in a leafy sac
which protrudes beyond the nut like a beak and is covered with stiff
hairs.  These sacs are borne singularly, or in groups of two or three,
at the end of the current year's twigs.  [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>]


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  California hazel produces large seed crops at irregular
intervals, every 2 or 3 years to every 5 years [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  Late frosts can
kill flowers, and dry weather can affect fertilization [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Seed
production increases with stem age, peaking at 10 or 11 years, and
ceasing when twigs are 18 years old [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Small mammals and birds are
the primary dispersal agents [<a href="#6">6</a>].
 
Seeds have poor viablity in storage and must remain moist.  Two to six
months of chilling is required before germination can take place [<a href="#6">6</a>].
Germination rates are low.  In laboratory tests, best results were
achieved when the nuts were covered with humus to prevent drying [<a href="#12">12</a>].
Mirov and Kraebel [<a href="#18">18</a>] obtained 20 percent germination from seed
stratified for 3 months in peat moss; seeds germinated 96 days after
sowing.  Seed survival is low due to animal predation.  Although only a
small number of nuts produce seedlings, in good seed years regeneration
by seed allows California hazel to to invade new sites [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Vegetative:  California hazel sprouts from the root crown after its
aerial crown has been removed [<a href="#26">26</a>].  It does not sprout from lateral
root suckers, as beaked hazel does [<a href="#12">12</a>].  California hazel also
regenerates by layering [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
California hazel is typically found on moist and well-drained sites.  It
occurs on cool shaded sites on north-facing slopes, along streambanks,
in moist wooded canyons and slopes, in the understory of oak and conifer
forests, and in open, burned or cut-over lands [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].

Soil:  California hazel occurs on a variety of soils ranging from moist,
black loam to dry, stony soils, and even appears in crevices in rocks.
It is most abundant on the moderately fertile but stony soils of slopes,
on dry and rocky islands, and along streambanks [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Climate:  California hazel is adapted to a mild, temperate climate.  It
has lower frost resistance than beaked hazel [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Elevation:  In the coastal mountains of California and at the northern
edge of its range in British Columbia, California hazel occurs at low
elevations.  It occurs at increasingly higher elevations inland and at
its southern perimeter [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  It generally occurs below 7,000 feet
(2,134 m) in California and from sea level to 2,625 feet (0-800 m) in
British Columbia.


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
California hazel exhibits both tolerant and intolerant behavior.  It is
able to survive in the forest understory and to invade open sites.

In central Oregon, California hazel was found growing under crown
openings in a 36- to 40-year-old stand of Douglas-fir; it formed an even
shrub layer in a 20-year-old Douglas-fir plantation; and it was found
growing scattered over a recently clearcut unit [<a href="#23">23</a>].  In the Oregon
Cascades, California hazel has been listed as an invader of clearcut and
burned units of old-growth Douglas-fir (it was absent from the
undergrowth of adjacent uncut units) [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Male and female flower buds are formed in late summer and remain dormant
over the winter.  Fowers emerge in January to March before the leaves
appear [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Fruits develop by late summer or early fall [<a href="#6">6</a>]
and ripen from from September to October in California [<a href="#6">6</a>] and from
August to September in British Columbia [<a href="#5">5</a>].  In Oregon, vegetative buds
begin to swell in mid-March, three-quarters of the leaves are fully
developed by mid-June, and growth ceases in August [<a href="#12">12</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
California hazel sprouts from the root crown after the aboveground
portion of the plant has been destroyed [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tall shrub, adventitious-bud root crown

<pre><center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Corylus cornuta var. californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
The aboveground parts of California hazel are easily killed by fire,
even by light spring fires [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].

Because of their moisture requirements, seeds probably do not survive
the high temperatures and drying associated with fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
California hazel responds to spring fires by vigorous and abundant
sprouting; sprouting after summer fires is less vigorous [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Prefire
stature and density are regained in only a few years [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fire would destroy California hazel only under the most extreme fuel and
weather conditions.  Repeated spring burning conducted when the soil is
moist simply increases the number of stems present [<a href="#12">12</a>].  However,
repeated summer fires destroy hazel's ability to sprout by exposing and
destroying underground root systems and exhausting stored food reserves
[<a href="#7">7</a>].
