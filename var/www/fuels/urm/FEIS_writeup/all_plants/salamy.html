<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix amygdaloides
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Willows (Salix spp.) in general are a preferred food of moose and
beaver; peachleaf willow occurs in riparian and floodplain habitats
which these animals frequent [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Stands in Montana typically have a
good moisture regime throughout the growing season, and the understory
associates provide quality forage for both livestock and wildlife [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
In the West, willowsin general are considered to be more palatable to
sheep than to catle, but cattle may make greater use of willow because
they tend to frequent riparian areas [<a href="#40">40</a>].  The palatability of
peachleaf willow has been rated as follows [<a href="#10">10</a>]:

          CO    MT    ND    UT    WY
Cattle   fair  fair  fair  poor  fair
Sheep    fair  good  good  fair  fair
Horses   fair  fair  fair  poor  fair


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Peachleaf willow's energy value has been rated as fair and its protein
value as poor [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Peachleaf willow provides cover for numerous wildlife species.  The
degree to which it provides environmental protection during one or more
seasons has been rated as follows [<a href="#10">10</a>]:

                      CO    ND    UT    WY
Pronghorn            good  ----  ----  poor

Small nongame birds  good  ----  good  good 
Upland game birds    ----  ----  good  good
Waterfowl            ----  ----  ----  fair
      


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Cuttings of pachleaf willow can be used to revegetate disturbed riparian
areas.  Cuttings quickly stabilize disturbed alluvium, allowing other
plants to become established.  Unrooted willow stem cuttings (slips)
should be planted on sites that provide sufficient moisture to start and
maintain growth throughout the growing season [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Since willows are
sensitive to both competition and shading, dense tall grasses will
reduce transplant survival [<a href="#31">31</a>] and may need to be removed by cutting or
by herbicide application [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Although harder to plant, rooted stock
is recommended for use because it has higher survival rates [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  A
20-inch (50 cm) cutting should be planted to a depth of 12 inches (30
cm), with 8 inches (20 cm) left aboveground [<a href="#31">31</a>].  This deep planting
allows for more rooting surface to extract soil moisture and higher
amounts of carbohydrates as stored food reserves [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  Peachleaf
willow cuttings root at the base of the cut; roots appear in about 10 to
20 days, and stems in about 10 days [<a href="#31">31</a>].  If serious streambank erosion
has resulted in a nearly vertical cut bank, slope reshaping may be
necessary to enhance success of transplants.  Reshaping may not be
necessary if, through protective measures, existing vegetation is able
to stabilize the site [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  With any method of revegetation, sites
should be fenced to protect them from grazing and trampling.


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
All willows produce salicin, which chemically is closely related to
acetylsalicylic acid, commonly known as aspirin.  This is probably why
Native Americans used various preparations from willows to treat
toothache, stomach ache, diarrhea, dysentery, and dandruff [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Native
Americans also used the stems for basketry and bow making, and the bark
for tea and fabric making [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Overuse by livestock can decrease vigor and eventually kill individuals;
however, degraded stands recover rapidly after they are fenced to
exclude livestock [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Because of its soil-binding properties,
peachleaf willow helps stabilize streambanks and protect them from
erosion; stands should therefore be maintained.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix amygdaloides
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Peachleaf willow is a rapidly growing, short-lived, small- to
medium-sized deciduous tree with one to several trunks that is typically
from 20 to 40 feet (6-12 m) tall [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>] but occasionally
reaches 65 to 80 feet (20-24 m) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  Trunk diameters are typically 8
to 20 inches (20-50 cm) [<a href="#44">44</a>].  The bark is thick, yellowish brown to
dark brown, irregular, fissured, and has broad flat ridges [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  The
leaves are alternate, simple, pinnately veined, lanceolate to
ovate-lanceolate, with finely serrate margins which have 15 to 17 teeth
per inch (6-7/cm) [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  Leaves are 1 to 4 inches (2.5-10 cm)
long and 0.4 to 1.2 inches (1-3 cm) wide [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Male and female
flowers occur on separate trees as catkins.  Pistillate catkins are 1 to
3 inches (3-8 cm) long, and staminate catkins are 1 to 2 inches (3-5 cm)
long [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].

Due to their morphological similarities, peachleaf willow may be
mistaken or confused with Pacific willow (Salix lasiandra), but they can
be distinguished by differences in their bud scales [<a href="#12">12</a>] Peachleaf
willow has bud scales with free overlapping margins and are pointed at
the tip, while Pacific willow has bud scales without free overlapping
margins and are rounded at the tip.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State: Phanerophyte (mesophanerophyte)
   Undisturbed State: Phanerophyte (microphanerophyte)
   Undisturbed State: Phanerophyte (nanophanerophyte)
   Burned State: Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Peachleaf willow's regenerates primarily through the dispersal of
thousands of small seeds.  It is unable to produce suckers from lateral
roots but will resprout from its root crown or stem base following fire
or cutting [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Peachleaf willos It relies heavily on insect
pollination, especially from bees [<a href="#30">30</a>].  After fertilization, a capsule
develops which eventually splits open during spring or summer,
dispersing the numerous tiny seeds (about 2,600,000 per pound
[6,420,000/kg] [<a href="#8">8</a>]). Producing large quantities of seeds ensures that
some will fall on favorable sites [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Seeds have a cottony down which
allows them to float long distances in wind or on water.  Seeds are
non-dormant remaining viable for only a few days.  They germinate
rapidly, usually within 12 to 24 hours of dispersal if a moist seedbed
is reached [<a href="#8">8</a>].  The seeds contain significant amounts of chlorophyll,
and photosynthesis generally occurs as soon as the seed is moistened.

Regeneration may also occur through broken pieces of stems or roots,
which are transported and deposited by floodwaters, and later sprout
[<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Peachleaf willow is found along stream and river banks, pond and lake
borders, moist ravines and ditches, oxbows, roadside gullies, and
prairie sloughs [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  It is shade intolerant and requires
canopy openings to survive [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  It is tolerant of poor drainage and
prolonged flooding [<a href="#19">19</a>] but extended immersion in water for a year or
longer will cause most plants to die [<a href="#17">17</a>].
 
Soils:  Peachleaf willow occurs on a wide variety of soil textures but
is most commonly found on sandy or silty alluvium [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  It can
tolerate weakly saline or alkaline soils [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Its growth on gravel or
dense clay is poor, on clay is fair, and on sand, sandy-loam, loam,
clay-loam is good [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Associates:  Peachleaf willow is often found bordering water in riparian
or floodplain forests that contain eastern cottonwood (Populus
deltoides), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), boxelder (Acer negundo),
American elm (Ulmus americana), Woods rose (Rosa woodsii), chokecherry
(Prunus virginia), hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), and sandbar willow
(Salix exigua) [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].

Elevation:  Peachleaf willow is typically found along low elevation
streams, rivers, and ponds in the Rocky Mountains [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>]; along
streambanks in the foothills and plains of dryland regions of the
Pacific Northwest [<a href="#20">20</a>]; and along lowland floodplain forest of the Great
Plains [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  Elevational ranges for several western states are as
follows [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]:

        from 3,500 to 9,500 feet (1,067-2,896 m) in CO
        from 3,500 to 5,600 feet (1,067-1,707 m) in UT
        from 3,500 to 7,000 feet (1,067-2,134 m) in WY


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Peachleaf willow is an early successional species which pioneers
floodplain alluvium [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  In Kansas, it occurrs only as a pioneer on
newly deposited alluvium; stands maintain themselves for about 30 years,
until other riparian forest trees shade them out [<a href="#4">4</a>].  It is shade
intolerant and can therefore persist along a river's edge, where
repeated flooding prevents other species from becoming established.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Peachleaf willow is a deciduous tree.  Its catkins emerge with the
leaves in the spring [<a href="#16">16</a>].  After fruits ripen, seeds are dispersed from
spring to early summer [<a href="#8">8</a>].  The flowering times for several states are
presented below [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>]:

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix amygdaloides
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Peachleaf willow sprouts from its roots following fire [<a href="#19">19</a>].  The high
soil and fuel moisture content chracteristic of its streamside habitat
reduces the chance of fire ignition and spread.  Its numerous
wind-dispersed seeds are also important in revegetating areas following
fire [<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by wind; postfire years one and two
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by animals or water; postfire yr 1&2

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix amygdaloides
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Most fires kill only aboveground plant parts.  However, severe fires can
completely remove soil organic layers, leaving willow roots exposed and
charred, and thus eliminating basal sprouting [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Generally peachleaf willow will resprout from its roots following fire
[<a href="#19">19</a>].  Peachleaf willow is a prolific seeder, and off-site plants are
important seed sources for revegetating burned areas [<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Due to their proximity to water or high water tables, peachleaf willow
communities may serve as natural fire breaks [<a href="#19">19</a>].
