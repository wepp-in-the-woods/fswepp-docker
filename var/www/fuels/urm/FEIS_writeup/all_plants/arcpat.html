<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Greenleaf manzanita is the most common manzanita in the Great Basin and
much of the Sierra Nevada [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  From the Great Basin it ranges north
through the Oregon Cascades to Klickitat County, Washington [<a href="#22">22</a>]; east
to western Colorado [<a href="#21">21</a>]; south to the higher elevations of northern
Arizona [<a href="#31">31</a>]; and west through the Sierra Nevada to the Coast Ranges of
California north of Lake County [<a href="#44">44</a>].  There is also an isolated
occurrence of this species in Lake County, Montana [<a href="#13">13</a>].

<pre><center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arctostaphylos patula
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
A 1986 study describes the feasibility of using greenleaf manzanita and
Parry manzanita (Arctostaphylos manzanita) as raw material for
processing into products such as torula yeast, furfural, methanol,
brewer's yeast, and other assorted sugars and acids.  These products
were obtained through hydrolysis of various wood components [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Greenleaf manzanita is virtually worthless to livestock as browse
[<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  Even domestic goats only browsed this shrub when nothing
preferable was available [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].

Greenleaf manzanita is of considerable value as a food source for
wildlife.  Mature berries are eaten by bear, grouse, turkey, and song
birds [<a href="#59">59</a>].  Use of the foliage as browse by deer is ample in the fall,
winter, and spring [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Deer also browse sprouts and seedlings [<a href="#49">49</a>].

Both livestock and deer prefer the tender young shoots and seedlings
common the first couple of years following fire to the mature foliage
[<a href="#49">49</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability of greenleaf manzanita is listed as poor for cattle,
sheep, and horses.  It ranges from fair to good for various wildlife
species.  The degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife species for
greenleaf manzanita in Colorado, Utah, and California is rated as
follows [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>]:

                                CO      UT      CA

    Cattle                      ----    Poor    Poor
    Sheep                       ----    Poor    Poor
    Horses                      ----    Poor    Poor         
    Elk                         Fair    Poor    ----        
    Mule deer                   Good    Poor    Good
    Small mammals               Good    Good    ----
    Small nongame birds         Good    Fair    ----
    Upland game birds           Good    Fair    ----
    Waterfowl                   ----    Poor    ----


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
No species of manzanita provides high quality browse [<a href="#49">49</a>].  The
percentage of crude protein of browse material of greenleaf manzanita is
relatively low year-round, ranging from 5.2 to 7.8 percent [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Chaparral generally harbors numerous species of seed-eating birds and
rodents [<a href="#51">51</a>].  The value of greenleaf manzanita as cover for small
mammals and birds is good, but for large mammals is poor.  The degree to
which greenleaf manzanita provides environmental protection during one
or more seasons for wildlife species in Colorado and Utah is as follows
[<a href="#12">12</a>]:

                                  CO     UT

    Elk                          Poor   Poor      
    Mule deer                    Poor   Poor
    Small mammals                Good   Good
    Small nongame birds          Good   Good
    Upland game birds            Fair   Fair
    Waterfowl                    ----   Poor


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Because of its ability to resprout quickly from the lignotuber (as
little as 10 days to 3 weeks), this is an important species for
rehabilitating disturbed sites, especially burned areas [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  The
shrub forms a good ground cover, and through the addition of humus tends
to improve the site [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].

Seeds of this species are produced annually in large quantities and lie
dormant in the soil [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  These seeds will not germinate until
exposed to heat from fire or unless they are otherwise mechanically
scarified [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].  Seedling establishment is dependent upon seed
production prior to fire, protection during fire, microsite
characteristics, and postfire weather [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Greenleaf manzanita is listed as a superior shrub species for erosion
control on sites in the Tahoe Basin of California [<a href="#52">52</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Food:  Native peoples of the Great Basin ate the fruits occasionally and
made an extract from the leaves for use as a diuretic [<a href="#43">43</a>].  They also
made cider from the ripe fruits [<a href="#59">59</a>].  The berries can be made into
jelly, and the seeds can be ground into flour [<a href="#43">43</a>].

Landscaping:  The shrub is recommended for use in native and dryland
landscaping in California [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Livestock barrier:  Using brush fields of this shrub as natural fencing
is suggested as a method to prevent the unwanted free movement of cattle
on open range.  Unless special trails are built and maintained within
the brush, the cattle are not able to move through it [<a href="#59">59</a>].

Watersheds:  This shrub is an important cover for many critical
watersheds, especially in California [<a href="#59">59</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Timber management:  Timber concerns related to the competition of
greenleaf manzanita with regeneration of desirable tree species are as
follows:

Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) - A recent study showed that the
uncontrolled development of canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis) and
greenleaf manzanita sprouts following site preparation caused a
significant reduction in Douglas-fir seedling growth.  Growth of
Douglas-fir seedlings was enhanced by the removal of these sprouts.
Management practices that allow the development of even moderate levels
of sprout competition with newly planted seedlings will substantially
lengthen the rotation age of the stand [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  The leaves of greenleaf
mazanita have shown allelopathic qualities that have the potential to
contribute to slow regeneration of managed stands of Douglas-fir in
southern Oregon [<a href="#57">57</a>].

Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) - The growth of ponderosa pine
seedlings is severely limited by the presence of sprouting greenleaf
manzanita shrubs.  The decline in growth is due to root competition for
water.  A greenleaf manzanita crown density of only 25 percent of the
total cover resulted in a nearly 60 percent loss in tree productivity
[<a href="#47">47</a>].  Established tree seedlings seldom die from the suppressing
effects of the competing vegetation, but the growth loss could be
substantial.  Shrub crown cover of greater than 30 percent can cause
significant growth loss, and rotations can be lengthened from 1 to 20
years [<a href="#42">42</a>].

Sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) - The growth of sugar pine seedlings is
severely retarded by the presence of greenleaf manzanita in the
overstory; only 18 percent will survive in the understory over an 18- to
24-year period.  However, sugar pine seedlings will compete if given an
even start with shrub seedlings [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Brewer spruce (Picea breweriana) - The seedlings of Brewer spruce can
establish under greenleaf manzanita shrubs.  They have the ability to
grow well despite competition for soil moisture and light [<a href="#55">55</a>].

Control treatments:  The application of herbicides such as 2,4,D;
2,4,5-T; 2,4,DB; and Triclopyr ester have been proven effective in
controlling greenleaf manzanita [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  The nonsprouting form
of this shrub is particularly vulnerable to herbicidal treatment
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  The sprouting form may be more persistent and require more
frequent applications of higher concentration herbicides carried in oil
emulsions rather than water [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  Mechanical treatments, such as
slashing, disking, brushraking, and controlled burning (when done in
open areas, not in the forest understory), were ineffective as a means
of hrub control when applied alone.  This is due to the sprouting
ability of root burls, and the presence of viable seeds in the soil
[<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arctostaphylos patula
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Greenleaf manzanita is an erect native perennial shrub, approximately 3
to 7 feet (1-2 m) tall.  Its limbs are crooked, many branched, stout,
and rigid.  The twigs are covered with fine hairs.  The bark is smooth,
shiny, and reddish brown.  On older stems the bark becomes "shreddy".
Stripping occurs and exposes the light colored whitish-green wood
underneath.  Those stems that are stripped of their bark become
especially twisted and gnarled.  The evergreen leaves are bright green
to yellow-green, simple, alternate, leathery, broadly oval, hairless,
entire, and have distinct petioles.  The pinkish flowers are borne on
nodding terminal clusters.  The petals are fused together in an urn
shape.  The manzanita fruit is a berrylike drupe that looks like a small
apple.  It is dark reddish-brown to black and has a thin mealy pulp
enclosing 4 to 10 stony seeds.  The seeds may be separate or variously
coalesced [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].

Greenleaf manzanita has a heavy, turnip-shaped or globular lignotuber
which may include a tabular platform [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>].  Its roots generally
reach 10 feet (3 m) or more in depth [<a href="#24">24</a>].  

Stands of greenleaf manzanita may reach 20 to 100 hundred years of age
[<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  Lignotuber age is rarely documented.  It is difficult to
determine the age of a burl by its annual rings because the wood tissue
is swirled and arranged in an irregular pattern.  Carbon-dating
techniques have shown that burls may persist in some species of
chaparral brush for 200 hundred years or more [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Greenleaf manzanita reproduces sexually by seed.  These seeds
have an extremely thick endocarp and will not germinate unless
scarified.  Seed coat scarification may occur naturally by the high
temperatures associated with fire, mechanically by soil disturbances,
such as those associated with logging activities, or chemically
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  A recent laboratory study suggested that exposure to light
inhibited the germination of greenleaf manzanita seeds [<a href="#35">35</a>].

Seeds stored in the soil appear to have a great longevity as evidenced
by the synchronous establishment of large numbers of seedlings after
fire in 400-year-old forests [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Seed longevity is also illustrated
by the fact that there is little difference in the number of seedlings
after fires in 100-year-old stands of chaparral than after fires in
20-year-old stands [<a href="#32">32</a>].

Greenleaf manzanita produces heavy seed crops nearly every year ( 10,000
seeds per acre [24,710 seeds/ha]) [<a href="#51">51</a>].  These seeds can tolerate soil
temperatures in excess of 200 degrees F (93 degrees C) [<a href="#66">66</a>].  Animals
are the primary mode of seed dispersal [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Insects are primarily
responsible for the pollination of greenleaf manzanita flowers [<a href="#41">41</a>].
The flowers occurring on one individual are usually noncompatible [<a href="#43">43</a>].
Outcrossing and hybridization are common within this species [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

Vegetative:  Greenleaf manzanita regenerates vegetatively through
sprouting and layering.  Sprouting occurs from dormant buds located
within the root burl or lignotuber [<a href="#75">75</a>].  These buds are stimulated to
sprout after the removal of the aboveground crown [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  This
type of new growth occurs rather rapidly and may be observed in as
little as 10 days to 3 weeks [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  Greenleaf manzanita is
generally able to sprout when the plant reaches approximately 2 years of
age, as it takes about this long for the root burl to fully develop
[<a href="#24">24</a>].  Fire may promote an increase in the size of the root burl [<a href="#26">26</a>].
Forma platyphylla does not have a root burl and is not able to sprout
[<a href="#71">71</a>].

Layering may occur when manzanita branches are forced to the ground and
kept there for long periods of time, such as may occur with a heavy
snowfall.  Under conditions such as these, the branches may sprout roots
and develop into separate plants [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Greenleaf manzanita is typically found on dry sites. It
characteristically grows in full sunlight on well-drained soils.  It is
found in the openings of coniferous forests, on old burns, and in arid
chaparral belts [<a href="#59">59</a>].  It is found on a variety of aspects and at
elevations ranging between 3,100 and 10,000 feet (945 and 3,048 m)
throughout its range [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].

Soil:  Greenleaf manzanita typically occurs on soils that are
well-drained, shallow to moderately deep, and sandy loam to silty loam
in texture.  Parent materials may include sandstones, limestones, and
granite types [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].  In Utah greenleaf manzanita shows a
preference for acidic and saline soils over sodic-saline and organic
soils [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Climate:  Greeenleaf manzanita usually occurs within warm, dry, semiarid
climes [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>]. 

Elevation:  Elevational ranges for greenleaf manzanita in several
western locations follow:

Location                     Elevation                 Reference

w Colorado      7,500 to  9,000 feet (2,286-2,743 m)   [<a href="#59">59</a>]

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Greenleaf manzanita-dominated communities have been variously referred
to as grassland climax, true climax, pyric climax, and transitional
vegetation [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].

Greenleaf manzanita displays characteristics common to shade intolerant
pioneer species [<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  It begins to die back when overtopped by
trees, preferring open areas in full sunlight [<a href="#53">53</a>].  It is often one of
the first plants to become established on disturbed sites, especially
after fire [<a href="#59">59</a>].
 
When this plant occurs in locations susceptible to frequent fires, it
has the ability to regenerate quickly, allowing it to perpetually
dominate a site [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>].  On sites where fire is excluded for long
periods of time, greenleaf manzanita may provide a better microclimate
for some tree seedlings than would exist on harsh sites in full
sunlight, and it may enhance soil conditions through the addition of
organic material [<a href="#51">51</a>].  This would allow for the relatively slow but
sure establishment of the seedlings of some species of pine.  Several
authors have noted that conifers may regain site dominance from
chaparral within 10 to 30 years [<a href="#51">51</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Greenleaf manzanita flowers from late March to June, depending on
location [<a href="#59">59</a>].  In California flowering occurs from April to June
[<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>], in the Great Basin from May to June [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Flowering of this
species may be triggered by summer moisture stress [<a href="#3">3</a>].  The number of
flowers produced by a shrub is dependent upon the amount of the previous
year's precipitation.  The flower buds form 1 year prior to the time
they mature.  They are dormant the following summer, fall, and winter,
and bloom the next spring [<a href="#43">43</a>].

The fruits ripen in late summer to early fall [<a href="#59">59</a>].  Generally, this
species fruits over its entire range between July and October [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].
In Nevada, fruiting occurs from May to September [<a href="#67">67</a>].  The fruits may
occasionally persist on the shrub year-round [<a href="#62">62</a>].  The seeds are
generally dispersed in the summer and fall [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].

Most chaparral species experience the greatest amount of growth in May
and June.  Growth ceases in mid-July, due to high air temperatures and
low soil-moisture [<a href="#24">24</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Greenleaf manzanita has a dynamic relationship with fire [<a href="#18">18</a>].  This
shrub has adapted specialized reproductive processes that enhance its
ability to survive fires [<a href="#36">36</a>].  It can reestablish by sprouting from
dormant buds in the root burl or from fire-stimulated germination of
dormant residual seeds in the soil [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].  

Greenleaf manzanita is very susceptible to fire due to its stand
density, presence of volatile materials in its leaves, low moisture
content of foliage during summer, and the persistence of its dead
branches and stems [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  This shrub forms stands that are
conducive to very rapid and extensive fire spread due to its physical
and chemical characteristics [<a href="#33">33</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arctostaphylos patula
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire generally top-kills greenleaf manzanita, but severe fire may kill
it completely.  Fire generally scarifies the seed, which promotes later
germination [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
The seeds of greenleaf manzanita can survive temperatures in excess of
200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 deg C) for 40 minutes and still germinate
[<a href="#66">66</a>].


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Fire stimulates greenleaf manzanita seeds stored in the soil to
germinate [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  Germination of these seeds occurs in the
1st postfire year [<a href="#36">36</a>].  It may take 10 or more years before these
seedlings mature and produce a significant seed crop [<a href="#33">33</a>].

Unless the entire periphery of the lignotuber is deeply charred, which
seldom occurs, vigorous sprouting occurs following fire [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Shrubs
produce new sprouts from dormant buds in the lignotuber in as little as
10 days to 3 weeks [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  These new sprouts are capable of heavy
seed production by the 2nd postfire year [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Weatherspoon [<a href="#68">68</a>] reported on the effects of preharvest burning for
shrub control in a white fir (Abies concolor var. lowiana) stand in
California.  The density of greenleaf manzanita seedlings after
postharvest burning was considerably higher for spring burns than for
fall burns.  This seasonal difference was attributable to consistently
higher percent burned area in spring than in fall; in the fall burning
period the available fuels were wet due to rains.  

The density of greenleaf manzanita seedlings was not significantly
reduced by preharvest burning.  This may have been due to the relatively
low fuel-consuption levels in these burns [<a href="#68">68</a>].


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
An understanding of the dynamics of shrub reestablishment after fire is
an important fire management concern.  This is dependent upon an
understanding of shrub reproductive strategies [<a href="#33">33</a>].

When fire is used for brush control, consumption level, as well as shrub
phenology, is an important factor contributing to mortality.
Phenologically, shrubs are more resistant to fire in fall, but more
fuels are generally available for consumption at this time.  Therefore,
more destructive heat can be generated around meristematic tissues and
root crowns [<a href="#28">28</a>].  It has been reported that the greatest mortality of
shrubs occurred during high consumption burns regardless of season, and
that burning during the active aboveground growing season appeared to
increase mortality regardless of the amount of duff consumed.  Timing
controlled burns to coincide with dryer fuel conditions and active
aboveground growth may result in the highest mortality rates [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Fire can also be used to reduce or eliminate the greatly increased fire
hazard of the standing dead brush, to set back resprouting brush a
second time, and to remove the impenetrable mass of dead brush resulting
from herbicide application [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Prescribed burning in the early spring, before active shrub growth, can
be used to increase palatability of foliage to wildlife [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Studies indicate that prescribed understory burning can used
successfully to kill or reduce the vigor of greenleaf manzanita shrubs
and seedlings, deplete the amount of viable residual seed in the soil,
and thus prepare a better seedbed for pine and white fir (Abies
concolor) regeneration [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  An increase in understory slash depth
may reduce the density of manzanita seedlings [<a href="#68">68</a>].
