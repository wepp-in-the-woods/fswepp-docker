<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Buffalo grass is codominant with blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) over
most of the shortgrass prairie [<a href="#51">51</a>].  It is a common component in
mixed-grass prairie [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>], semidesert grassland of New Mexico [<a href="#17">17</a>], and
coastal prairie of Louisiana and Texas [<a href="#33">33</a>].  It is usually a minor
element in undisturbed tallgrass prairie [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  Buffalo grass also
occurs in the understory of pinyon-juniper (Pinus-Juniperus spp.),
mesquite (Prosopsis spp.), and eastern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)
woodland [<a href="#8">8</a>], and in oak-hickory (Quercus-Carya spp.) savanna of the
Cross Timbers region of Texas [<a href="#39">39</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Buchloe dactyloides
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Buffalo grass is one of the most important forage grasses of the
shortgrass and mixed-grass prairies.  All classes of livestock graze it
during all seasons [<a href="#59">59</a>].  The foliage is nutritious and palatable when
green, and its nutritional quality does not decline greatly as it cures
[<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].

Buffalo grass is also important wildlife forage.  Wildlife consumers of
buffalo grass include white-tailed deer [<a href="#22">22</a>], bison [<a href="#73">73</a>], pronghorn,
black-tailed jackrabbit [<a href="#38">38</a>], and prairie dogs [<a href="#24">24</a>]. Buffalo grass is
especially important in bison [<a href="#73">73</a>] and black-tailed prairie dog diets
[<a href="#24">24</a>].  Bison in northeastern Colorado consumed it year-round, with mean
percent composition in their diet least in May (41%) and highest in
August (84%) [<a href="#73">73</a>].  Black-tailed prairie dog also use it year-round,
consuming all parts of the plant [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Annual black-tailed prairie dog
consumption of buffalo grass averaged 23 percent in western South
Dakota, peaking in June and July (34%) and reaching a low in December
(8%) [<a href="#90">90</a>].

Mountain plover nest on blue grama-buffalo grass flats in Colorado [<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability of buffalo grass has been rated good for cattle, domestic
sheep, and horses [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Reitz and Morris [<a href="#81">81</a>] rated it one of the most
palatable grasses in Montana.  Livestock utilization may vary by region
and year, however.  In a cattle utilization study in South Dakota
mixed-grass prairie, cattle selected several other graminoids over
buffalo grass even though buffalo grass was the most productive
graminoid on the study site [<a href="#96">96</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Nutritional value of fresh, mature buffalo grass in the United States
was [<a href="#70">70</a>]:

                   Percent
dry matter          48.9
ash                  6.1
crude fiber         13.0
digestible protein  
  cattle             2.9
  domestic sheep     2.9
  domestic goats     2.7
  horses             2.7 
  rabbits            2.9

The National Academy of Sciences [<a href="#70">70</a>] also provides nutritional analyses
of fresh and cured buffalo grass in other phenological stages (immature,
dough stage, ripe, overripe), and for fresh buffalo grass-western
wheatgrass-bluestem (Grama spp.) mixes.  Energy (calories/kg) and
mineral analyses of buffalo grass are given.  Harlan [<a href="#50">50</a>] published a
nutritional analysis of buffalo grass seed.

Dittberner and Olson [<a href="#36">36</a>] rated buffalo grass fair in energy and protein
value.  They rated its nutritional value for wildlife in several states
as follows:

                      UT      CO      MT      ND

elk                   good    fair    poor    ----
mule deer             good    poor    poor    ----
white-tailed deer     ----    ----    ----    poor
pronghorn             good    ----    ----    poor

waterfowl             fair    ----    ----    ----
nongame birds         good    ----    poor    ----
small mammals         good    good    poor    ----


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Dittberner and Olson [<a href="#36">36</a>] rated the value of buffalo grass in providing
cover for wildlife as follows:

                         WY       ND

upland game birds       good     poor
small nongame birds     good     poor
small mammal cover      good     poor


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Buffalo grass sod is ranked superior in controlling erosion [<a href="#100">100</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>].
It has been ranked first among native grasses in controlling wind
erosion [<a href="#10">10</a>].  It is recommended for rehabilitating surface-mined lands
[<a href="#92">92</a>], and has been successfully established on bentonite [<a href="#87">87</a>] and coal
mine [<a href="#98">98</a>] spoils.


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Buffalo grass is planted for lawns [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>] and used in hayfield
mixtures.  It is of limited use as a hay grass when planted alone,
however, due to its short stature [<a href="#89">89</a>].

The sod houses of early Great Plains settlers were constructed mostly
from buffalo grass [<a href="#52">52</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Buffalo grass is highly resistant to grazing [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  It usually
increases under heavy grazing, especially at the expense of tallgrass
species [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>].  Its response to grazing may vary by site, however.  On
the Central Plains Experimental Range in Colorado, Archer and Tieszen
[<a href="#9">9</a>] found that buffalo grass importance value increased with moderate to
heavy continuous grazing on ridges and midridges, but decreased with
such grazing on swales.  Importance value was low on all sites with
light grazing.  Buffalo grass responses to various other grazing regimes
are described [<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>].

Buffalo grass is highly drought resistant, although somewhat less so
than blue grama [<a href="#89">89</a>].

Buffalo grass seed is commerically available [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>].  Guidelines for
seeding buffalo grass onto rangeland, or establishing it from cut sod,
are available [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>]

Marcum and Engelke [<a href="#65">65</a>] provide field test results on buffalo grass
response to various pre- and postemergent herbicides.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Buchloe dactyloides
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Buffalo grass is a warm-season, native perennial shortgrass [<a href="#20">20</a>].  It is
drought-, heat-, and cold-resistant [<a href="#106">106</a>].  Foliage is usually 2 to 5
inches (5-13 cm) high, though in the southern Great Plains foliage may
reach 12 inches (30 cm) [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].  Buffalo grass is usually dioecious.
Plants are occasionally monoecious, sometimes with perfect flowers
[<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  Flowerstalks are 4 to 8 inches (10-20 cm) tall [<a href="#100">100</a>].
The male inflorescense is a panicle; the female inflorescense consists
of short spikelets borne in burlike clusters, usually with two to four
spikelets per bur [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>].

Buffalo grass sends out numerous, branching stolons [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>];
occasionally it also produces rhizomes [<a href="#85">85</a>].  Roots are also numerous
and thoroughly occupy the soil [<a href="#100">100</a>].  The numerous stolons and roots
form a dense sod [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>].  Buffalo grass roots are finer than those of
most plains grasses, being less than 1 mm in diameter.  Weaver [<a href="#100">100</a>]
found that in the Great Plains, buffalo grass roots in silty loam
reached 5 feet below ground, with 70 percent of roots (by weight)
occurring in the first 6 inches (15 cm) of soil.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Primarily dioecious, buffalo grass usually outcrosses by wind
pollination [<a href="#77">77</a>].  The monoecious sex form is more common in peripheral,
sparse populations, and monecious plants may be self-fertile [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Seed
production on native grasslands in Kansas was greatest when
above-average rainfall occurred in May and June; seed production was
lowest when rainfall during that period was below average [<a href="#27">27</a>].  At
dispersal the entire bur, with seeds still inside, abscises from the
plant.  Burs usually disperse close to the parent plant; they cling only
briefly, if at all, to animals or clothing [<a href="#76">76</a>].  Fresh seed is usually
dormant, requiring abrasion or overwintering to break dormancy.  Degree
of dormancy, however, has been found to vary between populations [<a href="#78">78</a>].
Light is required for germination [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Ahring and Todd [<a href="#2">2</a>] found that
prechilling at 41 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit (5-10 deg C), drying seeds
for 6 to 48 hours at 104 to 158 degrees Fahrenheit (40-70 deg C), or
soaking seeds 1 to 72 hours in sodium hypochlorite greatly increased
germination.  Fulright and others [<a href="#43">43</a>] provide a summary of recommended
buffalo grass seed stratification regimes.  Reports of germinative
capacity of fresh seed that has been stratified and scarified range from
45 to 70 percent.  Seed has remained viable in the seedbank for at least
7 years [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Twenty-five-year-old seed recovered from the walls of an
abandoned sod house in Kansas was 15 to 78 percent viable [<a href="#64">64</a>].
Germination rates are usually better when seed remains within the bur
[<a href="#76">76</a>].

In a seedbank study on the Central Plains Experimental Range, Colorado,
buffalo grass seedling density in fine-textured soil samples gathered
over a 15-month sampling period averaged 112 plants per square meter
[<a href="#25">25</a>].  Seedlings grow rapidly under favorable conditions.  They have
produced stolons by 2 months of age.  By the end of their first summer,
seedlings grow a thick root mass that extends 2 feet (0.6 m) below
ground [<a href="#100">100</a>].

Vegetative reproduction through spreading stolons is rapid given
favorable environmental conditions [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Buffalo grass stolons have
grown as rapidly as 2.25 inches (5.72 cm) per day [<a href="#69">69</a>].  Buffalo grass
also spreads by tillering [<a href="#106">106</a>].  Following drought in western Kansas,
buffalo grass cover increased vegetatively from 2 percent in 1940 to 93
percent in 1943.  Buffalo grass has been reported to spread vegetatively
following depletion even when heavily grazed [<a href="#101">101</a>].  Although blue grama
is more drought resistant, buffalo grass usually recovers more quickly
after drought through vegetative reproduction [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Buffalo grass occurs on all soil textures [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  It is most common on
clay, then fine-textured loam.  It is rare on sandy soils [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>].
Soils supporting buffalo grass are usually alkaline [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>], with a
high water-holding capacity (33-66%) [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Buffalo grass grows mostly
on dry uplands and/or disturbed sites in mixed- and tallgrass prairie
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  It grows best in regions of the Great Plains where annual
precipitation ranges between 12 and 25 inches (305 and 635 mm) [<a href="#106">106</a>].
It is widely adapted, however, to extremes in climate and elevation
[<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>].  Elevation at which buffalo grass occurs ranges from 2,000
feet (600 m) in Montana to 6,300 feet (1,890 m) in Wyoming [<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Buffalo grass appears in early to mid-stage secondary succession [<a href="#4">4</a>].
Costello [<a href="#28">28</a>] described an old-field successional sequence in
north-central Colorado where the inital stage was dominated by annuals,
followed by perennial forbs.  Buffalo grass appeared after the perennial
forbs, 10 to 20 years after abandonment.  

Buffalo grass is common on disturbed sites such as prairie dog towns
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>].  In a pattern similar to old-field succession, buffalo grass
established after forbs and three-awns (Aristida spp.) but before
mid-grasses such as silver bluestem (Bothriochloa saccharoides) and
sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula) on an abandoned black-tailed
praire dog town in Oklahoma tallgrass prairie [<a href="#71">71</a>].

Buffalo grass often establishes dominance in mixed-grass prairie with
drought or heavy grazing, and may invade tallgrass prairie under such
conditions [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>].  Buffalo grass may not require disturbance in order
to maintain dominance on all sites, however.  It dominated fine-textured
clay soils in a remnant mixed-grass Kansas prairie that had not been
grazed or burned for 68 years [<a href="#57">57</a>].  Van Auken and Bush [<a href="#97">97</a>] found that
honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa var. glandulosa) was unable to
invade high-density buffalo grasslands in Texas.

Buffalo grass is somewhat shade tolerant, but cannot tolerate dense
shade [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>].

Clements [<a href="#23">23</a>] described buffalo grass-blue grama shortgrass prairie as
"proclimax:"  a community held indefinitely from reaching "climax
condition" by the natural disturbances of grazing and fire.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Buffalo grass growth begins in late spring and continues through summer
[<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>].  In the Great Plains flowering occurs mostly from April to
June, but male plants may flower until late summer or fall [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Period
of heaviest flowering varies by location.  Flowering is reported from
July through August in eastern Colorado [<a href="#35">35</a>].  August flowering is also
reported from Kansas, with male plants beginning flowering slightly
before female plants [<a href="#103">103</a>].  Seed ripens from early summer to late fall,
depending upon location.  Early July seed ripening is reported from
Kansas [<a href="#27">27</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Buchloe dactyloides
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fire was an essential component of presettlement prairie ecosystems
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>].  Prior to European settlement, buffalo grass
probably burned in all seasons [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Areas dominated by warm-season
grasses such as buffalo grass can carry fire even in winter and early
spring [<a href="#12">12</a>], and Native Americans apparently burned various portions of
the prairie year-round [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Buffalo grass survives grassland fire by several mechanisms.  Vegetative
regeneration is probably most important.  Basal meristems are generally
protected from grassland fire by soil and/or damp litter.  Some stolon
apices are usually protected by damp litter [<a href="#107">107</a>].  Buffalo grass
regenerates after fire by basal tillering and sprouting from unburned
stolon buds.  Recovery time greatly accelerates when plants become
vigorous enough to spread by stolons.  Buffalo grass also regenerates
from seed following fire [<a href="#108">108</a>].  Because it is enclosed in a bur,
buffalo grass seed is more protected from fire than seed of most grass
species.  Buffalo grass burs have been shown to greatly reduce fire and
heat damage to enclosed seed [<a href="#76">76</a>].  Regeneration from seed is slower
than vegetative regeneration, however, and is probably most important
when severe fire has killed a large proportion of stolon and basal buds.

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Buchloe dactyloides
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Buffalo grass is not completely consumed in most grassland fires.
Typically the upper part of the plant burns, and damage to basal
portions of the plant is uncommon [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>].  With grassland fires, flames
fanned by even light winds seldom stay in one spot long enough to
produce high temperatures at the soil surface.  Fire intensities lethal
to native perennial grasses such as buffalo grass rarely, if ever, occur
during prescribed grassland fire [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Even with wildfires,
temperatures near perennating tissues at the soil surface are usually
not lethal.  Unburned stubble often remains after fire has passed, and
shallowly placed buds and seeds are unharmed [32 and references
therein].  Wildfire occurring during drought, however, may generate
temperatures high enough to kill buffalo grass perennating buds [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].
Lethal temperatures may also occur at the soil surface if woody plant
invasion into grassland has occurred.  Soil surface temperatures tend to
rise when woody plants burn, and elevated temperatures last for longer
periods of time [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Burning generally either favors buffalo grass or has no long-term effect
upon it [<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>].  In some studies, buffalo grass productivity is
unchanged or increases in the first postfire year [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Wright [<a href="#110">110</a>]
concluded from several studies that in western Texas, buffalo grass was
neither harmed nor favored by fire.  In southern Nebraska, April burning
of loess hill mixed-grass prairie had no significant (p=.1) effect on
buffalo grass cover the following June or Septemeber.  However, buffalo
grass cover on burn plots had increased significantly compared to
control plots by the second September after fire [<a href="#84">84</a>].

Fire had no long-term effect on buffalo grass at the Kansas Agricultural
Experimental Station.  Launchbaugh [<a href="#63">63</a>] reported that after a March
wildfire in shortgrass prairie there, buffalo grass cover at postfire
year 1 was reduced by 48 percent on burned areas as compared to adjacent
unburned areas; height at the end of the first growing season was 6.7
inches (17.0 cm) on burned sites and 11.9 inches (30.2 cm) on unburned
sites.  By postfire year 2, buffalo grass cover on burned sites was 39
percent less than on unburned sites, and by postfire year 3 there was no
significant difference in buffalo grass cover between burned and
unburned sites.

Buffalo grass recovery time may vary depending upon phenological stage,
season of burning, fire severity, and/or postfire weather conditions.
In a bluestem (Andropogon gerardi and Schizacharium scoparium) pasture
in Kansas, buffalo grass declined under 10 years of early (20 March) and
late spring (1 May) annual burning compared to annual mid-spring (10
April) and no burning.  Buffalo grass basal cover (%) after 10 years was
[<a href="#5">5</a>]:

                   Percentages followed by the same letter
                   do not differ significantly (p<0.05).

Spring (April) prescribed burning in mixed-grass praiaire in Badlands
National Park, South Dakota, favored buffalo grass.  Buffalo grass began
vegetative expansion and produced seed during the first growing season
after fire [<a href="#107">107</a>].  Compared to the control (no burn), buffalo grass
standing crop increased for 2 to 3 postfire years, then returned to
approximate prefire levels with onset of a drought [<a href="#108">108</a>].

Buffalo grass increased significantly (p=0.05) after various treatments
involving prescribed burning on the South Texas Plains-Texas Gulf
Prairie interface.  Burning was effected to reduce woody plant invasion.
Treatments were shredding, chopping, or scalping followed by prescribed
burning 2 years later, and a control (prescribed burning only).  All
prescribed burning was done in September 1965.  Percentage composition
of buffalo grass in July 1966 was [<a href="#14">14</a>]:

Brush cover was significantly (p=0.05) reduced from prefire levels at
postfire year 1, although less than 15 percent of woody plants were
actually killed by the fire [<a href="#14">14</a>].

In another southern Texas study on the Rob and Bessie Welder Wildlife
Refuge, plots were subjected to a fall (September) fire, a winter
(December) fire, or a fall fire with a winter reburn the following year.
Burning was conducted in 1965 and 1966.  Buffalo grass production
(lb/acre) in August 1967 was [<a href="#15">15</a>]:

        Control          Fall          Winter          Fall & Winter

April prescribed burning in cultivated buffalo grass in Kansas reduced
subsequent summer seed yield.  Unburned portions of the field produced
303 pounds of buffalo grass seed per acre compared to 79 pounds per acre
on the burned portion [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fall burning in a shortgrass-mixed-grass transition zone of the Flint
Hills of Kansas reduced prairie threeawn (Aristida oligantha), an annual
grass with little to no forage value for livestock, and increased
relative abundance of the dominant perennial grasses, buffalo grass and
blue grama.  Percentages of total herbage production in fall, 1972, with
no burning, fall burning, and spring burning, were [<a href="#72">72</a>]:

            prairie threeawn     Perennial grasses     Western ragweed
            ----------------     ------------------     ---------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1=burned 4 April 1972; 2=burned 8 November 1971   

April prescribed fire in mixed-grass prairie of southern Nebraska also
reduced nonnative, cool-season annuals and increased the native,
warm-season dominants, buffalo grass and blue grama [<a href="#84">84</a>].

There was no significant relationship between fireline intensity and
postfire response of buffalo grass after spring burning in western Texas
grassland.  High-intensity (approximately 5,570 kW/m) headfire did no
more damage to buffalo grass than low-intensity (approximately 70 kW/m)
headfire [<a href="#83">83</a>].

Buffalo grass mortality may be higher with backfires than headfires.
Being more slow-moving, backfires tend to generate more heat at ground
level [<a href="#45">45</a>].

Wright has provided prescriptions for burning buffalo grass in the
central and southern Great Plains [<a href="#111">111</a>], the Edwards Plateau [<a href="#115">115</a>] and
Rio Grande Plains [<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>] regions of Texas, and in chained
mesquite-tobosa communities [<a href="#112">112</a>].

<b>CASE NAME : </b>
Postfire forage production in Custer State Park, SD


<b>REFERENCE : </b>
Easterly, T. G.; Jenkins, K. J. 1991 [<a href="#40">40</a>]


<b>SEASON/SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION : </b>
spring/variable


<b>STUDY LOCATION : </b>
The study area was on the north edge of French Creek Natural Area in
Custer State Park, South Dakota.


<b>PREFIRE VEGETATIVE COMMUNITY : </b>
The study area was a mosaic of mixed-grass prairie and ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa) forest.  Prairie was dominated by buffalo grass
(Buchloe dactyloides), bluegrasses (Poa spp.), gramas (Bouteloua spp.),
and western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii).  The forest understory was
dominated by sedges (Carex spp.) and bluegrasses.


<b>TARGET SPECIES PHENOLOGICAL STATE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>SITE DESCRIPTION : </b>
General:  Site description was not given in detail.  Aspect and slope
were variable.  Mean annual temperature at Custer, South Dakota (20 km
northwest), was 42 degrees Fahrenheit (6 deg C).  Mean annual
precipitation was 18.4 inches (460 mm).  Annual precipitation at Custer
State Park was 14.9 inches (372 mm) in 1987 and 13.5 inches (337 mm) in
1988.

Burn days:  Peak temperature was 75 deg Fahrenheit (23 deg C) on 27
April 1987 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit (28 deg C) on 28 April 1987.
Relative humidity ranged from 17 to 34 percent.  Winds were from the
south to southeast at 13 to 42 miles per hour (8-25 km/hr).  Fine fuel
moisture was approximately 5 percent.


<b>FIRE DESCRIPTION : </b>
Primary goals of the study were to reduce encroachment of ponderosa pine
onto the prairie and increase forage available to bighorn sheep.  The
235-acre (94-ha) burn was conducted on 27 and 28 April 1987.
Strip-firing techniques were used to meet different burn objectives in
different areas.  In meadows and sites dominated by cool-season species,
fire intensity was low and flame length was less than 12 inches (30 cm).
Green-up of cool-season herbaceous species in the fall before the fire
resulted in an incomplete burn pattern with large unburned patches.
Sites dominated by warm-season species including buffalo grass burned
hotter than cool-season sites, with flame lengths of 18 to 30 inches
(45-75 cm).  Fire intensities in forested areas varied widely depending
upon fuels, aspect, time of day, and width of firing strip.  Some direct
mortality of pines occurred due to fire in tree crowns.


<b>FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES : </b>
Percent cover of buffalo grass in July was:

                 1987                             1988
           __________________               __________________

              4         2                      5         3


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS : </b>
Spring prescribed burning increased buffalo grass cover within the
2-year study period, and reduced ponderosa pine cover.

Burning in mixed-grass prairie increased production of forbs and
warm-season grasses including buffalo grass.  Utilization of herbaceous
species by elk, deer, and bison was higher in burned than unburned
areas.  Of all the Park ungulates, bison used the burns most intensively,
with their use peaking in summer.  Prescribed burning did not, however,
increase the amount of forage available to bighorn sheep in late summer
and presumably, winter.

Mortality of ponderosa pine over the study area was approximately 50
percent.  Pine expansion into mixed-grass prairie was curtailed.
