<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
Dispute over the taxonomic placement of Cercocarpus betuloides Nutt. has
been considerable.  Martin's [<a href="#32">32</a>] 1950 taxonomic revision of the genus
Cercocarpus reduced C. betuloides to several varieties of C. montanus
Raf. [see SYNONYMS above].  Some taxonomists have adopted Martin's
revision [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>], while others treat C. betuloides and C. montanus as
distinct species [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  In this report, C. betuloides is
recognized as a distinct species, birchleaf mountain-mahogany, found in
southern Oregon, California, and Arizona.  Plants found in the
Intermountain and Rocky Mountain regions are C. montanus, true
mountain-mahogany.

Munz [<a href="#37">37</a>] recognizes three varieties of birchleaf mountain-mahogany:

  var. betuloides
  var. blancheae (Schneid.) Little
  var. macrourus (Rydb.) Jeps.

Plants on Santa Catalina Island off the coast of southern California
were once considered a fourth variety, var. traskiae (Eastw.) Dunkle,
but are now recognized as a distinct species:  C. traskiae, Catalina
mountain-mahogany [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Birchleaf mountain-mahogany is a primary component of many chaparral
communities and is a dominant or codominant in localized areas.  It is
codominant with shrub live oak (Quercus turbinella) in Arizona
chaparral.  Other common associates in Arizona chaparral include desert
ceanothus (Ceanothus greggii), Wright buckwheat (Rhamnus crocea), datil
yucca (Yucca baccata), sugar sumac (Rhus ovata), hollyleaf buckthorn
(Rhamnus crocea), broom snakewood (Gutierezia sarothrae), and Arizona
oak (Quercus arizonica) [<a href="#8">8</a>].  In California chaparral, associates
include eastwood manzanita (Arctostaphylos glandulosa), desert
ceanothus, chaparral whitethorn (Ceanothus leucodermis), chamise
(Adenostoma fasciculatum), scrub and live oaks (Quercus spp.),
buckthorns (Rhamnus spp.), and sumacs (Rhus spp.) [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cercocarpus betuloides
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Birchleaf mountain-mahogany is a valuable browse for ungulates.  In
California, it is listed as one of primary browse species of deer in the
north and south Coast Ranges, along the west slope of the Sierra Nevada,
and in the southern mountain ranges [<a href="#4">4</a>]. Mule deer and white-tailed deer
consumption of birchleaf mountain-mahogany is light to heavy in the late
fall, winter, and spring [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
In California, birchleaf mountain-mahogany's palatability is rated as
good for cattle, good to excellent for sheep and goats, poor to good for
horses, excellent for mule deer, and good for bighorn sheep [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Birchleaf mountain-mahogany is a nutritious ungulate browse.  The
protein content of leaves and twigs is somewhat higher than that of many
associated browse species [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Seasonal variation in birchleaf
mountain-mahogany twig and leaf chemical constituents has been reported
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Birchleaf mountain-mahogany presumably provides cover for a wide variety
of animals, both in chaparral and forest communities.


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Birchleaf mountain-mahogany's ability to survive on harsh sites makes it
a useful candidate for erosion control of arid mountain slopes [<a href="#10">10</a>].
Its use in rehabilitation projects, however, has been very limited due
to problems with seedling establishment.  Work with true
mountain-mahogany suggests that plants can be established via fall
planting [<a href="#39">39</a>].

Selective breeding within the Cercocarpus genus may provide crosses
useful for rehabilitation work.  Monsen and Davis [<a href="#36">36</a>] suggest that
hybrids of true and birchleaf mountain-mahogany would retain the
favorable adaptive traits of their parents, including nondormant
seeds and an improved growth rate.


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Native Americans used the strong wood of birchleaf mountain-mahogany to
make fish spears, arrow shafts, and digging sticks.  They used the inner
bark for many medicinal purposes and to produce a purple dye [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Biological control:  Browsing by domestic goats can reduce brush growth.
Studies in Arizona and California show that birchleaf mountain-mahogany
is highly preferred by goats, and that managed herds can keep this plant
closely browsed [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  In Arizona, birchleaf mountain-mahogany height
in browsed areas was 67 percent less than in unbrowsed areas [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Chemical control:  Phenoxy herbicides have generally been ineffective in
controlling sprouting chaparral shrubs.  Fenuron and picloram applied to
the soil as pellets are more effective, killing 54 and 94 percent of
birchleaf mountain-mahogany, respectively, 3 years after application
[<a href="#7">7</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cercocarpus betuloides
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Birchleaf mountain-mahogany is an erect, open shrub or small tree.
Plants are typically 5 to 12 feet (1.5-3.6 m) tall but occasionally grow
up to 20 feet (6 m) [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Birchleaf mountain-mahogany height varied as
follows in different aged chaparral stands in southern California [<a href="#17">17</a>]:

9-21 years          5.2       1.6              7.8       2.4
22-40 years         6.6       2.0              7.5       2.3
40+ years           7.2       2.2              9.1       2.7

Mature birchleaf mountain-mahogany plants typically have considerable
amounts of dead branches [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Simple, alternate, wedge-shaped leaves,
up to 1 inch (2.5 cm) long, are borne on spurlike branchlets [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Bark
is smooth and gray.  The fruit is a soft, hairy, tubular achene with a
2- to 3-inch-long (5-7.5 cm) feathery style at the tip [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Microphanerophyte
   Nanophanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Birchleaf mountain-mahogany begins producing seed at about 10 years of
age.  Seed crops vary from very light to very heavy [<a href="#3">3</a>].  The seeds are
not dormant and germinate readily without pretreatments.  The fruit and
awned-seeds are dispersed widely by wind, and occasionally by animals
[<a href="#10">10</a>].  Seedling establishment is infrequent and is probably substantial
only in years of high precipitation.

Birchleaf mountain-mahogany sprouts vigorously from the root crown after
top-killing disturbances [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Birchleaf mountain-mahogany occupies dry foothills and lower mountain
slopes and ridges [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  It is most abundant in chaparral
vegetation types but is also common at its upper elevational limits in
the understory of pinyon-juniper (Pinus edulis, P. monophylla-Juniperus
spp.), oak (Quercus wislizeni, Q. chrysolepis), and pine (Pinus
ponderosa, P. sabiniana) woodlands [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

In southern California, birchleaf mountain-mahogany occurs in both
coastal (west of the mountain range crest) and desert chaparral stands
(east of the crest) but generally makes up a greater percentage of the
cover in desert chaparral.  It is often associated with north-facing
aspects.  On coastal exposures it becomes more abundant with increasing
elevation [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Elevational range is 3,000 to 6,500 feet (915-1,982 m)
in Arizona, and 500 to 6,000 (152-1,829 m) in California [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Birchleaf mountain-mahogany is a stable member of chaparral communities.
The plant is a long-lived vigorous sprouter and neither a regime of
frequent fires nor long fire-free periods will eliminate it.  During
long, fire-free intervals, birchleaf mountain-mahogany rejuvenates its
canopy by resprouting, ensuring continuous recruitment of new stems from
an established root crown [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Under a regime of frequent fires,
postfire sprouting ensures little demographic change [<a href="#18">18</a>].  In Arizona,
shrub live oak-birchleaf mountain-mahogany communities are considered
climax types [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Burcham [<a href="#6">6</a>] reported that in certain situations in southern California,
pinyon-juniper communities may be replaced by birchleaf
mountain-mahogany and desert ceanothus following fire.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Birchleaf mountain-mahogany has been variously described as evergreen,
deciduous, and partly deciduous.  In some areas it apparently loses 25
to 75 percent of its leaves each fall [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Flowering in California is
from March to May [<a href="#9">9</a>], and in Arizona from March to July [<a href="#21">21</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Birchleaf mountain-mahogany sprouts from the root crown following
top-kill by fire.  Sprouting is usually the only method of postfire
regeneration [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Seedling establishment occurs infrequently from seed
blown onto the burn from off-site plants [<a href="#18">18</a>] or from on-site seeds that
fall from the crown of lightly burned plants [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cercocarpus betuloides
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Plant:  Most fires top-kill birchleaf mountain-mahogany.  It is a common
component of chaparral where severe wildfires often defoliate all
aboveground vegetation and leave only charred stems and a layer of ash
over mineral ash [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  Birchleaf mountain-mahogany is a strong
resprouter, and survival is usually high; however, 25 to 60 percent
mortality has been observed following hot chaparral fires [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

Seed:  Birchleaf mountain-mahogany seeds are not heat-resistant and are
easily destroyed by fire.  Seeds on the ground are especially vulnerable
to heat damage; seeds in the crown of lightly damaged plants may
occasionally survive [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Birchleaf mountain-mahogany sprouts vigorously following fire, and
recovery is relatively rapid.  Sprouting is independent of the growing
season and can begin as soon as 10 days after burning [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Sixty-four
percent of preburn plants had sprouted within 4.5 months of an intense
summer chaparral fire in southern California [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Sprouts grow
rapidly.  After one growing season, fire-borne sprouts in southern
California were taller than those of associated shrubs, averaging
between 12 and 27 inches (31-69 cm) tall [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Six to eight years after
fire, birchleaf mountain-mahogany sprouts are often 5 or 6 feet (1.5-1.8
m) tall [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Sprouts have produced seed as early as 5 years after
fire [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Small numbers of seedlings have been observed on some burns [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].
Mortality of postfire seedlings may be high.  Sweeny [<a href="#43">43</a>] observed that
about 75 percent of first year birchleaf mountain-mahogany seedlings
were dead 4 years after fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Percentage of dead arial fuels is higher for birchleaf mountain-mahogany
than for associates such as chamise, manzanitas, and scrub oak (Quercus
dumosa).  Nearly all of these dead fuels are consumed during fire.
Birchleaf mountain-mahogany, however, contains less volatile fats, oils,
and terpines than do many of its associates, and is therefore much less
flammable [<a href="#15">15</a>].  During prescribed fires in southern California, chamise
and manzanitas burned intensely, with 75 to 85 percent of live fuels
consumed, while only 45 percent of birchleaf mountain-mahogany live
fuels were consumed [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Birchleaf mountain-mahogany sprouts of fire origin are highly palatable
to deer and livestock.  Although birchleaf mountain-mahogany is
generally resistant to browsing, excessive browsing can kill new sprouts
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].
