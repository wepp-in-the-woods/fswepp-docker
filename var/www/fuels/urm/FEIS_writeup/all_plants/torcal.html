<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Torreya californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
California torreya is endemic to California.  Its range has two distinct
parts:  one in the Coast Ranges and one in the Cascade-Sierra Nevada
foothills.  In the Coast Ranges, it is distributed from southwest
Trinity County south to Monterey County.  In the Cascade-Sierra Nevada
foothills, it is distributed from Shasta County south to Tulare County
[<a href="#8">8</a>].  Although not rare, it is not an abundant species.  Local
occurrence is widely scattered throughout its range [<a href="#3">3</a>], and trees are
often infrequent in these localities [<a href="#8">8</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
California torreya is plastic is its habitat requirements, and occurs in
many diverse plant communities.  In the Coast Ranges, it grows in
chaparral and various coastal forests such as redwood (Sequoia
sempervirens).  It is associated with canyon live oak (Quercus
chrysolepis) and California bay (Umbellularia californica) woodlands in
both coastal and inland foothill regions [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Inland populations are
most commonly found in the ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) belt [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].
It is rare in chaparral communities of the Cascade-Sierra Nevada.  It is
not a dominant or indicator species in community or vegetation typings.

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Torreya californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Commercial harvesting of California torreya is almost nonexistant due to
scant availability.  It was logged on a limited basis in the past,
especially where growing in association with redwood, but was never an
important timber species.  The fine-grained yellow-brown wood is,
however, highly attractive and of good quality.  It is strong and
elastic, smooth in texture, polishes well, and emits a fragrance similar
to that of sandalwood [<a href="#3">3</a>].  It is highly durable.  Trees cut over 100
years ago have been found lying on the ground with little rot [<a href="#17">17</a>].  The
wood was historically used for making cabinets, wooden turnware, and
novelty items; and for fuel and fenceposts [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Various animals eat California torreya seeds [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
California torreya provides watershed protection and increases wildlife
habitat diversity [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Sites where it has been eliminated or reduced
in numbers would benefit from repopulation.  Historical records of such
sites are sparse, but a few are known.  Logging during the early 1900's
eliminated California torreya from the Vaca Mountains of Napa and Solano
counties, and considerably reduced populations in the Santa Cruz
Mountains and lower Russian River area of Sonoma County [<a href="#3">3</a>]].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
California torreya is sometimes planted as an ornamental, but the
disagreeable odor of the needles detracts from its desirability.  The
seed oil has potential use in cooking, being similar in quality to olive
and pine-nut oils.  Seeds of a related Asian species, Torreya nucifera,
are harvested in Japan for rendering into high-quality cooking oil.
California torreya seeds are edible, reportedly tasting somewhat like
peanuts [<a href="#4">4</a>].

The seeds were a highly esteemed food of California Indians.  In
addition, Indians used the tree roots for making baskets [<a href="#4">4</a>], and the
wood for making bows [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Unlike Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia), a related species, California
torreya is not harvested as a source of taxol [<a href="#1">1</a>] because it produces
taxol in only extremely small quantities.  It is used as a control,
however, when testing other species with potential for taxol production
[<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
If thinning of California torreya stands is necessary, care should be
taken to preserve both male and female trees as near to each other as
possible in order to facilitate natural regeneration [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Favorable
sites for potential natural regeneration such as canyon bottoms and
lowland flats are unlikely to support seedlings if there is heavy
logging or other disturbance above catchment areas [<a href="#3">3</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Torreya californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
California torreya is a dioecious native evergreen tree, typically from
16.5 to 90 feet (5-30 m) tall and 8 to 20 inches (20-51 cm) in diameter
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  A record tree growing near Fort Bragg measured 141 feet (43 m)
in height and 14.8 feet (4.5 m) in d.b.h. until cut by timber thieves
[<a href="#17">17</a>].  The crown is pyramidal to irregular in shape [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Needles
persist for many years.  The bark is thin, from 0.3 to 0.5 inch (0.8-1.3
cm) on mature trees [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Roots are described as "deep" [<a href="#14">14</a>].  The
large, heavy seeds are from 1 to 1.4 inches (2.5-3.0 cm) long, enveloped
by a drupelike aril [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Male California torreya bear their microsporophylls within strobili.  In
contrast, the ovules of female trees are not contained within strobili
but are solitary [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Male strobili begin growth the year prior to
flowering, while females trees develop ovules in one growing season
[<a href="#21">21</a>].  Torreyas are wind pollinated [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Male trees must normally be
within 75 to 90 feet (23-27 m) of female trees in order to effect
pollination [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Seed production is erratic.  Good seed crops may be
followed by crop failure the following year [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Seeds mature in 2
years [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Being heavy, seeds usually fall near the parent plant; wind
dissemination is rare [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Seed predation by Stellar's and scrub jay
is high [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Seeds require a 9- to 12-month stratification period
before germination [<a href="#21">21</a>].  In one study, seeds stratified for 3 months
before planting took an additional 9 months to germinate under
greenhouse conditions.  Ninety-two percent of seedlings germinated at
that time. [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Temperature regimes during the stratification period
were not noted.  Seeds sometimes germinate without stratification but do
so slowly [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Growth of trees in the understory is slow [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Sudworth [<a href="#24">24</a>] reported
trees from 4 to 8 inches (10-20 cm) in diameter were 60 to 110 years of
age, while those from 12 to 18 inches (30-46 cm) in diameter were 170 to
265 years old.  The growth rate needs further study, however, as rates
of over 1 foot (30 cm) per year have been reported in cultivars [<a href="#3">3</a>].
Preliminary data obtained from tree-ring counts of saplings on the El
Dorado National Forest shows some trees attained heights of 4.8 feet
(1.5 m) in 28 years [<a href="#10">10</a>].

California torreya sprouts from the roots, root crown, and bole
following damage to aboveground portions of the tree [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Some
torreyas reproduce by layering [<a href="#21">21</a>], but the layering capacity of
California torreya is unknown.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
California torreya grows in diverse sites such as streambanks, shaded
slopes, hot dry canyons, canyon floors, and lowland flats [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Best
growth occurs on moist sites.  Trees in Colusa County grow in serpentine
soil [<a href="#8">8</a>].

The climate is mediterranean, characterized by hot, dry summers and
cool, wet winters.  Summer climate is moderated in the outer Coast
Ranges by cool marine air and fog [<a href="#29">29</a>].

California torreya grows at elevations from 3,000 to 7,000 feet
(914-2,134 m) [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Plant associations:  Common overstory associates not listed under
Distrubution and Occurrence include tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflora),
Oregon ash (Fraxinus latifolia), California bay (Umbellularia
californica), bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), white alder (Alnus
rhombifolia), and bishop pine (Pinus muricata).  Understory associates
include cascara (Rhamnus purshiana), ceanothus (Ceanothus spp.),
manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.), Pacific rhododendron (Rhodedendron
macrophyllum), California huckleberry (Vaccinium ovatum), California red
huckleberry (V. parvifolium), and Pacific bayberry (Myrica californica)
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

California torreya is very shade tolerant [<a href="#9">9</a>] and is found in late seral
and climax communities [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Following disturbance such as fire or
logging, sprouts growing from surviving perennating buds appear in
initial communities [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Stamens and arils are produced from March through May [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Seeds
ripen from August until October and are released from September through
November [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].
