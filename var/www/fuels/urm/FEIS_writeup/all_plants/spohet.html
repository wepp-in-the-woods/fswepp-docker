NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Prairie dropseed is widely used for roadside revegetation and prairie
rehabilitation projects [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Planting by hand may be the best method
for establishing this species.  Refer to Schramm [<a href="#28">28</a>] for other planting
techniques.


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Sporobolus heterolepis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Prairie dropseed is a native, perennial, sod-forming, warm-season grass.
It is 1 to 3 feet (0.5-1 m) tall, densely tufted, with alternate basal
leaves.  Its leaves are half as long as its stout culms; the panicles
are purple to black and up to 11.8 inches (30 cm) long [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Prairie dropseed regenerates by seed.  In germination tests, seeds
stratified in dry soil for 10 weeks germinated in 7 days; peak
germination occurred in 25 days.  Greenhouse temperatures during the day
varied between 70 and 90 degrees F (21-32 deg C) and at night varied
between 40 and 70 degrees F (4-21 deg C) [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Other tests showed that
only slightly more seeds germinated when stratified than when
unstratified [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Prairie dropseed does not establish well when direct
seeded [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Prairie dropseed is a tallgrass species that grows in mesic prairies,
well-drained moraines, rock outcrops, glades, pine savannahs and
barrens, lightly grazed pastures, and along railroad and highway
rights-of-way [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  In Colorado it grows at elevations between
5,300 and 7,200 feet (1,615-2,195 m) [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Soil types in Kansas include
shallow, cherty, clay loams and deep silty, clay loams [<a href="#15">15</a>].  In North
Dakota prairie dropseed grows in Hamerly and Barnes soil types in
moderately drained rolling plains [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Associates include bluestems (Andropogon/Schizachyrium spp.), gramas
(Bouteloua spp.), junegrass (Koeleria cristata), porcupine grass (Stipa
spartea), panic grass (Panicum spp.), indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans),
northern bedstraw (Galium boreale), common goldstar (Hypoxis hirsuta),
mountain deathcamas (Zygadenus elegans), leadplant (Amorpha canescens),
green milkweed (Asclepias viridiflora), coreopsis (Coreopsis spp.),
purple sorrel (Oxalis violacea), phlox (Phlox spp.), and yellow cone
flower (Ratibida pinnata) [2,5,8,].  Species that invade prairie
dropseed areas include Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis), smooth brome
(Bromus inermis), and quackgrass (Elytrigia repens) [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Prairie dropseed is a climax species that is codominant with little
bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) in some community types of Ohio and
Minnesota [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  It codominates with prairie dropseed, big bluestem
(Andropogon gerardii var. gerardii), and indiangrass on remnant mesic
prairies in Indiana [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Prairie dropseed flowers and fruits from August through November
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Sporobolus heterolepis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire top-kills prairie dropseed [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Prairie dropseed sprouts and generally increases following fire
[1,2,3,7,10, 16,17].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
In most prescribed burning studies prairie dropseed was shown to
increase in flower production, height, and cover.  It has been described
as an increaser following spring or winter fires [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Following an
April wildfire in Wisconsin, flower production increased by 25 times,
cover by 30 times, and average plant height by 4 inches (10 cm) [<a href="#7">7</a>].
Other studies on the effects of prescribed burning have shown similar
results [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].  Prairie dropseed appears to increase when burned during
winter and spring and decrease when burned during summer or fall [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].
Annual fires are less beneficial to prairie dropseed than fires
conducted every 2 to 3 years [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
On prairie sites in Iowa, burning in early spring, after vegetation has
dried but while soils are still frozen, has been recommended [<a href="#10">10</a>].
Timing of the burn is important; burning too early may expose soils to
late winter storms, while burning too late may damage emerging plants.
