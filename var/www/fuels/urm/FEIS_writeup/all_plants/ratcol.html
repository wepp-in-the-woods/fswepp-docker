<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
In a 1-year study in the central Black Hills of South Dakota, upright
prairie coneflower made up 0.4 percent of cattle diets in June but was
not utilized from July through October [<a href="#50">50</a>].

Another 1-year study showed that upright prairie coneflower was an
important species in the diets of white-tailed deer in southeastern
Texas from early spring through summer [<a href="#9">9</a>].  However, upright prairie
coneflower seedlings in restored native prairie in southeastern
Minnesota were not grazed by white-tailed deer, although seedlings of
other forbs were eaten [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Upright prairie coneflower seeds were eaten by wild turkeys in
south-central South Dakota.  In September and October these seeds made
up 1.2 percent of the volume of crop contents and were used by 10
percent of wild turkeys studied [<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Prior to heading upright prairie coneflower is palatable to livestock
[<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].

Upright prairie coneflower palatability is rated poor to fair for cattle
and horses, and fair for sheep [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Upright prairie coneflower energy value and protein value for livestock
is poor [<a href="#14">14</a>].

The food value of upright prairie coneflower is listed as follows [<a href="#14">14</a>]:

                                  MT          ND        

	Elk                     poor         ----
        Mule deer               poor         poor
        White-tailed deer       fair         poor
        Pronghorn               ----         poor
	Upland game birds       good         ----
        Small nongame birds     fair         ----
        Small mammals           fair         ----


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The cover value of upright prairie coneflower for wildlife in North
Dakota is fair for mule deer and pronghorn, and poor for white-tailed
deer [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Upright prairie coneflower is suggested for use on roadsides, park and
recreation areas, and prairie restoration projects where annual
precipitation is from 10 to 30 inches (254-762 mm) [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Plant vigor
and seed quality are rated excellent [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Upright prairie coneflower
has been established successfully from seed [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>], greenhouse stock
[<a href="#3">3</a>], and tissue culture [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Research from southeastern Montana,
however, indicates that moisture stress can reduce growth of seedlings.
The potential for for vigorous establishment during extended drought was
rated as low to moderate [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Prairie hay harvested from natural grassland in 1978 was used
successfully as a source of upright prairie coneflower seeds in central
North Dakota.  This method was used to establish vegetation in the
Central Great Plains after the drought of the 1930's.  Both recently
harvested and stored hay produced seedlings in greeenhouse tests [<a href="#42">42</a>].

Upright prairie coneflower seeds were collected locally in southwestern
Ohio, and raked into the soil of a prairie reclamation site on a sand
and gravel borrow-pit.  The seeds germinated and the plants flowered [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Upright prairie coneflower seeds collected in the Badlands of western
North Dakota were grown on raw coal spoil material.  Upright prairie
coneflower had good emergence of seedlings.  Seedlings and greenhouse
transplants showed vigorous growth for 2 years.  Upright prairie
coneflower developed substantially more cover on the plots than did most
of the other species tested [<a href="#3">3</a>].

In southeastern Montana, upright prairie coneflower was recommended for
inclusion in seed mixtures for strip mine reclamation.  Seeds germinated
well even under high water stress and with high sodium chloride
concentration in the soil.  Seedling performance was favorable [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Cheyenne Indians boiled upright prairie coneflower leaves and stems to
make a solution applied externally to draw poison from rattlesnake
bites.  The solution was also applied for relief from poison-ivy
(Toxicodendron spp.) [<a href="#48">48</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Upright prairie coneflower responds variably to grazing.  It often
increases in mixtures with more palatable species, but decreases in
mixed-grass prairies lacking more palatable forbs [<a href="#53">53</a>].  On mixed-grass
prairie in east-central South Dakota, upright prairie coneflower
increases when cattle grazing reduces more palatable species [<a href="#38">38</a>].

In southwestern Texas, upright prairie coneflower occurred on severely
overgrazed shortgrass pasture [<a href="#11">11</a>].  A 1-year study in southeastern
Texas showed no significant difference in upright prairie coneflower
cover between short-duration and continuous grazing pastures [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Upright prairie coneflower increased slightly following mechanical brush
removal in west-central Texas [<a href="#43">43</a>].

A northeastern Kansas tallgrass prairie containing upright prairie
coneflower was mowed with different schedules on matched plots.  Upright
prairie coneflower canopy cover after mowing was less than 1 percent on
all plots.  Frequency ranged from 0 to 45 percent, varying with soil and
mowing treatment [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Upright prairie coneflower seeds can be planted in the fall.  If they
are placed in winter storage for spring planting, they should be
stratified with a cold dry treatment [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Upright prairie coneflower is a native [<a href="#21">21</a>] warm-season [<a href="#53">53</a>] perennial
forb [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  It has one to several stems 12 to 47 inches (0.3-1.2
m) tall [<a href="#30">30</a>], often branched in the upper part [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  Leaves are up
to 6 inches (15 cm) long [<a href="#26">26</a>] and pinnately divided [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Flowerheads
are borne singly [<a href="#48">48</a>] at the ends of naked peduncles [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  The floral
disk is columnar, 0.6 to 1.6 inches (1.5-4 cm) long [<a href="#30">30</a>], and about 0.4
inches (1 cm) across.  The fruit is a small achene [<a href="#26">26</a>]; the pappus is
reduced to one or two prominent awn-teeth [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  Upright prairie
coneflower has a caudex and a stout taproot [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>] with branch roots
[<a href="#53">53</a>].  It is an obligate mycotroph [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
The most frequent pollinator of upright prairie coneflower in
northeastern Kansas is an andrenid bee (Andrena rudbekii) [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Requirements for optimum germination of upright prairie coneflower seeds
vary.

According to research conducted in east-central South Dakota, upright
prairie coneflower seeds have an impermeable membrane which completely
inhibits germination.  Moist-cold stratification produced 11 percent
germination.  If the seed membrane was punctured with a probe,
germination increased to 95-100 percent without stratification.  Filled
seed constituted 47.5 percent of the seed collected [<a href="#46">46</a>].

Upright prairie coneflower seeds from southeastern Montana outlier
stands of tallgrass prairie were tested for viability, germination, and
seedling vigor.  Seeds had good germination over a broad range of
temperatures and pretreatments; optimum germination temperatures were 68
to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (20-30 deg C).  At 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20
deg C), 50 percent germination was achieved in 2 days.  Seedling
survival was excellent [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Germination rates of upright prairie coneflower seeds from western North
Dakota were tested.  Maximum germination occurred with dry cold storage
(29%, occurring in January) [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Upright prairie coneflower can regrow until seasonal maturity if
partially defoliated by mowing or grazing [<a href="#53">53</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Upright prairie coneflower grows well on sandy loam, loam, and clayey
loam soils [<a href="#14">14</a>].  It can also be found growing on thin, rocky, gravelly
and sandy soils.  It is tolerant of weakly acidic to moderately alkaline
soils and weakly saline soils [<a href="#53">53</a>].  Optimum soil depth for upright
prairie coneflower growth is 20 or more inches (51 cm) [<a href="#14">14</a>].  It has low
to moderate water requirements [<a href="#13">13</a>] and grows in full sun [<a href="#45">45</a>].  It is
found on dry plains, prairies [<a href="#21">21</a>], hillsides [<a href="#15">15</a>], and also roadsides,
railway grades and other "waste places" [<a href="#51">51</a>].

A field survey of minimally disturbed native grassland of the Coastal
Sand Plain of south Texas was conducted in May, 1987.  Upright prairie
coneflower occurred in five of ten sites on dune ridges and well-drained
flats, with mean absolute frequency of 14 percent and relative cover of
3 percent.  In swales and on moderately drained flats it occurred on
only one of five sites, with absolute frequency of 5 percent and trace
relative cover [<a href="#13">13</a>].

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Upright prairie coneflower is listed as an early seral species in
southeastern Montana [<a href="#17">17</a>].  It shows weak shade tolerance and is usually
found on open or exposed sites [<a href="#53">53</a>].

After the drought of the 1930's, upright prairie coneflower was
particularly common in mixed-grass prairie of the Great Plains as bare
areas were colonized.  It was one of only five species that showed
marked recovery from the drought by 1943 [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Upright prairie coneflower was not present on a range site in
southwestern North Dakota that had been ungrazed for 39 years.  A
similar grazed site had an average of 1.3 upright prairie coneflower
stems per square meter [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Upright prairie coneflower resumes growth in spring [<a href="#53">53</a>].  In
north-central Texas, it broke dormancy in early March, bloomed in June,
and shed seed in July [<a href="#16">16</a>].  In southwestern North Dakota, upright
prairie coneflower resumed growth in late April, bloomed during the
latter part of July, and obtained maximum height by the end of July.
Mature height, averaged over 8 years (1955-1962), was 11.3 inches (28.7
cm) [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Upright prairie coneflower bloomed an average of 41 days a
year in central North Dakota [<a href="#8">8</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Upright prairie coneflower is fire sensitive when actively growing, but
has good fire tolerance in the dormant state [<a href="#53">53</a>] since it sprouts from
the caudex [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  In the central Great Plains tallgrass prairie,
upright prairie coneflower was reported to be harmed by fire [<a href="#57">57</a>].
Upright prairie coneflower produces numerous small seeds [<a href="#1">1</a>] and can
establish on burned sites, since it thrives in the open, sunny
conditions [<a href="#45">45</a>] created by fire.  It may be an initial on-site
colonizer, but no information was available on presence in the seedbank.

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Upright prairie coneflower is probably top-killed by fire during the
growing season.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Upright prairie coneflower response to fire varies considerably,
depending to some extent on geographic area and season of burning.

Upright prairie coneflower was studied in tallgrass prairie of
northeastern Kansas, where it was abundant.  Plants from sites not
burned for 9 years or more were 2.6 times larger, produced 50 percent
more stems, and had more flowerheads and seeds than did plants from
recently burned sites.  Reproductive effort (the ratio of inflorescence
biomass to total vegetative biomass) was 33 percent lower in annually
burned prairie than in prairies with longer fire intervals.  However,
percent cover and frequency were not significantly different between
burned and unburned sites.  Variation in upright prairie coneflower
response to fire is probably due to changes in its competitive status
relative to the dominant perennial grasses and to changes in abiotic
conditions after fire [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Another study in northeastern Kansas
reported that upright prairie coneflower cover was not significantly
correlated with years since burning at postfire years 1 to 4 [<a href="#58">58</a>].

Upright prairie coneflower was less prevalent on north-central Nebraska
sand hills 2 to 3 months after an early May wildfire than on similar
unburned sites [<a href="#56">56</a>].

Changes in upright prairie coneflower flowering were not significant
after May prescribed fires in northwestern Minnesota [<a href="#40">40</a>].  A survey of
literature on plant response to fire indicates that upright prairie
coneflower decreased or showed no change in response to spring fires
[<a href="#35">35</a>].

Upright prairie coneflower in a south Texas chaparral-bristlegrass
(Setaria spp.) community had varying responses to fire.  Plots burned in
September produced 3 pounds of upright prairie coneflower herbage per
acre; plots burned the December of the next year produced 8 pounds per
acre; plots burned at both times produced 3 pounds per acre.  Unburned
plots produced 2 pounds per acre [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Percent cover of upright prairie
coneflower was 3 percent or less on all burned and unburned plots, some
of which were also mechanically treated by shredding, chopping, or
scalping [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Upright prairie coneflower in tallgrass prairie in northeastern Kansas
was burned on different schedules on matched plots.  Cover was less than
1 percent on all treatments, burned and unburned.  Frequency varied with
soil type, fire frequency, and season of burning [<a href="#23">23</a>].
