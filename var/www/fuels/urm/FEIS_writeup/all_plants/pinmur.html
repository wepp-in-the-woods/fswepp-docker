<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Bishop pine is frequently dominant in closed-cone pine forests
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Stands are open with little or no understory on dry,
rocky sites, with a more dense understory on moist sites [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Bishop
pine also occurs in mesic border areas of woodlands and savannas [<a href="#27">27</a>].

In the northern part of its range, bishop pine occurs in pure stands and
in redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii),
and pygmy forests [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  In the southern portion of its
range, it is found in annual grassland, coastal sage scrub, and chaparral
communities.  Scattered bisop pine stands often form a mosaic with these
communities [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

Bishop pine is named as a dominant tree in the following published
classifications:

Terrestrial natural communities of California [<a href="#15">15</a>]
A vegetation classification system applied to southern California [<a href="#36">36</a>]
The southern California islands [<a href="#37">37</a>]
Vascular plant communities of California [<a href="#42">42</a>]
The closed-cone pines and cypress [<a href="#44">44</a>]

Associated canopy species not previosly mentioned include Gowen cypress
(Cupressus goveniana ), Monterey cypress (C. macrocarpa), Tecate cypress
(C. guadalupensis var. forbesii), Mendocino cypress (C.  goveniana var.
pigmaea), Bolander pine (Pinus contorta var. bolanderi), Monterey pine
(Pinus radiata), and Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].
Understory associates include glossyleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos
nummularia), woollyleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos tomentosa), Pacific
rhododendron (Rhododendron macrophyllum), California huckleberry
(Vaccinium ovatum), and salal (Gautheria shallon) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus muricata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Bishop pine wood is light, strong, hard, and coarse-grained [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  It
has good papermaking properties [<a href="#40">40</a>].  The growth habit of bishop pine
varies, but on fair to good sites it shows good form and uniform size
[<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Squirrels occasionally eat bishop pine seeds, but the spiny cones
usually deter seed predators [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

Browsing by exotic sheep on Santa Cruz Island has resulted in the absence
of regeneration and an accelerated deterioration of bishop pine [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Bishop pine can be used for erosion control [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Its roots bind soil
more effectively than coastal sage scrub and annual grass species [<a href="#7">7</a>].
On low coastal terraces, bishop pine helps to stabilize sand dunes
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
When planting bishop pine, the genotype of planted seeds or trees vs.
the genotype of existing populations should be compared in order to
preserve the genetic purity of bishop pine.  seeds of unknown origin
were sown in an area of northern California where two genotypically
distinct bishop pine overlap in the mid-1960's.  Genes from the unknown
source have been found in seeds from native trees.  As a result, trees
from this site has lost their value for genetic and evolutionary studies
[<a href="#31">31</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus muricata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bishop pine is a native conifer, typically 49 to 50 feet (15-25 m) tall
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  The needles are 3 to 6 inches (10-15 cm) long and
persist for 2 to 3 years [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  The asymmetric, thin- to
thick-scaled, spiny cones are 1.9 to 2.8 inches (5-7 cm) long
[<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
The interval between good seed crop is 2 to 3 years.  Bishop pine begins
to produce seed at the age of 5 to 6 years [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Bishop pine produces cones that remain closed for several years and open
after fire or on hot days [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Temperatures of up to 203 degrees
Fahrenheit (95 deg C) do not seriously reduce seed germination [<a href="#23">23</a>].
The germinative capacity is approximately 80 percent [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  A
germination study indicated that seeds germinate equally well on highly
acid, serpentine, or clay soils [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Growth of bishop pine is rapid [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
The climate where bishop pine occurs is Mediterranean; most of the
precipitation falls in the winter, and summers are dry [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  Fog
occurs in spring and summer is important to bishop pine's survival
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Slopes vary from flat to steep, and are often
north-facing [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  Bishop pine occurs from near sea level to
1,320 feet (0-400 m) in elevation [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Soils in which bishop pine grows are sometimes shallow and poorly
drained [<a href="#44">44</a>].  In the pygmy forest, the upper soil layer is devoid of
nutrients, has a low pH (4.7), and covers an impermeable hardpan.  When
growing in this soil, bishop pine has stunted growth [<a href="#3">3</a>].  It is also
found on less acidic soils which vary from dry, gravelly sands to peat
bogs [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Diatomaceous shale soils support good growth [<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Bishop pine stands are typically even-aged, originating after fire
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Fire is the most common natural disturbance in bishop
pine communities [<a href="#9">9</a>].  

Bishop pine has intermediate shade tolerance [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Cones of bishop pine open for pollination between April and June
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Growth is initiated in the spring [<a href="#15">15</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus muricata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fire plays an important ecological role in continuance or maintenance of
bishop pine communities [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Older trees have thick bark, which
enables them to survive surface fire in woodlands and savannas [<a href="#25">25</a>].
Bishop pine stands, however, are often dense [<a href="#44">44</a>], and stand-replacing
crown fire typically occurs in such stands.  The generally serotinous
and persistent cones are adapted to open when exposed to such heat
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Serotiny is somewhat variable; northern populations
are less serotinous than southern populations [<a href="#47">47</a>].  Seed released from
serotinous cones results in even-aged stands; most seedling
establishment occurs in the first postfire year [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

Bishop pine's rapid growth and early production of seed help prevent its
elimination from areas where fires are frequent [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  A fire-free
period of 80 years or more results in greatly increased susceptibility
to disease [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Analysis of point and composite data at Salt Point
State Park, California showed fire intervals of 20.5 to 29 years and 6.1
to 9.3 years, respectively [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Bishop pine does not sprout after fire [<a href="#18">18</a>].
 


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tree without adventitious-bud root crown
   Crown residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus muricata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Large, thick-barked trees probably survive low- to moderate-severity
surface fires.  Crown fire kills bishop pine [<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Bishop pine cones open and release seed after exposure to intense heat [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
The half-life of bishop pine litter is approximately 7.5 years.  Biomass
and productivity varies between stands [<a href="#43">43</a>].

Fire reduces fuel loading and improves seedbed conditions for bishop
pine [<a href="#27">27</a>].
