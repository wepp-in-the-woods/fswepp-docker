<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name for soft-stem bulrush is Scirpus
validus Vahl in the family Cyperaceae [<a href="#16">16</a>].  There are two recognized
varieties:  S. validus var. validus and S. validus var. creber Fern.
Scirpus cirpus validus var. creber has two distinct forms:  S. cirpus
var. creber f. creber and S. cirpus var. creber f. megastachyus Fern.
[<a href="#11">11</a>].  Scirpus validus and S. acutus were once considered indistinct
species and given the subspecies rank of S. lacustris L. ssp. validus
(Vahl) Koyama and S. lacustris ssp. glaucus (Sm.)  Hartm., respectively
[<a href="#26">26</a>].  However, studies in Manitoba showed the two are separate species
[<a href="#26">26</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Soft-stem bulrush is a dominant in the following classification type:

Landscape classification and plant successional trends in the
   Peace-Athabasca Delta [<a href="#7">7</a>]

Some species associated with soft-stem bulrush are smartweed (Polygonum
spp.), sedge (Carex spp.), common cattail, reed (Phragmites spp.), water
hemlock (Circuta maculata), spikerush (Eleocharis calva), fowl
mannagrass (Glyceria striata), tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia
caespitosa), beggartick (Bidens spp.), narrowlieaf burreed (Sparganium
eurycarpum), common arrowhead (Sagittaria latifolia), sego pondweed
(Potamogeton pectinatus), and nodding waternymph (Najas flexilis)
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Scirpus validus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
The seeds of soft-stem bulrush are eaten by waterfowl and considered a
good to excellent food source in South Dakota [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Soft-stem bulrush provides good cover for waterfowl, especially in
conjunction with common cattail (Typha latifolia) [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Soft-stem bulrush is used in wetland restoration and is best planted
vegetatively because it can triple its biomass in one growing season
[<a href="#20">20</a>].  It is also used to reduce pollutant loads carried by storm water
runoff in urban wetlands [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Roots of soft-stem bulrush can be ground into flour or eaten whole.
Syrup can be extracted from them [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Livestock grazing in wetlands can reduce soft-stem bulrush [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Soft-stem bulrush will establish from the seedbank following periodic
draining and reflooding of marshes [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  However, prolonged draining
and reflooding can reduce soft-stem bulrush stands [<a href="#18">18</a>].  In a Minnesota
marsh, early to mid-June drawdowns favored soft-stem bulrush stands in
the first 2 years.  After the third-year drawdonw, bulrush began to
decrease in water depths greater than 15 inches (38 cm).  Eventually it
was eradicated from all areas reflooded annually [<a href="#18">18</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Scirpus validus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Soft-stem bulrush is a tall, leafless marsh plant 1.5 to 9 feet (0.5-3
m) high and 0.12 to 0.8 inches (0.3-2 cm) thick with scaly, stout,
horizontal rhizomes [<a href="#11">11</a>].  The stems are obscurely three-sided and
spongy [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Spikes occur near the stem tips in branched clusters [<a href="#8">8</a>].
The fruit is an achene [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Soft-stem bulrush reproduces by both rhizomes and seeds [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  It
reproduces well from seed stored in the seedbank [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Soil-stored
seed can remain viable for as long as 20 years [<a href="#31">31</a>].  In the lab, seed
viability in dry storage is more than 2 years [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Soft-stem bulrush grows in marshes, along lake and stream shores, and in
wet meadows.  It grows in fresh or brackish water [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Soils are
usually poorly-drained [<a href="#5">5</a>], or continually saturated [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Soft-stem
bulrush grows in silty or peaty soils [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Under greenhouse conditions
soft-stem bulrush produced more aboveground biomass in silty clay soils
than in clay or sand alone [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Belowground biomass was equal in silty
clays and clays, and lower in sandy soils.  Soft-stem bulrush seems to
grow better in saline conditions than in fresh water, and it tolerates a
wide range of salinity [<a href="#32">32</a>].




<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Soft-stem bulrush is a perennial [<a href="#17">17</a>] and is a dominant emergent in the
northern plains and prairie states [<a href="#19">19</a>].  It is replaced by cattail
(Typha spp.) in continuously flooded marshes following drawdown [<a href="#18">18</a>].
Soft-stem bulrush is found in the third sere of succession in Wisconsin
marshes, preceded by submerged and floating plant stages and followed by
sedge meadows, shrubs, and trees [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Because of the wide distribution of soft-stem bulrush, its growing
seasons varies with latitude.  In the northeast soft-stem bulrush
flowers from July through August [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Flowering lasts from 5 to 6
months in wetland prairies of Nebraska [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Fernald [<a href="#11">11</a>] reported
fruits generally ripening from June through September.

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Soft-stem bulrush sprouts from rhizomes following fire [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>

   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Scirpus validus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire topkills soft-stem bulrush stands [<a href="#13">13</a>] and reduces shoot mass of
Scirpus species [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
The effects of fire on wetland plants after drawdowns in Utah's Great
Salt Lake Marsh were studied [<a href="#27">27</a>].  On burned sites new shoots had a
lower biomass per inch of length than shoots on unburned sites.


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Soft-stem bulrush sprouts from rhizomes following fire [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Fire increases protein content of Scirpus acutus, a closely related
species [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Wetland vertebrates may select certain marsh plant
species due to protein increases following fire [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Prescribed fires were lit in early September following April drawdowns
in the Great Salt Lake Marsh [<a href="#27">27</a>].  No distininction was made between S.
validus and S. acutus in this study.  Both were referred to as S.
lacustris. Burned and unburned sites were reflooded 1 week following
fire.  Stands of bulrush on burned sites were similar to those on
unburned sites during the first year.  Bulrush began sprouting
immediately following fire, growing to a height of 1.3 feet (0.4 m)
before the first winter.  Production did not differ between sites.

Waterfowl and muskrats can reduce soft-stem bulrush through overgrazing,
especially following fire [<a href="#27">27</a>].
