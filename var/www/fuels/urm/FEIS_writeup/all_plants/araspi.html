<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Aralia spinosa

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Insects harvest pollen and nectar from the flowers of Devil's walking
stick [<a href="#8">8</a>].  The fruits are used as food by many birds and other
frugivores, including black bear [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Van Dersal reported that
deer use Devil's walking stick as browse [<a href="#32">32</a>].  White [<a href="#37">37</a>] did not
observe any deer browsing of young ramets but did observe stem damage
due to antler rubbing.

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Devil's walking stick bark, roots, and berries have been used for
medicinal purposes, both by Native Americans and European settlers.  It
is planted as an ornamental in North America and Europe [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Control:  Devil's walking stick is killed by aerosol applications of
glyphosate at rates of 1.50 to 2.25 pounds per acre (0.56-2.52 kg/ha)
applied three times at 2-week intervals from mid-August to mid-September
[<a href="#35">35</a>].  Korostoff [<a href="#17">17</a>] reported that Devil's walking stick is controlled
by cutting and application of herbicide to the stump.  The most
effective treatment reported by Loftis [<a href="#20">20</a>] is injection of stems larger
than 2 inches in diameter with herbicide; basal sprays were ineffective
on his study sites.

Establishment:  Devil's walking stick populations are maintained only on
disturbed sites.  When the overstory cover becomes thick enough, Devil's
walking stick declines.  Defoliation by gypsy moth infestation in
Pennsylvania and Maryland resulted in an increase in stems per acre of
Devil's walking stick, due both to injury of Devil's walking stick
ramets and to release by removal of overstory [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Mowing or cutting
of stems results in vigorous sprouting of new ramets from underground
rhizomes and is recommended for maintenance of vigorous stands [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].
Fire also produces appropriate disturbances and stem damage, and could
be used to maintain Devil's walking stick stands [<a href="#36">36</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Aralia spinosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Devil's walking stick is a spiny, few-branched, flat-topped tree or
shrub 25 to 35 feet (7-10 m) tall.  It grows from extensive rhizomes
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  The stems tend to remain unbranched until the first
terminal inflorescences are produced at an average age of 3.5 years.
There are abundant prickles on the stems and leaves of first-year ramets
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte (mesophanerophyte)


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Devil's walking stick perennates by rhizomes, producing ramets.  Leaves
may be killed by frost in winter; severe frost can kill stems back to
ground level [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Flowers are pollinated by insects, mostly bees.
Seeds are dispersed by frugivores, and germination is in the spring
following stratification [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Artificial propagation can be
achieved through root cuttings [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Devil's walking stick is found in upland and low woods, pocosins, and
savannahs [<a href="#24">24</a>].  It prefers rich moist soils and is found at edges of
streams, and in thickets and shrub bays [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Some of the plant
species associated with Devil's walking stick include black cherry
(Prunus serotina), eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), tree
sparkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum), red maple (Acer rubrum var trilobum),
American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), common persimmon (Diospyros
virginiana), sassafras (Sassafras albidum), Carolina jessamine
(Gelsemium sempervirens), Bignonia capreolata, St. Andrew's cross
(Ascyrum hypericoides), common sweetleaf (Symplocos tinctoria),
Vaccinium spp., and passionflower (Passiflora lutea) [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Associates
on a Texas shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata)/white oak (Quercus alba)
community include Meliz azedarach, hawthorn (Crataegus crus-galli), and
flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) [<a href="#36">36</a>].

Devil's walking stick is found in Louisiana in openings in upland
hardwoods, with plant associates including sassafras, American holly
(Ilex opaca), flowering dogwood, sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum),
serviceberry (Amelanchier spp.), common persimmon, Vaccinium spp., grape
(Vitis spp.), eastern hophornbeam, Viburnum spp., and Carolina buckthorn
(Rhamnus caroliniana).  It is also found on gullied land and on moist
bottomlands with plant associates including American sycamore (Platanus
occidentalis) and green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Devil's walking stick is found in southern Appalachian forests in
openings from 8,042 square feet to 10,763 square feet (750-1,000 sq m),
with the frequency of occurrence dropping off with larger gaps; it is
not found in undisturbed understory [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

Devil's walking stick is shade intolerant [<a href="#31">31</a>].  In a study of
succession in Illinois oak (Quercus velutina) woodlands , Shotola [<a href="#27">27</a>]
reported that a population of Devil's walking stick (documented in 1967)
decreased as a population of sugar maple (Acer saccarum) increased; by
1983, no individuals were found.  The assumption is that the increased
canopy coverage was unfavorable to Devil's walking stick.  Devil's
walking stick is also found in abundance in clearcuts, but not in
adjacent intact pine plantations in Ohio.  The population on this site
increased in the third and fourth years after the clearcut.  There is
concern that the presence of Devil's walking stick on these sites may
delay subsequent establishment of hardwood species [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Devil's walking stick flowers in July and August, setting fruit
that ripens from September to October [<a href="#33">33</a>].

NO-ENTRY


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Removal of aboveground portions of stems by means other than fire is
reported to result in vigorous resprouting of new ramets.  It is
reasonable to assume, although not documented, that fire death of
aboveground stems would have the same result [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Periodic fires
create openings in forest canopies that allow Devil's walking stick to
establish and maintain populations [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Since populations of Devil's walking stick are maintained only on
disturbed areas, periodic fires that create disturbed areas and forest
openings would result in seral sites that could include Devil's walking
stick [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].
