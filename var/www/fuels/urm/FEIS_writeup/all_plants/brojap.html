<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of Japanese brome is Bromus
japonicus Thunb. [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  Recognized varieties are [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>]:

B. j. var. japonicus
B. j. var. porrectus Hack

Japanese brome intergrades with corn brome (B. squarrosus) and hariy
brome (B. commutatus) [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  Several authorities have noted a lack of
distinguishing features between Japanese brome and hairy brome [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>],
and Hickman [<a href="#38">38</a>] treats them as synonyms.

Japanese brome hybridizes with rattlesnake brome (B. brizaeformi) and
soft chess (B. horeaceus) [<a href="#68">68</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
In the West, Japanese brome occurs in prairie, pinyon-juniper
(Pinus-Juniperus spp.), sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) steppe, and desert
shrub-grassland communities.  It is most common on disturbed sites, but
is also found in undisturbed communities [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  It occasionally
occurs in openings in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) or other
low-elevation forest types [<a href="#53">53</a>].  It is uncommon in the East, where it
is reported only from disturbed areas [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  Plant associates are
listed below by location and community type.

Eastern Wyoming shortgrass prairie:  Wyoming big sagebrush (A.
tridentata ssp. wyomingensis), fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens),
Gardner's saltbush (A. gardneri), rubber rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus
nauseosus), blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), threadleaf sedge (Carex
filifolia), sand bluestem (Andropogon gerardii var. paucipilis), prairie
junegrass (Koeleria macrantha), needle-and-thread grass (Stipa comata),
western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii), cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum),
and plains prickly pear (Opuntia polycantha) [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Southwestern South Dakota mixed-grass prairie:  western wheatgrass, red
threeawn (Aristida purpurea), cheatgrass, buffalograss (Buchloe
dactyloides), plains silver sagebrush (Artemisia cana ssp. cana),
Russian-thistle (Salsola kali), and scarlet mallow (Sphaeralcea
coccinea) [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Central Oklahoma tallgrass prairie:  big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii
var. gerardii), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), switchgrass
(Panicum virgatum), Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), black-eyed Susan
(Rudbeckia hirta), and Carolina geranium (Geranium carolinianum) [<a href="#2">2</a>]. 

North-central Texas mesquite savanna:  honey mesquite (Prosopsis
glandulosa var. glandulosa), buffalograss, sideoats grama (Bouteloua
curtipendula), and Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha) [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Mesa Verde, Colorado, pinyon-juniper woodland:  annual sunflower
(Helianthus annuus), pigweed (Chenopodium pratericola), wheat (Triticum
aestivum), and mountain brome (Bromus carinatus).  True pinyon (Pinus
edulis) and Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) were adjacent to but
not within this fire-disturbed community [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Northeastern California sagebrush steppe:  medusahead (Taeniatherum
caput-medusae), cheatgrass, Columbia needlegrass (Stipa columbiana),
bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata), and bottlebrush
squirreltail (Elymus elymoides).  Basin big sagebrush (Artemisia
tridentata ssp. tridentata) and low sagebrush (A. arbuscula ssp.
longicaulis) were adjacent to but not within this grazing-disturbed
community [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Japanese brome was ranked as important in high-disturbance willow (Salix
spp.)-zone stream channels of south-central Oklahoma [<a href="#51">51</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Livestock use Japanese brome heavily in fall and early spring [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].
It is an important and highly palatable fall diet item of white-tailed
deer [<a href="#77">77</a>], and bison also graze it heavily in fall.  Plants rapidly
loose palatability as they mature [<a href="#61">61</a>].  Like all annuals, Japanese
brome is unpredictable forage:  Yields are high in wet years but low in
dry years [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].

Wild turkey eat Japanese brome seeds [<a href="#46">46</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Japanese brome palatablity for livestock and wildlife has been rated as
follows [<a href="#17">17</a>]:

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Japanese brome rapidly decreases in nutritive content and digestibility
as it matures [<a href="#61">61</a>].  Analysis of fresh, immature Japanese brome yielded
the following data [<a href="#48">48</a>]:

crude fiber         28.7%
protein (N x 6.25)  16.1% 
digestible protein
   cattle           11.6%
   goats            11.6%

   sheep            12.0%
calcium              0.40%
phosphorus           0.26%


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Japanese brome provides fair cover for small nongame birds and mammals
and poor cover for upland game birds and waterfowl [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Japanese brome is not used for reclamation, but its seeds are often
present in salvaged topsoils.  Its presence on reclamation sites can
slow succession toward desirable perennials [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Japanese brome is usually regarded as a noxious weed on rangelands and
prairies because it competes with native perennials for water and
nutrients [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].  It is reported in general literature as
increasing with moderate to heavy grazing [<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].  It may decrease
under such grazing regimes, however.  Whisenant and Uresk [<a href="#74">74</a>] observed
that Japanese brome density in Badlands National Park, South Dakota,
which is only lightly grazed, appeared much greater than in more heavily
utilized adjacent rangeland.  They hypothesized that litter accumulation
with little or no grazing created a favorably mesic environment for
Japanese brome germination and establishment.

Mechanical treatments may increase, sometimes greatly, Japanese brome
populations.  With favorable soil moisture Japanese brome establishes
wherever native vegetation is disturbed and soil nitrogen levels are
temporarily increased [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Mowing a Kansas tallgrass prairie in August
resulted in one such Japanese brome population increase [<a href="#32">32</a>].

Control:  The best way to prevent or minimize Japanese brome invasion is
to minimize soil disturbance.  Where Japanese brome has already
established, it can be reduced with herbicides.  Atrazine is most
commonly used [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  A list of other pre- and postemergent herbicides
effective against Japanese brome is available [<a href="#79">79</a>].

Discing or moldboard plowing followed by a second discing or herbicide
treatment after the germination period reduced Japanese brome on the
Texas Southern Great Plains [<a href="#14">14</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Bromus japonicus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Japanese brome is an introduced, cool-season, annual grass from 8 to 48
inches (20-120 cm) tall.  It sheaths are hairy; the blades are glabrous
to hairy. The inflorescence is an open panicle bearing 6 to 13 caryopses
[<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  Roots may be shallow [<a href="#61">61</a>], or surprisingly deep for
an annual.  Roots of plants in Lewistown, Montana, reached depths of 5
feet (150 cm), with most roots concentrated between 2.7 and 4.7 feet (80
and 140 cm) below ground.  Japanese brome root density surpassed that of
five other annual bromes also occurring at the site [<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Therophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Japanese brome reproduces entirely from seeds.  The seeds require a
moist substrate for germination.  A heavy thatch or litter layer
improves germination rates by retaining moisture [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Seeds germinate
over a broad temperature range:  from just above freezing to over 95
degrees Fanrenheit (35 deg C) [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Under laboratory conditions a
majority (67%) of fresh seed was immediately germinable, but under
natural conditions most seeds are retained on the parent plant until
late fall or winter, which delays germination [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Some seeds are
dispersed off-site in animal hides or dung:  The majority of seeds found
in bison chips on the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge, Oklahoma, were
Japanese brome [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Other seeds fall near the parent plant [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].
Seeds are probably not deeply buried.  In Wind Cave National Park, South
Dakota, Whisenant [<a href="#71">71</a>] found few Japanese brome seeds deeper than 1.2
inches (3 cm) below ground.  Late fall- and winter-dispersed seeds
undergo dormancy and need a period of afterripening the following summer
before germination occurs.  Most seeds therefore germinate in fall and
are from the previous year's crop [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Fall precipitation increases
successful germination, and above-average precipitation is critical when
the litter layer is sparse to absent [<a href="#70">70</a>].  Whisenant [<a href="#71">71</a>] reported that
Japanese brome density in Wind Cave National Park was much greater in
summers that followed heavy fall rains.  Winter and spring precipitation
did not greatly affect Japanese brome density.  A minority of seeds
germinate in spring; plants growing from these seeds tend to flower
later in the year, if at all [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Japanese brome is a prodigious
seed producer [<a href="#4">4</a>].  The long-term viability of Japanese brome seeds is
unknown, but seeds remain viable for at least several years.  Soil from
north-central Kentucky, collected after the germination period had passed,
still contained an average concentration of 2,325 viable Japanese brome
seeds per square meter [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Seedlings overwinter in a rosettelike growth form [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Japanese brome invades disturbed and undisturbed sites.  It dominates
disturbed areas in the Jackson Hole Wildlife Park, Wyoming, where it
occurs on bridle paths, roadsides, gravel pits, and heavily used or
burned picnic sites [<a href="#55">55</a>].  In other areas it is reported from
site-prepared plantations [<a href="#53">53</a>], old prairie dog mounds [<a href="#50">50</a>], moderately
to heavily grazed rangelands [<a href="#56">56</a>], and undisturbed mixed-grass prairie
[<a href="#72">72</a>].

Japanese brome grows on soils of various textures including sand [<a href="#8">8</a>],
silt [<a href="#9">9</a>], clay [<a href="#7">7</a>], and claypan [<a href="#35">35</a>].  It usually occurs on mesic sites
[<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>].  Fine-textured soils with good litter cover promote best
growth [<a href="#70">70</a>].  It is apparently intolerant of alkaline soils [<a href="#64">64</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Japanese brome colonizes disturbed sites [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  It sometimes decreases
with succession:  Four years following elimination of disturbance
(logging and ranching) on the University of Kansas Natural History
Reserve, Japanese brome had 7.4 percent cover.  Twelve years later it
was present only in trace amounts.  Twenty-seven years later it was
absent from the community [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Japanese brome may persist or even
dominate some late seres or climax communities, however [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].
Huschle and Hironaka [<a href="#42">42</a>] listed a Japanese brome phase of the bluebunch
wheatgrass-Sandberg bluegrass (Agropyron spicatum-Poa sandbergii
[Pseudoroegneria spicata-Poa secunda]) habitat type by the middle and
lower Snake River, Idaho.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Japanese brome usually germinates in fall.  It shows some fall
vegetative growth, winter dormancy, vigorous spring vegetative growth,
and late spring flowering.  It fruits and dies in summer, and seeds
disperse from the dead plants in fall and winter [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].
Overwintering Japanese brome seedlings are among the first grasses to
resume growth in spring [<a href="#29">29</a>].  A minority of seeds germinate in spring,
and flowering occurs in late summer in these plants.  Spring-germinating
plants in northern latitudes are usually killed by frost before seeds
are ripe [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>].

Baskin and Baskin [<a href="#5">5</a>] reported that in north-central Kentucky,
germination occurs from early September to mid-October; flowering begins
in early May; seeds ripen and plants die from late June to early July;
and seeds disperse from late October until March.

Frequency (%) of occurrence of phenological stages in central Oklahoma
was reported as follows [<a href="#2">2</a>]:

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Bromus japonicus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Except in wet years, fire tends to reduce Japanese brome populations
[<a href="#31">31</a>].  The reduction usually lasts for only 1 or 2 years, however
[<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].  Some seed is killed by fire, but seedbank reserves,
reproductive capacity, and competitive ability of Japanese brome are
usually sufficient to allow for repopulation of an area within 2 years
unless the site is reburned [<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>].

Studies conducted when precipitation was below normal reported
reductions in Japanese brome populations for 2 postfire years [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].
Since litter accumulations are more critical for germination and
seedling establishment when precipitation is low, drastic population
reductions can be expected when burning is followed by below-average
precipitation [<a href="#71">71</a>].

Fire during wet years may not reduce Japanese brome populations.
Studies conducted during years of high precipitation showed no change in
Japanese brome density the summer after burning [<a href="#73">73</a>].

Kirsch and Kruse [<a href="#44">44</a>] hypothesized that the successful establishment and
spread of Japanese brome across the Northern Great Plains is a direct
result of fire suppression:  The resulting thicker surface mulch created
a more mesic microenvironment for seeds and seedlings [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].  Japanese
brome populations will probably continue to increase in the absence of
fire [<a href="#71">71</a>].  In the Flint Hills of Kansas, for example, bluestem
(Andropogon gerardii and Schizachyrium scoparium) prairie grazed and
burned annually has remained in excellent condition, while prairie
grazed but not burned has been invaded by Japanese brome and Kentucky
bluegrass (Poa pratense) [<a href="#3">3</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire kills Japanese brome.  Some of the seeds retained in panicles are
also killed [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Whisenant [<a href="#71">71</a>] suggested that Japanese brome postfire response is best
explained as a function of level of litter reduction by fire and the
amount of fall precipitation following fire.  Since litter accumulations
are more critical for seed germination and seedling establishment in dry
than wet years, populations are reduced when burning is followed by
below-average precipitation.  During wet years, fire has little impact
on subsequent generations.

A 1973 to 1975 South Dakota study showed that spring, summer, or fall
burning reduced Japanese brome for two postfire growing seasons.  During
the study, prescribed burning was followed by 2 years of drought [<a href="#28">28</a>].
In another South Dakota study where prescribed fire was followed by 2
years of above average precipitation, Japanese brome densities at
postfire years 1 and 2 were similar to prefire densities [<a href="#72">72</a>].
Whisenant and others [<a href="#73">73</a>] reported that Japanese brome frequency was not
significantly changed in postfire year 1 by fires in September 1979,
January 1980, or March 1980.  In eastern Montana, spring burning
reduced Japanese brome for one postfire growing season.  Subsequent
years were not evaluated [<a href="#76">76</a>].

Prescribed fire was used on a western wheatgrass-green needlegrass
(Pascopyrum smithii-Stipa viridula) prairie in Wind Cave National Park,
South Dakota, to test Japanese brome response to fire.  Treatments were
fall (Sept. 18, 1973), winter (Feb. 13, 1974), and spring (April 10,
1974) burning.  Japanese brome density (stems/sq ft) on May 24, 1974,
was as follows [<a href="#27">27</a>]:

                                Treatment
| fall burn  control | winter burn  control | spring burn  control | unburned |
|    0.8      80.0   |     33.8       57.3  |     15.7       56.1  |    56.9  |

Only one study was found describing Japanese brome postfire response in
palouse prairie.  A July 1961 wildfire in a bluebunch
wheatgrass-Sandberg bluegrass stand in southeastern Washington reduced
Japanese brome and cheatgrass populations for at least 2 years.
Japanese brome percentage frequency was as follows [<a href="#16">16</a>]:

                      unburned        burned

postfire yr  2           42             10
postfire yr  4           30             50
postfire yr 12           32             18      

Two accounts of Japanese brome postfire response in the Southwest were
found.  In Mesa Verde, Colorado, Japanese brome was a component of an
initial (postfire yrs 1 & 2) annual sunflower-pigweed community
following a July 15 to August 7, 1959, wildfire in a true pinyon-Utah
juniper (Pinus edulis-Juniperus osteosperma) woodland [<a href="#19">19</a>].  

The spring following prescribed winter fire in a honey mesquite/Texas
wintergrass woodland in Coleman County, Texas, cool-season annuals
including Japanese brome were reduced by 74 percent.  At postfire year 2
there was a trend toward more annual grasses on burned than unburned
sites [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Whisenant [<a href="#72">72</a>] stated that fire exclusion in northern mixed-grass
prairie has improved conditions for Japanese brome establishment at the
expense of native grasses.  In the absence of intensive grazing, litter
accumulations in northern mixed-grass prairie stabilize after 5 to 6
postfire years [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Whisenent [<a href="#74">74</a>] has recommended burning every 5
years or less to reduce litter accumulations.  This reduces Japanese
brome populations, particularly when fall precipitation is low.
However, he cautions managers to balance the benefits of litter against
need to reduce Japanese brome when preparing fire management plans.
Benefits of litter include soil stabilization and insulation, moisture
retention, and promotion of perennials [<a href="#80">80</a>].

Gartner and others [<a href="#28">28</a>] recommended burning Japanese brome in the ripe
seed stage in order to maximize kill of seeds in panicles.

Whisenant [<a href="#70">70</a>] has developed regression equations modelling Japanese
brome density and seed production as affected by fire.

<b>SEASON/SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION : </b>
Spring/Severity not measured


<b>STUDY LOCATION : </b>
The study area was in Badlands National Park in south-central South Dakota.


<b>PREFIRE VEGETATIVE COMMUNITY : </b>
The study was conducted in a stand of native shortgrass prairie in good
condition.  Japanese brome (Bromus japonicus) and western wheatgrass
(Pascopyrum smithii) codominated the site.  Green needlegrass (Stipa
viridula), sand dropseed (Sporobolus cryptandrus), threadleaf sedge
(Carex filifolia), blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), and buffalograss
(Buchloe dactyloides) were minor components of the community.  Japanese
brome tiller density averaged 1,500 per square meter; western wheatgrass
tiller density averaged 273 per square meter.


<b>TARGET SPECIES PHENOLOGICAL STATE : </b>
Japanese brome seedlings were 1 to 2 inches (3-5 cm) tall when the April
fires were set, and 3 to 4 inches (8-10 cm) tall when the May fires were
set.


<b>SITE DESCRIPTION : </b>
The mean growing season in the Park is 126 days.  Annual precipitation
is approximately 384 millimeters, 303 of which falls during the growing
season.  Average temperature is 47 degrees Fahrenheit (8.3 deg C), with
temperatures rising to 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 deg C) in summer and
dropping to -20 degrees Fahrenheit (-29 deg C) in winter.  Summer and
fall relative humidity has a wide diurnal variation, ranging from 85
percent in morning to 40 percent by afternoon.  Precipitation from
October 1983 to July 1984 (the first year of the study) was above
average, with of most of it occurring in fall.  Precipitation from
October 1984 to July 1985 (the second year of the study) was 61 percent
of normal.  Soil at the study site is Larvie silty clay (fine,
montmorillonitic, mesic, vertic Camborthid).

The study site was relatively undisturbed.  It had never been cultivated
and had not been burned or grazed by domestic livestock for at least 25
years.  White-tailed deer, pronghorn, bison, and Rocky Mountain bighorn
sheep reside in the Park, but grazing effects were not apparent at the
study site.


<b>FIRE DESCRIPTION : </b>
Fire treatments were:  (1) unburned, (2) burned in April 1983, (3)
burned in May 1984, (4) burned in April 1983 and April 1984, (5) burned
in May 1983 and May 1984, (6) clipped in April 1983, (7) clipped in May
1983, (8) atrazine application in September 1983, (9) burned in April
1983 with atrazine application in September 1983, and (10) burned in
April 1984.

<b>FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES : </b>
Japanese brome tiller density and standing crop were significantly
reduced the first year after the 1984 fires.  Tiller density and
standing crop were not significantly reduced the second postfire year.
Burning resulted in greater reductions than did clipping, indicating
that mortality resulted from heat rather than simply foliage removal.
Atrazine applied as a preemergent herbicide significantly reduced
Japanese brome density.

In July 1984, Japanese brome density and standing crop were as follows:

Japanese brome densities in the spring were positively correlated with
litter weight and autumn precipitation.  As precipitation decreased,
litter became more important.  Burning reduced seed production for at
least three growing seasons.  Seed production in 1984 and 1985 was
greatest in controls and lowest in recently burned plots.  In 1986, seed
production was reduced in plots burned in 1984 but not in untreated
plots or those burned in 1983.  

Litter seedbanks were reduced when precipitation was below normal.  The
litter seedbank was reduced drastically after the combination of drought
and fire in 1985.  Reduction in the litter seedbanks on burned sites
lasted for 3 years.  The soil seedbank was also reduced for 3 years, but
the reduction was less drastic.

Japanese brome seedling density and seedbank reserves, measured in July,
were as follows:

<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS : </b>
Fire that reduces litter accumulations reduces the next generation of
Japanese brome.  Carryover of Japanese brome in the seedbank is usually
sufficient to establish subsequent generations.  As water becomes more
limiting, litter becomes increasingly important in determining the size
of Japanese brome populations.
