<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Hardstem bulrush often forms monocultures in marshes throughout its
range [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>].  It is a member of sandhill, spring fen, graminoid
fen, and wet meadow communities [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].

In California hardstem bulrush is a member of montane, coastal, and
valley freshwater marsh communities.  Common associates include Olney
threesquare (Scirpus americanus), California bulrush (S. californicus),
slenderbeak sedge (Carex athrostachya), Nebraska sedge (C. nebracensis),
swamp carex (C. senta), cottonsedge (Eriophorum spp.), common reed
(Phragmites australis), and yellow nutgrass (Cyperus esculentus)
[<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>].  In the western and central United States, a common cattail
(Typha latifolia)-hardstem bulrush habitat type has been described
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>].

In Montana hardstem bulrush habitat, dominance, and riparian types have
been described [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Common associates include softstem bulrush,
beaked sedge (Carex rostrata), seaside arrowgrass (Triglochin maritima),
common spikesedge (Eleocharis palustris), and common buckbean
(Menyanthes trifoliata).  In Utah hardstem bulrush is commonly
associated with saltmarsh bulrush (Scirpus maritimus), alkali bulrush
(S.  paludosus), saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), and sago pondweed
(Potamogeton pectinatus) [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].

In North Dakota hardstem bulrush is dominant in marshes and meadows.
Associates include whitetop (Scolochloa festucacea), common cattail, and
common reed [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  In Minnesota hardstem bulrush occurs in emergent
marshes with river bulrush (Scirpus fluviatilis), giant burreed
(Sparganium eurycarpus), prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata), and
marsh groundsel (Senecio congestus) [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].

In Canada hardstem bulrush is found in the Delta Marsh of Manitoba
[<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  It is also found in marshes and basins in Saskatchewan and
Alberta [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Scirpus acutus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Hardstem bulrush herbage production is high, but forage value is low.
It is seldom grazed by livestock if other forage is available [<a href="#29">29</a>].  If
upland forage becomes limited and soil conditions dry, livestock and big
game animals may utilize hardstem bulrush [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].

Hardstem bulrush is a staple food for muskrat [<a href="#4">4</a>] and other small
mammals [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  Seeds are eaten by passerines and waterfowl [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].
In California hardstem bulrush comprised 26 percent of American coot
diets [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Hardstem bulrush palatability is rated as poor for sheep and fair for
cattle and horses [<a href="#90">90</a>].  


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Hardstem bulrush nutritional values are rated as follows [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>]:

                           UT        WY        MT        ND

Energy rating is fair and protein content is poor [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>].  In-vitro dry
matter digestibility, crude protein, and phosphorus levels decrease
linearly from late spring to late summer [<a href="#42">42</a>].  


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Hardstem bulrush cover values are rated as follows [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>]:

                            UT       WY       MT       ND

small mammals              good     good     fair     fair

Hardstem bulrush provides valuable nesting cover and escape cover for a
variety of passerines and waterfowl throughout its range [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].
In the prairie pothole region hardstem bulrush is preferred nesting
cover for redhead and canvasback hens [<a href="#71">71</a>].  In Utah hardstem bulrush is
important heron and egret nesting cover [<a href="#7">7</a>].  In Montana muskrat uses
hardstem bulrush in hut construction [<a href="#4">4</a>].  


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Hardstem bulrush erosion control and short-term and long-term
revegetation potential are rated as medium [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>].  Hardstem bulrush
buffers wind and wave action on lakes and ponds, which may enhance the
establishment of vegetation along shorelines [<a href="#38">38</a>].  In California 1.6
foot (0.5 m) segments of hardstem bulrush rhizomes were transplanted in
a tidal zone for erosion control in October 1978.  Hardstem bulrush
survival rate was 4 percent in February 1979 [<a href="#83">83</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In Montana waterfowl managers often attempt to increase the proportion
of the hardstem bulrush dominance type relative to the common cattail
dominance type as a means of improving habitat [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  Consumption of
hardstem bulrush by waterfowl and muskrats may decrease aboveground
standing biomass [<a href="#66">66</a>].  Hardstem bulrush may be replaced by cattail
(Typha spp.) in continuously flooded marshes following drawdown [<a href="#34">34</a>].
However, during years of drought coupled with heavy livestock grazing,
hardstem bulrush may increase at the expense of common cattail [<a href="#92">92</a>].  In
northern prairie wetlands hardstem bulrush replaces river bulrush and
sedges under intensive grazing [<a href="#40">40</a>].

Miller [<a href="#49">49</a>] suggests that hardstem bulrush may be reduced in some ponds
or fields where it dominates by draining the water off and then letting
drought conditions desiccate plants; mowing and burning following
drainage are recommended.  Generally it is necessary to plow and summer
fallow the area for one season for best results.

Hardstem bulrush is used in artificial wetlands to filter agricultural
wastewater [<a href="#38">38</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Scirpus acutus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Hardstem bulrush is a native, perennial graminoid.  Culms are slender
and erect, usually 3.3 to 10 feet (1-3 m) tall, but occasionally
reaching heights of 16.5 feet (5 m) [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  Leaves are
reduced to basal sheaths with blades up to 3.2 inches (8 cm) long [<a href="#51">51</a>].
Hardstem bulrush is densely colonial from extensive, stout rhizomes
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>]. 


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte
   Helophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction:  Hardstem bulrush reproduces by seed [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].
Seed is dispersed by wind and water [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].  It establishes well
from seed stored in the seedbank [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  Hardstem bulrush seed
establishes and germinates best on moist, bare soil [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>], but will
germinate submerged in up to 1.6 inches (4 cm) of water in the
laboratory [<a href="#65">65</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Hardstem bulrush reproduces from rhizomes
[<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  Adventitious shoots may arise from rhizomes that have extended
into pools from the littoral zone [<a href="#62">62</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Hardstem bulrush grows best on sites with saturated soil or standing
water for most of the year.  It occurs in marshes, swamps, seeps,
washes, floodplains, along lake and stream margins, and in wet meadows
[<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].  It grows in fresh or brackish water [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].
Soils are usually poorly drained [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>] or continually saturated
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  Hardstem bulrush can grow in areas where the water table
is up to 5 feet (1.5 m) above or 0.33 feet (0.1 m) below the soil
surface [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>].  In Montana hardstem bulrush is an obligate
wetland species [<a href="#4">4</a>] and an indicator of relatively stable water
conditions (areas where free water remains in the rooting zone for at
least part of the growing season and can be periodically flooded up to
6.6 feet [2 m]) [<a href="#56">56</a>].  In Utah hardstem bulrush is subordinate to Olney
threesquare because of limitations in salinity tolerance, shallow water,
and competitiveness [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Hardstem bulrush is fairly drought tolerant;
it can persist through several years of dry conditions [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Hardstem
bulrush grows in silt loam, clay, sandy loam, gravel, marl, and peaty
soils [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>].

Elevations for hardstem bulrush are as follows:

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Hardstem bulrush is a dominant emergent on moist and saturated sites in
the northern plains and prairie states [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].  In Montana
hardstem bulrush colonizes newly exposed mudflats and drawdown areas
[<a href="#29">29</a>].  In Saskatchewan hardstem bulrush is one of the earliest rooted
macrophytes to invade flooded areas [<a href="#15">15</a>].

After hardstem bulrush becomes established in the hardstem bulrush
riparian site type in Montana, most other plant species are precluded
because of the saturated conditions and hardstem bulrush aggressiveness
[<a href="#31">31</a>].  Hardstem bulrush forms a stable dominance type on sites with
relatively constant water regimes; permanent standing water may result
in compositional shifts toward sedges (Carex spp.) [<a href="#29">29</a>].

In marl-bed vegetation of the Byron-Bergen Swamp of New York, hardstem
bulrush is dominant but may be replaced by shrubby cinquefoil
(Potentilla fruticosa) with accumulated litter [<a href="#62">62</a>].

Hardstem bulrush is found in the third sere of succession in Wisconsin
marshes, preceded by submerged and floating plant stages and followed by
sedge meadows, shrubs, and trees [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Hardstem bulrush flowering dates are as follows:

California          May-Aug          [<a href="#51">51</a>]

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Scirpus acutus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Hardstem bulrush sprouts from rhizomes following fire [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].  After a
prescribed fire in the Great Salt Lake Marsh, Utah, on September 2,
1981, hardstem bulrush sprouts were 1.6 feet (0.5 m) tall before winter
freeze-up [<a href="#68">68</a>].  This fire occurred during an extended drought.
Postfire regeneration included germination from buried seed [<a href="#65">65</a>], and
probably also germination of off-site seed dispersed by wind and water.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)
   Secondary colonizer - on-site seed

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Hardstem bulrush is top-killed or killed by most fires [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>].  


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Hardstem bulrush sprouts from rhizomes following fire [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>], and
probably sprouts from the root crown as well.  It establishes from
buried seed or seed dispersed onto burned sites [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].
Inflorescence production may increase for at least 1 postfire year [<a href="#88">88</a>].
Fire increases protein content in sprouting hardstem bulrush [<a href="#67">67</a>].

At the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge, Utah, herons and egrets nest
almost exclusively in dead hardstem bulrush stands.  Green and dead stem
densities (mean +/- SE) were studied on a March 1981 prescribed burn
site and on unburned nesting colony sites. The results are as follows
[<a href="#7">7</a>]:

<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Burning dead hardstem bulrush stands may have a negative effect on
breeding herons and egrets [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Herons and egrets use dead hardstem
bulrush stems as nesting material.  On the Bear River Migratory Bird
Refuge, fire eliminated all dead hardstem bulrush stems.  Live stems may
be utilized later in the nesting season.  Herons and egrets have been
reported to abandon traditional colonial nest sites that have been
burned [<a href="#91">91</a>]; thus, burning dead stands may have a negative effect on
breeding herons and egrets [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Wetland vertebrates may select certain marsh plant species due to
protein increases following fire [<a href="#66">66</a>].  

The effects of fire and grazing on wetland plants after drawdowns in
Utah's Great Salt Lake Marsh were studied [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  Five acres (2 ha)
were prescribed burned on September 2, 1981, then reflooded 1 week
later.  Data were recorded in areas grazed by waterfowl and muskrats,
and in exclosures protected from grazing.  Mean annual production (g/sq
m/yr) +/- SD of hardstem bulrush (S. acutus and S. validus were both
referred to as S. lacustris) under grazed and burned treatments was
measured from May to August 1982.  Results were as follows [<a href="#66">66</a>]:

                    burned             unburned

grazed            915 +/- 366        1084 +/- 495
ungrazed         1559 +/- 811        1556 +/- 684

The effect of prescribed burning on hardstem bulrush standing crop was
minimal.  The total annual production of the hardstem bulrush vegetation
type after fire was not significantly different (P >.10) than the
production of these types in unburned areas.  Grazing, however, had a
significant impact (P <.05) on production in hardstem bulrush stands.
Grazing significantly reduced the total annual production of the
hardstem bulrush type within the burned sites [<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  Roots and
rhizome numbers were lower on the burned than unburned units, but
mortality was not great enough to significantly reduce total
productivity [<a href="#68">68</a>].

</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>CASE NAME : </b>
Fire effects on wetland vegetation/Malheur NWR, Oregon


<b>REFERENCE : </b>
Young, R. P. 1986 [<a href="#88">88</a>]


<b>SEASON/SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION : </b>
late fall/moderate-high severity
early spring/moderate-high severity


<b>STUDY LOCATION : </b>
The study was located in Harney Basin in the Malheur National Wildlife
Refuge (NWR), Oregon.  


<b>PREFIRE VEGETATIVE COMMUNITY : </b>
A monotypic, palustrine hardstem bulrush (Scirpus acutus) wetland
community type occurs throughout the Malheur NWR.  Standing dead fuel
was assessed 2 to 10 days preceding a fire.  A series of quadrats were
located throughout the cover type; on the quadrats, vegetation was
harvested to ground level and collected for oven drying and weighing.


<b>TARGET SPECIES PHENOLOGICAL STATE : </b>
All prescribed fires were conducted during periods of vegetative
dormancy.  


<b>SITE DESCRIPTION : </b>
The study site was located on a flat to gently rolling landscape at
4,015 to 4,225 feet (1,250-1,280 m) elevation.  Harney Basin is
characterized by a semiarid climate and moderate to cold temperatures.
Annual precipitation averages 10 to 12 inches (250-300 mm), but extremes
of 4 inches (100 mm) and 20 inches (500 mm) have been recorded.  The
bulk of precipitation occurs in winter and spring, whereas summers are
typically dry.  The riverine and palustrine systems occupy the
bottomlands draining into Malheur and Harney lakes.  These are typically
long, narrow wetland zones composed of a continuum of ponds, sloughs,
marshes, and wet meadows.
   


<b>FIRE DESCRIPTION : </b>
Hardstem bulrush prescribed burn sites were at least 5 acres (2 ha) and
were located in areas that would facilitate safe and efficient
controlled burning.  Prefire fuels and fire weather conditions at the
Malheur NWR were as follows:

fire dates                      9 December 1980          7 April 1981
prefire fuel load (g/sq m)
  mean                            1,817                    1,707
  range                           1,062-2,402              887-2,208   
fuel height (cm)                  184                      122
litter depth (cm)                 74                       66
fuel moisture (%)                 4.6                      5.8
temperature (C)                   3-5                      4-9
relative humidity (%)             27-34                    31-35
wind speed (km/h)                 2-16                     6-10

Fire behavior and effects on fuels were as follows:

fire dates                          9 Dec 1980           7 April 1981
rate of spread (m/min) 
  headfire                            5-30                 20-25
  backfire                            1-1.5                1-2
flame length (m)
  headfire                            3-10                 3-4
  backfire                            1-2                  1-2
postfire residual fuels (g/sq m)
  mean                                309                  154
  range                               27-568               12-328
reduction (%)                         83                   91

Rate of spread was strongly influenced by wind speed.  


<b>FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES : </b>
Regenerative tissues arising form rhizomes were protected from heat
injury under conditions of dormant season, surface fires.  Winter and
spring burning of hardstem bulrush increased reproduction for at least 1
year.  Inflorescence production increased by 25 percent for at least 1
year.  Burning increased aboveground standing crop and shoot densities
for 2 years.  Mean shoot weight decreased slightly.  


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS : </b>
Prescribed fires reduce the amount of litter in hardstem bulrush stands,
which may increase hardstem bulrush productivity.
