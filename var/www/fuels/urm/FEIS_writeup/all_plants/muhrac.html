<b>COMMON NAMES : </b>

<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of green muhly is Muhlenbergia
racemosa (Michx.) B.S.P. [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].

Although some authorities recognize M. racemosa and M. glomerata
(Willd.) Trin. as separate species, the diagnostic characters between
the two entities are not consistently correlated.  This write-up will
follow those authorities who put M. glomerata into synonomy with M.
racemosa [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Green muhly plants are scattered and of little importance to livestock
and wildlife [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability of green muhly is fair to good before maturity.  When
plants are immature their palatability is fair for cattle and poor for
wildlife [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  The degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife
species for green muhly has been rated as follows [<a href="#2">2</a>]:

Small mammals           ----    ----    Fair
Small nongame birds     ----    ----    Fair
Upland game birds       ----    ----    Poor


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Green muhly is rated fair in energy value and poor in protein value [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
In Utah, cover value of green muhly is poor for pronghorn and upland
game birds, and fair for elk, mule deer, small mammals, and small
nongame birds [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Compared to other grasses the potential of green muhly for
rehabilitation work in Utah is rated as follows [<a href="#2">2</a>]:

Potential biomass production         Medium
Erosion control potential            Medium
Establishing requirements            Medium
Short-term revegetation potential    Low

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Growth of green muhly starts in late spring with plants blooming from
July to October [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].
