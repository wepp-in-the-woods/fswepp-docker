<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of gray oak is Quercus grisea
Liebm.  It is a member of the oak family (Fagaceae) [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  There are
no recognized infrataxa.  Gray oak hybridizes with four other oak
species where it overlaps their ranges:  Gambel oak (Q. gambelii)
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>], sandpaper oak (Q. pungens), Mohr shin oak (Q. mohriana)
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>], and Arizona white oak (Q. arizonica) [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].

<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Although of limited distribution overall, gray oak is relatively common
in the Trans-Pecos area of Texas [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Its range extends from Texas
westward into the mountains of central and southern New Mexico [<a href="#48">48</a>].
Gray oak is less common in central and southeastern Arizona [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].
The scattered populations of gray oak in northern Mexico extend
southward to Durango and westward from Coahuila to Sonora [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Gray oak is a dominant or codominant member of the Madrean evergreen oak
woodlands, encinal, and pine-oak (Pinus spp.-Quercus spp.) communities
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  It is a codominant or a common mid-story tree in
juniper (Juniperus spp.)-Mexican pinyon (Pinus cembroides) and
juniper-true pinyon pine (P. edulis)-oak habitat series or community
types [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  Gray oak is a dominant species in the
juniper-gray oak association [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  It is the principal tree in
gray oak series and community types [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  Gray oak occurs as a
dominant shrub in pinyon-juniper woodlands [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].  In riparian
habitats, gray oak is an important subdominant species in the bigtooth
maple (Acer grandidentatum)-oak series, in the western soapberry
(Sapindus saponaria) and lanceleaf cottonwood (Populus acuminata)/
sandbar willow (Salix exigua) habitat types, and in mesophytic
communities of New Mexico and Texas [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  It may replace
little walnut (Juglans microcarpa) in wet areas [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Gray oak is an
indicator species in the ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) series and
occurs in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests that have a lower
stratum of oaks [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  Some of the publications in which
gray oak is listed as a dominant or indicator species are:

(1)  Classification of the forest vegetation on the National Forests of
       Arizona and New Mexico [<a href="#2">2</a>]
(2)  Forest and woodland habitat types (plant associations) of Arizona
       south of the Mogollon Rim and southwestern New Mexico [<a href="#3">3</a>]
(3)  Forest habitat types in the Apache, Gila, and part of the Cibola
       National Forests, Arizona and New Mexico [<a href="#20">20</a>]

Several woody species associated with gray oak that were not previously
mentioned in the Distribution and Occurrence information include
fendlerbush (Fendlera rupicola), bushy sage (Salvia ramosissima), Texas
madrone (Arbutus texana), Fremont barberry (Berberis fremontii),
Louisiana sagewort (Artemisia ludoviciana), and soaptree yucca (Yucca
elata) [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus grisea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
The hard, heavy wood of gray oak has little commercial value.  It is
used as fence posts and firewood [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  Large-sized gray oak are
sometimes used for furniture [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Gray oak is seldom used by cattle or sheep, but other livestock and
wildlife browse gray oak leaves [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  In a feeding study in New
Mexico, gray oak ingestion adversely affected angora goat nutritional
status by significantly (P<0.05) reducing forage intake, digestibility,
and nitrogen retention [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Gray oak is valuable spring browse for
pronghorn [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Its leaves are highly utilized by elk, white-tailed
deer, and mule deer [<a href="#54">54</a>].  Squirrels, rodents, Arizona porcupine,
Merriam's turkeys, thick-billed parrots, Viosca's pigeons, and other
birds consume gray oak acorns [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].

In Upper Dog Canyon of the Guadalupe Mountains in Texas and New Mexico,
where gray oak occurred in a bigtooth maple community, 42 breeding bird
species were recorded over a 3-year period [<a href="#45">45</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Gray oak is unpalatable to cattle and sheep and has fair palatability
for pronghorn [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>]. 


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Gray oak has a lower digestibility than alfalfa.  In one study, gray oak
leaves and stems had 8 percent crude protein and 38 percent in vivo
digestibility.  It had 1.7 percent total nitrogen and 35.1 percent acid
detergent fiber [<a href="#29">29</a>].  In New Mexico, the phosphorus levels of the
current growth were at favorable levels for elk and mule deer during
spring.  Current growth digestibility over the year ranged from 51
percent in winter to 39 percent in the fall; protein was 11 percent in
the spring and 7 to 8 percent for the rest of the year [<a href="#54">54</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The low shrubby growth form of gray oak provides good cover for jack
rabbits, cottontails, encinal mice, gray fox, and racoon [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Although no direct reference to gray oak acorn consumption by humans was
found in the literature, gray oak belongs to the white oak subgenus
(Lepidobalanus).  Edible acorns are a characteristic of the group [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Gray oak often occurs on sites of poor quality for timber production [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Equations have been developed to estimate gray oak volume and biomass as
measures of current production and utilization [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].

In the southwestern United States, herbicides and mechanical methods
have been used with good grazing practices to control woody plants such
as gray oak [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Angora goats are not effective in controlling gray
oak [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Gray oak appeared to decrease under grazing in an evergreen woodland in
Texas.  The importance value of gray oak on plots protected from grazing
from 1946 to 1962 in livestock grazed plots was 133; the importance
value on grazed plots was 83 [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Converted pinyon-juniper woodlands provide grasslands or enhance
watersheds.  These large scale clearings of pinyon-juniper woodlands
reduce gray oak populations [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus grisea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Gray oak is a native medium-sized tree from 20 to 65 feet (6-20 m) tall
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Its growth form varies from a tree with one trunk to a
clonal shrub [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Gray oak is many branched.  It may be low growing and
less than 18 inches (45.7 cm) in diameter [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Gray oak leaves are
evergreen or drought-deciduous, depending upon the amount of winter
precipitation received [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  The leaves are leathery and small, 0.8
to 3 inches (2-7.5 cm) long [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Pistillate catkins have one to six
flowers; staminate catkins are loosely flowered.  Acorns are solitary or
paired and are about 0.5 inch (1.2 cm) long [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Gray oak reproduces asexually and sexually.  Shrubby gray oak puts out
many ramets [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Gray oak is monoecious.  Acorns are produced annually
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  No information on gray oak acorn germination was found in the
literature.  However, the other southwestern oaks, such as Arizona white
oak and Emory oak (Q. emoryi), have no seed dormancy.  Most germination
occurs within 30 days after acorns drop from the trees [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Acorn
consumption by animals may substantially depress gray oak establishment
rates.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Gray oak occurs along drainages, arroyos, rocky slopes, foothills,
bajadas, stream sides, and terraces [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  It is a facultative
riparian species [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Gray oak has a low-growing form in open savannas
[<a href="#16">16</a>].  It reaches tree size in mesic canyons [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Gray oak occurs
in semiarid climates characterized by mild winters, hot summers, and dry
springs [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  It is found on shallow, rocky soils with textures
that range from clays to sandy loams. The soils often are derived from
igneous or dolomitic parent materials [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].

Gray oak can be found from lower slopes to ridgetops [<a href="#20">20</a>].  It occurs
from 4,000 to 9,000 feet (1,219-2,743 m) throughout its range
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Gray oak predominantly occurs on north-facing exposures on
lower slopes, but it has been reported from all aspects [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].
At higher elevations, it may be restricted to sun-exposed or
southeastern aspects [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].



<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Gray oak is a seral or climax understory species in pinyon-juniper
woodlands [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Following cabling or fire in pinyon-juniper woodlands,
gray oak and other oaks begin to establish after about 4 years, during
the grass and forb stage [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  Gray oak is a seral species in
Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine forests, and a climax understory species
in ponderosa pine and Chihuahuan pine (Pinus leiophylla var.
chihuahuana) forests [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Gray oak is a climax species in
Madrean evergreen oak and encinal communities [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Gray oak flowers as new leaves emerge [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Acorns mature during the
autumn [<a href="#60">60</a>].  Leaves may remain throughout the winter until new leaves
are produced in mid-March through April [<a href="#1">1</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus grisea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Gray oak is codominant or present in Mexican pinyon habitat types.  The
fire chronology of Mexican pinyon types, in which gray oak occurs,
indicates numerous separate fires.  Fire-produced scars on Mexican
pinyon occurred in intervals from 9 to 60 or more years [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Naturally
caused fires were probably less frequent and greater in size and
severity before the settlement of this area than in more recent times [<a href="#15">15</a>].

No fire ecology information on gray oak was found in the literature.
The shrubby growth form of gray oak, which produces numerous ramets, may
sprout after being top-killed by fire.  Oaks generally survive
low-intensity, fast fires.  Fires that occur in closed-canopy oak
woodlands are probably high-intensity, stand replacement fires [<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tree with adventitious-bud root crown/soboliferous species
root sucker
   Tall shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed






</pre>

<pre>
<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus grisea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Gray oak is probably top-killed by fire.  Surviving individuals with a
shrubby growth form may sprout.  Sprouting information on gray oak with
a single trunk was not found in the literature.  However, McPherson [<a href="#39">39</a>]
asserts that all of the oaks of Arizona, which include gray oak, sprout
prolifically following top-kill by fire.  The acorns probably are killed
by fire.  Acorns covered by an insulating layer of soil may survive
low-severity fires.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
The response of gray oak to fire was not found in the literature.  If
surviving gray oak sprout following the removal of top-growth, gray oak
may reestablish dominance relatively quickly.  Site factors will
influence the length of time required to achieve prefire crown cover.
If establishment depends on off-site seed, rates of recovery will vary
depending upon the proximity of seed trees and on animal facilitation
and seed predation.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
The build-up of surface fuels is slow in the low productivity
pinyon-juniper savannas where gray oak occurs in Big Bend National Park,
Texas [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Fine fuels in pine-oak woodlands in the Park are mainly
grasses; grass fires leave trees intact.  On mesic Park sites in the
pine-oak woodland, low-growing gray oak and other shrubs rarely carry a
fire unless it crowns out [<a href="#15">15</a>].

A downed woody material summary is useful for assessing fire potential
and danger.  Downed woody material ranged from 2.8 to 9.2 cubic feet per
acre in pine-oak woodlands and from 40.1 to 81.7 cubic feet per acre in
moist woodlands [<a href="#15">15</a>].
