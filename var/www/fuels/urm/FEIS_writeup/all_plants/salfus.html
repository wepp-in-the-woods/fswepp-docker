<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix fuscescens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Alaska bog willow occurs throughout most of the Alaskan boreal forest
except in the Aleutian Islands and the along the southeastern coast of
Alaska.  Outside of Alaska, its range extends from the Yukon Territory
to the Hudson Bay [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>]

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Willows (Salix spp.) are generally preferred food and building materials
for beaver [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Willow shoots, catkins, leaves, and buds are eaten by
numerous small mammals and birds [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Willows are a staple year-round food for moose.  Moose browse on twigs
in winter and consume leaves and new shoots in summer [<a href="#6">6</a>].

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Willow stem cuttings are commonly planted for restoration of wildlife
habitat, streambank protection, and the reclamation of sites disturbed
by mining and construction [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  Alaska bog willow is apparently
well adapted for these purposes [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
All willows produce salacin, which is closely related to aspirin.
Native Americans used various preparations of willows to treat
toothaches, bee stings, stomach aches, and diarrhea; they used the stems
for making baskets, bows, arrows, and fish and muskrat traps [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix fuscescens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Alaska bog willow is a native, low-growing, much-branched, trailing
deciduous shrub 4 to 12 inches (10-30 cm) tall [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Male and female
flowers occur on separate plants in 0.75 to 1.5 inch (1.9-3.8 cm) long
catkins.  The fruit is a two-valved capsule [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Like all willows, Alaska bog willow's primary mode of reproduction is
sexual.  It produces an abundance of small, lightweight seed.  It
probably begins seed production at an early age (between 2 to 10 years).
At maturity the capsular fruits split open to release the minute downy
seeds that are dispersed by either wind or water [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Willows are prolific sprouters.  Alaska bog
willow sprouts from from the root crown if aboveground stems are broken
or destroyed by cutting or fire [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Alaska bog willow commonly occurs in wet tundra, small bogs, swamps,
riverbanks, and in open black spruce (Picea mariana) muskegs throughout
most of the Alaskan boreal forest [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Frequent associates include
alder (Alder spp.), bog birch (Betula glandulosa), balsam popular
(Populus balsamifera), and numerous willows (Salix spp.) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

Alaska bog willow is an early seral species.  Like other willows it
probably becomes abundant after disturbances that open the canopy and
expose the mineral soil.  It occurs in the early seral stages following
fire in black spruce stands [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Alaska bog willow flowers in June; the fruits ripen in July [<a href="#18">18</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix fuscescens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Information on Alaska bog willows's ability to sprout following fire is
lacking.  It probably sprouts prolifically immediately after fire.  Like
most willows, Alaska bog willow's wind-dispersed seed are probably
important in colonizing recently burned sites [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Small shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix fuscescens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Low- to moderate-severity fires generally top-kill willows.  Severe fire
can kill willows by completely removing soil organic layers and charring
the roots [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Like most willows, Alaska bog willow probably sprouts vigorously after
fire [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>].  Information regarding postfire establishment for Alaska bog
willow is lacking.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
NO-ENTRY
