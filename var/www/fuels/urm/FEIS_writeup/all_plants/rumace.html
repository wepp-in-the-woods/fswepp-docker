<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Sheep sorrel occurs mainly in grassland, mixed-grass prairie, and
montane meadow communities of western North America, but is also common
in forested communities throughout temperate North America.  

Sheep sorrel is common in floodplain and riparian habitats.  In western
Washington sheep sorrel is found on gravel bars and floodplains
dominated by Scouler willow (Salix scouleriana).  Other associates
include Virginia strawberry (Fragaria virginiana), velvetgrass (Holcus
lanatus), white clover (Trifolium repens), curly dock (Rumex crispus),
and bog rush (Juncus effusus) [<a href="#20">20</a>].  In Oregon sheep sorrel occurs in a
riparian mountain meadow community dominated by cheatgrass (Bromus
tectorum) [<a href="#45">45</a>].  In California sheep sorrel occurs in a freshwater marsh
community dominated by tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), sedge (Carex
spp.), and narrow-leaved cattail (Typha angustifolia) [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Sheep sorrel is commonly found in old fields, annual grassland, and
montane meadow communities.  In Connecticut sheep sorrel occurs in a
postagricultural little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) grassland.
Associates include redtop (Agrostis alba) and yellow sedge (Carex
pensylvanica) [<a href="#69">69</a>].  In New Jersey sheep sorrel is a member of an
old-field plant community dominated by Canada goldenrod (Solidago
canadensis) [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Sheep sorrel is commonly found in southern Appalachian
grassy bald communities dominated by mountain oatgrass (Danthonia
compressa).  Other associates include thornless blackberry (Rubus
canadensis), hillside blueberry (Vaccinium pallidum), and violet (Viola
spp.) [<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  In Indiana sheep sorrel occurs in a litte bluestem
community with hackberry (Celtis occidentalis) and smooth horsetail
(Equisetum laevigatum) [<a href="#81">81</a>].  In Montana sheep sorrel occurs in
mixed-grass prairie communities [<a href="#86">86</a>].

In California sheep sorrel is common in annual grassland, montane
meadow, and perennial bunchgrass communities.  Associates include ripgut
brome (Bromus rigidus), soft chess (B. hordeaceus), silver hairgrass
(Aira caryophyllea), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratense), Sandberg
bluegrass (P. nevadensis), Italian thistle (Carduus pycnocephalus), wild
oat (Avena fatua), and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum)
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  

At Point Reyes National Seashore, California, sheep sorrel occurs in a
coastal grassland community with coast rock cress (Arabis
blepharophylla), poison-oak (Toxicodendron diversiloba), California
barberry (Berberis pinnata), and the endangered Sonoma spineflower
(Chorizanthe valida) [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].

Sheep sorrel is a common understory species in forested habitats
throughout North America.  In Pennsylvania sheep sorrel occurs in
eastern white pine (Pinus strobus)-poverty oatgrass (D. spicata)
communities; associates include Canada goldenrod, fireweed (Epilobium
angustifolium), whorled yellow loosestrife (Lysimachia quadrifolia),
Virginia springbeauty (Claytonia virginica), trout lily (Erythronium
americanum), mountain wood sorrel (Oxalis montana), and violet
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>].  In Alberta sheep sorrel is a member of an 80-year-old white
spruce (Picea glauca)-jack pine (Pinus banksiana)-feathermoss
(Pleurozium spp.)  community [<a href="#21">21</a>].  In Idaho sheep sorrel occurs in
grand fir (Abies grandis)/wild ginger (Asarum caudatum), grand
fir/pachistima (Pachistima myrsinites), and grand fir/ninebark
(Physocarpus malvaceus) habitat types [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>].  In California
sheep sorrel occurs in redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), Douglas-fir
(Pseudotsuga menziesii), and Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana)
habitats [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>].

In Montana and Wyoming, sheep sorrel is found in alpine tundra
environments [<a href="#94">94</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rumex acetosella
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
In Arizona sheep sorrel is grazed by cattle and sheep, but has little
forage value [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Sheep sorrel contains oxalic acid which can be
poisonous [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].

In California and Ohio sheep sorrel is grazed by mule deer [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].  In
Idaho, Montana, and Wisconsin sharp-tailed grouse and ruffed grouse eat
sheep sorrel seed [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].  


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
In Utah palatability ratings for sheep sorrel are fair for cattle and
poor for sheep and horses [<a href="#100">100</a>].  


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Sheep sorrel nutritional levels are adequate to meet the requirements of
mule deer [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Energy and protein content ratings of sheep sorrel are
poor.  Nutritional values are rated as poor for waterfowl and fair for
elk, mule deer, upland game birds, small nongame birds, and small
mammals [<a href="#100">100</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
In Utah sheep sorrel cover values are rated as fair for small mammals
and small nongame birds and poor for upland game birds and waterfowl
[<a href="#100">100</a>].  


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Sheep sorrel colonizes disturbed sites such as clearcuts, streambanks,
and surface mined lands.  It has been used for revegetation of disturbed
lands, although it is rated low for erosion control, and short- and
long-term revegetation potential [<a href="#100">100</a>].  In a mining and smelting region
of Sudbury, Ontario, sheep sorrel established when a thin sprinkling
of limestone was applied to the soil [<a href="#97">97</a>].

In east-central Texas revegetation of eight unreclaimed mine sites
occurred naturally.  These sites and an adjacent unmined site were
sampled to determine vegetational changes over time.  The percent
frequency of sheep sorrel was as follows [<a href="#79">79</a>]:

    3m*    6m    5y    10y    15y    20y    30y    50y    control
   
     0     11     4      6      4      3      0      0       0

*m=months since first sampling, y=years since first sampling

In Pennsylvania an attempt was made to transplant rootstocks of sheep
sorrel on black waste sites created by anthracite mining.  All emergent
vegetation was subsequently heat killed [<a href="#77">77</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Sheep sorrel leaves are used in salads [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  The Nuxalk Indians of
British Columbia eat sheep sorrel [<a href="#55">55</a>].  


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Sheep sorrel is classified as a noxious weed in 23 states [<a href="#67">67</a>].  It is a
serious weed in pastures and rangelands.  Control is difficult because
of its perennial, creeping rhizomes [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Sheep sorrel is a common
weed in West Virginia, except in limestone regions; liming the soil may
help eradicate sheep sorrel [<a href="#82">82</a>].  

Sheep sorrel presence and abundance are indicative of poor and "sour"
soils [<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>].  It reaches peak abundance at low soil nitrogen levels
[<a href="#87">87</a>].  Sheep sorrel is potentially poisonous to livestock because of the
presence of soluble oxalates [<a href="#19">19</a>]; however, it is grazed by sheep and
cattle [<a href="#39">39</a>].  In Idaho sheep sorrel is an increaser species under heavy
grazing regimes, and a decreaser species under light grazing regimes
[<a href="#54">54</a>].  In Oregon percent frequency of sheep sorrel was not affected by
late season cattle grazing in a riparian mountain meadow [<a href="#45">45</a>].

In Novia Scotia sheep sorrel is one of the most common weed species in
lowbush blueberry fields.  Control with hexazinone was attempted but
after the activity of the herbicide decreased, sheep sorrel grew and
produced a large number of seeds [<a href="#62">62</a>].  In Pennsylvania in a goldenrod
(Solidago spp.)-aster (Aster spp.) community, sheep sorrel was dominant
in 1- and 3-year-old plowed, disked, prometone-treated plots [<a href="#64">64</a>].  

Control Methods:  Repeat cultivation during dry weather gradually
weakens rootstalks of sheep sorrel [<a href="#19">19</a>].  According to Fitzsimmons [<a href="#19">19</a>]
several herbicides can selectively control sheep sorrel.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rumex acetosella
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sheep sorrel is an introduced rhizomatous perennial herb that sometimes
forms dense colonies by adventitious shoots from widely spreading roots
and rhizomes [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>].  Stems are erect, slender, and 4 to 24
inches (10-60 cm) tall [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].  Leaves are 0.8 to 4 inches (2-10 cm)
long and 0.4 to 0.8 inch (1-2 cm) wide [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].  The fruit is an
achene [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].  Roots are slender, almost fibrous and
penetrate to a depth of 5 feet (1.5 m) [<a href="#48">48</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Sheep sorrel reproduces by seed.  It is wind pollinated and
seed is dispersed by wind and insects [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>].  Sheep sorrel regularly
colonizes from buried seed following disturbance [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  In
Massachusetts sheep sorrel was not present in the ground cover of most
eastern white pine and red pine (Pinus resinosa) stands, but seeds were
contained in soil samples from 1-to 80-year-old stands.  In the
laboratory soil-stored seeds from all stands germinated [<a href="#57">57</a>].

Vegetative:  Sheep sorrel reproduces from creeping roots and rhizomes
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>].  Shoots develop from stem buds that arise adventitiously
at irregular intervals on horizontal roots.  Adventitious buds are
usually found in the top 8 inches (20 cm) of soil [<a href="#48">48</a>].  


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sheep sorrel is common in fields, pastures, meadows, waste places, and
along roadsides [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].  In Olympic National Park,
Washington, sheep sorrel is commonly found on lower terraces and gravel
bars of the riparian zone [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>].  Sheep sorrel is generally found in
open, unshaded areas on disturbed sites [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].  It thrives on
acidic soils with low fertility, but is adapted to a variety of soil
types [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>].  Sheep sorrel is commonly found on sandy loam, fine
sandy, silty, and gravelly soils [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>].  

Elevations for sheep sorrel are as follows:

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Sheep sorrel invades disturbed sites and may move onto undisturbed sites
when growing conditions are ideal [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>].  It is commonly found on
clearcut, burned, and flood-disturbed riparian sites [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>].  It
colonizes rapidly by seed and may persist for 15 to 20 years through
vegetative growth and propagation [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Competition from other species
on good soils may reduce its abundance [<a href="#19">19</a>].

In South Carolina sheep sorrel is found in the early seral stages of a
disturbed old-field broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus)
community [<a href="#101">101</a>].  

In the Pacific Northwest sheep sorrel seed generally remains viable in
the soil long enough to provide a source of new infestations when the
soil is disturbed [<a href="#19">19</a>].  In Massachusetts buried sheep sorrel seed
germinated from soil samples from eastern white pine and red pine stands
1 to 80 years old [<a href="#57">57</a>].  

Sheep sorrel is moderately shade tolerant.  In the foothills of the
Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges, California, sheep sorrel was more
abundant under dead blue oak (Quercus douglasii) trees (5.7%) than in
open grassland (5.2%) or live blue oak stands (<0.1%) [<a href="#36">36</a>].

<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Sheep sorrel probably sprouts from rhizomes following fire and
establishes from on-site seed [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Several studies describe
establishment or increase of sheep sorrel after fire.  Very severe fire
may kill sheep sorrel.

In New Brunswick a woodlot was clearcut in the fall of 1949 and
prescribed burned in April 1951.  The number of stems of sheep sorrel
per area present in June 1949, 1950, 1951, and 1952 were 0, 0, 18, and
28, respectively [<a href="#31">31</a>].  In New Brunswick understory layers of 11 mixed
hardwood stands representing an age sequence of 7 to 57 postfire years
were examined.  Sampling occurred in July and August 1973 and 1974.
Sheep sorrel was found in stands 7, 10, 13, 17, and 25 years old.  It
did not occur in some 7-year-old stands, or in stands 18, 20, 29, and 37
years old [<a href="#58">58</a>].

In Idaho seral brushfields in a grand fir/pachistima habitat type were
prescribed burned on May 14, 1975, and a portion was seeded on May 15,
1975.  Sheep sorrel was present on the burn-only area, but did not occur
on the burn-and-seed site.  Frequency (out of 10 possible plots) of
sheep sorrel was as follows [<a href="#53">53</a>]:

In Idaho a wildfire burned a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest and
adjacent montane grassland on August 10, 1973 for 43 days.  Fourteen
sites were examined in June 1974 and June 1976.  Percent cover and
frequency of sheep sorrel on burned and unburned sites were as follows
[<a href="#65">65</a>]:
                            1974                     1976

In Washington on the Mount Adams huckleberry (Vaccinium spp.)  fields,
an experimental area was prescribed burned from October 3-7, 1972.
Average understory cover (%) of sheep sorrel from 1972 to 1977 was as
follows [<a href="#66">66</a>]:

               1972 (before treatment)    1973    1974    1975    1977

In Great Britain severe fires in late summer 1976 killed all surface
vegetation.  Sheep sorrel first appeared in burned areas in October
1985, postfire year 9 [<a href="#59">59</a>].  


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Some research describes no change in cover or frequency in sheep sorrel
after fire.  In California the effects of a late fall burn on a mountain
meadow in Grover Hot Springs State Park were evaluated.  Both wet and
dry meadow plots were prescribed burned by a low- to moderate-intensity
fire in mid-November 1987.  Sheep sorrel was found only on dry plots
before burning and did not increase following fire [<a href="#8">8</a>].

In Connecticut experimental tracts were set up in a little bluestem
grassland in 1967.  Tract A was prescribed burned annually from
1968-1976, and in 1978, 1980, 1983, and 1985.  Tract B was prescribed
burned annually from 1968-1975, and in 1978, 1980, 1983, and 1985.
Sheep sorrel percent cover and frequency in two burns and 2 control
plots on each tract were as follows [<a href="#69">69</a>]:

                     Tract A                        Tract B
