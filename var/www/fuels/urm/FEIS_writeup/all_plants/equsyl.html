<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of wood horsetail is Equisetum
sylvaticum L. [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  The following varieties and form are
recognized [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>]:

  Equisetum sylvaticum var. sylvaticum -- with scabrous branches
  E. sylvaticum var. pauciramosum Milde. -- smooth branches, slightly branched
  E. sylvaticum f. multiramosum Fern. -- smooth branches, copiously branched

Wood horsetail is a highly variable species; many varieties and forms
have been described that have little taxonomic significance [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Wood horsetail apparently hybridizes with meadow horsetail (E. pratense)
[<a href="#10">10</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Wood horsetail is most prevalent in lowland wet conifer forests but is
also common in mixed upland, dry conifer, and deciduous forest habitats
[<a href="#3">3</a>].  In addition, it is found in meadows, bogs, swamps, and along
streambanks [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].

The following publications classify wood horsetail as a dominant
herbaceous layer component:

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Equisetum sylvaticum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Wood horsetail is a perennial, deciduous, homosporous pteridophyte
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  Sterile stems are green with lacy branches and grow up to 28
inches (70 cm) tall.  Fertile stems are at first unbranched and lack
chlorophyll but become branched and green after spores are released.
Strobili are usually 1 inch (3 cm) long and are borne on short stalks at
the apices of fertile stems [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  The spores germinate to produce
a distinct gametophytic generation.  The unisexual gametophyte is very
small, generally from 0.002 to 0.008 inch (0.5-2.0 mm) in height [<a href="#9">9</a>].
Wood horsetail often forms large stands [<a href="#24">24</a>].  It has extensive creeping
rhizomes which may outweigh aerial shoots by a ratio of 100 to 1 [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Wood horsetail primarily reproduces by vegetative means; the majority of
shoots arise from rhizomes [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  Rhizome systems are extensive, deeply
buried, and extremely long-lived (perhaps several thousand years old)
[<a href="#1">1</a>].

The establishment of gametophytes and subsequent sexual reproduction is
rare in the wild due to an extremely narrow habitat tolerance.  The most
critical factor for sexual reproduction appears to be the initial
establishment of spores.  Gametophytes only establish on recently
exposed bare mud, such as around resevoirs or streambanks following
flooding.  Wood horsetail has a very limited spore dispersal period, and
spores are short-lived.  Male gametophytes grow at a much slower rate
than females.  There is also evidence of early male mortality.
Gametophytes reach sexual maturity at 3 to 5 weeks and then produce a
constant supply of gametes until death.  The sex ratio of a population
is determined by environmental conditions; female gametophytes are more
likely to be produced under favorable conditions [<a href="#9">9</a>].  The frequent
occurence of Equisetum hybrids suggests, however, that sexual
reproduction is a common occurrence in this genus [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Wood horsetail most commonly occurs in cool, moist, shaded to somewhat
open forests [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  It also occurs on streambanks, and in bogs,
swamps, and forest openings [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Wood horsetail is an
indicator of boreal and cool-temperate climates, and very moist to wet,
nitrogen-poor soils [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Soils may be poorly drained to moderately
well drained [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Wood horsetail is found from lowlands to subalpine
regions [<a href="#22">22</a>].  In the Adirondack Mountains of New York, it occurs from
1,460 to 2,200 feet (438-660 m) in elevation [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Gametophytes of wood
horsetail are found on substrates with a lower pH than are gametophytes
of other horesetail species [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Wood horsetail is shade tolerant [<a href="#25">25</a>]. It is found throughout all
successional stages to climax forests [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Wood horsetail colonizes
newly exposed mud on streambanks and floodplains [<a href="#9">9</a>], and it invades
recently burned areas [<a href="#25">25</a>].  In floodplain succession in interior
Alaska, wood horsetail is common in 200-year-old white spruce-black
spruce and climax black spruce/sphagnum forests [<a href="#41">41</a>].  It is also
widespread in black spruce stands from 26 to 120 years old in Ontario
[<a href="#38">38</a>].  Wood horsetail is common in stable, mature forests in
west-central Alberta [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
In the Northern Clay Belt Region, Ontario, fertile shoots of wood
horsetail appear before sterile shoots, liberate their spores, and die
before sterile shoots complete their growth.  Most fertile shoots die by
the end of June, and sterile shoots begin to die in August [<a href="#1">1</a>].  In most
areas within its distributional range, wood horsetail spores are shed
from April through May [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Equisetum sylvaticum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Wood horsetail survives repeated fires by means of deeply buried
rhizomes that are apparently almost indestructible [<a href="#1">1</a>].  The extensive
rhizome system penetrates well into mineral soil or clay, allowing
revegetation even after severe fire [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Wood horsetail may be
the most abundant herb species after fires in black spruce stands in
Alaska.  It sprouts after fire in any stage of succession [<a href="#45">45</a>].

Wood horsetail also colonizes recently burned areas by wind-dispersed
spores [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Its phenotypic plasticity enables it to survive the
environmental changes associated with postfire succession [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil
   Geophyte, growing points deep in soil
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Equisetum sylvaticum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Aboveground stems of wood horsetail are killed by fire [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Rhizomes
are resistant to fire because they are buried deep in mineral soil
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
In the Northern Clay Belt Region of Ontario, wood horsetail recovers
rapidly after fire and is one of the most prominent postfire species.
It becomes less abundant in the later stages of postfire succession, but
is still present under mature spruce (Picea spp.) stands up to 240 years
old.  Shoots that appear immediately after fire are sterile, but up to
20 percent of the stems that appear in postfire year 1 are fertile [<a href="#1">1</a>].

In central Saskatchewan, wood horsetail was present 4 years after fires
on moist and moderately moist sites in jack pine clearcuts [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Wood horsetail regenerates rapidly following fire in black
spruce/feathermoss forests in southeastern Newfoundland, and its
abundance may exceed prefire levels.  Its frequency was 27.8 percent in
unburned areas and 21.1 percent in areas that had been burned 5 years
previously [<a href="#16">16</a>].

On mesic black spruce sites in interior Alaska, wood horsetail is
present throughout all stages of postfire succession.  The following
cover and frequency percentages were reported [<a href="#15">15</a>]:

Stage               Years since fire       Cover         Frequency
__________________________________________________________________________
Newly burned               0-1             <0.5             10.0

Spruce                    90-200+           4.0             49.0

After the 1971 Wickersham Dome Fire near Fairbanks Alaska, wood
horsetail had the following cover and frequency percentages in lightly
burned and severely burned black spruce stands (control plot cover and
frequency was 1.25 and 60.0 percent, respectively) [<a href="#43">43</a>]:

               1971            1972             1973            1974

In this same study area, wood horsetail had cover values on fireline
sites of 4, 40, and 12 percent in 1972, 1975, and 1980, respectively [<a href="#42">42</a>].
