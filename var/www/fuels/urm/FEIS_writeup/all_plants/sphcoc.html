<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
In many range studies scarlet globemallow is noted as the most common
forb in those areas that it is found; however, a grass species is
usually identified as the dominant understory species in related plant
community information.  Scarlet globemallow has been noted as present
but not necessarily dominant in several plant typings:

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Scarlet globemallow is commonly eaten by almost all species of
herbivores where it occurs and is an important part of the diets of
small mammals, pronghorn, sheep, and cattle [<a href="#17">17</a>].  


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Scarlet globemallow palatability is generally thought to be fair to
poor, although in the southwestern portions of its range it is an
important part of the diets of many animals [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Scarlet
globemallow provides excellent forage for deer, pronghorn and cattle,
and is a staple in black-tailed prairie dog diets [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].

The degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife species for scarlet
globemallow in several western states is rated as follows [<a href="#7">7</a>]:

Mule deer diets in New Mexico contained 3 percent scarlet globemallow in
a pinyon-juniper/oak area [<a href="#26">26</a>], and a study in Colorado determined that
scarlet globemallow is the largest single pronghorn dietary item in the
summer (18% of total diet) [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Summer use and preference values
of scarlet globemallow for cattle can be broken down by state:

Scarlet globemallow was found in higher proportions in cattle diets
where it grew on fertilized land in New Mexico [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Several studies have examined the importance of scarlet globemallow to
black-tailed prairie dogs and other small mammals.  Black-tailed
prairie dogs apparently prefer scarlet globemallow in fall
(September-November) [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  The following table presents the percent
composition of scarlet globemallow in the diets of several species.

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Scarlet globemallow contains high amounts of vitamin A, low amounts of
magnesium and calcium, and is considered highly digestible [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Scarlet
globemallow roots have a higher seasonal (fall) concentration of
carbohydrate reserves than any other organ; the average yearly
carbohydrate content in scarlet globemallow is 107 mg per gram of plant
[<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Scarlet globemallow provides fair cover for small nongame mammals and
birds [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Scarlet globemallow readily invades disturbed areas.  Webb and Guthery
[<a href="#45">45</a>] found that the percentage of scarlet globemallow cover increased
when a northwest Texas mesquite rangeland was disked:

                           1978    1979    1980
                           ----    ----    ----
        undisked            0.2     0.6     1.9
        disked              1.0     0.8     2.3

A similar response occurred after a fire in western North Dakota.  These
increases are primarily due to a reduction in competition from other
plants.  The deep rhizomes of scarlet globemallow enable it to survive
disking, fires, and grazing; when other species are eliminated scarlet
globemallow proliferates [<a href="#8">8</a>].  To illustrate the degree to which scarlet
globemallow can withstand disturbance, changes in cover percentages
following various degrees of soil scarification are presented below [<a href="#3">3</a>]:

Scarlet globemallow has been known to volunteer on mine spoils to a
certain degree [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>], but is not considered a colonizer on such [<a href="#39">39</a>].
Bjugstad and Whitman [<a href="#4">4</a>] seeded coal mine spoils in North Dakota, and
obtained a maximum of 21 scarlet globemallow plants in a square meter
plot, but usually fewer.  On bentonite (clay) mine spoils in Montana,
scarlet globemallow was the most common forb in the surrounding area,
but it did not invade the spoils to any degree [<a href="#32">32</a>].

The planting of scarlet globemallow for rehabilitative purposes may not
be feasible since the seeds are hard to collect and therefore expensive, and
the germination rate is low.  Since scarlet globemallow is somewhat
palatable and nutritious to livestock, disking or burning the range may
increase the occurrence of this plant [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Native North Americans chewed scarlet globemallow and applied it as a
paste to relieve the pain of burns and flesh wounds [<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Nitrogen fertilization may increase the palatability of scarlet
globemallow [<a href="#19">19</a>], however fertilization does not increase biomass
production [<a href="#9">9</a>].  An exception to this is a study done by Goetz [<a href="#15">15</a>] in
which basal cover of scarlet globemallow increased after fertilization
on one site of three; Goetz believes that fertilization results are site
specific.

In a study of scarlet globemallow invasion patterns, Grygiel, Bonham and
Redente [<a href="#17">17</a>] found that scarlet globemallow will invade readily where a
native grass seed mixture has been planted on disturbed sites, but not
where introduced grasses are planted; fertilization made no difference.
 
Disking, burning, and even grazing increases scarlet globemallow
production on the range for several years if competition from grasses is
limited [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Scarlet globemallow is also very drought tolerant [<a href="#21">21</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Sphaeralcea coccinea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Scarlet globemallow is a native, warm-season, perennial forb with a
stout woody taproot [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Erect or decumbent, this plant is 3 to 12
inches in height (7-30 cm).  Leaves are grayish-green and palmately
lobed; the light pink to brick red flowers are clustered in terminal
spike-like racemes [<a href="#17">17</a>].

The roots of scarlet globemallow growing in Saskatchewan have been
described by Coupland and Johnson [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Maximum root depth is 40 to 72
inches (1-1.8 cm).  The tap root decreases in diameter from 0.2 inch
(2-5 mm) near the soil surface, to 0.04 inch (1 mm) at the deepest
levels.  There is little or no branching from the taproot in the top 40
inches (1 m) of soil in the central U.S., however in this study one or
two large branches (1-3 mm) are given off 11.8 inches from the surface
(30 cm), each as long as 48 inches (1.2 m).  These branches follow
oblique courses before turning down to parallel the main root.  Smaller
laterals come off throughout the length of the taproot; secondary
branches are scarce.

Scarlet globemallow is found in dry areas and is very drought and
grazing tolerant; it loses its leaves during times of drought [<a href="#21">21</a>]
and may actually increase in size in times of drought and overgrazing
[<a href="#17">17</a>].

Scarlet globemallow will produce seed prolifically only when moisture is
available; poor seed germination occurs due to a hard seed coat [<a href="#17">17</a>].
Scarlet globemallow reproduces mainly vegetatively by rhizomes [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Scarlet globemallow has a tendency to reproduce by rhizomes [<a href="#17">17</a>] and is a
natural colonizer of disturbed sites [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  While it is debatable
whether scarlet globemallow will invade mine spoils [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>], it does
increase in abundance when the range is disced or burned, perhaps due to
a reduction in competition from other plants [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Scarlet
globemallow is suppressed as disturbed communities mature, although it
is not eliminated [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Prolific seed production can occur if moisture is available, however a
hard seed coat prevents prolific seed germination [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Roth, Holechek,
and Hussain [<a href="#30">30</a>] applied mechanical and chemical treatments to scarlet
globemallow seeds to determine if germination might improve.  Seed
scarification by soaking in sulfuric acid allowed a higher than normal
germination rate, as did soaking in dioxane, an organic material.
Mechanical treatments (i.e., carpel removal and scarification of seed
coat) improved germination, but embryos died withing one week.  Since
dioxane is carcinogenic and highly flammable, sulfuric acid is
recommended to potentially increase the germination rate of native
globemallow species.

Applications of fertilizers seem to have little effect on scarlet
globemallow production [<a href="#9">9</a>], except in certain local range conditions
[<a href="#15">15</a>].  However, fertilizing globemallow may improve rangeland by reducing
the exploitation of other plants by livestock [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Scarlet globemallow grows mainly in dry grassland prairies at elevations
of 3,500 to 9,000 feet (1,067-2,473 m) [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Precipitation in the
central and northwestern grassland areas averages 10 to 40 inches
(26-100 cm) falling mostly in summer; temperatures vary from -20
degrees Fahrenheit in winter to 85 degrees Fahrenheit in summer (-29 -
32 degrees C) [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Scarlet globemallow growth in specific soils are rated as follows [<a href="#7">7</a>]:

Scarlet globemallow was most commonly found in sandy loam and loam in a
study in Colorado [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Scarlet globemallow is considered a pioneer on disturbed sites and is
present in early seral stages [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  This species will aggressively
invade an open area, but will not aggressively compete with established
plants, especially grasses.  After infiltrating newly disturbed areas,
scarlet globemallow is somewhat suppressed by competing species as the
community matures, although it maintains a constant presence in the
community; scarlet globemallow will release again if a second
disturbance occurs [<a href="#17">17</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Scarlet globemallow is able to survive fires since the bulk of the plant
is situated underground [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Rhizomes will send new shoots up soon
after fire and other disturbances [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Scarlet globemallow is a colonizing
species; it invades disturbed areas readily and proliferates until
grasses begin to outcompete it [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
The aerial portions of scarlet globemallow are killed by fire, but
extensive rhizomes allow it to resprout immediately (same season)
following a fire [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Scarlet globemallow is thought to increase in
abundance and vigor after fire [<a href="#17">17</a>].

<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Dix [<a href="#8">8</a>] compared the frequency of scarlet globemallow on a burned North
Dakota grassland site and adjacent unburned sites:
