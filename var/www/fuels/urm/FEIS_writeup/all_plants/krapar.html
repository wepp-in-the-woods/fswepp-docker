<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of range ratany is Krameria
parvifolia Benth. [<a href="#22">22</a>].

There are two recognized varieties:  Krameria parvifolia var. glandulosa
(Rose & Painter) J.F. Macbr. and K. p. var. imparata J.F. Macbr.
Variety glandulosa is differentiated from var. imparata by its stipitate
glands on the pedicels [<a href="#22">22</a>]

Various authors have included the genus Krameria in the families
Leguminosae, Polygalaceae, and Krameriaceae [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Dhillon [<a href="#10">10</a>]
concluded that, based on the vascular anatomy of the flower, range
ratany belongs in the family Polygalaceae.

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Range ratany is an important forage species for all classes of livestock
and for deer (Odocoileus spp.) [<a href="#6">6</a>].  It also provides cover for small
mammals and reptiles [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

In Arizona range ratany is an important component in the diet of deer.
It comprises approximately 10 percent of white-tailed deer's (O.
virginianus) diet and 23 percent of mule deer's (O. hemionus) diet
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability of range ratany is rated fair to good for cattle and sheep
[<a href="#16">16</a>].  Mule and white-tailed deer browse range ratany year-long with
seasonal peaks.  Mule deer peak use is from February to April and from
August to October, and white-tailed deer peak use is from August to
October [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>].
 
The relish and degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife species for
range ratany in several western states is rated as follows
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>]:

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Krausman and others [<a href="#18">18</a>] reported the bimonthly nutritional value
(percent composition) of range ratany as follows:

           Dry                         Cell                  Hemi-

The in-vitro digestibility of range ratany varies with the species of
deer.  Mule deer are able to utilize 40 percent of it while white-tailed
deer only utilize 31 percent [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Range ratany provides thermal cover for rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.) and
the western whiptail (Cnemidophorus tigris) [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Small mammals, such
as the Bailey's pocket mouse (Perognathus baileyi), use range ratany for
hiding cover [<a href="#26">26</a>].  For large mammals it provides poor to fair hiding
cover.


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The Papago Indians used an infusion of the twigs externally for treating
sore eyes and internally for dysentery.  The roots provided them with a
red dye for wool and other materials.  The dye was also used as an ink
[<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Range ratany decreases in response to heavy grazing [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Judd [<a href="#16">16</a>]
suggests that 25 to 50 percent of the current year's growth be used on a
well-grazed range.  Beyond 50 percent range ratany is receiving too much
grazing pressure.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Krameria parvifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Range ratany is a native, long-lived, deciduous, perennial shrub that
grows from 12 to 24 inches (30-60 cm) tall.  It is densely branched,
thorny, and drought resistant.  The leaves are alternate and pubesent;
flowers are irregular and purple in color; and the fruit is globose,
indehiscent, thick walled, and spiny [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].

The root system is shallow, with 40 percent of the root mass in the top
4 inches (10 cm) of the soil, and spreads horizontally and radially
[<a href="#36">36</a>].  The roots form grafts with members of the same or different
species forming protocooperation or a parasitic relationship.  These
relationships and the hypothesis that range ratany obtains atmospheric
moisture through its foliage may explain how it can maintain active
growth after soil moisture has dropped below 3 percent [<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (nanophanerophyte)
   Burned or Clipped State:  Cryptophyte (geophyte)


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Range ratany reproduces sexually by seed.  In years with high soil
moisture it will flower twice, in the spring and again in the fall
[<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Range ratany's habitat is the desert environs, where it occupies open,
sandy to rocky flats, bajadas, and playas [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].

Soil:  Range ratany occurs in Alfisol, Aridisol, and Entisol soil orders
[<a href="#12">12</a>].

Climate:  Range ratany inhabits areas where the winters are short and
mild, and the summers are long and hot.  Precipitation is received
primarily in the fall and winter in the northern portion of its range
and in the summer in the southern portion.  The annual precipitation is
8 to 25 inches (20-65 cm) [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].

Elevation:  Range ratany generally grows at elevations ranging from 500
to 5,000 feet (150-1,500 m) [<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Range ratany is a component of some climax desert shrub communities
[<a href="#37">37</a>].  It is a dominant in the shrub live oak-mixed shrub and shrub live
oak-birchleaf mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus betuloides) plant
associations [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Compared to associated species, range ratany remains dormant for at
least a month longer in the spring and retains its leaves for up to 2
months longer in the fall [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

The mean dates and one standard deviation [(SD) in days] of the
phenological developement of range ratany are as follows [<a href="#27">27</a>]:

Development                     Date                    SD
---------------------------------------------------------------
Leaf budding                    April 7                 +/- 4.5
flowering                       May 5                   +/- 4.6
Fruiting                        May 22                  +/- 4.6

The phenological development of range ratany is based primarily on the
temperature regime and secondarily on the moisture regime [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  It
does not go dormant during the summer no matter how dry the soil.  Range
ratany can photosynthesize when its water potential is at negative 72
bars.  Dormancy starts when night temperatures consistently drop below
40 degrees F (4 deg C) [<a href="#1">1</a>].
