The currently accepted name for field bindweed is <i>Convolvulus arvensis </i>L.
It is a member of the morning-glory family (Convolvulaceae) 
[<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>,<a href="#146">146</a>,<a href="#149">149</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>].

As of this writing (2004), field bindweed is classified as a noxious or 
prohibited weed or weed seed in 35 states in the U.S. and 5 Canadian provinces [<a href="#139">139</a>]. 
See the
<a href="http://invader.dbs.umt.edu/">Invaders</a>,
<a href="http://plants.usda.gov/">Plants</a>, or 
<a href="http://www.aphis.usda.gov/npb/F&SQS/sqs.html">APHIS</a> 
databases for more information. The Eastern Region of the U.S. Forest Service ranks 
field bindweed as a Category 3 plant: often restricted to disturbed ground and not 
especially invasive in undisturbed natural habitats [<a href="#136">136</a>].

Field bindweed is native to Europe and Asia. Field bindweed is successful in many types of 
climates, including temperate, tropical, and mediterranean, but is most 
troublesome for agriculture throughout the temperate zone, from 60<font face="Times New Roman">°</font>N 
to 45<font face="Times New Roman">°</font>S latitude. Fifty-four countries report 
field bindweed as a weed in 32 different  crops [<a href="#66">66</a>].

<p>Field bindweed most likely arrived in the 
U.S. as contaminant in farm and garden seeds. Some 
plants were introduced intentionally and planted ornamentally as ground cover or 
in hanging baskets. It was first noted in Virginia in 1739 and was found all 
along the eastern seaboard, from Virginia to Maine, by the early 1800s. Western 
migration of field bindweed may have been hastened by the building of railroads; however, 
field bindweed seeds 
continued to arrive whenever immigrants settled new areas or whenever crop seed 
was imported. A &quot;bindweed plague&quot; in the Great Plains in 1877 was attributed to Ukrainian settlers who 
inadvertently brought the weed seed in wheat (<i>Triticum</i> spp.) seed during 
the early 1870s. Field bindweed reputedly established in the Pacific Northwest when an 
Oregon settler used it as a cover crop in his orchard. Field bindweed was evidently present 
in California as early as 1838. By the end of the 1st quarter of the 20th 
century, field bindweed was considered the &quot;worst weed&quot; in several states and a &quot;serious 
pest&quot; in several others, especially west of the Mississippi ([<a href="#95">95</a>] and references therein).</p>

<p>The current North American distribution of field bindweed extends from the agricultural 
regions of all provinces in Canada (except Newfoundland and Prince Edward 
Island) southward throughout the United States and into northern Mexico. It is common to abundant 
in the U.S., except in the extreme Southeast and parts of southern Texas, New Mexico, and 
Arizona ([<a href="#144">144</a>] and references therein). Field bindweed is adventitious in Hawaii [<a href="#121">121</a>].
<a href="http://plants.usda.gov/">Plants database</a> 
provides a state distribution map of field bindweed. Field bindweed is 
especially common in cultivated fields and gardens [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#146">146</a>,<a href="#149">149</a>], along roadsides [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#146">146</a>,<a href="#149">149</a>], railroads [<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#146">146</a>], 
&quot;disturbed sites&quot; [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>], and &quot;waste places&quot; [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#146">146</a>]. It is  
reported from ballast heaps in Nova Scotia [<a href="#110">110</a>].</p>

<p>A survey of weed specialists and herbaria in the continental U.S., conducted 
in 1994 and 1995, found that field bindweed occurs at &quot;serious&quot; densities (&gt; 1,000 acres/county) in 957 
counties, &quot;moderate&quot; densities (250-1000 acres/county) in 845 counties; and 
&quot;low&quot; densities 
(&lt; 250 acres/county) in 573 counties, in 47 of the 48 contiguous states. 
Only Florida and the southern parts of states from South Carolina to Texas did 
not report its presence. The authors also report that field bindweed infestations have increased 
in several western states since 1970, but have decreased in importance in most Great Plains states [<a href="#18">18</a>].</p>

<p>The following lists suggest ecosystems and vegetation types in which field 
bindweed may be invasive, especially following disturbance. It is unclear from 
the literature which vegetation types may be susceptible to invasion by field 
bindweed in the absence of disturbance. These lists were derived from known or perceived 
ecological tolerances of field bindweed, are largely speculative, and may not be 
exhaustive.</p>

Field bindweed is invasive primarily in agricultural areas, although some 
authors indicate that it is also invasive in natural areas (e.g. [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>]). Natural area managers are most 
likely to find it in moist locations (e.g. riparian corridors and irrigated 
areas) on tracts once used for agriculture [<a href="#86">86</a>]. Field bindweed is normally found in 
open communities in association with annual, biennial, and short-lived perennial 
weeds [<a href="#144">144</a>]. Habitats that are most like agricultural 
lands (little competition, repeated disturbance, and high light intensity) are ideal for 
growth of field bindweed (Cox (1915) as cited by [<a href="#86">86</a>]). 
<p><b>California</b>: Field bindweed establishes locally in vernal pools in 
Sacramento County, and in large pools in Tehama County. These habitats  support populations of endangered hairy Orcutt 
grass (<i>Orcuttia pilosa</i>) and Hoover's spurge (<i>Chamaesyce hooveri</i>), 
and also support thriving field bindweed and cocklebur (<i>Xanthium strumarium</i> var. <i>canadense</i>) populations. Field bindweed occurs in open 
annual grassland and oak savannah sites. Dominant natives include blue oak (<i>Quercus douglasii</i>) and chamise (<i>Adenostoma 
fasciculatum</i>). Grassland natives include purple needlegrass (<i>Nassella pulchra</i>), 
Sandberg bluegrass (<i>Poa secunda</i>), 
California melic grass (<i>Melica californica</i>), small fescue (<i>Vulpia microstachys</i>), 
and many native forbs [<a href="#68">68</a>]. At Sugarloaf Ridge 
State Park, field bindweed is occasional in disturbed 
places such as campgrounds and horse corrals [<a href="#19">19</a>].

<p>In <b>Nevada</b>, field bindweed occurs on disturbed, moist soil of cultivated fields, near springs, roadsides, and 
homesteads with pinyon (<i>Pinus</i> spp.), juniper (<i>Juniperus</i> spp.), and 
saltbush (<i>Atriplex</i> spp.) [<a href="#71">71</a>]. </p>

<p>At the Thousand Springs Preserve, <b>Idaho</b>, field bindweed thrives under 
cultivated and irrigated conditions, and managers there suggest that field 
bindweed outcompetes native grasses [<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>]. At Garden Creek Preserve in northern Idaho, managers report that 
field bindweed threatens bunchgrass and forb-dominated habitats [<a href="#86">86</a>].</p>

<b>Wyoming</b>: Olson and Gerhart [<a href="#100">100</a>] describe a field 
bindweed vegetation type in a Wyoming riparian area with an overstory dominated by quaking aspen (<i>Populus 
tremuloides</i>), and blue spruce (<i>Picea pungens</i>), and shrub layer 
dominated by russet buffaloberry (<i>Shepherdia canadensis</i>) and willow (<i>Salix</i> 
spp.), with rose (<i>Rosa</i> spp.), shrubby cinquefoil (<i>Dasiphora floribunda</i>), 
and bog birch (<i>Betula glandulosa</i>) also present. They describe 2 other habitat types 
with herbaceous plant communities dominated by field bindweed, bluegrass (<i>Poa</i> spp.), 
western wheatgrass (<i>Pascopyrum smithii</i>), and an unknown annual forb, with 
coniferous overstories dominated by blue spruce, lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus 
contorta</i>), and white fir (<i>Abies concolor</i>). </p>
<p>In <b>Colorado</b>, field bindweed has been identified in &quot;seemingly remote, undisturbed 
aspen stands&quot; in Rocky Mountain National Park [<a href="#28">28</a>]. At the Phantom 
Canyon Preserve, field bindweed is most problematic in 
riparian corridors and mountain-mahogany (<i>Cercocarpus</i> spp.) shrubland/grassland [<a href="#86">86</a>].</p>
<p><b>Midwest</b>: Field bindweed occurs with purple loosestrife (<i>Lythrum salicaria</i>) in wetland sites in the 
Midwest [<a href="#132">132</a>]. It occurs in Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota [<a href="#26">26</a>], and occurs in the understory in 
eastern cottonwood (<i>Populus deltoides</i>) stands along the Missouri River in southeastern South Dakota [<a href="#150">150</a>]. 
Field bindweed had relatively high (compared with other regulated noxious weeds) 
frequency and canopy cover on study areas in the glaciated prairie pothole 
region of the Northern Great Plains [<a href="#61">61</a>].</p>
<p><b>Canada</b>: Field bindweed is a dominant species in some disturbed riverbank areas in the Montr<font face="Times New Roman">é</font>al 
area of Qu<font face="Times New Roman">é</font>bec. Codominant species include 
common wormwood (<i>Artemisia vulgaris</i>), common dandelion (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i>), and 
bird vetch (<i>Vicia cracca</i>) [<a href="#97">97</a>].

The following description of field bindweed is based on descriptions found in several florae 
[<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>]. It provides 
characteristics that may be relevant to fire ecology, and is not meant for 
identification. Keys for identification are available (e.g. [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#146">146</a>,<a href="#149">149</a>]). Proper identification is 
important if control strategies are planned, as 
field bindweed may closely resemble some native morning-glories.<p>
Field bindweed is a perennial vine arising from deep, persistent, spreading roots. It has slender, trailing to 
somewhat twining, branched 
stems, 8 to 79 inches (20-200 cm) long, sometimes forming tangled mats. Herbage is glabrous to 
pubescent and leaves are variable, 0.4 to 4 inches (1-10 cm) long and 0.1 to 2.4 
inches (0.3-6 cm) wide, with 
petioles 5-40 mm long. Peduncles arise from leaf axils, range from 0.2 to 2.4 
inches (0.5-6 cm) 
long, and bear 1 to several flowers. Corollas are broadly funnelform, 0.6 to 1.2 
inches (1.5-3 cm) 
long and 0.9 to 1.4 inches (2.2-3.5 cm) broad. Fruit is a capsule, 5-10 mm long, bearing 1 to 4 
seeds, each about 3-4 mm long. Kennedy and Crafts [<a href="#74">74</a>] provide a detailed description 
of the anatomy of field bindweed.

<p>Several authors describe variations in botanical characteristics of field 
bindweed. A review by Weaver and Riley [<a href="#144">144</a>] indicates the leaves of field 
bindweed vary greatly in size and shape with environmental factors such as light intensity, 
soil moisture, and damage due to frequent cultivation or defoliation. Degennaro 
and Weller [<a href="#35">35</a>] identified and characterized 5 biotypes among field bindweed 
clones collected from a field in Indiana. Consistent variations in leaf 
morphology, floral characteristics, flowering capacity, phenology, vegetative 
reproduction potential, and accumulation of shoot and root biomass were found 
between biotypes when grown in a controlled environment. Pollination studies 
showed that presumed biotypes were self-incompatible. The variability in growth 
and reproduction observed in field bindweed biotypes may explain the survival 
and adaptability of a field bindweed population as environmental conditions and 
control practices change.</p>

<p>Several researchers have described the anatomy and development of field 
bindweed roots (e.g. [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>]). The root system is characterized by a taproot with large numbers of 
annual lateral roots that develop adventitiously throughout its length, and penetrate 
the soil in all directions 
(see <a href="#Seedling establishment/growth:">Seedling establishment/growth</a> for more detail). 
Some laterals are ephemeral and some are persistent. It is by 
these lateral roots that plants spread horizontally. Shoot buds arise on these 
horizontal laterals and develop into rhizomes which, reaching the surface, 
establish new crowns [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>]. The ability to 
produce buds, together with the root food reserves, favors vegetative 
reproduction and makes field bindweed plants persistent [<a href="#74">74</a>] 
(see <a href="#Asexual regeneration:">Asexual regeneration</a> for more detail).</p>

<p>Field bindweed taproots may be 2 to 10 feet (0.5-3 m) or more long. Other 
vertical roots may penetrate to depths of 17 to 30 feet (5-9 m) [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>], 
depending on climate and soil type. Lateral roots are found primarily in the top 
12 inches (30 cm) of soil, and most commonly in the upper 4 to 6 inches 
[<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>]. In field bindweed plants grown from root cuttings in a sandy loam 
soil in Oxford, England 70% of lateral root spread was in the top 3 to 6 inches 
(7.5-15 cm) of soil, and none was below 12 inches (30 cm) [<a href="#34">34</a>]. Similarly, Swan 
[<a href="#128">128</a>] notes that the lateral roots are generally found within the top 12 inches 
(30 cm) of soil, but approximately 1 third of the total root system is in the vertical roots 
below the 24 inch (60 cm) zone. Estimates of the amount of root by weight in the upper 
24 inches (60 cm) of soil range 
from 50% to 70% [<a href="#133">133</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>]. The concentration of food 
reserves increases with root depth, and maximum percentages of reserves were 
found in roots 6 to 8 feet (2-2.4 m) deep [<a href="#10">10</a>].</p>

<p>Field bindweed from an old-field site in Ontario was among the few plant 
species observed in the laboratory that were not infected with native arbuscular 
mycorrhizal fungi [<a href="#76">76</a>]. Field bindweed plants growing on disturbed sites in Utah were infected 
with vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae [<a href="#102">102</a>].</p>

<p>Root exudations may decrease the germination of some crop seed (Grummer 1957, as cited by [<a href="#128">128</a>]).</p>

Field bindweed reproduces both sexually and vegetatively.

<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Breeding system:</font></b> 
Field bindweed is self-incompatible [<a href="#98">98</a>] and thus an 
obligate out-crosser, which may play an important role in maintaining the high 
degree of phenotypic variation observed in this species.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Pollination:</b></font> 
Field bindweed flowers persist only 1 day and are insect pollinated [<a href="#144">144</a>]. Observations in 
Kansas determined that field bindweed flowers were fully open by 8 am during 
late June and early July. Nectar, produced at the base of the tube of fused 
petals, attracted various pollinators including Halictid bees, honeybees, bumblebees, 
butterflies, and moths. Halictid foraging was highest from 8:30 to 11:30 am. The 
flowers wilted by early afternoon [<a href="#142">142</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Seed production:</font></b> 
Seed production by field bindweed is variable and dependent upon environmental conditions. There is  little 
information on the amount and relative reproductive importance of seeds produced by 
field bindweed. Literature reviews and observations over 3 years in Iowa [<a href="#22">22</a>] indicate that seed set 
in field bindweed is favored in seasons of high temperature and low rainfall, especially on 
calcareous soils. Periods of cloudy weather and fine-textured, poorly drained 
soils restrict blossoming and seed production. Individual flowers may fail to 
set seed or to mature seed that has been set, and capsules that appear normal 
frequently contain no viable seed. Under favorable conditions the number of 
seeds per capsule varies from 1 to 4 with an average of 2; however, 10 
seeds per capsule have been reported from Russian material. Seed is often not produced by plants in frequently 
cultivated soils. In one count, 157 capsules collected from plants in cultivated 
fields yielded 41 seeds. Few estimates of seed production per plant are 
available, as the spatial limit of an individual plant is often difficult to 
determine due to the extensive root system. Estimates of 12 to 300 seeds per 
plant are reported, and estimates of number of seeds produced per unit area in a 
pure field bindweed stand range from 50,000 to 20 million seeds per hectare, though it is 
unclear under what conditions these estimates were made [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>].</p>

<p>According to a review by Weaver and Riley [<a href="#144">144</a>], field bindweed seldom sets 
seed during the 1st year of growth, although plants grown in the greenhouse will 
flower within 6 weeks of emergence based on unpublished data of the author. 
According to Brown and Porter [<a href="#22">22</a>], germinability of field bindweed seeds began 
10 to 15 days after pollination, when moisture content was 81%. Sripleng and Smith [<a href="#120">120</a>] provide a 
detailed description of the anatomy and development of field bindweed seed, 
and their observations suggest that field bindweed seeds mature about 25 days after 
fertilization.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seed dispersal:</b></font> 
Field bindweed seeds generally fall near the parent plant but can be dispersed by water [<a href="#22">22</a>], as contaminants in crop seed [<a href="#66">66</a>], 
by animals after ingestion [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>], by animals' feet,  and by vehicles or machinery. Long-distance dispersal by birds is 
possible because seeds of field bindweed can remain viable in the digestive tracts of  some birds for up to 144 hours [<a href="#104">104</a>].</p> 

<p>Harmon and Keim [<a href="#57">57</a>] tested the viability of weed seeds recovered in the 
feces of several domestic animals. Field bindweed had the highest percentage 
recovery and germination of all weed seeds tested, resulting in an average of 
11.7% viable seeds recovered from all animals. Percent germination of field 
bindweed seeds before feeding and without acid scarification, after a 2-week 
germination period, was 9.3%; and with acid scarification, after a 4-week 
germination period was 84%. Some data are as follows:</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seed banking:</b></font> 
Field bindweed produces impermeable seed, giving it a physical exogenous dormancy which may or may not 
be combined with other dormancy mechanisms [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>]. A review by Rolston [<a href="#111">111</a>] indicates that seed longevity is often, 
but not always, associated with impermeable seed, so that impermeable seeds are 
distributed in time as well as space. Rolston describes in detail 
the anatomy of the seed coat of field bindweed seed and other seeds with impermeable seed 
coats. Seed impermeability varies with time and place of collection [<a href="#22">22</a>] as a result of differences in relative 
humidity, temperature, light, soil fertility, and genetic factors [<a href="#111">111</a>].</p>

<p>Many impermeable seeds survive ingestion, allowing dispersal by animals and 
birds (see Seed dispersal above). Under natural conditions increments of a seed 
population become permeable to water and germinate in successive intervals [<a href="#111">111</a>]. Permeability in field 
bindweed seeds is increased by various laboratory treatments, 
including storage at both high 104 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>F (40
<font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) and low 33 <font face="Times New Roman">
°</font>F (0.5 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) temperatures, soaking in 
concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> for 45 to 60 minutes, immersion in hot 
water at temperatures ranging from 126 to 212 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>F 
(52-100 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C), soaking in ethyl alcohol, and 
mechanical scarification [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>]. Rolston [<a href="#111">111</a>] speculates that in the 
field, field bindweed's seed coat may be broken down or punctured by mechanical abrasion, 
especially during cultivation, by passage through the digestive tract of 
mammals and birds, by high temperatures or temperature fluctuations, by fire, 
and possibly by microbial degradation. However, results presented 
by Leishman and others [<a href="#85">85</a>] suggest that fungi do not play a 
major role in field bindweed seed degradation. Other data indicate that as much as 48% of 
impermeable field bindweed seeds may become permeable in 1 winter if the seeds are 
not more than 3 inches (8 cm) deep in the soil. Impermeable seeds of field bindweed retained a 
considerable degree of viability and impermeability for 4 years after burial  at 6 and 18 inches 
(15-46 cm) [<a href="#22">22</a>].</p>

<p>It is generally accepted that field bindweed seeds remain viable in the soil seed bank 
for many years, with estimates ranging from 20 to 50 years [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>]. Timmons [<a href="#133">133</a>] wrote in
1949 &quot;the ability of seed of field bindweed, 
to remain dormant in cultivated soil for a considerable time and eventually 
germinate is quite generally known.&quot; Brown and Porter [<a href="#22">22</a>] found that as much as 62% of 50-year-old 
field bindweed seeds stored and tested in the laboratory were viable, with 8% germinable, 54% 
impermeable, and 38% dead. Timmons [<a href="#133">133</a>] observed field bindweed seedlings emerging 
in a field from which field bindweed plants had been eradicated 20 years earlier, 
and suggested that the seed had survived in the seed bank for those 20 years. 
However, it is not clear whether there may have been seed or root fragments 
imported from off-site. Timmons also observed 
seedling emergence and adult plant establishment under different cropping 
systems, and he concluded that completely ridding infested 
land of field bindweed may require 30 years or more of persistent attention to a rigid 
program of field management until all dormant seeds have been germinated and 
destroyed [<a href="#133">133</a>]. Research is needed to better understand field 
bindweed seed longevity under various field conditions, especially in natural areas.</p>

<p>Field bindweed was among many plants that emerged from soil samples taken from a 
blue grama-needle-and-thread grass-western wheatgrass (<i>Bouteloua gracilis</i>-<i>Hesperostipa 
comata</i>-<i>Pascopyrum smithii</i>) mixed grass community 
in eastern Montana and incubated to determine seed bank composition. It was not 
reported whether adult field bindweed plants were present on the site [<a href="#63">63</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Germination:</font></b> 
Differences in percent germination, impermeability, and viability have been noted for seed lots 
of field bindweed collected in different years and from different sites. The mean percentage of germinable 
seeds produced by field bindweed plants varies from 5% to 25%, of impermeable seeds from 60% to 80%, 
and of viable seeds from 87% to 99% [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>]. Germination of impermeable seeds can be 
promoted by chemical or mechanical scarification. Seeds of field bindweed that have been scarified will 
germinate over a wide range of temperatures (41 to 104
<font face="Times New Roman">°F </font>(5-40 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C)) with maximum and most rapid 
germination at alternating temperatures of 95/68 <font face="Times New Roman">°F 
(</font>35/20 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) [<a href="#22">22</a>]. 
Exposure to light does not much improve germination of freshly 
harvested seeds (Weaver, unpublished data cited in [<a href="#144">144</a>]). According 
to Brown and Porter [<a href="#22">22</a>], exposure to both high (104
<font face="Times New Roman">°F </font>(40 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C)) and 
low (33 <font face="Times New Roman">°F </font>(0.5 <font face="Times New Roman">
°</font>C)) temperatures promotes germination in field bindweed. 
Similarly, Jordan and Jordan [<a href="#69">69</a>] ran tests in which field 
bindweed seeds were prechilled in the dark at 41<font face="Times New Roman">°</font>F (5
<font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) for 21 to 42 days and then 
moistened and germinated at 84 <font face="Times New Roman">°F (</font>29
<font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) at 96% relative humidity, in darkness. 
Percentage seed germination increased as the prechilling time increased. The 
increase in germination was accompanied by morphological changes in the seed 
coat, as observed with scanning electron microscopy [<a href="#69">69</a>]. 
Conversely, viability of field bindweed seed was not reduced, nor was permeability 
increased, after 50 days in loosely stacked, composting chicken manure where 
temperatures reached approximately 149 to 158 <font face="Times New Roman">°F</font> 
(65-70 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C). Viability and permeability were 
also unchanged after 4 months in moistened, compacted chicken manure, where 
temperatures reached about 113 <font face="Times New Roman">°F </font>(45
<font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) [<a href="#125">125</a>].</p> 

<p>Over 5 years of dry storage in the laboratory at room temperature, the 
percentage of germinable seeds did not vary greatly, although the average 
percentage of dead seeds increased from 8% to 47% as the percentage of impermeable 
seeds decreased from 87% to 38% during the 5 years. The percentage of total live 
seed decreased from 87% to 49%. Germination rate averaged 31.8% in field 
bindweed seeds that had overwintered in the 
soil at 3 inches (8 cm) depth, an increase of 17.8% over average germination 
rate (14%) in a laboratory test. Seeds buried 4 to 6 inches (10-15 cm) deep had 
germination rates that ranged from 0.4% to 6.8%.  Oxygen 
concentrations below 10.5% and above 53% are unfavorable, and concentrations 
between 21% and 53% are favorable for field bindweed seed germination. Impermeable seeds of 
field bindweed were not affected by changes in the amount of oxygen [<a href="#22">22</a>]. Germination of field bindweed seeds 
was low (mostly between 0.2% and 9%) before, during, 
and after both dry storage and storage in water (up to 22 months) [<a href="#23">23</a>]. In a 2nd, similar study, the 
percentage germination of field bindweed 
seed appeared to increase with the length of time in water storage [<a href="#24">24</a>].</p> 

<p>Field bindweed germinated and 
established better on bare ground than on sites with litter on rangeland in

The ability of field bindweed to establish from seed 
may be underestimated. Seeds are 
usually responsible for the introduction of field bindweed to a new area, and 
lateral roots and rhizomes play the primary role in spreading an infestation 
locally [<a href="#144">144</a>].</p>

<p>By 6 weeks after emergence a field bindweed taproot may reach a depth of 18 to 24 inches 
(45-62 cm) and have 3 to 6 
lateral roots, usually within 12 inches (30 cm) of the soil surface&nbsp;(Riley, unpublished 
data as cited by [<a href="#144">144</a>]). Seeds of field bindweed, scarified 
and planted in Iowa at 2-week intervals from 
25 April to 26 September, germinated and produced seedlings at each planting. Emergence was greatest in the spring (60-75%) and late 
summer (43-57%) and least in midsummer (1-10%). Roots of field bindweed seedlings emerging in the spring 
and early summer  penetrated to depths of 51 to 67 inches (1.3-1.7 m) by November, whereas 
seedlings produced in August and September had a maximum root penetration of 
10 to 20 inches (25-50 cm) [<a href="#22">22</a>].</p>

<p>In Saskatchewan, Best [<a href="#16">16</a>] found that 25 shoots 
had emerged from a 2 inch (5 cm) root fragment 4 months after planting. The 
nearest shoot was 18 inches (46 cm) from the parent plant and the furthest 52 inches 
(132 cm). After 15 months a shoot was observed 114 inches (290 cm) from the 
parent plant.</p>

<p>Frazier [<a href="#47">47</a>] describes, in detail, the growth of a field bindweed plant growing 
in a deep silt loam soil in Kansas, under known climatic conditions, with little 
or no competition (none from other plant species). The taproot rapidly 
penetrated directly down from the germinating seed. Many branch roots arose 
throughout the length of the taproot, a few of which grew extensively and became  permanent lateral roots. 
Permanent lateral roots tended to radiate away from the point of origin, thus 
together occupying an area somewhat circular in shape. All shoot development was 
derived from root-borne stem buds that developed on any part of the permanent 
root system. Regardless of where these root-borne buds formed, if they developed 
underground they gave rise to rhizomes. If the buds were borne at or above the soil 
surface they gave rise to leafy shoots. By 120 weeks after emergence, practically all the vertical roots observed 
penetrated the 34- to 39-inch (86-99 cm) layer. No soil layer was found in this 
study that impeded vertical penetration of the roots [<a href="#47">47</a>]. Other descriptions of field 
bindweed growth and development are available from England [<a href="#34">34</a>] and Nebraska [<a href="#75">75</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b><a name="Asexual regeneration:">Asexual regeneration:</a></b></font> 
Field bindweed reproduces vegetatively by means of endogenous root buds that develop 
into rhizomes and establish new shoots upon reaching the soil surface. Root buds 
at or above the soil surface develop into shoots [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>]. Roots develop on rhizomes, allowing  daughter plants to survive 
if severed from the parent plant [<a href="#74">74</a>]. New field bindweed plants may also 
develop from root fragments [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>]</p>

<p>In cultivated fields and in old, well-established areas of bindweed, field 
bindweed's creeping roots are often inconspicuous. Because of their slenderness and their 
proximity to the surface, they are easily destroyed by cultivating tools and by 
heavy freezing. New growth after  cultivation is made from the vertical root 
immediately below the point of injury [<a href="#75">75</a>]. Whenever the taproot has 
become broken or cut, as in deep cultivation or plowing, the rhizomes 
connect it to the growing shoots. Field bindweed rhizomes vary in 
length from a few inches to several feet. Roots severed at various depths below 
the soil surface often develop rhizomes several feet 
in length. In many instances, old roots that have been cut off successively for 
several years may produce a thousand or more slender rhizomes from the severed 
end and give rise to a peculiar and striking bunchy form of leafy growth above 
ground. In localities where there is a high water table, the taproot may branch 
at a depth of 2 feet (0.6 m) or less, while in other localities, it may penetrate to a 
depth of 10 feet (3 m) or more before branching profusely [<a href="#74">74</a>]. 
Seedlings grown in the greenhouse were  regenerated from the root when 
the aboveground portion was removed 19 days after emergence (Weaver, unpublished 
data as cited by [<a href="#144">144</a>]).</p>

<p>Sherwood [<a href="#117">117</a>] conducted experiments to determine if new field 
bindweed infestations could be initiated by root fragments. The larger the diameter 
and/or length of the root section, the more likely it is to grow. Fragments less 
than 3 inches in length were weak or failed to grow, and fragments obtained from 
below the plow depth were more likely to grow than those taken from shallower 
depths. Fragments from starved roots with low root reserves (i.e. roots 
from plants whose top growth was prevented for a growing season) had poor 
growth. Root fragments from previously disturbed plants are less 
likely to grow than are those from undisturbed plants [<a href="#117">117</a>]. Results presented by Swan and Chancellor [<a href="#130">130</a>] suggest 
that regeneration of field bindweed from root fragments varies by season, and is highest in 
spring and lowest in late summer. Interpretation of results presented by Swan and Chancellor suggest that 
regeneration is primarily from fragments of vertical roots and rhizomes (more so than 
horizontal root fragments) [<a href="#78">78</a>].</p>

Field bindweed is primarily an agricultural weed, and occurs in cultivated 
fields and other disturbed sites such as pastures, gardens, lawns, and along 
roadsides and railways. Natural area managers are most likely to find it in 
moist locations (e.g. riparian corridors and irrigated areas) on tracts once 
used for agriculture [<a href="#86">86</a>].

<p>Field bindweed was among several nonnative 
plant species identified in a tallgrass prairie study in Kansas, where 
nonnative species were most common at the town site and along human and 
livestock travel corridors. A gradient was observed with a high abundance of 
nonnative species in town to low abundance in prairie sites, with the 
distribution of native plants forming a reverse gradient. Sources of nonnative plant introduction were related 
to early cattle trails through the community, railroad and stockyard locations, 
gardens, cultivated fields, livestock and wildlife activity. Nonnative plants 
occurred on truck trails 
into the upland prairie but had not yet invaded the surrounding grassland [<a href="#40">40</a>]. On study sites on open annual grassland and 
blue oak savannah in California, field bindweed was found on both 
<a href="../../../glossary.html#SERPENTINE SOILS:">serpentine</a>
and nonserpentine soil types. 
It was most frequent near roads on nonserpentine soils and its frequency of occurrence decreased with 
increasing distance from the road. This pattern was not observed on serpentine 
soils [<a href="#68">68</a>].</p>

<p>Field bindweed is found in dry or moderately moist soils and can survive long periods of 
drought due to its extensive root system. It grows best on rich, fertile soils but persists on poor, gravelly soils as 
well [<a href="#66">66</a>]. In Quebec, field bindweed is found primarily on sandy 
soils in warm, dry areas (Rousseau 1968 as cited by [<a href="#144">144</a>]). In northern California and the Great 
Plains, field bindweed persists into autumn under severely dry conditions when most other 
plants are unable to sustain growth. Strong sunlight and moderate-to-low moisture 
appear to be optimal conditions for field bindweed growth and reproduction [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>].</p>

<p>Field bindweed appears to be somewhat cold tolerant. Plants extracted from frozen ground in 
Michigan had roots that appeared to be severely injured or dead in the uppermost 
layers of soil. However, a laboratory test indicated that about 30% of field 
bindweed roots survived 21 <font face="Times New Roman">°F </font>(-6 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) 
for 8 hours, but were unable to survive 
18 <font face="Times New Roman">°F </font>(-8 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) 
for any time period tested [<a href="#36">36</a>].</p>
<p>Elevation range: Field bindweed has reportedly been found in 
the Himalayas at altitudes of 10,000 feet (3,000 m) ([<a href="#95">95</a>] and references therein). 
Field bindweed is found in several plant communities in riparian corridors in Wyoming, at 
7,000 to 7,500 feet (2,100-2,300 m). Elevation ranges are given by area as follows:</p>

<br />

Field bindweed tends to be an early successional species, as it establishes well on bare 
ground under open conditions. Disturbed sites are common habitat for field 
bindweed 
throughout its range (e.g. [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#146">146</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>]). On a site in 
western Nevada, field bindweed germinated and established better on microsites with bare 
ground than on microsites with litter, and occupied 
early successional stages (mostly grazing disturbance) in 
some rangeland plant communities [<a href="#42">42</a>].

<p>It is unclear how long field bindweed plants may persist in native plant communities.
Field bindweed plants were still present in an abandoned farm field 30 years after it was 
last farmed in tallgrass mixed hardwood forest in Minnesota [<a href="#59">59</a>].</p>

<p>A review by Holm and others [<a href="#66">66</a>] suggests 
that competition for sunlight places field bindweed at a disadvantage, and that, if adequate soil moisture is present, 
several crop plants will force 
it into abnormal growth and dormancy by shading. When crop plants are removed, 
field bindweed resumes active growth [<a href="#66">66</a>]. Similarly, on a site in western 
Nevada, scattered plants of field bindweed were observed growing intermixed with, but suppressed by a 
medusahead (<i>Taeniatherum caput-medusae</i>) population. When medusahead was reduced by a variety of methods 
(herbicide, disk-harrow, furrow),  medusahead reduction was 
followed by  heavy infestations of field bindweed [<a href="#155">155</a>].</p>

<p>Bakke (1939, as cited by [<a href="#9">9</a>]) reports that shaded 
field bindweed plants lose their prostrate habit and become twining plants. In general, the 
lower the light intensity reaching field bindweed plants, the more rapid the elimination of 
above- and belowground parts and the more reduction of available root 
carbohydrates [<a href="#9">9</a>]. Dall'Armellina and Zimdahl [<a href="#32">32</a>] found that flower production, leaf area, and dry matter of shoots, 
roots, and rhizomes 
of field bindweed grown from seed declined as light level decreased. The only response 
to reduced light levels of plants grown from rhizome segments was complete inhibition of rhizome 
production [<a href="#32">32</a>]. A study by Mashhadi 
and others [<a href="#89">89</a>]&nbsp;characterized the photosynthetic rate of 
field bindweed under varied 
light levels, measured as photosynthetic photon flux 
(PPF). Field bindweed showed a linear response to PPF levels. Photosynthesis and transpiration both decreased at the 
same rate in response to 
decreasing PPF. There was a small amount of transpiration  in darkness. The 
authors also noted that field bindweed 
growing under a dense juniper canopy had mostly abscised or chlorotic lower 
leaves and long internodes on stems far from sunlight. They speculated that 
field bindweed plants were able to establish in this low light environment 
either because the leaves had adapted to low light and/or root reserves were 
used to support the initial growth stages.</p>

<p>The competitive ability of field bindweed is due largely to its extensive root system. One 
plant is able to reduce the available soil moisture in the top 24 inches (60 cm) of soil 
below the &quot;wilting point&quot; (Wiese, unpublished data in [<a href="#144">144</a>]). Bakke [<a href="#8">8</a>] characterized the competitive 
interaction between corn and field bindweed in Iowa, 
noting that field bindweed is a superior competitor for water under conditions of low soil 
moisture, and that corn plants growing with field bindweed were smaller and had lower 
yields. How the competitive ability of field bindweed might affect successional trajectories 
native plant communities is unknown.</p>

<a name="SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT">
SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Seeds of field bindweed germinate throughout the growing season when adequate moisture 
is available, and a germination peak usually occurs in late spring or early summer. 
In southern Ontario, seedlings usually emerge in early May and quickly develop a 
taproot followed by lateral roots and numerous thin feeding roots.
Rapid growth of rhizomes and shoots begins when day temperatures are near 57 °F (14 °C) and night 
temperatures at least 36 °F (2 °C) (Whitesides, 1979 as cited by [<a href="#144">144</a>]).

<p>In southern Ontario, plants begin flowering in late June and continue as long 
as conditions permit [<a href="#144">144</a>]. Flowers last for only one day, 
opening in the morning and wilting by early afternoon [<a href="#142">142</a>].</p>

<p>Field bindweed roots and rhizomes develop 
winter hardiness during autumn. The shoots are killed back to the roots by freezing temperatures, but hardened 
roots will withstand temperatures 
as low as 21 <font face="Times New Roman">°F </font>(-6 <font face="Times New Roman">
°</font>C) [<a href="#36">36</a>]. Field bindweed overwinters by means of its root and rhizome system as well as by seeds on or 
below the surface of the soil. </p>

<p>In the 2nd and subsequent years new growth arises from endogenous root 
buds formed in the fall on the vertical roots and on any lateral roots that 
survive 
winter. The endogenous root buds, unlike adventitious buds, may remain dormant 
or develop into shoots or roots.&nbsp; While Davidson [<a href="#34">34</a>] found developing buds at all times of the year on 
field bindweed 
plants grown from root cuttings in Oxford, England, others suggest that 
regenerative capacity of root buds varies throughout the year (e.g. [<a href="#130">130</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>]). Buds on the larger roots begin to enlarge 
and develop rhizomes in early spring [<a href="#144">144</a>]. The 
number of shoots formed from lateral root segments is greatest in early spring 
and least in late summer [<a href="#130">130</a>]. Davison observed new shoots 
emerging until late October, with those emerging after late August accounting 
for half the annual radial increase in shoot emergence of 10 feet (3 m) [<a href="#34">34</a>].</p>

<p>Storage capacity of field bindweed roots and rhizomes also varies throughout 
the year. The percentage of starch in 
the roots reaches a maximum in August or September and thereafter rapidly 
declines as it is converted to sugar. The percentage of sugars in the roots 
reaches a maximum in late October and a minimum in May (Barr 1940, as cited by 
[<a href="#144">144</a>]).&nbsp;The percentage of root carbohydrates is lowest at the prebloom stage of 
growth (Gigax 1978, as cited by [<a href="#144">144</a>]).</p>

Frazier [<a href="#45">45</a>] provides details on the amount, distribution, and seasonal trend 
of carbohydrate and nitrogen fractions in the root system of field bindweed in Kansas. All of the carbohydrate 
fractions, except the reducing sugar fraction, 
reached low points in all of the root portions during the interval of 15 April to 
15 May. Sugars attained a seasonal maximum the 1st of November in most parts 
of the root system; starch-dextrin fraction attained  maximum levels in all 
root parts between mid-August and the 1st of October; the readily available 
carbohydrate fraction followed the trend of the starch-dextrin fraction closely. 
The general trend of the nitrogen fractions in practically all portions of the 
plant showed an early season rise to 15 April (from 1 April), followed by a 
decline to a low point sometime between 15 May and 15 June. See Frazier [<a href="#45">45</a>]

<br />

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font> 
There is no information available in the literature regarding fire adaptations of field bindweed. Some inferences 
can be made regarding the likely response of field bindweed to fire based on its 
reproductive strategies. Field bindweed has a deep and extensive root system with abundant 
food reserves and can  sprout repeatedly following removal of aboveground 
growth [<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>].

<p>Goodwin and others [<a href="#51">51</a>] present the following generalization about 
rhizomatous weeds and fire, although they provide no supporting evidence. 
&quot;Growth of rhizomatous weeds is especially enhanced through the survival of 
underground reproductive structures that have access to large energy reserves. 
When above-ground weed growth is removed, such as by fire, vegetative shoot 
production is strongly stimulated, directly producing great numbers of 
individual weeds. Because of the established root reserves, these shoots are 
immediately aggressive and highly competitive.</p>

<p>Field bindweed also produces varying amounts of long-lived, durable seed that 
survives passing through the digestive tracts of various animals [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>], and long periods 
of composting and ensilage [<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#156">156</a>] 
(see <a href="fire_effects.html#DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT">Discussion and Qualification of Fire Effect</a>). 
Considering its survival  under such conditions, one might predict that 
field bindweed seed would survive low- to moderate-severity fires; however, more information is needed.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font> 
There is no information on fire regimes in areas where field bindweed is native or on the effects of fire regimes on 
field bindweed in areas where it is invasive. The response of field bindweed to native 
and imposed fire regimes  probably varies among geographic locations, plant 
community types, fire adaptations of native species, and other disturbance and 
management regimes imposed at a particular site. More information on the effects 
of native and imposed fire regimes on the establishment, persistence, and spread 
of field bindweed are needed.</p>

<p>Frequent fire may deter field bindweed and other nonnative invasive species in temperate 
grasslands. According to Knapp and Seastedt [<a href="#77">77</a>], fire and 
grazing are necessary, integral ecosystem processes that maintain productivity 
of tallgrass prairie by removing standing and fallen litter. Similarly, Leach 
and Givnish [<a href="#84">84</a>] recommend prescribed burning (with specific guidelines) in 
Wisconsin prairie remnants to maintain native plant diversity. A review by Grace 
and others [<a href="#53">53</a>] suggests fire is only 1 type of disturbance that may affect the 
establishment and spread of invasive species in temperate grasslands. Since fire 
return intervals have been and will continue to be heavily influenced by land 
use, fire suppression, and grazing, these other disturbances can be expected to 
continue to play important roles in the future.</p>

<p>A 15-year study in C<sub>4</sub>-dominated grasslands (dominated by big bluestem (<i>Andropogon 
gerardii</i>) and indiangrass (<i>Sorghastrum nutans</i>) and supporting many 
nonnative species, including field bindweed) in Konza Prairie Research Natural 
Area in eastern Kansas, indicated that patterns of disturbance (i.e. grazing and 
fire) strongly affected nonnative plant cover and richness. In particular, 
long-term annually burned sites had low cover and few, if any, nonnative 
species, whereas richness and cover of exotic species was as much as 5 times higher in long-term unburned sites. 
Although the effects of 
grazing could not be tested directly, higher nonnative species richness was 
associated with both annually burned and unburned grazing treatments. The 
authors suggest in their review that annual burning increases the dominance 
(i.e. production and abundance) of C<sub>4</sub> grasses and decreases 
production and abundance of the subdominant grasses and C<sub>3</sub> forbs in 
this grassland, and may indirectly prevent establishment of nonnative species 
[<a href="#119">119</a>].</p>

communities and ecosystems in which field bindweed may occur. If you are interested in

There is no information available regarding the immediate effects of fire on 
field bindweed. 
It is likely that fire removes aboveground growth, while leaving the root system 
and buried seeds undamaged. More research is needed to determine the effects of 
fires of different severities under varied site conditions on field bindweed roots and seeds.

While no information is available regarding the direct effects of fire on field 
bindweed plants and seeds, some information on the effects of various heat 
treatments on viability of field bindweed seed is available.
<p>Harmon and Keim [<a href="#57">57</a>] tested the longevity of several weed 
seeds after burial in horse and cow manure over a period of 1 to 4 months. The 
temperature in the horse and cow manure reached 158 <font face="Times New Roman">
°</font>F (66 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) and 150
<font face="Times New Roman">°</font>F (70 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C), 
respectively, in 2 weeks. Percent germination of field bindweed seed before 
burial was 84%. In horse manure, germination was 6% after 1 month (without acid 
treatment), 8% after 2 months (with acid treatment), and 0% thereafter. In cow 
manure, germination was 4% after 1 month (without acid treatment), 22% after 2 
months (with acid treatment), 1% after 3 months (1 weak bindweed seedling was 
obtained), and 0% thereafter. Field bindweed seeds retained viability longer 
than all other weed seeds tested. 
Similarly, most weed seeds tested by Wiese and others [<a href="#148">148</a>] were 
killed after 3 days or more exposure at 
120 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>F (49 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) in compost; it required 7 days of 
exposure at 180 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>F (83 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) to kill 
all field bindweed seed in compost. In dry air, all species survived 140
<font face="Times New Roman">°</font>F (60 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) for 30 
days. All seeds except field bindweed were killed in dry air by 160
<font face="Times New Roman">°</font>F (72 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) for 3 days, 
while it took 7 days of exposure at 180 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>F (83
<font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) to reduce viability of field bindweed seed from 
about 30% to 7%, and 30 days to reduce field bindweed seed viability to 5%. 
Field bindweed seed was 
killed by a 12-day exposure in an outside storage 
pile of compost. Ensiling field bindweed seed seemed to have no effect on its viability [<a href="#156">156</a>]. 
These results suggest that field bindweed seed may survive low severity fire.

<a name="PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE">
PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:</a>
</span>
<br />

There is no information available regarding field bindweed response to fire.
Field bindweed probably sprouts from roots and rhizomes if top-killed by fire. Response of field bindweed populations to 
fire depends on a number of factors, including 
native and imposed fire regimes, site conditions (e.g. soil, moisture, 
temperature), associated plant communities, management history, and disturbance 
regimes at a particular site.

<p>In a study on the effects of litter on 
germination and establishment of cheatgrass and medusahead, field bindweed  germinated and grew well without litter, 
suggesting that field bindweed may do well in a 
postfire environment. When litter was present, and with increased competition from grasses, yields of 
field bindweed were 
&quot;drastically curtailed&quot; [<a href="#42">42</a>].</p>

<br />

<b>Fire as a control agent:</b> 
Prescribed fire alone is not likely to control field bindweed, 
but it may be useful in combination with other methods (Callihan and others 
1990, as cited by [<a href="#86">86</a>]). The effectiveness of prescribed fire as a control 
method for field bindweed may vary with the invaded plant community and interactions with 
other types of disturbance.

<p>In C<sub>4</sub>-dominated grasslands, for example, long-term annually burned 
watersheds had lower cover of nonnative species (including field bindweed) than unburned watersheds, 
and fire reduced nonnative species richness by 80% to 90% [<a href="#119">119</a>]. Langstroth [<a href="#82">82</a>] recorded the 
presence of field bindweed on experimental plots in a California grassland that were grazed by 
domestic sheep (short duration) in the summer, but unburned. All other plots 
(ungrazed/unburned, spring grazed/unburned, and all burning treatments) had no 
field bindweed present.</p>

<p>It is unclear from these results how fire and grazing affect field bindweed 
populations over the long term.</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Postfire colonization potential:</b> </font>
Field bindweed has the potential to invade an area following fire. Fire provides a suitable seedbed 
for field bindweed [<a href="#42">42</a>] by removing shade and exposing mineral soil. 
Therefore, if field bindweed is present on or near the site prior to burning, there is 
potential for its establishment and spread. It is a good idea to survey the 
surrounding area for field bindweed and control plants that may contain seed that could be dispersed 
into the burn.</p>

<p><b>Preventing postfire establishment and spread:</b> The USDA Forest 
Service's &quot;Guide to Noxious Weed Prevention Practices&quot; [<a href="#137">137</a>] provides 
several fire management considerations for weed prevention in general that apply 
to field bindweed.</p>

<p>Preventing invasive plants from establishing in weed-free burned areas is the 
most effective and least costly management method. This can be accomplished 
through careful monitoring, early detection and eradication, and limiting 
invasive plant seed dispersal into burned areas by [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>]:</p>

  detecting weeds early and eradicating before vegetative spread and/or seed

  <li>
  <p class="subframeText"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">
  eradicating small patches and containing or controlling large infestations 
  within or adjacent to the burned area</font> </li>
</ul>

<p>In general, early detection is critical for preventing establishment of large 
populations of invasive plants. Monitoring in spring, summer, and fall is 
imperative. Managers should eradicate established field bindweed plants and 
small patches adjacent to burned areas to prevent or limit seed dispersal into 
the site [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>].</p>

<p>The need for revegetation after fire can be based on the degree of desirable 
vegetation displaced by invasive plants prior to burning and on postfire 
survival of desirable vegetation. Revegetation necessity can also be related to 
invasive plant survival as viable seeds, root crowns, or rhizomes capable of 
reproduction. In general, postfire revegetation should be considered when 
desirable vegetation cover is less than about 30% [<a href="#51">51</a>].</p>

<p>When prefire cover of field bindweed is absent to low, and prefire cover 
of desirable vegetation is high, revegetation is probably not necessary after 
low- and medium-severity burns. After a high-severity burn on a site in this 
condition, revegetation may be necessary (depending on postfire survival of 
desirable species), and intensive monitoring for invasive plant establishment is 
necessary to detect and eradicate newly established invasives before they spread 
[<a href="#51">51</a>].</p>

<p>When prefire cover of field bindweed is moderate (20-79%) to high 
(80-100%), revegetation may be necessary after fire of any severity if cover of 
desired vegetation is less than about 30%. Intensive weed management is also 
recommended, especially after fires of moderate to high severity [<a href="#51">51</a>].</p>

<p>Fall dormant broadcast seeding into ash will cover and retain seeds. If there 
is insufficient ash, seedbed preparation may be necessary. A seed mix should 
contain quick-establishing grasses and forbs (exclude forbs if broadleaf 
herbicides are anticipated) that can effectively occupy available niches. 
Managers can enhance the success of revegetation (natural or artificial) by 
excluding livestock until vegetation is well established (at least 2 growing 
seasons) [<a href="#51">51</a>]. See
<a href="http://www.montana.edu/wwwpb/pubs/eb160.html">Integrated Noxious Weed Management after Wildfires</a> 
for more information.</p>

When planning a prescribed burn, managers should preinventory the project 
area and evaluate cover and phenology of any field bindweed and other 
invasive plants present on or adjacent to the site, and avoid ignition and 
burning in areas at high risk for field bindweed establishment or spread due 
to fire effects. Managers should also avoid creating soil conditions that 
promote weed germination and establishment. Weed status and risks must be 
discussed in burn rehabilitation plans. Also, wildfire managers might consider 
including weed prevention education and providing weed identification aids 
during fire training; avoiding known weed infestations when locating fire lines; 
monitoring camps, staging areas, helibases, etc., to be sure they are kept weed 
free; taking care that equipment is weed free; incorporating weed prevention 
into fire rehabilitation plans; and acquiring restoration funding. Additional 
guidelines and specific recommendations and requirements are available [<a href="#137">137</a>].

IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE:</a>

<br />

Very little information is available regarding the use of field bindweed by 
livestock and wildlife. According to Bell [<a href="#13">13</a>], various research reports 
published by the Experiment Stations of Kansas, Iowa, Utah and Texas from 1920 
to 1952 suggest that farm animals, including sheep and pigs, were used to eat 
bindweed as a control method in some places during that time, but that cattle 
are &quot;nearly useless&quot; for this purpose (see Biological control). In Minnesota, 
sheep grazed bindweed in preference to wheat, rye (<i>Secale</i> spp.), or Sudan grass 
(<i>Sorghum</i> <i>bicolor</i> ssp. <i>drummondii)</i>, and they grazed alfalfa

Dioscorides (circa A.D. 50) recommended drinking tea made from field bindweed 
seeds for 40 days to cure spleen problems, weariness, and hiccups. However, he 
warned, it had the inconvenient side effects of causing&nbsp;one to urinate blood 
after the 6th day and making one permanently sterile after the 37th (as cited by 
[<a href="#95">95</a>]). According to Kearney and others [<a href="#72">72</a>], an antihemorrhagic substance has been discovered in 
field bindweed, although the source of this information is not given.</p>

IMPACTS AND CONTROL:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Impacts:</b></font> 
A 1998 review by Lyons [<a href="#86">86</a>] indicates that the impact of field bindweed on agricultural lands is well documented, 
especially in the central U.S., but the threat it poses to rangelands and 
natural areas is unclear. Almost all research on field bindweed pertains to agriculture.
When surveyed in 1982 and 1988, farmers and ranchers in north-central Idaho 
considered field bindweed to be one of the 3 most serious weeds in their area [<a href="#27">27</a>]. The Eastern 
Region of the U.S. Forest Service ranks field bindweed as a Category 3 plant: 
often restricted to disturbed ground, and not especially invasive in undisturbed 
natural habitats [<a href="#136">136</a>]. Natural area managers are most likely to find it in 
moist locations (e.g. riparian corridors and irrigated areas) on tracts once 
used for agriculture [<a href="#86">86</a>]. 

<p>Field bindweed is found on several of The Nature Conservancy's preserves and may pose a 
threat to restoration efforts. Stewards at the Phantom Canyon Preserve in 
Colorado report that field bindweed is most likely to invade and reduce cover of native 
grasses and forbs in areas that are degraded due to past land use, current human 
activity, and fire suppression. 
Stewards at Garden Creek Preserve in northern Idaho report that field bindweed threatens 
native plant communities by &quot;decreasing biodiversity,&quot; and is a direct 
threat to several species [<a href="#86">86</a>]. At the Thousand Springs Preserve in Idaho, 
field bindweed thrives under 
cultivated and irrigated conditions, and managers there suggest that field 
bindweed &quot;outcompetes&quot; native grasses 
[<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>].</p>

<p>Field bindweed competition for nutrients and water may reduce productivity of native plants, 
although this has only been studied with crop plants, where yield reductions 
range from 0 to 100% [<a href="#128">128</a>]. Competition from field bindweed for soil moisture may have 
greater impact in dry years [<a href="#8">8</a>].</p>

<p>It has been suggested that field bindweed may be mildly toxic to some grazing animals, and 
that the amount of field bindweed that can be safely eaten by domestic sheep, 
cattle, and goats is not known. It is reported to cause distress in domestic 
pigs that eat it (Callihan and others 1990, as cited by [<a href="#86">86</a>]).
Field bindweed contains alkaloids that may be toxic to horses [<a href="#134">134</a>]. Other 
authors report a history of using sheep and pigs to eat field bindweed and thereby help control infestations 
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>] (see <a href="#Biological:">Biological</a> control).</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Control:</b></font> 
Field bindweed has a deep, 
extensive root system that stores carbohydrates and proteins and allows it to  sprout repeatedly following 
removal of aboveground growth. 
Field bindweed may also 
produce abundant, long-lived seed. Strategies to control field bindweed infestations must 
include removing established plants and preventing seed production and seedling 
establishment. Alcock and others (1974, as cited by [<a href="#86">86</a>]) suggest the following as general goals 
for field bindweed control: 
1) reduce seed in soil 2) prevent seedling growth, 3) deplete food reserves in 
the root system 4) prevent its spread.</p>

<p>Eradication of an established invader is rare, and control efforts vary 
enormously in their efficacy. Successful control depends more on 
commitment and continuing diligence than on the efficacy of specific tools 
themselves. Control of biotic invasions is most effective when it employs a 
long-term, ecosystem-wide strategy rather than a tactical approach focused on 
battling individual invaders [<a href="#87">87</a>]. A long-term perspective is important where total eradication is not a 
realistic short-term goal. Even with intensive management, field bindweed can 
persist as seed for several years, and some authors suggest that 3 to 5 growing 
seasons are required in agricultural settings to eliminate seedlings (Callihan 
and others 1990, as cited by [<a href="#86">86</a>]).  The key to implementing a successful control program is to continue 
treatment even after it appears the infestations are seriously reduced 
[<a href="#86">86</a>].</p>

<p>Successful control of field bindweed is most likely if aboveground 
biomass is removed multiple times over at least 2 growing seasons (e.g. [<a href="#13">13</a>]), or 
by planting of competitive species following aboveground removal and continuously monitoring for 
and killing  sprouts and seedlings. In agriculture, control has been most 
successful where tillage is combined with herbicide application, although 
herbicide application alone may also be effective 
(see <a href="#Chemical:">Chemical</a> control) [<a href="#86">86</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><font size="4">Prevention:</font></font>
The most efficient and effective method 
of managing invasive species is to prevent their invasion and spread [<a href="#116">116</a>]. 
Preventing the establishment of weeds in natural areas is achieved by 
maintaining healthy natural communities and by conducting aggressive monitoring 
several times each year. Monitoring efforts are best concentrated on the most 
disturbed areas in a site, particularly along roadsides, parking lots, 
fencelines, and waterways. When a field bindweed infestation is found, the 
location can be recorded and the surrounding area surveyed to determine the size 
and extent of the infestation, so these sites can be revisited on follow-up 
surveys [<a href="#67">67</a>]. It is important to kill any field bindweed plants that are found, 
followed by some combination of mechanical, chemical and/or biological control. 
Prevention of new invasions is much less costly than postinvasion control 
[<a href="#87">87</a>].</p>

<p>Avoid management activities that encourage invasion and be prepared to 
eradicate small infestations that may follow such disturbances. Factors 
indicated by Nature Conservancy managers as encouraging field bindweed invasion 
include cultivation and irrigation in Idaho grassland and road grading and 
haying in Oregon along roadsides and riparian areas [<a href="#109">109</a>]. Weed prevention and 
control can be incorporated into all types of management plans, including 
logging and site preparation, management of grazing allotments, recreation 
management, research projects, road building and maintenance, and fire 
management [<a href="#137">137</a>]. See the USDA &quot;Guide to noxious weed prevention practices&quot; 
[<a href="#137">137</a>] for specific guidelines and recommendations for preventing the spread of weed 
seeds and propagules under different management conditions.</p>

<p>Roads act as dispersal corridors for many invasive species. Avoid road building in nature reserves, 
and when unavoidable, redeposit original 
topsoil in roadside ditches. Road construction 
projects should not be considered complete until native vegetation is fully 
established. Road construction projects in nature reserves should be treated and 
funded as 10- to 20-year biological projects rather than 1-2 year engineering 
projects, with biologists and resource managers consulting on road construction. 
Roadsides should be actively managed by regular monitoring for establishment of nonnative species, 
and reseeding roadsides with natives [<a href="#135">135</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Integrated management:</font> 
A combination of complementary control methods may 
be helpful for effective control of field bindweed. Integrated management includes not only 
killing the target plant, but establishing desirable species and discouraging 
nonnative, invasive species over the long term. Components of any integrated 
weed management program are sustained effort, constant monitoring and 
evaluation, and the adoption of improved strategies. An integrated management 
plan includes efforts to place continual stress on undesirable 
plants. </p>

<p>In agriculture, most effective programs for the control of field bindweed 
combine cultivation and crop rotation with the use of herbicides. A review by 
Weaver and Riley [<a href="#144">144</a>] summarizes this information as follows: Cultivation at 
frequent intervals results in a gradual and continuous reduction in the 
concentration of total available carbohydrates and a decrease in root quantity. 
However, 1 to 5 years of repeated tillage may be required to exhaust the root 
reserves and effectively control populations of field bindweed. Competitive 
crops such as winter wheat or perennial forages are able to reduce field 
bindweed infestation after 3 to 5 years, particularly when combined with the 
application of herbicides.</p>

<p>In North Dakota, 2 fields were prepared for planting to native grasses by 
burning once and summer fallowing for 2 years. Summer fallowing effectively 
killed all aboveground vegetation. Within 2 months after drill seeding native 
grasses, perennial weeds, including field bindweed, were very dense. Fields were 
then sprayed with 2 applications of 2,4-D. Results of these treatments are not 
given [<a href="#62">62</a>].</p>

<p>Managers at 
Thousand Springs Preserve in Idaho had success controlling field bindweed in an agricultural 
site undergoing restoration, using a combination of tilling and planting 
competitive plants. In the 1st year the field was burned and planted with peas 
and oats. After the crop was harvested in the spring, the field was tilled and 
irrigated to encourage germination of weeds. Glyphosate was applied in October, 
although this had little effect because it was quickly followed by a killing 
frost. Native perennial bunchgrass seeds were no-till drilled in late fall, and seedlings emerged in February and March. The native grasses were irrigated 
and cheatgrass was suppressed using glyphosate. Annual weeds were controlled by 
mowing around the bunchgrasses. Mowing and irrigation continued for 1 
year. After 5 years the perennial grasses were well established, the annual 
weeds continued to persist, and the perennial weeds (e.g. field bindweed) were minor 
components. Field bindweed grows most successfully only where there are irrigation leaks and 
generally does poorly if not irrigated. See the
<a href="http://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/esadocs/convarve.html">review</a> by Lyons [<a href="#86">86</a>] 
for more details.</p>

<p>In a greenhouse study on the combined effects of 
the bindweed gall mite (<i>Aceria malherbae</i>) and herbicide (2,4-DB or glyphosate) on field bindweed height 
and biomass, mite feeding alone reduced field bindweed shoot biomass 37% to 48% and root biomass 46% 
to 50%. Herbicide alone reduced field bindweed root biomass 25% to 52%, and combining mite feeding 
with either 2,4-DB or glyphosate reduced root biomass more than mites or either 
herbicide alone. Combination of bindweed gall mite with sublethal doses of 
herbicide may allow for field bindweed suppression while reducing potential herbicide injury 
to desirable plants and maintaining mite populations. The herbicides did not appear to 
negatively affect the mites [<a href="#21">21</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><font size="4">Physical/mechanical:</font></font>
Removing aboveground parts of 
field bindweed repeatedly to starve the roots is commonly suggested as a control method in 
agricultural settings (e.g. [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>]). Common methods for removing top-growth 
include tillage, hoeing, cutting, or mowing. Tillage is  usually not recommended for natural areas, 
as it may damage 
desirable vegetation and/or increase soil erosion. On rangelands or natural areas 
that were previously used for agriculture, tilling may be useful for ridding 
infestations. For small areas this may be done using hand-held tools, but for 
large areas machinery is often required [<a href="#86">86</a>].</p>

<p>The study and use of tillage or cultivation for control of field bindweed has a long history, particularly in 
the midwestern United States, as reviewed by Bell [<a href="#13">13</a>]. The biological basis of 
this research was that field bindweed could be killed if the roots were starved by cutting 
off the leaves on a regular routine. Food reserves in the surface roots (upper 
12 inches (30 cm)) are rapidly depleted by cultivation, but in deep roots (6 to 8 feet 
(1.8-2.4 m) deep), reserves are exhausted only after long 
continued cultivation at the emergence of new sprouts. Only a small quantity of 
reserves is necessary to regenerate new growth [<a href="#10">10</a>].</p>

<p>Recommendations of intensive, repeated cultivation for control of field 
bindweed are common. One recommendation was to cut off field bindweed plants about 3 
inches (8 cm) below soil surface &quot;for the whole season&quot; (15-27 cultivations, 
every 8-10 days, through the spring, summer, and early fall (until frost), and 
another dozen cultivations the next year). Cultivations should extend 16.5 feet (5 
m) from the population boundary because of invasive roots. 
Another recommendation was to cultivate 8 
days after the weed re-emerges, based upon careful studies of the rhizome system 
that showed that the emerging shoots relied upon food stored in the root system 
for 8 days before photosynthesis started to replenish the root. For a cultivation 
tool, a duckfoot sweep was the desired implement [<a href="#13">13</a>].</p>

<p>Shallow hoeing and deeper 
cultivations were equally&nbsp;effective when made every time the 1st shoots of 
field bindweed emerged. Hoeing at regular 14-day 
intervals was just as effective as hoeing every 7 or 10 days. All 3 techniques 
eradicated field bindweed in 2 seasons (Sherwood and Fuelkeman 1948, and Timmons and Bruns 
1951, as cited by [<a href="#6">6</a>]). The percentage of total sugars, carbohydrates, polysaccharides,  starch, 
and readily available carbohydrates in field bindweed roots cultivated at 3-week intervals 
was markedly lower than that found in the roots of undisturbed plants. 
Additional decreases were observed in the roots in the top 12 inches (30 cm) of 
plants cultivated bi-weekly and weekly [<a href="#12">12</a>]. The relative depletion of food reserves, supplied by underground parts of the 
plant, by cultivation every 7th day as compared with cultivation every 14th day, 
was calculated. From this it appears that cultivation every 14 days would 
destroy a 5th more of the readily available carbohydrates and more than double 
the loss of protein nitrogen in the 2 parts as compared with 2 cultivations 
at intervals of 7 days in the same unit of time [<a href="#46">46</a>]. Caution must be 
used with cultivation, because much of the root system is concentrated near the surface of the soil 
[<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>], and mechanical tillage may cut 
and disseminate root fragments [<a href="#78">78</a>].</p>

<p>At the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge on the Rio Grande in 
New Mexico, 3 techniques were employed in an effort to increase native chufa (<i>Cyperus 
esculentus</i>) tuber production: 1) mowing early in the growing season; 2) shallow 
disking 30 days after wetland drawdown; and 3) periodic sustained flooding 
during the growing season. There was no control in this study. Field bindweed mass (g/m2) 
appeared unaffected by mowing, and appears to have decreased slightly but not 
significantly (p&lt;0.10) after disking or flooding treatments [<a href="#131">131</a>].</p>

<p>Even under cultivation, field bindweed seedlings may continue to emerge for 
many seasons. After 6 weeks, a new seedling has a root system 
large enough to regenerate stems if it is cut [<a href="#13">13</a>]. Studies by Swan [<a href="#129">129</a>] indicate that 
field bindweed seedlings can be killed by 
tillage or cutting at a depth of 4 inches (10 cm) if done within 3 weeks of emergence.</p>

<p>Mulches are effective for controlling field bindweed if no light reaches the 
soil surface. Black plastic is recommended. Complete death of field bindweed plants under  mulch 
takes about 3 to 5 years [<a href="#13">13</a>]. Similarly, 6 to 9 weeks of solarization in 
California field plots 
reduced the number of field bindweed seedlings, and regrowth from established 
field bindweed plants was 
suppressed for 6 weeks after treatment [<a href="#41">41</a>].</p>

Several natural enemies of field 
bindweed have been identified in its home range and several tested for 
host-specificity. Unfortunately, nearly all of the biocontrol agents tested so

<p>Larvae and adults of the Argus tortoise beetle (<i>Chelymorpha casidea</i>) feed on 
the leaves of members of the morning-glory family. The Argus tortoise beetle is native to the U.S. and 
also occurs in Canada. In New York, it has been observed to defoliate infestations of 
field bindweed and false bindweed (<i>Calystegia</i> <i>sepium</i>) completely, while 
leaving the associated rye and corn crops untouched. It was being investigated as a 
potential biological control agent in 1979 (Selleck 1979, as cited by [<a href="#144">144</a>]); 
the outcome of these investigations is unknown.</p>

<p>Grazing: In Minnesota, domestic sheep grazing on field bindweed infested land 
sown to several crops (wheat, rye, and Sudan grass) consistently eliminated 
bindweed in 2 seasons, while grazing of perennial pasture mixtures consisting of 
alfalfa and brome grass or reed canary grass did not eliminate bindweed in any 
of 3 experiments. Grazing of pure bindweed reduced the stand somewhat, but was 
much less effective than was the grazing of infested land on which crops were 
being grown [<a href="#122">122</a>]. According to a review by Bell [<a href="#13">13</a>], cattle do not eat field 
bindweed, sheep will eat it but do not prefer it, and pigs are the field 
bindweed gourmands. Pigs will eat the whole plant, given a chance. Pigs are said 
to nearly eradicate the root system of bindweed if the field is plowed before 
they are let into the field. However, their snouts must be free of nose rings or 
slits.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><a name="Chemical:">Chemical:</a></font> 
Herbicides commonly recommended for the control of field 
bindweed include 2,4-D (alone and in combination), glyphosate, dicamba, picloram, quinclorac, and 
paraquat. See the 
<a href="http://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/handbook.html">Weed Control Methods Handbook</a> 
or the field bindweed
<a href="http://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/esadocs/convarve.html">ESA</a> 
for more information on specific chemicals, their efficacy, and recommendations for use in controlling field bindweed.</p>

<p>In general, herbicides should be applied when they will be most effectively 
absorbed and translocated to field bindweed roots, but before plants produce seed and new 
buds. The optimum time for the 
application of foliar-applied herbicides is the bud to full-bloom stage which 
coincides with the maximum translocation of assimilates downward and root 
metabolic activity. However, the application of herbicides 
in late summer, if the vines are actively growing, may also be effective  [<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>].</p>

<p>Moisture availability may impact the effectiveness of chemicals applied for 
field bindweed control. A laboratory test indicated that field bindweed is more resistant to glyphosate action 
when plants are drought stressed [<a href="#33">33</a>]. Similarly, a 
review by Meyer  [<a href="#93">93</a>] indicates  that field bindweed growing in semiarid conditions (rainfall 
of 11 to 20 inches (280-500 mm)) may be more resistant to weed control efforts 
(herbicides and cultural control) than field bindweed growing in more humid conditions 
(rainfall &gt;25 inches (640 mm)). This is especially apparent for foliar-applied 
herbicides, possibly due to lower leaf area, thicker cuticle with higher wax 
content, slower biological processes, and smaller leaf:root ratios under 
semiarid conditions. But it may also be due, in part, to different cropping and 
cultural practices employed in the different areas.</p>

<p>According to a review by Lyons [<a href="#86">86</a>], repeated use of the same or similar herbicides can result in 
herbicide-resistant strains of field bindweed. Investigators have 
unsuccessfully tried to correlate the morphology of field bindweed strains with their 
herbicide resistance. When planning on 
using herbicides to control field bindweed, it is useful to know whether field 
bindweed strains in the 
area have demonstrated any herbicide resistance [<a href="#86">86</a>]. Evidence of resistance of 
field bindweed to 2,4-D isooctylester after 3 consecutive years 
of spraying is suggested by Zengin [<a href="#157">157</a>]. Field bindweed 1st demonstrated resistance to 2,4-D in Kansas in 1964, and apparently, 
research has shown that these particular biotypes may be resistant to other 
synthetic auxin herbicides. See the
<a href="http://www.weedscience.org/in.asp">International Survey of Herbicide 
Resistant Weeds</a> for more information.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><font size="4">Cultural:</font></font> 
In agricultural systems, smother crops 
are often used to control invasive species such as field bindweed. Competition for light 
reduces field bindweed vigor [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>]. According to a review by 
Lyons [<a href="#86">86</a>], light reaching field bindweed plants must be reduced to about 50% shade or more for 3 
years to control field bindweed growth.</p>

<p>In agricultural systems suggested smother crops include millet, sorghum, 
Sudan grass, or alfalfa [<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>]. Winter wheat is often a good competitor with 
field bindweed because it grows rapidly during the early spring when 
bindweed is not using soil moisture (Wiese and Rea 1959, as cited by [<a href="#144">144</a>]). Summer-planted crops that grow 
vigorously and provide early shade offer competition to field bindweed at a time when it is normally making its best 
growth [<a href="#66">66</a>].</p>

<p>It may be difficult to find native species that can compete effectively with 
field bindweed. The outcome of competition between species can be complicated and unpredictable. 
Managers at Phantom Canyon Preserve were unable to establish 
native species to compete with field bindweed, while those at Thousand Springs Preserve 
successfully established perennial grasses [<a href="#86">86</a>].</p>

A review by Lyons [<a href="#86">86</a>] suggests that, in general, species that grow vigorously during the winter and early spring 
may offer the best competition to field bindweed, because they force field 
bindweed plants to compete 
for light later in the season. Competitive crops may be most effective in 
humid/shady areas where solar radiation is diminished and shading has larger 
consequences (Wilson and others 1955, as cited by [<a href="#86">86</a>]). Therefore competitive planting or 
restoration efforts in low light riparian habitats, where the available light is 
reduced by tree canopies, may work to control field bindweed [<a href="#86">86</a>].
