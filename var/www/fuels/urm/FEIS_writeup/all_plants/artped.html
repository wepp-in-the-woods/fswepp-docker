<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Birdfoot sagebrush grows from the high plains of southern Idaho and
Montana through Wyoming to northwestern Colorado [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  It extends

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Birdfoot sagebrush has been described as a climax indicator at some
sandy to stony sites in central Montana [<a href="#2">2</a>].  It is codominant with
Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis) at these range sites [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Birdfoot sagebrush is found in sagebrush (Artemisia spp.)-grass and
saltbush (Atriplex spp.)-grass communities in Utah and elsewhere [<a href="#7">7</a>].
It commonly occurs with the following species:  Indian ricegrass
(Oryzopsis hymenoides), needle-and-thread (Stipa comata), threadleaf
sedge (Carex filifolia), Idaho fescue, bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus
elymoides), bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata), fringed
sagebrush (Artemisia frigida), winterfat (Ceratoides lanata), and a
number of annual grasses and forbs [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Artemisia pedatifida
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Little is known about the importance of birdfoot sagebrush to livestock
and wildlife.  Its palatability ratings suggest potential importance to
some species.  However, Johnson [<a href="#12">12</a>] reports that birdfoot sagebrush has
little value as a browse species.


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Overall palatability of birdfoot sagebrush in Wyoming is rated as
follows [<a href="#4">4</a>]:

Cattle               Fair
Sheep                Good
Horses               Good
Pronghorn            Fair
Elk                  Fair
Mule deer            Poor
Small mammals        Poor
Small nongame birds  Fair
Upland game birds    Fair
Waterfowl            Poor


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Birdfoot sagebrush is rated as fair in energy value and good in protein
value [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Nutritional content is as follows [<a href="#17">17</a>]:

                      Buds, fresh
  Ash                    27.8%
  Crude Fiber            23.7%
  Ether Extract           2.4%
  N-free Extract         39.1%
  Protein (Nx6.25)        7.0%
    Cattle-dig. protein   3.8%
    Horses-dig. protein   3.5%
    Sheep-dig. protein    3.5%



<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Because of its short stature, birdfoot sagebrush provides little cover
for wildlife [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Birdfoot sagebrush grows well on alkaline flats and could be used for
rehabilitation of alkaline spoils and other revegetation projects [<a href="#15">15</a>].
It is rated as having low potential for erosion control and for long-
and short-term revegetation [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Birdfoot sagebrush may cause hayfever [<a href="#4">4</a>].  It is reported to be a good
soil stabilizer [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Birdfoot sagebrush increases in response to grazing [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Herbage yields
at four central Montana birdfoot sagebrush sites ranged from 400 to
2,600 pounds (182-1,180 kg) air-dry herbage per acre [<a href="#2">2</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Artemisia pedatifida
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Birdfoot sagebrush is a dwarf, somewhat mat-forming perennial subshrub
which grows from 2.0 to 5.9 inches (0.5-1.5 dm) in height [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].
Numerous erect stems arise from a branching woody base [<a href="#3">3</a>].  The root is
described as tough and woody [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Leaves are greenish gray and pubescent [<a href="#16">16</a>] and once or twice ternate
[<a href="#10">10</a>].  The cauline leaves are reduced and often entire [<a href="#3">3</a>].  The
inflorescence of birdfoot sagebrush is subracemiform or spiciform [<a href="#10">10</a>]
and few-headed [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Four to seven marginal pistillate ray flowers are
produced, as well as five to ten perfect but sterile staminate disc
flowers [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Birdfoot sagebrush produces few-headed spiciform, subracemiform, or
racemiform inflorescences with four to seven pistillate, and five to ten
disk flowers [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].  Regeneration is presumably by seed.  Information on
germination and seedling establishment is lacking.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Birdfoot sagebrush grows in small isolated stands on dry hills, mesas,
ridges, and high plains [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  Annual precipitation at four
representative central Montana sites ranged from 5 to more than 25
inches (13-64 cm) [<a href="#2">2</a>].  This species commonly occurs on alkaline desert
soils [<a href="#16">16</a>], with good growth reported on saline soils and on loam, clay
loam, and clay [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Optimum soil depth is between 10 and 20 inches
(25-51 cm) [<a href="#4">4</a>].  General elevational ranges are as follows [<a href="#4">4</a>]:

                from:  5,500 to 5,000 ft. (1,678-1,678 m) in CO
                       6,200 to 8,000 ft. (1,891-2,440 m) in MT
                       6,000 to 6,800 ft. (1,830-2,074 m) in UT 
                       4,100 to 7,000 ft. (1,251-2,135 m) in WY




<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Birdfoot sagebrush is a climax indicator at a number of central Montana
range sites [<a href="#2">2</a>].  The successional status of birdfoot sagebrush is not
well documented.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Time of flowering is as follows [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>]:

        Location            Beginning of Flowering       End of Flowering

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Resprouting and other types of vegetative response have not been
documented.  Reestablishment probably occurs thorough reseeding.

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Artemisia pedatifida

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
The effect of fire on birdfoot sagebrush is not well documented.
Presumably the plant is killed when aboveground vegetation is consumed
by fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
Resprouting after fire or other disturbance has not been documented.
Reestablishment of this "weakly spreading" subshrub [<a href="#8">8</a>] is probably
through seedling establishment.  Recovery time is unknown.
