<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Bromus pumpellianus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
The native perennial species of brome (Bromus spp.) form a considerable
portion of the forage in open woods of the mountain regions of the
western United States.  Pumpelly brome is abundant, good forage for all
classes of livestock [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep in Jasper National Park, Alberta, ate
Pumpelly brome during July and early August 1968-70.  However, its
utilization was less than its availability.  Though available, it was
not recorded as being utilized in Waterton Lakes or Banff national parks
[<a href="#26">26</a>].

Pumpelly brome has been crossed with smooth brome to produce the
cultivar "Polar" bromegrass.  It is a long-lived and productive forage
crop in south-central Alaska [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Pumpelly brome had a higher mean Nutritive Value Index for five tested
stages of growth than did any of the other 20 native and cultivated
grasses studied at Lethbridge, Alberta.  Pumpelly brome had 12.7 percent
protein in the leaf stage of growth.  Protein, phosphorus, and carotene
decreased with advancing maturity; calcium and crude fiber increased [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Pumpelly brome, native to the Matanuska Valley near Palmer, Alaska, was
1 of 17 indigenous and introduced grass species evaluated for forage
yield and quality in that area .  It was grown over a 3-year period, and
harvested twice each year.  Of the two Pumpelly brome accessions, one
ranked fourteenth out of 38 accessions in 3-year average yield; the
other was not as successful.  Pumpelly brome had good nutritional
quality, with sufficient percentages of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,
calcium, and magnesium to produce moderate gain on a growing 440-pound
(200-kg) steer [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Pumpelly brome was evaluated for revegetation potential in the
Richardson Mountains of the northeastern Yukon Territory.  Seeding was
done June 7, 1979.  Seedling emergence was 96.7 percent in that year.
In 1980 survival was 63.3 percent, in 1981 it was 40.0 percent, and by
1985 there were no surviving plants.  There was no seed production by
Pumpelly brome in any year.  The Pumpelly brome selection was a northern
type, but it was apparently not adapted for survival at this severe
northern Yukon site [<a href="#30">30</a>].

Pumpelly brome did not establish on scarified arctic tundra sites of a
construction-disturbed alluvial fan in the central Brooks Range.  Some
sites were planted with grasses (other than Pumpelly brome) and others
were not; 4 and 11 years after treatments Pumpelly brome occurred only
on undisturbed control plots [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In Wyoming Pumpelly brome decreases with grazing pressure [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Pumpelly brome seed should be planted at shallow depth.  It grows best
on moderately moist soil [<a href="#12">12</a>].

At the Matanuska Research Farm in south-central Alaska, Pumpelly brome
planted May 24, 1984, and harvested in 1984, 1985, and 1986, produced a
3-year total of 7.69 tons of forage per acre.  Seeding rate was 22
pounds per acre; commercial fertilizer was applied.  Pumpelly brome
compared favorably with 29 other strains of grasses tested for forage
production.  It also showed excellent winter survival and spring vigor [<a href="#19">19</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Bromus pumpellianus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Pumpelly brome is a native, perennial graminoid [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Culms are 20 to
47 inches (50 to 120 cm) tall [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Leaves are 0.16 to 0.39 inches
(4-10 mm) wide [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>] and 4 to 8 inches (10-20 cm) long [<a href="#1">1</a>].  There are
generally two to four culm leaves [<a href="#16">16</a>].  The inflorescence is a narrow
panicle 2 to 8 inches (5-20 cm) long [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Spikelets are seven to
eleven flowered [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  The lemma is 0.39 to 0.47 inches (10-12 mm)
long [<a href="#14">14</a>] and is generally short-awned [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  The fruit is a caryopsis
[<a href="#12">12</a>].  Pumpelly brome has well-developed creeping rhizomes [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>] and
forms colonies [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Pumpelly brome sprouts from perennating buds at the base of the culms
[<a href="#16">16</a>] and from rhizomes [<a href="#15">15</a>].  It also reproduces by seed [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Pumpelly brome occurs on moist to dry sites.  It is found in woods [<a href="#9">9</a>],
meadows, and on grassy slopes [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  In interior Alaska it occurs on
warm, dry sites on steep, south-facing slopes in young mixed hardwood
and white spruce (Picea glauca) stands [<a href="#33">33</a>].  In Michigan it grows on
sandy shores and dunes at the northern edge of Lake Michigan [<a href="#31">31</a>].  In
western Montana it occurs in moist montane or subalpine meadows [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].
In Colorado it is found on dry rocky slopes [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Pumpelly brome grows on a variety of soil types.  It occurs on gravelly
sandy clay loam on arctic alluvial fan tundra in the central Brooks
Range [<a href="#8">8</a>].  It is found on rocky, shallow, poorly developed soil on
bluffs in the upper Yukon valley in east-central Alaska [<a href="#10">10</a>].  It occurs
on deep, well-drained mineral loess soils that are rich in organics and
are underlain by permafrost on pingos near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska.  Pingo
permafrost thaws more deeply in summer than that of surrounding land
[<a href="#32">32</a>].  Pumpelly brome grows on marine deltas and eroding sandy seashores
of Amundsen Gulf [<a href="#7">7</a>].  It occurs on shallow, well-drained sandy loam
soil on a wind-disturbed butte top in southeastern Montana [<a href="#25">25</a>] and on
sandy loam on the Palliser winter range in Banff National Park, Alberta
[<a href="#26">26</a>].

Pumpelly brome occurs on soils with pH 7.0 to 8.0 in north-central
Alaska.  These soils are wind-deposited from calcareous sediments [<a href="#32">32</a>].
It was grown successfully on silty loam soil with pH 6.2 near Palmer,
Alaska [<a href="#23">23</a>].

In the Rocky Mountains Pumpelly brome is abundant up to about 11,000
feet (3,353 m) elevation, depending on latitude and other conditions
[<a href="#15">15</a>].  In Banff National Park it occurs from 6,204 to 7,205 feet
(1,891-2,196 m).  It was found at 3,700 feet (1,128 m) in northwestern
Montana [<a href="#20">20</a>].  In east-central Alaska it was recorded at 2,297 feet (700
m) elevation [<a href="#10">10</a>], and in the Northwest Territories it was found at sea
level [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Pumpelly brome occurs on some recently disturbed sites, and is also
present in seral and undisturbed stands.  Pumpelly brome is occasionally
found in disturbed sites and on sandy banks in the Caribou Hills, near
Eskimo Lakes, and on the Arctic coast in the McKenzie River Delta region
of the northwestern Northwest Territories [<a href="#6">6</a>].

In the central Brooks Range, pumpelly brome did not appear 4 or 11 years
after disturbance on tundra alluvial fans.  It was present on undisturbed
sites [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
In Colorado Pumpelly brome seeds mature from August 10 to September 10
at higher elevations and somewhat earlier at lower elevations [<a href="#12">12</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Since Pumpelly brome can reproduce vegetatively [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>], it probably
sprouts from rhizomes after aerial portions are burned.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
