<b>COMMON NAMES : </b>
   tussock sedge


<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name for tussock sedge is Carex
stricta Lam. (Cyperaceae) [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Some authorities recognize the variety
C. stricta var. strictior Dewey [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>], but Standley [<a href="#24">24</a>] contends that
C. stricta presents no evidence of any discontinuities that would enable
recognition of intraspecific taxa.

Tussock sedge hybridizes with many other Carex species [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Tussock sedge is a moist-site species [<a href="#19">19</a>].  It is often dominant in
meadows in New England and the upper Midwest [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Tussock sedge also
occurs in moist forest communities [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].

Common associates of tussock sedge include blueberries (Vaccinium spp.),
huckleberries (Gaylussacia spp.), common winterberry (Ilex verticillata)
bog rush (Juncus effusus), bog Labrador tea (Ledum groenlandicum),
Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii
var. gerardii), bluejoint reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis), and other
sedges (Carex spp.)  [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carex stricta
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Tussock sedge is a rhizomatous sedge reaching a height of about 3 feet
(1 m) [<a href="#16">16</a>].  The long narrow leaves are 0.25 inches (0.6 cm) wide and
about 2.5 feet (75 cm) long [<a href="#19">19</a>].  The wirelike rhizomes are usually
found in the top 6 inches (15 cm) of the soil and are variable in length
[<a href="#5">5</a>].  The fruit is an achene [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Tussock sedge regenerates primarily through rhizomes.  Two types of
rhizomes are distinguished.  Long rhizomes branch and produce distant
plants.  Short rhizomes produce culms just offset from the parent [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Propagation:  Propagation tests for tussock sedge in Wisconsin showed
variable results.  Seeds collected and planted within 2 weeks in 1988
were compared with seeds collected in 1987 and held in cold storage for
1 year.  Germination rates for seeds collected and planted in 1988
were 70 to 95 percent; 1-year-old seeds showed less than 15 percent
germination.  These results indicated that seeds should be planted while
still fresh, preferably within a week or two following harvest [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Tussock sedge is found in bogs, wet meadows, floodplains, swales,
marshes, and wet woodlands. It is found in areas where the soil is at or
just above the water level [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Tussock segde is shade intolerant hydro-successional species in the
sedge meadow community [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  The sedge community is preceded by an
emergent marsh community of reeds (Phragmites spp.) and/or cattails (Typha
spp.)  where the water is above the soil.  The sedge community is
followed by a shrub communty of willows (Salix spp.), dogwoods (Cornus
spp.), and/or alders (Alnus spp.) as drier conditions are produced [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Depending on site, tussock sedge flowers from late May to mid-June.  The
fruit ripens in August [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carex stricta
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
The rhizomes of tussock sedge make it resistant to fires that burn
little of the soil organic layer.  Fire is important to the maintenance
of the sedge meadow community where tussock sedge grows [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>].  It is a
natural feature of this environment and prevents the encroachment of
shrubs and trees.  The wet habitat usually protects the roots and
rhizomes from fire.  During severe droughts or when the meadows have
been partially or completely drained, however, fire has serious effects.
Underlying peat beds may ignite and smolder for long periods of time
Such fires can destroy roots of most plants.  By lowering the meadow
surface and reducing plant cover, such fires may also convert a sedge
meadow to an emergent marsh community [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].

Tussock sedge probably colonizes burned areas by seeds and rhizomes.

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carex stricta
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fires that occur when meadows are moist or wet probably top-kill tussock
sedge.  The rhizomes are probably killed by severe fires that remove
most of the soil organic layer [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Tussock sedge is typically an increaser following fire.  In a study on
the effects of burning on sedge meadows in Wisconsin, tussock sedge was
found to occur at higher numbers on burned areas than on unburned areas
[<a href="#29">29</a>].  A spring fire was set in 1973 in Ontario to study the short-term
response of the shrub and herb layers.  Tussock sedge had already
emerged at the time of the fire.  Percent cover of tussock sedge was
similar in control and burned plots that summer.  Later-emerging
associated species, however, showed more vigorous postfire growth; the
initially lower cover of tussock sedge may have been due to fire damage
to early spring growth.  At postfire month 15, tussock sedge cover was
significantly (p=0.05) greater on burned plots than on unburned plots
[<a href="#23">23</a>].

<b>SEASON/SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION : </b>
Spring/Low


<b>STUDY LOCATION : </b>
The study was conducted at the Mullin Tract in West Luther Township,
Wellington County, Ontario.


<b>PREFIRE VEGETATIVE COMMUNITY : </b>
The prefire vegetation was dominated by an open stand of trembling aspen
(Populus tremuloides) (164 stems/ha, average d.b.h. 14 cm) with
red-osier dogwood (Cornus sericea) in the shrub layer.  The herb layer
was codominated by tussock sedge (Carex stricta) and bluejoint reedgrass
(Calamagrostis canadensis).


<b>TARGET SPECIES PHENOLOGICAL STATE : </b>
No specific information was given on the phenological state of tussock
sedge but it was probably in a preflowering condition during these
spring fires.  


<b>SITE DESCRIPTION : </b>
The site is at an elevation of 1,221 feet (470 m).  Mean total
precipitation is 35.4 inches per year (885 mm/yr), the average length of
the growing season is 116 days, and the July mean daily temperture is 70
degrees Fahrenheit (21 deg C).  The study was located on poorly drained,
organic muck soils approximately 1 foot (3 m) in depth.  The area had
generally low relief but consisted of a mosiac of hummocks and hollows,
the latter filled with standing water in the early spring.

Standard deviations are reported for wind speed, fuel combustion, and
reaction intensity data [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Fuel moisture content was "generally high" on the treatment plots in
both 1972 and 1973 and evidently tended to reduce fire intensity.  The
pattern of burning in both years was heterogeneous.  This was related to
the uneven microtopography and patchy distribution of fuel prior to the
fires.  Areas dominated by tussock sedge had large amounts of surface
litter and standing dead material and consequently were the most
thoroughly burned.


<b>FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES : </b>
Short-term postfire response of tussock sedge after light prescribed
surface fire in trembling aspen woodlands were as follows: 

               Percent abundance   Percent frequency
Burned 4/73          43.5                87.5
Burned 5/72          70.0                96.0
Control              54.0                83.5

Abundance of burned and control populations was not significantly
different (p=0.05) at postfire year 1.  Growth of the burned population
may have been affected by scorch or by increased competition from
bluejoint reedgrass.  Tussock sedge was substantially more abundant in
the plots measured 15 months following fire.
