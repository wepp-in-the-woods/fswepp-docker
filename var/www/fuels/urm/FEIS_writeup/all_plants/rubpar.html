<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of thimbleberry is Rubus
parviflorus Nutt. [<a href="#72">72</a>].  Many formerly recognized varieties are no
longer accepted by most taxonomists.  Varieties are as follows [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>]:

          R. p. var. parviflorus
          R. p. var. velutinus (Hook and Arn.) Greene

Hybrids between thimbleberry and red raspberry (R. idaeus) have been
reported, as have hybrids between thimbleberry and evergreen blackberry
(R. laciniatus) [<a href="#71">71</a>].  However, these hybrids are frequently sterile.

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Wildlife:  Thimbleberry provides food and cover for a variety of
wildlife species.

Browse:  In many areas, thimbleberry browse is reportedly of little
value to most ungulates [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>].  However, in parts of Oregon,
thimbleberry is considered one of the most important summer browse
species of the black-tailed deer [<a href="#61">61</a>].  In a western Oregon study, deer
ate foliage until leaf drop in autumn, but rarely fed on the twigs
during winter [<a href="#62">62</a>].  Where deer winter at elevations below the range of
thimbleberry, browse becomes unavailable [<a href="#62">62</a>].  Thimbleberry leaves,
stems, blossoms, and fruit made up 1.82 percent of the total
black-tailed deer browse in a western Washington study [<a href="#12">12</a>].  In parts
of the West, thimbleberry is regarded as an outstanding mule deer food
[<a href="#127">127</a>].  However, in some areas deer winter at elevations below the range
of thimbleberry, and browse becomes unavailable [<a href="#62">62</a>].  This shrub is an
important summer moose browse in parts of northwestern Wyoming [<a href="#106">106</a>].
Bighorn sheep feed on the foliage of many species within the Rubus genus
[<a href="#127">127</a>].  Summer elk utilization in the Selway River Drainage of Idaho was
reported as follows [<a href="#137">137</a>]:

June 1-July 15              20 percent
July 15-September 15        50 percent
September 15-October 15     30 percent

On particularly moist, sites thimbleberry foliage occasionally grows
beyond the reach of deer and other large ungulates [<a href="#61">61</a>].

Numerous small rodents eat limited quantities of bark [<a href="#24">24</a>].
Thimbleberry leaves may represent as much as 3 percent of the annual
diet of white-footed voles in parts of Oregon.  White-footed vole
utilization may be particularly heavy during the fall when thimbleberry
leaves may comprise up to 14 percent of the rodent's total diet [<a href="#132">132</a>].
The leaves of many species of Rubus provide food for rabbits and
mountain beaver [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>].  The porcupine and beaver occasionally consume
the twigs, buds, and cambium of Rubus [<a href="#127">127</a>].

Fruit:  Thimbleberry fruit represents an important dietary item for many
birds and mammals [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>].  Fruit is eaten by black and grizzly bears
[<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#138">138</a>], and numerous smaller mammals.  The coyote, common opossum,
Townsend chipmunk, raccoon, red fox, gray fox, pika, red squirrel,
golden-mantled ground squirrel, skunks, squirrels, and chipmunks also
eat the fruit of Rubus.  "Berries" of species within the Rubus genus are
eaten by many birds, including the ruffed grouse, blue grouse,
sharp-tailed grouse, ring-necked pheasant, California quail, greater
prairie chicken, gray (Hungarian) partridge, American robin, thrushes,
thrashers, towhees, northern bobwhite, gray catbird, band-tailed pigeon,
northern cardinal, yellow-breasted chat, pine grosbeak, and brown
thrasher [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>].

Livestock:  Thimbleberry is of relatively little value as livestock
forage [<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>].  It is occasionally eaten by domestic sheep,
particularly in the Southwest, but is rarely used by cattle [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability of thimbleberry browse to most large ungulates is
described as "fair" or "intermediate" [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>].  Palatability of
thimbleberry browse to elk in Idaho appears to be somewhat greater in
late summer than earlier in the season [<a href="#137">137</a>].

Thimbleberry fruit is highly palatable to many birds and mammals.
However, limited evidence suggests that palatability may vary
geographically [<a href="#130">130</a>].

The degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife species for
thimbleberry is rated as follows [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>]:

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Thimbleberry is rated as poor in energy and protein value [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Crude
protein value of the foliage varies both seasonally and annually.
Protein levels are generally highest during the spring and summer and
then decline markedly in winter [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>].  Specific values of foliage
protein taken from plants in Oregon Coast Ranges are documented below
[<a href="#108">108</a>]:

                         crude protein - percent

    date               grazed plots      ungrazed plots
    October              8.1                7.8
    March               22.5               25.2
    October              9.0                8.2

In Oregon seasonal protein values varied from 8.58 percent in June to
4.25 percent in December [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Thimbleberry provides important cover for a variety of wildlife species.
Dense thickets of thimbleberry form good nesting habitat for many small
birds [<a href="#18">18</a>].  During summer, deer frequently bed down during the hottest
part of the day in dense, cool stands of thimbleberry growing beneath a
red alder canopy [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  Coastal brushfields dominated by thimbleberry
or salmonberry serve as favorable habitat for small mammals, such as
deer mice, chipmunks, voles, shrews, hares, and mountain beaver [<a href="#67">67</a>].
Species within the Rubus genus provide cover for rabbits, red squirrel,
pika, black bear, and beaver [<a href="#127">127</a>].  Subalpine fir (Abies
lasiocarpa)/thimbleberry habitat types of the Southwest offer good
thermal protection for big game during the hot summer months [<a href="#35">35</a>].  The
degree to which thimbleberry provides environmental protection during
one or more seasons is rated as follows [<a href="#28">28</a>]:

                         UT       WY
Pronghorn               poor     poor

Small nongame birds     good     fair
Upland game birds       ----     fair
Waterfowl               poor     poor


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Thimbleberry reportedly has only low to moderate value in preventing
soil erosion [<a href="#28">28</a>], although it has shown good potential for revegetating
many types of disturbed sites.  It has the ability to form clumps which
expand greatly once established [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Thimbleberry has proven useful in
rehabilitation projects in Yosemite National Park, the coastal mountains
and foothills of California, and on roadcuts in the northern Rocky
Mountains of Idaho and Montana [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  This shrub exhibited good
survival (73 percent) as long as 4 years after plantings were made in
western Montana and northern Idaho [<a href="#68">68</a>].  Initial propagation is
reportedly more difficult than for other species within the Rubus genus
[<a href="#8">8</a>].  Seed may be difficult to obtain commercially [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Thimbleberry may be propagated vegetatively by planting stem cuttings or
rhizome fragments [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Best results have been obtained from starting
dormant rhizome segments [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Several cultivars are now commercially
available [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The fruits of thimbleberry are edible, although palatability tends to be
greater towards the eastern portion of this plant's range where rainfall
is greater [<a href="#130">130</a>].  "Berries" make excellent jelly but are too seedy for
jam [<a href="#128">128</a>].  Approximately 0.27 quart (250 ml) of fruit can be harvested
within 10 minutes [<a href="#87">87</a>].  Young shoots may be eaten as greens and leaves
have been used in making teas [<a href="#75">75</a>].

Thimbleberry was traditionally used by indigenous peoples throughout its
range.  The fruit was eaten fresh in summer and dried for winter use.
The bark was boiled and made into soap, and leaves were used to make a
medicinal tea.  Leaves were powdered and applied to burns to minimize
scarring [<a href="#55">55</a>].

Thimbleberry is occasionally planted as an ornamental because of its
attractive fragrant flowers and colorful fall foliage [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>].  Several
cultivars have been developed, including `Golden' and `Colonel' [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Timber harvest:  Thimbleberry often assumes prominence on recent
clearcuts in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests of the
Northwest [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>].  Thimbleberry can establish as early as the first
growing season after clearcutting [<a href="#139">139</a>].  In some areas it dominates the
understory within 5 years after logging and slash disposal [<a href="#96">96</a>].
Thimbleberry is also an initial increaser after logging in western
redcedar (Thuja plicata)-western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) forests of
northern Idaho [<a href="#100">100</a>,<a href="#135">135</a>] and in grand fir forests of northwestern
Montana [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Evidence suggests that thimbleberry is often most favored
by relatively severe treatments.  Cover is up to ten times greater on
plots with little overstory than on sites where the tree cover is 55
percent or more [<a href="#100">100</a>].  Species such as thimbleberry and salmonberry
compete vigorously with Douglas-fir, western hemock (Tsuga heterophylla)
and Sitka spruce seedlings in parts of the Northwest [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>],
and conifer regeneration may be significantly impaired in some areas.
Thimbleberry may compete with conifer seedlings for water during summer
dry periods in parts of British Columbia, [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Conifer regeneration:  Although competing with conifer seedlings in some
areas, light to moderate thimbleberry cover may also provide "safe"
microsites for developing seedlings on some disturbed sites [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>].
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii),
lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and grand fir regenerate well under
thimbleberry in grand fir/Rocky Mountain maple or grand fir/blue
huckleberry (Vaccinium membranaceum) habitat types of central Idaho
[<a href="#42">42</a>].  Natural regeneration of western larch (Larix occidentalis) is
generally good on sites with thimbleberry [<a href="#116">116</a>].

Chemical control:  Thimbleberry is reported to be moderately susceptible
to herbicides [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>].  Herbicides such as picloram + 2,4-D,
glyphosate, and 2,4,5-T have proven effective in controlling
thimbleberry [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>].  Late foliar application of 2,4,5-T
can be particularly useful in releasing Douglas-fir and Sitka spruce
(Picea sitchensis) seedlings [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Guidelines detailing the relative
effectiveness of various herbicides on thimbleberry and the proper
method of application are available [16,43,44,90,91,92,93,94,95,118,119,125].

Recreational impacts:  Thimbleberry reportedly exhibits relatively low
resistance to trampling in recreational use studies but has high short-
and long-term resilience [<a href="#14">14</a>].
 
Browsing:  Thimbleberry typically decreases in response to heavy domestic
sheep use [<a href="#101">101</a>].

Mechanical removal:  Thimbleberry generally resprouts rapidly following
mechanical removal and can attain pretreatment height and cover within
1 year after cutting [<a href="#15">15</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rubus parviflorus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Thimbleberry is a low, scrambling or erect, unarmed deciduous shrub
which grows from 1.6 to 8.2 feet (0.5-2.5 m) in height
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>].  The perennial stems are few, erect, and simple
[<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>].

The perennial stems, or canes, typically live for 2 to 3 years [<a href="#15">15</a>].
Sterile first-year stems, known as primocanes, develop from buds at or
below the ground surface and generally bear only leaves.  During the
second year, lateral branches, or floricanes, develop in the axils of
the primocanes produce flowers and fruit [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Growth is rapid under
favorable growing conditions.  Plants may reach heights of 6.6 to 8.2
feet (2 to 2.5 m) within 10 years.  Maximum rates of height growth often
occur during the second and third years after establishment [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Twigs are greenish and finely hairy [<a href="#128">128</a>].  Grayish bark becomes flaky
or shreddy with age [<a href="#103">103</a>].  Large, simple, palmately-lobed leaves are
green above but pale beneath [<a href="#133">133</a>].  Leaves are unequally serrate [<a href="#103">103</a>]
and turn brilliant orange to maroon in fall [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Showy white or,
rarely, pink flowers occur in clusters of two to seven [<a href="#133">133</a>].  Loosely
cymose, perfect flowers are borne in a flat-topped terminal panicle or
corymb [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].  The fruit of thimbleberry is made up of a "thimblelike"
aggregate of numerous hairy, red or scarlet drupelets [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>].
These drupelets are nearly dry at maturity and fall apart readily when
picked [<a href="#133">133</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Thimbleberry reproduces through seed but also regenerates vegetatively,
even in the absence of disturbance.  It is capable of forming dense
thickets through vegetative sprouting [<a href="#112">112</a>].  Establishment from seed
appears to be the primary mode of colonization in newly disturbed areas
[<a href="#15">15</a>].  Abundant seedling establishment typically occurs during the first
year after disturbance [<a href="#78">78</a>].

Vegetative regeneration:  Thimbleberry, a strongly rhizomatous shrub
[<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>], is also capable of vigorous sprouting from rootcrowns
[<a href="#105">105</a>] and roots [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>].  A single thimbleberry seedling can spread and
occupy a relatively large area as rhizomes develop and spread [<a href="#80">80</a>].
Most local expansion of this shrub is attributable to rhizome sprouting
[<a href="#123">123</a>].

Seed:  Most species within the genus Rubus produce good seed crops
nearly every year [<a href="#11">11</a>].  However, thimbleberry seed production can be
limited at higher elevations.  Thimbleberry fruits, or "berries," are
made up of an aggregate of numerous small red drupelets [<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>] which
fall to the ground when ripe [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Fruit is almost dry at maturity and
readily breaks apart when picked [<a href="#133">133</a>].  Seed averages 0.8 inches (2
mm) in length [<a href="#80">80</a>].

Germination:  Thimbleberry seeds have a hard, impermeable endocarp and
dormant embryo [<a href="#80">80</a>].  Consequently, germination is often slow [<a href="#105">105</a>].
Seed has exhibited moderate viability in germination tests, with maximum
germination estimated at 62 percent [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Specific germination
requirements have not been documented for thimbleberry, but both warm
and cold stratification are probably required [<a href="#105">105</a>].  Most Rubus seeds
require, as a minimum, warm stratification at 68 to 86 degrees F (20 to
30 degrees C) for 90 days, followed by cold stratification at 36 to 41
degrees F (2 to 5 degrees C) for an additional 90 days.  These
conditions are frequently encountered naturally as seeds mature in
summer and remain in the soil throughout the cold winter months.
Laboratory tests indicate that exposure to sulfuric acid solutions or
sodium hyperchlorite prior to cold stratification can enhance
germination [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Allelopathic compounds produced by bracken (Pteridium
aquilinum) can apparently inhibit germination and subsequent growth of
thimbleberry [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Seedbanking:  Thimbleberry seed is noted for its ability to remain
viable for long periods of time [<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>].  Seedbanking is believed to
represent an important postdisturbance regenerative strategy in this
species [<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>].  Kramer [<a href="#80">80</a>] observed buried thimbleberry seed
in 50 percent of all plots examined in several Douglas-fir and grand fir
habitat types of central Idaho.  Kramer and Johnson [<a href="#82">82</a>] observed
maximum seed densities of 17.6 per foot square (189/m sq) in central
Idaho.  Approximately 91 percent of the thimbleberry seed was found
buried at a depth of 0 to 2 inches (0-5 cm), with 9 percent at 2 to 4
inches (5-10 cm) [<a href="#82">82</a>].  Kramer [<a href="#80">80</a>] found that 22 percent of all seeds
were buried at depths of 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm).  Approximately 14
percent of all buried seed was viable, although the total number of
viable seeds from lower soil layers (2 to 4 inches [5-10 cm]) was less
than one half of that of the more shallowly buried seed [<a href="#80">80</a>].

Seed dispersal:  Thimbleberry seed is readily dispersed by birds and
mammals [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].  Groups of seedlings occasionally germinate from
rodent caches.  However, small mammals generally play only a local role
in thimbleberry seed dispersal [<a href="#98">98</a>].  Birds often effect wider dispersal
[<a href="#15">15</a>].  Gravity may also aid in seed dispersal [<a href="#105">105</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Thimbleberry occurs in a variety of moist-to-dry and wooded-to-open
sites [<a href="#64">64</a>].  It commonly grows on open, wooded hillsides, in subalpine
meadows, along streambanks and canyons, on borders, and roadsides, and
on dry exposed sites at higher elevations [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>].
Thimbleberry is often well represented in areas of snow creep, such as
in avalanche chutes or on steep slopes [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  It is particularly
common on cool moist sites and predominates on north aspects throughout
much of northern Idaho [<a href="#69">69</a>].  Thimbleberry frequently occurs as
scattered individuals, but in some areas occurs in dense contiguous
patches [<a href="#15">15</a>].

This moderately shade-tolerant shrub [<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>] is occasionally found at
low light levels but is typically most abundant at 60 to 100 percent of
full sunlight in Oregon forests [<a href="#116">116</a>].  In some areas, thimbleberry can
survive within the understory of forests receiving only 3.5 percent of
full sunlight [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Although it persists in closed stands, it is
typically most abundant on disturbed sites within the forest canopy,
such as cutover or windthrown areas [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].

Soil:  Species within the genus Rubus grow well on a variety of barren
infertile soil types [<a href="#11">11</a>].  These shrubs tolerate a wide range of soil
temperature and pH but do require adequate soil moisture for good growth
[<a href="#18">18</a>].  Thimbleberry grows well on dry, rocky soil and deep well-drained
loam [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  Growth of thimbleberry is reported as "good" on loam or
clay-loam, "fair-to-good" on sandy loams, but only "fair to poor" on
gravel, sand, or clay [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Thimbleberry grows well on soils derived
from a variety of parent materials [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Elevation:  Thimbleberry grows across a wide elevational gradient from
sea level to subalpine zones [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].  Generalized elevational ranges by
state are as follows [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>]:

            from 8,000 to 9,500 feet (2,438 to 2,896 m) in AZ 
               < 8,000 feet (2,438 m) in CA
            from 7,000 to 10,000 feet (2,134 to 3,048 m) in CO
                 3,500 to 8,000 feet (1,067 to 2,438 m) in MT
                 4,691 to 9,004 feet (1,435-2,745 m) in UT
                 6,700 to 7,900 feet (2,042-2,408 m) in WY


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Thimbleberry is a persistent seral species which frequently dominates
the understory during the first several decades after disturbance
[<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>].  It readily invades disturbed sites through rhizomes or
seedling establishment [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Thimbleberry quickly established on
mudflows and other harsh microsites after the eruption of Mount St.
Helens [<a href="#54">54</a>].  This shrub is an important seral species in many
cedar-hemlock, western hemlock, grand fir, Douglas-fir, redwood, and
other coniferous forests of the West [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#140">140</a>].  This shrub
generally occurs in greatest abundance in seral stands throughout its
range [<a href="#59">59</a>] but can persist in trace amounts in many climax forests
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#135">135</a>].  In many mature forest stands, thimbleberry may be
restricted to disturbed sites such as clearings or areas of windthrow
[<a href="#30">30</a>].  On certain disturbed sites perpetuated by snow creep,
thimbleberry is functionally both a pioneer and climax species [<a href="#29">29</a>].
Thimbleberry is a nitrogen-demanding species and in some areas, begins
to decline within 2 to 5 years after timber harvesting as soil nutrient
levels decrease [<a href="#79">79</a>].  Plant vigor and canopy cover generally decline as
tree cover increases [<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].

Douglas-fir:  Thimbleberry is an important seral species in Douglas-fir
forests of the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountain regions
[<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  During the first few years after disturbance, weedy
annual colonizers become dominant but are soon replaced by perennial
invaders such as thimbleberry [<a href="#51">51</a>].  This shrub reaches peak abundance
more than 10 years after disturbance in Douglas-fir forests of Oregon's
western Cascades [<a href="#52">52</a>].  However, it reportedly becomes dominant as soon
as 5 years after logging and slash disposal in northwestern Douglas-fir
forests [<a href="#96">96</a>] and assumes prominence during the first 3 years after
disturbance in northwestern Montana [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Grand fir:  Thimbleberry is also a major seral species in grand fir
habitat types of Idaho where it quickly increases following reduction of
the overstory [<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>].  This shrub remained dominant in grand
fir/pachistima (Pachistima myrsinites) stands which had been clearcut
and burned 12 years earlier [<a href="#139">139</a>].  In northern Idaho it is particularly
abundant after timber harvest on sites which were severely burned by
wildfires 40 to 60 years earlier and frequently persists for relatively
long periods of time.  Consequently, some researchers note that the
relative successional amplitude of thimbleberry in grand fir types of
northern Idaho is uncertain [<a href="#116">116</a>].  In some grand fir-Sitka
spruce-Douglas-fir forests of northern California, thimbleberry is
abundant 5 to 10 years after disturbance.  Thimbleberry is overtopped at
approximately 30 years in redwood (Sequoia sempervirens)-grand fir
forests but generally persists in reduced abundance [<a href="#140">140</a>].

Cedar-hemlock:  Thimbleberry occurs in cedar-hemlock communities from
newly disturbed sites to stands of 400 years or older [<a href="#47">47</a>] but is much
more prevalent in younger stands [<a href="#47">47</a>].  In cedar-hemlock forests of
northern Idaho, thimbleberry is an initial increaser after logging but
begins to decrease by approximately 25 years after disturbance [<a href="#135">135</a>].
It has reached maximum cover in western redcedar/queencup beadlily
(Clintonia uniflora) habitat types by 3 to 5 years after fire [<a href="#98">98</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Phenological development of thimbleberry varies according to elevation
and weather conditions [<a href="#15">15</a>].  It generally leafs out in mid to late
spring.  However, buds may become active by late February in parts of
Oregon and Washington [<a href="#119">119</a>].  Leaves begin to fall in late summer to
autumn [<a href="#114">114</a>].  Leaf fall may be early in dry years.  In Oregon, leaves
were shed by late August in particularly dry years [<a href="#61">61</a>].  Phenological
development of thimbleberry foliage in the northern Rocky Mountains is
detailed below [<a href="#114">114</a>]:

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Thimbleberry is resistant to and generally enhanced by fire [<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>].
In areas of rigorous fire suppression, thimbleberry fruit production and
plant vigor has declined [<a href="#87">87</a>].  This species is well-adapted to
vigorously invade many types of burned sites through rhizomes or seed
[<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>,<a href="#136">136</a>].  Rhizome sprouting is an important postfire strategy which
enables rapid reestablishment and spread [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>].  Thimbleberry,
a seed banker [<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>], also reestablishes through viable seed stored
in the soil or duff [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Birds and mammals add to seedling
establishment by transporting seed to the site [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].

Thimbleberry typically becomes abundant within the first few years after
fire and remains prominent during the early postfire decades
[<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>].  Hamilton and Yearsley [<a href="#57">57</a>] note that thimbleberry "may be
well-adapted to the high nutrient availability and low competition from
other species found immediately after burning, but is less successful
once other species have reestablished."  This fire-adapted species
typically declines as the overstory develops in postfire communities.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>

<pre>
<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rubus parviflorus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Thimbleberry is described as resistant to fire [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>].  Although often
top-killed, underground rhizomes generally survive.  High severity fires
which damage belowground regenerative structures may be most damaging to
rhizomes [<a href="#98">98</a>].  The aerial portions of relatively few plants actually
survive fire, except for those on unusual microsites [<a href="#52">52</a>].  Most seed
stored on-site is probably unharmed by fire.



<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Thimbleberry cover and vigor is generally enhanced by fire [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].

Vegetative response:  Thimbleberry is capable of rapid, vigorous
postfire spread through an extensive network of often deeply-buried
rhizomes [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>].  Sprouting through surviving rootcrowns is also
possible, although rhizome sprouting probably represents the primary
mode of postfire regeneration [<a href="#105">105</a>].  Multiple sprouts often replace the
single stems observed in preburn communities [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Limited evidence suggests that sprouting of rhizomes is favored by fires
of low intensity and severity [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>].  Hot fires presumably offer
greater potential for damaging underground regenerative structures.  In
western redcedar habitat types of northern Idaho, thimbleberry cover was
estimated at 10.9 percent 2 years after low severity fire.  However,
following a high severity fire, thimbleberry cover reached only 4.9
percent [<a href="#98">98</a>].

Seedling establishment:  Seed banking is an important postfire
regenerative strategy in thimbleberry, a prolific seed producer [<a href="#57">57</a>].
Birds and mammals also transport some viable seed to burned sites
[<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].  Some seedlings have been observed to germinate from rodent
caches present on-site [<a href="#99">99</a>].  Thimbleberry seed is stimulated by fire
[<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>] and subsequently germinates in great numbers [<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>].
Researchers have observed up to 7.5 times more seedlings on plots which
have been burned than on adjacent untreated plots [<a href="#120">120</a>].  Most seedling
establishment occurs immediately after fire [<a href="#57">57</a>].

Some researchers have suggested that fires of high severity and
intensity can expose mineral soil, which serves as a favorable seedbed
for thimbleberry [<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>].  However, Morgan and Neuenschwander [<a href="#99">99</a>]
observed greatest seedling establishment on low severity burns where
duff reduction was incomplete.  The capacity to regenerate through seed
may be reduced by extremely hot, duff-reducing burns [<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>].

Rate of postfire recovery:  Both sprouting [<a href="#56">56</a>] and seedling
establishment occur soon after fire.  Growth is rapid and some plants
occasionally bear fruit during the first postfire year [<a href="#22">22</a>].
Thimbleberry generally reaches greatest abundance during the first years
after fire and decreases as the overstory canopy closes [<a href="#57">57</a>].  Dwindling
soil nutrients may also contribute to its decline [<a href="#79">79</a>].  On coastal
sites in British Columbia, thimbleberry typically attains greatest
height growth during the first few years after fire and remains abundant
for approximately 5 years [<a href="#57">57</a>].  Rhizome sprouting may produce dense
cover up to 3 feet (1 m) tall within 3 years after disturbance on some
particularly moist sites [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Thimbleberry reportedly dominates the
understory of many Northwestern Douglas-fir forests within just five
years after logging and slash disposal [<a href="#96">96</a>].  In Douglas-fir forests of
western Montana, thimbleberry was well-represented on many sites during
the first 2 to 3 years after fire [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].  Maximum cover values have
been observed within three to 5 years after fire in western redcedar
habitat types of Idaho [<a href="#98">98</a>].  In many areas, this shrub remains widely
distributed during the first several decades after fire [<a href="#123">123</a>].  Dense
early growth of aggressive species such as fireweed can slow
thimbleberry establishment and growth [<a href="#121">121</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Rate of postfire recovery may be significantly related to fire severity
and intensity.  However, contradictory findings have been reported.
Hooker and Tisdale [<a href="#66">66</a>] observed rapid growth rates on severely burned
sites (0.25 inch/day [0.6 cm/day]) but slower growth on less severely
burned plots [<a href="#66">66</a>].  Slower growth may be expected where cover (and thus
increased intraspecific competition) is greatest, and these results do
not necessarily indicate that actual cover was greatest on these
severely burned plots.  Other research has suggested that thimbleberry
cover develops most rapidily after fires of low intensity [<a href="#15">15</a>].  

Some researchers suggest that, in general, rhizome sprouting may be
favored by fires of low intensity and severity, whereas seedling
establishment may be more effectively promoted by fires of relatively
high severity [<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>].  However, researchers in northern Idaho have
occasionally observed greater seedling establishment after fires of low
severity [<a href="#99">99</a>].  

Factors other than fire severity and intensity can also contribute to
the rate of postfire recovery.  Differences in the season of burn, plant
density and vigor in the preburn community, site differences, and
climatic factors all contribute to postfire recovery.  Fire severity and
intensity are not consistently defined in the literature, which
compounds the problems of interpreting plant response.  The rate of
postfire recovery is significantly related to climatic and topoedaphic
factors.  In coastal Oregon, 8,760 thimbleberry seedlings per acre
(21,382/ha) were present 1 year after fire on north aspects where 4,450
seedlings per acre (10,988/ha) had been observed prior to the fire.  On
south aspects, increases were even more dramatic, with 10,988 seedlings
per acre (24,640/ha) counted 1 year after fire where none had been
observed prior to the fire [<a href="#120">120</a>].

Mean frequency of thimbleberry by burn age and severity was documented
as follows after fire in a western redcedar/queencup beadlily habitat
type of northern Idaho [<a href="#98">98</a>]:

fire severity                      years

                        1     2     3     4     5     15
low                    83    80    80    59    56     98
high                   61    76    78    75    53    100   


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Timber harvest:  Thimbleberry typically increases dramatically after
timber harvest and subsequent slash burns [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].  In many areas, it
may provide formidable competition for regenerating conifer seedlings
[<a href="#57">57</a>].  Mueggler [<a href="#100">100</a>] reports that thimbleberry often assumes dominance
on broadcast burns in western redcedar and western hemlock habitat types
of northern Idaho [<a href="#100">100</a>].  Response may be rapid.  Maximum cover values
were reached within 5 years after fire in western hemlock and western
redcedar habitat types of northern Idaho [<a href="#122">122</a>].  This shrub can
establish as early as the first growing season after clearcutting and
broadcast burns in grand fir/pachistima habitat types of north-central
Idaho.  More serious disturbance may enhance the growth and recovery of
thimbleberry more than lighter disturbance.  In the Intermountain West,
Laursen [<a href="#86">86</a>] reported greater increases in ground cover in stands that
were clearcut and burned than in unburned shelterwood or selection cuts.
Maximum cover was typically reached within 20 to 25 years after
clearcutting and burning [<a href="#86">86</a>].  Thimbleberry commonly assumes importance
soon after timber harvest and slash burning in Douglas-fir forests of
the Oregon Cascades.  Frequency of occurrence by years after treatment
was documented as follows [<a href="#136">136</a>]:

site #                      1     4     5     (years)

  1                        15    32    36 
  2                         4    14    14

Wildlife:  Fire generally benefits animals that eat the fruits of Rubus
[<a href="#83">83</a>].
