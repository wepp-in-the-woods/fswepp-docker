<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name for curlleaf mountain-mahogany is
Cercocarpus ledifolius Nutt. [<a href="#20">20</a>].  It is a member of the rose family
(Rosaceae).  Kartesz [<a href="#29">29</a>] recognized the following three varieties:

	C. ledifolius var. intercedens Schneid.
	C. ledifolius var. intermontanus N. Holmgren
	C. ledifolius var. ledifolius Nutt.

Curlleaf mountain-mahogany hybridizes with true mountain-mahogany (C.
montanus) and littleleaf mountain-mahogany (C. intricatus) where their
ranges overlap [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Curlleaf mountain-mahogany occurs throughout the Rocky Mountains and
Intermountain West in shrub ecotones or mountain brush communities, in
open forests, on ridgetops, and on rock outcrops [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].
Curlleaf mountain-mahogany usually occurs in isolated, pure patches that
are often very dense.  In the Great Basin, curlleaf mountain-mahogany
may form a distinct belt on mountain slopes and ridgetops above
pinyon-juniper woodland [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].

In the Rocky Mountain Region, curlleaf mountain-mahogany is associated
with skunkbush sumac (Rhus trilobata), antelope bitterbrush (Purshia
tridentata), serviceberry (Amelanchier spp.), and western juniper
(Juniperus occidentalis) [<a href="#14">14</a>].  As a codominant member of the
sagebrush-forest ecotone in Idaho, curlleaf mountain mahogany is
associated with snowberry (Symphoricarpos spp.), mountain big sagebrush
(Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana), green rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus
viscidiflorus), bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata), Sandberg
bluegrass (Poa secunda), Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis), and Columbia
needlegrass (Stipa columbiana) [<a href="#47">47</a>].

Curlleaf mountain-mahogany occurs in mid-elevation forests that do not
develop dense canopies.  It is commonly associated with limber pine
(Pinus flexilis), lodgepole pine (P. contorta), ponderosa pine (P.
ponderosa), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Englemann spruce (Picea
engelmannii), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), and white fir (A.
concolor) [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>]; it may also occur with quaking aspen (Populus
tremuloides) and whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulus) above 9,000 feet in
the Great Basin [<a href="#33">33</a>].  In Utah curlleaf mountain-mahogany is associated
with maple (Acer spp.)-oak (Quercus spp.) woodlands [<a href="#5">5</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Curlleaf mountain-mahogany is good forage for all classes of browsing
animals in both summer and winter [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>]; it is one of the few
browse species that meets or exceeds the protein requirements for
wintering big game animals [<a href="#9">9</a>].

In mature stands, much of curlleaf mountain-mahogany foliage is out of
reach of browsing animals but provides excellent winter cover [<a href="#52">52</a>].

Deer mice in western Nevada consumed curlleaf mountain-mahogany seeds
[<a href="#15">15</a>].

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Curlleaf mountain-mahogany is highly nutritious and less seasonally
variable than its associates.  In southwest and central Montana, the
crude protein content of current annual growth averaged 10.5, 10.4, 9.5,
and 9.8 percent for spring, summer, fall, and winter, respectively [<a href="#14">14</a>].
Curlleaf mountain-mahogany in southeastern Oregon had a high calcium
content and intermediate phosphorous content; the ratio of calcium to
phosphorus ranged from 5:1 to 9:1.  Fiber content was low in mid-spring
and high in summer and fall.  Curlleaf mountain-mahogany retained a high
level of crude fat longer in the spring than its associates [<a href="#21">21</a>].



<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Curlleaf mountain-mahogany stands provide hiding and thermal cover for a
variety of wildlife species.  Cover values are as follows [<a href="#13">13</a>]:

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Curlleaf mountain-mahogany may be planted to help stabilize soil in
disturbed areas such as roadcuts and mine spoils [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  It was used
to revegetate roadcuts in northwestern Montana (out of its normal
range); established plants remained in good condition after 9 years
[<a href="#25">25</a>].

Curlleaf mountain-mahogany may be seeded to improve range [<a href="#54">54</a>], although
shrub seedlings may exhibit low seedling vigor and slow initial growth
rates [<a href="#40">40</a>].  It is particularly recommended for southwestern exposures
[<a href="#54">54</a>].



<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Because curlleaf mountain-mahogany wood burns slowly, it was the
preferred charcoal wood used for smelting ores in the nineteenth century
[<a href="#33">33</a>].  It is also highly prized as a barbecue fuel [<a href="#64">64</a>].

Because of its tolerance to heat and drought, curlleaf mountain-mahogany
can be used for water-efficient landscaping in arid environments [<a href="#19">19</a>].



<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Pruning curlleaf mountain-mahogany can increase available browse by over
200 percent for 5 years, sustain increased forage production for up to
20 years, encourage the establishment of new seedlings, and increase
understory vegetation [<a href="#59">59</a>].  On summer range in northern Utah, forage
production of plants that were pruned by less than 50 percent increased
and remained high for 13 years [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Thompson [<a href="#58">58</a>] recommended pruning
in spring or fall because late fall or winter pruning in Emory County,
Utah, resulted in complete loss of all pruned trees.  Pruning of trees
less than 12 feet tall, with stem diameters of 2 to 4 inches, yielded
the best results.  Large, mature trees were difficult to prune, had
fewer branches suitable for pruning, and often died as a result of
pruning.

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cercocarpus ledifolius
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Curlleaf mountain-mahogany is a native, xerophytic, evergreen shrub or
small tree growing up to 35 feet (10.6 m) tall and 3 feet (0.9 m) in
diameter [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].  The thick, tortuous, leaf-scarred branches [<a href="#37">37</a>]
arise from a short trunk [<a href="#33">33</a>] and form a round or umbrella-shaped crown
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Leaves are broadly elliptic to lanceolate, 0.48 to 1 inch
(12-25 mm) long, leathery, somewhat resinous, and curled under at the
margins [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].  Flowers are borne singly or in rows of three in
the leaf axils [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].  Achenes retain their long, plumose styles [<a href="#30">30</a>].

The roots of curlleaf mountain-mahogany play a key role in its ability
to inhabit water- and nutrient-deficient substrates.  Dealy [<a href="#66">66</a>]
suggested that a combination of initial rapid root growth and slow top
growth may help curlleaf mountain-mahogany outcompete its associates.
Average root growth rates of 24 seedlings in a growth chamber were as
follows:

	Average Root Extension		Number of Days
		
	13.6 inches (0.34 m)		      25
	23.2 inches (0.58 m)		      62
	30.4 inches (0.76 m)		      92
	39.2 inches (0.98 m)		     120

The six longest roots reached a mean depth of 3.7 feet (1.13 m).
Curlleaf mountain-mahogany is able to extend its taproot into cracks in
bedrock, tapping into otherwise unavailable water supplies [<a href="#26">26</a>].
Curlleaf mountain-mahogany roots form nodules in association with
nitrogen-fixing, filamentous bacteria which increase available soil
nitrogen [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  In the San Bernadino Mountains of California, the
soil in limber pine stands associated with curlleaf mountain-mahogany
contained higher nitrogen concentrations than soils beneath similar
stands lacking curlleaf mountain-mahogany [<a href="#35">35</a>].
     
Curlleaf mountain-mahogany can be extremely long-lived.  On western and
central Nevada sites, Schultz [<a href="#49">49</a>] discovered curlleaf mountain-mahogany
trees that were approximately 1,350 years old.  In Idaho curlleaf
mountain-mahogany plants at least 150 years old were found; older stems
had rotten cores which made accurate aging impossible [<a href="#47">47</a>].  The average
age of curlleaf mountain-mahogany on sites in southwestern and central
Montana was only 22 years but ranged from 5 to 85 years [<a href="#14">14</a>].



<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Curlleaf mountain-mahogany reproduces by seed.  Curlleaf
mountain-mahogany can grow vigorously after pruning, but its ability to
sprout after top-kill has been described as weak or non-existent in the
literature [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].

The minimum fruit-producing age of curlleaf mountain-mahogany is
approximately 15 years [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Seed production may be sporadic or cyclic.
Few seeds were found in central and southwest Montana curlleaf
mountain-mahogany stands in 1973, but seed production was high in 1974
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>].  Observations of two stands in central Oregon over 12 years
revealed only 3 years of high seed production [<a href="#66">66</a>].  High seed
production occurred in different years in the two stands and the seed
production of individual trees varied from year to year.  Wind-drifted
seeds occasionally piled up to 10 inches (25 cm) deep in rocky pockets
under and around the edges of curlleaf mountain-mahogany stands.

Curlleaf mountain-mahogany seeds are primarily wind dispersed [<a href="#52">52</a>].  The
pointed basal end of the achene and corkscrew-like tail enable it to
penetrate the ground [<a href="#30">30</a>].

Germination requirements for curlleaf mountain-mahogany are not well
understood.  Bradley and others [<a href="#4">4</a>] suggested that curlleaf
mountain-mahogany is dependent on fire because it needs mineral soil for
germination.  However, Schultz [<a href="#49">49</a>] encountered curlleaf
mountain-mahogany seedlings growing in deep plant litter under curlleaf
mountain-mahogany canopies.  Germination experiments on seed collected
in central Oregon indicated that stratification increased germination
[<a href="#66">66</a>].  Incubated seeds having no stratification did not germinate, but
stratification for 170 days at 4 deg C resulted in 98 percent
germination.  Experiments performed on seed collected from sites in
Utah, Idaho, and Nevada demonstrated that the chilling requirements for
curlleaf mountain-mahogany seeds are variable [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Curlleaf
mountain-mahogany seed may remain viable for a number of years; in Utah
seeds stored in an open, unheated, uncooled warehouse for 7 years
germinated at a rate of 76 percent [<a href="#55">55</a>].

Curlleaf mountain-mahogany seedlings are sensitive to drought, frost,
and browsing [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  First-year seedling survival in a curlleaf
mountain-mahogany stand in north-central Idaho averaged only 29 percent
in the very dry summer of 1968.  Winter mortality was also high; the
average survival of seedlings protected from all browsing was 50
percent.  For seedlings protected from big game and rabbits, survival
was 45 percent.  For completely unprotected seedlings, survival was 25
percent [<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Curlleaf mountain-mahogany grows on shallow to moderately deep soil at
middle to high elevations on gentle to steep slopes, rock outcrops, and
ridges.  Curlleaf mountain-mahogany commonly occurs on dry, rocky, sandy
soils [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>], although it sometimes occurs on clay or loam
soils [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Elevational ranges for curlleaf mountain-mahogany vary
from 2,013 to 4,528 feet (610-1,372 m) in the northern and northwestern
parts of its range to 9,900 feet (3,000 m) or higher in Arizona,
southern Utah, Nevada, and east-central California [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].

Precipitation and growing season information for curlleaf
mountain-mahogany stands in Nevada is available.  At Great Basin
National Park in east-central Nevada, annual precipitation is evenly
distributed throughout the year and averages 13.2 inches (330 mm).
Average yearly minimum and maximum temperatures are 17.96 degrees
Fahrenheit (-7.8 deg C) and 85.46 degrees Fahrenheit (29.7 deg C),
respectively [<a href="#26">26</a>].  In the Humboldt National Forest, northeastern
Nevada, the growing period is 49 days.  The mean annual soil temperature
is 42.8 degrees Fahrenheit (6 deg C) [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Curlleaf mountain-mahogany is somewhat shade tolerant.  It is able to
grow in open coniferous forests; however, it occurs most often and grows
most vigorously on sites without forest canopy.  Seedlings establish
under the canopies of mature curlleaf mountain-mahogany, but canopy gaps
are necessary for long-term survival.

The successional role of curlleaf mountain-mahogany varies with
community type.  Mountain brush communities in which curlleaf
mountain-mahogany is either dominant or codominant are generally stable
[<a href="#7">7</a>].  Changes in relative abundance of codominant species may occur;
however, succession rates are extremely slow because vegetation changes
depend on soil development which is also slow [<a href="#10">10</a>].  In coniferous
forests and mesic mountain brush communities adjacent to forests,
curlleaf mountain-mahogany is a seral species.  Barring major
disturbance such as fire, mature conifer stands develop and eventually
shade out most curlleaf mountain-mahogany [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].

In western and central Nevada communities in which curlleaf mountain
mahogany occurs, large-scale disturbance was infrequent in presettlement
times.  However, evidence of small-scale disturbance from
lightning, low-severity fire, insects, wind, and snow is abundant.
Small disturbances often create canopy gaps in dense stands of curlleaf
mountain-mahogany.  Gaps allow for the release of young curlleaf
mountain-mahogany [<a href="#49">49</a>].

In western and central Nevada, Schultz and others [<a href="#48">48</a>] observed
self-tolerance in curlleaf mountain-mahogany seedlings.  Seedlings may
establish under mature curlleaf mountain-mahogany where they remain as
suppressed individuals, often dominating the understory, until canopy
gaps release them.  Suppressed plants eventually die; they are probably
replaced by more seedlings.

In mountain brush communities dominated by curlleaf mountain-mahogany,
interspecific competition is minimal and curlleaf mountain-mahogany may
grow large [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Over time, however, intraspecific competition may
result in an overall reduction in the biomass production of the
community [<a href="#50">50</a>].  As a result of intraspecific competition, many curlleaf
mountain-mahogany communities are dominated by a few very large, mature
individuals.  Younger, smaller curlleaf mountain-mahogany may live as
understory plants for 100 years or more [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Annual growth in curlleaf mountain-mahogany stands in Montana begins
with formation of flower buds in April or May [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Flowering generally
occurs in May [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>] but may begin as early as April [<a href="#26">26</a>] and
sometimes extends into July [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Branch elongation and leaf production
occurred in May through July in eastern Nevada [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Seeds are
dispersed during late summer (July or August through September) [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

Curlleaf mountain-mahogany phenology at 4,700 feet (1,433 m) near Silver
Lake, Oregon, was described as follows [<a href="#21">21</a>]:

        Month           Growth Stage

        mid-April       few buds
        early May       many buds
        mid-May         anthesis
        late June       early milk (seeds are soft and immature)
        early July      dough (seeds have a dough-like consistency)
        mid-July        dough
        mid-August      mature seed

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cercocarpus ledifolius

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Curlleaf mountain-mahogany may depend on fire to reduce conifer
competition and produce favorable soil conditions for seedling
establishment [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].  However, individual curlleaf mountain-mahogany are
severely damaged by fire [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Because many dead branches persist
in the crown [<a href="#14">14</a>] and leaves are slightly resinous, curlleaf
mountain-mahogany is probably very flammable.  Curlleaf
mountain-mahogany is occasionally a weak sprouter after fire [<a href="#8">8</a>].

The presettlement fire regime of curlleaf mountain-mahogany communities
probably varied with community type and structure.  Arno and Wilson [<a href="#1">1</a>]
reported that the mean fire interval of curlleaf mountain-mahogany
stands along the Salmon River in Idaho ranged from 13 to 22 years until
the early 1900's, but lengthened considerably thereafter.  However,
Schultz [<a href="#49">49</a>] found large curlleaf mountain-mahogany up to 1,350 years
old in western and central Nevada, indicating that severe fire has been
infrequent in some curlleaf mountain-mahogany communities.  Schultz also
found fire scars on large, old-growth curlleaf mountain-mahogany in the
Shoshone Range of central Nevada that suggested understory fuels were
insufficient to carry severe fire.  Some old-growth curlleaf
mountain-mahogany avoid fire by growing on extremely rocky sites [<a href="#1">1</a>].

In northern California fire suppression has allowed curlleaf
mountain-mahogany to proliferate in formerly open coniferous forests
[<a href="#67">67</a>].  The presence of curlleaf mountain-mahogany and other shrub
species has reduced pine reproduction and increased fuel loadings.  When
fires do occur on these sites, they may be more severe than in
presettlement times.

<pre><center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cercocarpus ledifolius
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire usually kills curlleaf mountain-mahogany.  A wildfire occurred at
Moose Creek in the Salmon National Forest, Idaho, in August of 1979.
Curlleaf mountain-mahogany plants 40 to 80 years old growing on gentle
to moderate slopes near the origin of the fire (which burned with
"considerable" severity) were mostly killed.  Only lightly seared
curlleaf mountain-mahogany survived.  Intense heat alone may cause
mortality in curlleaf mountain-mahogany by searing green growth.
Mortality of curlleaf mountain-mahogany was determined in postfire year
1 [<a href="#8">8</a>]:

			        # tagged	# alive	        # sprouting

completely charred, 
crown burned		            11		    0		      0

totally seared, 
crown partially burned 	             9		    0		      0

totally seared, 
crown unburned  	            11		    1		      0

partially seared, 
crown and trunk unburned             9		    1		      0


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Curlleaf mountain-mahogany seedlings establish after fire, although
establishment may be slow.  A curlleaf mountain-mahogany stand near
MacKay, Idaho, had burned around 1900.  In 1968, it contained plants
ranging from 8 to 54 years of age [<a href="#47">47</a>].  A stand that burned in 1965
showed no signs of regeneration by 1968.  However, Collins [<a href="#8">8</a>] described
excellent seedling emergence in postfire year 1 of a 1979 wildfire in
the Salmon National Forest, possibly due to an unusually wet growing
season.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>



<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In Montana prescribed fire can improve curlleaf mountain-mahogany forage
in seral stands by killing conifers and promoting conditions conducive
to seedling establishment.  In most cases a fall prescribed fire of
several hundred acres is recommended [<a href="#18">18</a>].  However, burning is not
recommended for all curlleaf mountain-mahogany communities.  Young
vigorous stands, such as those that have regenerated since 1920, stands
surrounded by volatile fuels such as sagebrush, and stands where
curlleaf mountain-mahogany distribution is scattered (density of 0.5
plant per acre or less) are not candidates for prescribed burning to
improve forage production [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Fuel loadings for limber pine/curlleaf mountain-mahogany,
Douglas-fir/curlleaf mountain-mahogany, and mixed conifer communities in
eastern Idaho and western Wyoming are given [<a href="#4">4</a>].  A general fire
prescription for curlleaf mountain-mahogany range types in the Northwest
is described [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].
