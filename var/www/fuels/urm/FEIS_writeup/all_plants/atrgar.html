<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Atriplex gardneri
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Gardner's saltbush provides nutritious forage for livestock and wildlife
species throughout its range [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Antelope, mule deer, rabbits, and
mourning doves browse Gardner's saltbush [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Its persistent leaves
are an important winter food source.  It is particularly important for
sheep because it provides the minimum nutritional requirement for
maintenance of gestating ewes [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].



<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Gardner's saltbush is a generally palatable, year-round food source for
livestock and wildlife [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  In Utah, it is rated as fair in
palatability for cattle, pronghorn, mule deer, and small nongame birds,
good for sheep and small mammals, and poor for horses, elk, and
waterfowl [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Gardner's saltbush is rated fair in energy and protein values [<a href="#8">8</a>].
Crude protein, expressed as percentage of dry matter, averages 7.2 for
Gardner's saltbush [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Mineral content is as follows [<a href="#23">23</a>]:

Gardner's saltbush (irrigated)   0.19      0.12     1.03     1.41     8.46


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
In Utah, Gardner's saltbush provides poor cover for pronghorn, elk, mule
deer, and waterfowl, and fair cover for upland game birds, small nongame
birds, and small mammals [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Gardner's saltbush has an extensive, highly branched root system, and
tolerates poor site conditions.  It is used to stabilize soils and to
reclaim disturbed sites [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  It had one of the highest survival
rates of all shrubs planted on processed oil shale in the Uinta Basin of
Utah.  Processed oil shale is low in available phosphorous, nitrogen,
and potassium.  It was one of only two species to establish on coal mine
spoils in Wyoming [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Cover and biomass, by year, for the Wyoming
mine spoil plots are shown below [<a href="#31">31</a>]:

       Cover (%)             Biomass (%)        Biomass (g/m2)
      1976  1978             1977  1978          1977   1978
      <1.0   5.0              2.3  32.2           1.4   18.3

Direct seeding of Gardner's saltbush seed is usually unsuccessful due to
conditions required for germination.  Under laboratory conditions, seeds
required a combination of stratification, scarification, afterripening,
and washing to completely overcome dormancy [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Seedlings can be used
to revegetate a site.  Survival of transplanted Gardner's saltbush at
one Wyoming site was 100 percent [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Although overgrazing may reduce plant vigor, winter grazing of up to 35
percent of total plant biomass allows for maintenance of Gardner's
saltbush populations [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Halogeton (Halogeton glomeratus), a species
poisonous to livestock, is unable to invade moderately grazed Gardner's
saltbush sites [<a href="#10">10</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Atriplex gardneri
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Gardner's saltbush is a native, spreading, low-growing, evergreen,
perennial subshrub.  It grows from 8 to 20 inches (20-50 cm) in height
and has alternate leaves 0.5 to 2.2 inches (15-55 mm) long.  Herbaceous
flowering stems rise above the woody, decumbent portion of the plant
[<a href="#17">17</a>].  Plants are typically dioecious, although some monoecious
individuals also occur [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Roots of two-foot-tall (61 cm) plants near
Riverside, California, measured 3.5 to 4.5 feet (107-137 cm) deep, with a
lateral spread of 5 to 7 feet (152-213 cm) [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Polyploidy, which may afford drought tolerance, is common in Gardner's
saltbush.  Diploid forms are widespread in low-lying valleys, whereas
tetraploid populations more often occupy higher, steeper terrain [<a href="#32">32</a>].
Evidence suggests that the more drought-resistant tetraploids are
increasing at the expense of diploids.  Diploids and tetraploids are
very similar morphologically [<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte
   Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Gardner's saltbush regenerates from long-lived, wind-dispersed seed.
Most species of the genus Atriplex first bear seed at 2 to 4 years of
age.  The genus is characterized by wide annual fluctuations in seed
production [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Gardner's saltbush produces seed in abundance.  Seed
may remain on the plant for up to 2 years.

Gardner's saltbush undergoes an average afterripening period of 3 months
in order to overcome seed dormancy [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Under laboratory conditions, a
combination of stratification, scarification, washing, and dry
afterripening increased germination of Gardner's saltbush.  This
suggests that any combination of the above processes may help overcome
seed dormancy in the natural environment [<a href="#1">1</a>].  The percentage of filled
seed is highly variable, and may depend upon genetic factors.  In one
study, seed planted in spring or fall exhibited the best germination and
survival, with seedlings emerging in 6 to 20 days [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  

Gardner's saltbush reproduces vegetatively by layering and sprouting
from the root [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Gardner's saltbush is most common on saline, poorly developed, or clay
soils with a pH of 7.8 to 8.6.  Soils are typically low in available
phosphorous, nitrogen, and potassium [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Gardner's saltbush also
grows on sodic, silty, or sandy soils [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Sites are usually
harsh and arid, with widely fluctuating temperatures and high winds
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].
                    
Elevational range of Gardner's saltbush in Utah is from 4,300 to 6,500
feet (1,311-1,982 m) [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Gardner's saltbush is a climax indicator in several saltbush-greasewood
and saltbush-grassland plant communitites.  McKell and Goodin [<a href="#18">18</a>],
however, note that it is not a climax species on many desert rangelands.
It can be an abundant species during early secondary succession.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Gardner's saltbush begins annual growth in the spring.  The flowering
period extends from May through July, depending on ecotype and climatic
factors, with intermittent flowering after periods of heavy rain [<a href="#47">47</a>].
Foliage remains succulent even during the hot, dry summer months [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].
In Utah, seeds mature from September 10 through March 1 [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Seed
dispersal is variable, but typically begins in late fall and lasts until
the following April or May.  It is not unusual to find 1- and 2-year-old
fruits on some shrubs [<a href="#11">11</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Atriplex gardneri
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Most North American species of saltbush are highly tolerant of fire.  If
top-killed, they sprout prolifically.  Gardner's saltbush is a vigorous
root-sprouter [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Because it produces abundant, wind-dispersed seed,
it probably also establishes on burned sites from off-site seed.

Many Gardner's saltbush communities lack the fuels to carry fire [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Small shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Atriplex gardneri
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
The chemical composition of Gardner's saltbush renders it "fire
resistant", and it burns very slowly when ignited [<a href="#20">20</a>].  It is sometimes
top-killed by fire, however [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].



<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
Gardner's saltbush is described as fire resistant because it contains
high concentrations of minerals that increase char formation, but has
low concentrations of volatile, flammable compounds [<a href="#22">22</a>].  It is
characterized by an unusually high ash content and a low volatization
rate [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Ash content and volatization (Vol.) rates are as follows
[<a href="#23">23</a>]:

In California, the heat value of Gardner's saltbush ranged from 6,750 to
7,000 BTUs per pound, with foliage averaging 7,000 BTUs per pound [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Most Atriplex spp. sprout after fire, recovering fully within 2 to 3
years [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Vigorous root-sprouting has been well documented in a
number of native and cultivated strains of Gardner's saltbush [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Gardner's saltbush recovered quickly along railroad right-of-ways burned
repeatedly to reduce weeds [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Gardner's saltbush is known for its "fire-resistant" properties.  It has
been considered for planting on fuelbreaks in southern California [<a href="#23">23</a>].
