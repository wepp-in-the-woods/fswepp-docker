Stiped maple is widely distributed over the northeastern quarter of the
United States and adjacent southeastern Canada.  Its natural range
extends from Nova Scotia and the Gaspe Peninsula of Quebec west to
southern Ontario, Michigan, and eastern Minnesota; south to northeastern
Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, and in the Appalachian Mountains to
northern Georgia [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Striped maple is a common but minor understory forest component.  It
appears as an understory species in boreal mixed woodland, and in
spruce-fir and hardwood types in northern forest regions.

The most common understory associates of striped maple include
hobblebush (Viburnum alnifolium), Canada yew (Taxus canadensis),
mountain maple (Acer spicatum), oxalis (Oxalis spp.), eastern
hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), American hornbeam (Carpinus
caroliniana), serviceberry (Amelanchier spp.), hawthorn (Crataegus
spp.), and pawpaw (Asimina triloba) [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Acer pensylvanicum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
The wood of striped maple wood is porous and fine grained, and has
occasionally been used by cabinet makers for inlay material [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Striped maple is an important wildlife food.  It is one of the preferred
species for rabbits, and is frequently eaten by porcupines.  The leaves
and shoots are browsed by moose, white-tailed deer, and beavers [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].
Ruffed grouse consume the vegetative buds [<a href="#6">6</a>].  The nectar is an
important food source for honeybees [<a href="#1">1</a>].

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Striped maple is occasionally planted as an ornamental [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
When striped maple regeneration is abundant before cutting, it
frequently become the dominant species after cutting, excluding more
desirable species [<a href="#10">10</a>].  In northwest Pennsylvanis, when more than 30
percent of regeneration plots had more than eight striped maple
seedlings before clearcutting, this species became dominant after
cutting.  If the number of striped maple stems exceeds this percentage,
it is essential to reduce their numbers before cutting to encourage
regeneration of desirable hardwood species.  Striped maple can be
controlled with glyphosate applied with a mistblower at the rate of 1
lb/acre (1.12 kg/ha).  Best kill was achieved when applied from July 1
through September 1 [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Acer pensylvanicum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Striped maple is a native, deciduous, tall shrub or small tree.  It
reaches a maximum height of about 45 feet (13 m), but is usually smaller
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  It has a short, forked trunk divided into a few ascending,
arching branches, forming a broad but uneven, flat-topped to rounded
crown.  The branchlets are straight and slender [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].  Striped maple
is primarily dioecious; monoecy is rare.  The sex ratio is male-biased.
Hibbs [<a href="#9">9</a>] reported that 80 percent of a Massachusetts population was
male.  The fruit of striped maple is a two-winged sumara.  The root
system is shallow and wide-spreading [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction: Striped maple reproduces mostly by seed.  Seed
production varies from tree to tree; some trees produce as few as 10
seeds, whereas others produce several thousand.  Seed production begins
at about 10 years of age, and large seed crops are produced every year.
The seeds are wind dispersed [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].

A small proportion of striped maples undergo gender change.  The gender
of such trees may differ from year to year [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  In one year, in a
sample of trees taken in western Massachusetts, 27 of 243 trees changed
sex.  Most changes were from male to female [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Vegetative reproduction: Vegetative reproduction does not seem to play
an important part in the reproduction of striped maple.  Although it
reproduces by layering and basal sprouting, sampling of striped maple
populations showed that only 3 percent of the trees originated from
layering, and 8 percent by sprouting [<a href="#6">6</a>].  In general, vegetative
propagation seems to be a mechanism by which it survives suppression
rather than increases in number [<a href="#6">6</a>].



<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Striped maple is found on moist, acid soils in deep valleys and on cool,
moist, shaded, north-facing slopes.  In middle elevations and on mesic
sites in the Green Mountains of Vermont, it is found from 1,830 to 2,830
feet (550-830 m) in elevation.  It reaches best development below 2,430
feet (730 m) in elevation [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].



<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Striped maple is tolerant of deep shade but develops best under moderate
light [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Rapid shoot growth can occur under low light intensity,
but the growth is etiolated.  Under direct sunlight, striped maple is
succeeded by mountain maple.  It grows well in small forest openings and
under thinned overstorys that result in moderate understory lighting.
Because its maximum height growth is about 50 feet (15 m), it never
becomes a major component in the upper canopy of northern hardwood
forests.  It may, however, occupy forest openings for more than 100
years [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Striped maple flowers from May to June.  The fruits ripen in September
and October and are dispersed in October and November [<a href="#18">18</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Acer pensylvanicum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Striped maple is moderately resistant to low-severity fires.  In a study
of tree survival after low-severity surface fires in Great Smoky
Mountains National Park, striped maple showed a positive correlation of
bark thickness to tree diameter growth.  Equations relating bark
thickness, tree diameter, tree diameter growth rate, and fire survival
were given [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tall shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Crown residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Acer pensylvanicum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
No information was found in the literature concerning fire effects on
striped maple.  Crown fire that burns only the upper canopy of a
deciduous forest presumably has little effect on striped maple, because
it never reaches the upper canopy.  Crown fire can create partial
openings in a stand, ideal for striped maple recruitment [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Striped maple probably sprouts from the root crown after fire [<a href="#6">6</a>].
Information regarding postfire establishment of striped maple is lacking
in the literature.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
NO-ENTRY
