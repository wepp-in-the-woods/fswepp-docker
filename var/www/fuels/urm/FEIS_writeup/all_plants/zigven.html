<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Zigadenus venenosus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
The seeds, bulbs, leaves, and stems of deathcamas are poisonous to
livestock and wildlife, ranking in danger in the order listed [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].
Plants remain poisonous when dry [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Grassy deathcamas is the
more toxic of the two varieties [<a href="#3">3</a>].  This species is the most poisonous
within the death camasgenus, which is noted for the production of toxic
alkaloids [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Two pounds (0.9 kg) green weight of deathcamas per 100
pounds (45 kg) of animal weight is fatal.  Sheep are most frequently
poisoned because of their tendency to select forbs while grazing.  Fatal
poisonings are most common in lambs [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability of deathcamas is poor for all classes of livestock and
wildlife [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Deathcamas is rated as poor in energy and protein values [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The cover value of deathcamas in Utah is poor for upland game birds,
waterfowl, small nongame birds, and small mammals [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The Blackfeet Indians made a poultice from crushed deathcamas bulbs for
treating bruises and sprains [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Range:  Livestock losses can be reduced by following good management
practices:  (1) Keep animals off ranges infested with death camus until
adequate forage is available.  Deathcamas appears early in the spring,
when leaves are highly toxic and there is little other forage.  (2) Give
animals supplemental feed when necessary.  Well-fed animals will usually
graze an infested range without injesting deathcamas.  (3) Improve
range conditions by seeding with desirable grasses [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Deathcamas increases with overgrazing [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Control:  Plants may be pulled from wet ground when small areas are
infested.  If the ground is dry, the plant will break off at the stem,
leaving the bulb to eventually develop new leaves.  Larger areas can be
90 percent controlled by using a 3-pound acid equivalent of 2,4-D ester
per acre (3.4 kg/ha) in early spring, when the plant is in the three- to
six-leaf stage.  Chemical control is not effective after plants have
flowered [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].

Other:  Humans have been poisoned by injestion of deathcamas bulbs
after mistaking them for edible wild onion (Allium spp.), Mariposa lily
(Calochortus spp.), or wild hyacinth (Brodiaea spp.) bulbs [<a href="#17">17</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Zigadenus venenosus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Deathcamas is a native, perennial, cool-season forb.  It grows from 8
to 24 inches (20-61 cm) in height.  Leaves are grasslike, and usually
shorter than the flower stalk.  Flowers are borne on a terminal panicle.
The bulb, which is 0.5 to 1.5 inches (1.3-3.8 cm) in diameter, occurs
from 2 to 8 inches (5-20 cm) under ground.  Roots are short and sparse.
The small seeds are contained in three-celled pods [13,16,17,]


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Deathcamas reproduces by seed [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Information concerning
regeneration is sparse.  One source reports that seedling establishment
is poor in this species [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Deathcamas may require 2 to 3 years to
attain sexual maturity [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Asexual:  Deathcamas reproduces vegetatively by bulb offsets [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
The two varieties of deathcamas differ somewhat in their site
requirements and are discussed separately.

Grassy deathcamas:  This variety is found from 4,000 to 7,000 feet
(1,219-2,134 m) in elevation, in sandy- or gravelly-textured soils.  It
occurs in scattered stands in sagebrush (Artemesia spp.) and various
open woodland communities [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Meadow deathcamas:  This variety occurs from 1,400 to 8,000 feet
(427-2,438 m) in elevation.  It grows in sandy-, loamy-, or
clayey-textured soils which may contain gravelly or rocky components.
It occurs in a variety of sites including moist to wet meadows, dry
rocky hillsides, and on flats.  Best growth is attained on moist,
seeping sites [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Development of deathcamas varies with elevation and latitude.  The
following development was reported in western Montana at 7,100 feet
(2,164 m) [<a href="#15">15</a>]:

                     growth starts:  April - May                       
                     flowering begins:  June
                     flowering over:  June - July
                     plant dried:  June - August
                     seed dissemination:  August

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Zigadenus venenosus

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire top-kills deathcamas [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Fire research on this species is limited.  It is known, however, that
geophytic lilies such as deathcamas stop producing new leaves once the
flower stalk is formed in early spring.  Deathcamas, therefore, cannot
produce new growth at postfire year 1 except when fire occurs in very
early spring, before the flower stalk has developed.  Experiments
performed on a closely related species, foothill deathcamas (Zigadenus
paniculatus), showed that plants were unable to produce a second crop of
leaves following defoliation [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Deathcamus will emerge again at
postfire year 2, but flowering may be delayed until postfire year 3.
Zigadenus spp. seedling survival is enhanced following fire due to
reduced competition [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Peak population density is reached 2 to 5
years following fire, and then declines preburn density [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Repeated annual burning from mid-spring to mid-summer greatly reduces or
eliminates deathcamas populations.  Carbohydrates stored in the bulb
from the previous year are metabolized in early spring to produce new
leaves.  Because yearly burning destroys the photosynthetic surface
responsible for new carbohydrate production, the plant may have
insufficient carbohydrate stores for next year's growth.  The result is
plant death [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Fire at other seasons probably has little effect on
deathcamas.
