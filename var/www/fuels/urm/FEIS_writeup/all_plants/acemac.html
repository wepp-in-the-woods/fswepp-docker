<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Acer macrophyllum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Bigleaf maple occurs in the Pacific Coast region from just south of the
Alaska Panhandle in British Columbia south through the western portions
of Washington and Oregon to southern California [<a href="#20">20</a>].  It is generally
restricted to the west side of the Sierra Nevada-Cascade crest [<a href="#28">28</a>].
Bigleaf maple's northern distribution is apparently restricted by cold
temperatures.  Its southern and interior distribution seems restricted
by insufficient moisture and humidity [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  At the southern end of
its range, bigleaf maple is usually restricted to canyons or riparian
habitats [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Bigleaf maple occasionally forms pure stands on moist soils near
streams, but trees are generally found in riparian hardwood forests or
scattered under or within relatively open canopies of conifers, mixed
evergreens, or oaks (Quercus spp.).

Bigleaf maple most often occurs in

        - Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis)-western hemlock (Tsuga
          heterophylla) old growth forests of the Olympic rain forest
          [<a href="#21">21</a>]

        - Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), grand fir (Abies
          grandis), or redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) forests

        - Mixed evergreen forests dominated by Douglas-fir, tanoak
          (Lithocarpus densiflora), Pacific madrone (Arbutus
          menziesii), chinkapin (Castanopsis chrysophylla),
          coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), Californi live oak
          (Q. chrysolepis), Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), sugar pine 
          (P. lambertiana), or ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa) [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>]

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Acer macrophyllum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Bigleaf maple is the only commercially important maple of the Pacific
Coast region.  The wood is used primarily for making veneer for
furniture, but may also be used for making musical instruments, interior
paneling, and other products where a hardwood is preferred [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  The
heartwood is light, reddish brown, fine grained, moderately heavy, and
moderately hard and strong [<a href="#3">3</a>].

In California, many land managers consider bigleaf maple of low value,
and it is often knocked over intentionally but not harvested during
logging operations in Douglas-fir and redwood stands [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Although the leaves of mature bigleaf maple trees are mostly out of
reach of browsing animals, leaves on young plants that are within reach
are readily eaten by cattle and horses and to a lesser extent by sheep
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  Seedlings and saplings provide important browse for
black-tailed deer and mule deer and in some areas for elk [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].  A
western Oregon study found that 60 percent of bigleaf maple seedlings
over 10 inches (25 cm) tall had been browsed by deer, most several times
[<a href="#24">24</a>].

The seeds, buds, and flowers of bigleaf maple provide food for numerous
birds and small mammals including mice, woodrats, squirrels, chipmunks,
finches, and grosbeaks [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  Squirrels and chipmunks eat the seeds,
frequently caching them after removing the hull and wing [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Seeds
which hang on the tree during fall and winter provide nutritious food
for finches, grosbeaks, and the Douglas squirrel [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Seeds on the
ground and young seedlings are eaten by rodents.  Rodents eat the roots
or pull entire seedlings into burrows [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Numerous birds use maple
(Acer spp.) leaves and seed stalks for nest building [<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Bigleaf maple is browsed by deer during the summer months but is
virtually untouched once the leaves have fallen [<a href="#35">35</a>].

The palatability of bigleaf maple leaves and twigs for livestock and
wildlife species throughout its range is generally rated as follows
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>]:

cattle                  fair-good
horses                  fair-good
sheep                   poor-fair
black-tailed deer       fair-good
mule deer               fair-good


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>



<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Often occurring in riparian habitats, bigleaf maple contributes to the
structural diversity of riparian deciduous forests and provides cover
for many species of small mammals and perching birds [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Several
species of perching birds nest in bigleaf maple trees [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Bigleaf maple has been planted in California with other native trees,
shrubs, and herbs to revegetate disturbed sites along riparian areas
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  It is easily transplanted as bareroot material when
dormant.  Everett [<a href="#17">17</a>] details methods for growing seedlings for
transplanting.


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Bigleaf maple is a common shade tree in towns and pastures west of the
Cascades [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Native Americans used the bark for making rope and carved
bowls, utensils, and canoe paddles from the wood [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Although not
produced commercially, maple syrup can be made from the sap of bigleaf
maple.  It takes about 35 gallons of sap to produce 1 gallon of syrup
[<a href="#51">51</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In coastal Oregon, Washington, and California red alder and bigleaf
maple are the dominant vegetation on millions of acres of highly
productive forest land [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Although general references state that
bigleaf maple quickly "invades" logged areas [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>], research in the
Oregon Coast Range showed that bigleaf maple seedlings did not invade
clearcuts [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  However, following logging, bigleaf maple, whether
originating from sprouts or from seed, is a serious competitor with
Douglas-fir, especially on moist productive sites [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].

Established plants damaged or cut during logging operations quickly
sprout and produce wide-crowned multistemmed shrubs.  Sprouts grow
quickly and easily outgrow conifers.  Haeussler and Coates [<a href="#30">30</a>] report
that "no other individual of any plant species provides as much
competition to Douglas-fir as a single sprouted stump of bigleaf maple."
Bigleaf maple's large leaves produce a deep shade that does not allow
shade-intolerant species such as Douglas-fir to become established, and
the heavy leaf fall smothers young seedlings.

Cutting:  When cut, bigleaf maple sprouts grow back almost immediately
[<a href="#30">30</a>].
    
Herbicides:  Broadcast applications of most herbicides has proven
ineffective.  Broadcast spraying normally causes top-kill only, followed
by rapid sprouting [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Directed spot sprays or tree injections have
been more successful.  Glyphosate, triclopyr, dichlorprop, imazapyr, and
triclopyramine usually prevent sprouting when applied by these methods
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].

Mechanical removal:  Stumps uprooted by large crawler tractors and
backhoes produce minimal sprouts of low vigor [<a href="#30">30</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Acer macrophyllum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bigleaf maple is a long-lived deciduous tree exhibiting a high degree of
variation in size and form.  Trees in open habitats generally have
short, stout boles that support massive spreading limbs which form a
broad, rounded crown [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  Trees shaded under an overstory of
taller conifers generally have straight boles and narrow crowns [<a href="#37">37</a>].
Mature trees commonly attain heights of 50 to 70 feet (15-21 m) with 1.5
feet (0.5 m) diameter trunks and live to 150 to 300 years or more
[<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  In logged areas, plants commonly grow as multistemmed
individuals because numerous stems arise from the stump following
cutting.  The root system is shallow but wide spreading.

The bark of bigleaf maple retains moisture well, especially in coastal
environments where plants are often covered with mosses, liverworts, and
ferns [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  The leaves are the largest of all maples (Acer spp.).
They are generally 6 to 12 inches (15-30 cm) across and nearly as long,
shiny dark green above but paler below, and palmately divided into five
broad, coarsely toothed lobes [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  The greenish-yellow perfect or
staminate flowers are arranged in a raceme at the end of twigs.  The
fruit is a fused, double-winged samara.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (mesophanerophyte)
   Burned or Clipped State:  Chamaephyte
   Burned or Clipped State:  Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Bigleaf maple can reproduce both sexually and vegetatively but relies
primarily on sexual means of reproduction on undisturbed sites.  Its
reproductive strategy involves dispersing numerous seeds which germinate
on the forest floor, creating a bank of persistent seedlings.  Seedlings
remain in a stunted form until stand-opening disturbances create
conditions more favorable for rapid growth [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  

Seed production and dispersal:  Bigleaf maple begins to produce flowers
at about 10 years of age [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Trees growing in open habitats begin to
produce seed at an earlier age and produce larger quantities than trees
growing in shade [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Flowers are insect pollinated.  The heavy,
double-winged samaras are dispersed by the wind in late fall and early
winter [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Small mammals and birds may also disperse some seed.

Seed viability and germination:  Bigleaf maple seed remains viable for
only a few months.  Seeds normally germinate during the winter following
dispersal; those which do not germinate soon begin to decay [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Even
indoors, seed cannot be stored at room temperature or at cold
temperatures for even short periods of time [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Germination occurs on
both mineral and organic seedbeds.  Predation of seed by rodents can
significantly reduce germination.  In Douglas-fir forests in Oregon, 30
to 40 percent of seed protected from rodents emerged, but less than 2
percent of unprotected seed emerged [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Seedling development:  Moisture stress, light intensity, and predation
seem to be the primary causes of seedling mortality [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].
One-year-old seedlings in Oregon averaged 2.3 to 3 inches (6-8 cm) in
height [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Seedling growth under Douglas-fir overstories is slow; it
may take 10 years for seedlings to reach 10 inches (25 cm) in height
[<a href="#23">23</a>].  Young seedlings are susceptible to rodent, slug, and other
invertebrate predation.  Rodents clip the roots belowground or pull
entire seedlings into their burrows [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Bigleaf maple seedlings are
highly palatable to black-tailed deer, and intensive browsing frequently
retards seedling growth.  An Oregon study found that 90 percent of 15-
to 20-year-old seedlings had been browsed and suppressed to about 3 feet
(1 m) in height [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Studies in Oregon show that both recent germinants and older seedlings
are found in the understory of Douglas-fir forests.  However, seedlings
are not particularly shade tolerant and are significantly more abundant,
taller, and older in small forest openings than on adjacent sites under
a dense overstory [<a href="#52">52</a>].  Beneath undisturbed young conifer overstories
or under dense understory vegetation, seedlings rarely survive long, due
to low light levels.  In several different-aged Douglas-fir stands in
Oregon, few seedlings older than 15 years of age were found [<a href="#24">24</a>].
Seedlings that were older than 15 years were mostly found in stands that
had sustained windthrow 20 years earlier.  Seedlings readily germinated
in clearcuts, but an influx of herbaceous vegetation in subsequent years
dramatically diminished the light intensity reaching seedlings and
caused large die-offs.

Vegetative regeneration:  Bigleaf maple sprouts vigorously from the root
crown after it is top-killed or cut.  Haeussler and Coates [<a href="#30">30</a>] reported
that suppressed trees are extremely persistent and can die back and
resprout repeatedly under overmature conifer stands.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bigleaf maple has bimodal distribution along a moisture gradient.  It is
more abundant on sites occupying the moister and drier habitats than on
intermediate sites [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Although it is most common on moist sites,
stands also occur on xeric, sparsely vegetated talus slopes [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].
Dyrness and others [<a href="#16">16</a>] hypothesize that stands at these moisture
extremes tend to have open overstories and that bigleaf maple is only
able to survive under these somewhat open conditions.  Bigleaf maple's
shade tolerance is reported as low to moderate [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Research has shown
that bigleaf maple seedlings are able to establish themselves under
coniferous stands but will not survive more than a few years unless they
receive sufficient light [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Bigleaf maple most often grows where soils are moist [<a href="#20">20</a>].  It attains
its best development and sometimes forms pure stands on deep alluvial
soils near streams [<a href="#20">20</a>].  It is extremely flood tolerant [<a href="#39">39</a>] and often
persists in floodplain habitats.

On low elevation upland sites in Oregon and Washington, it occurs as
scattered trees in moist locations within relatively open canopied
Douglas-fir, western hemlock, western redcedar, grand fir, redwood, or
mixed-evergreen forests [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  In fact, it is one of the only
hardwood trees encountered commonly throughout low elevation Pacific
Northwest coniferous forests.

Because of higher rainfall and humidity and a short dry season, bigleaf
maple occurs over a broader range of sites in the western Cascades of
Oregon than in other parts of its range [<a href="#60">60</a>].  Here it is typically
mixed with conifers and may comprise up to 20 percent of stand basal
area [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].

At the southern portion of its range, in southern and central
California, bigleaf maple is usually riparian.  In the Sierra Nevada,
North Coast Ranges and Klamath Mountains of California, it is more
generally distributed and grows scattered on uplands within redwood,
Douglas-fir, and mixed-evergreen forests [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].

Soils:  Bigleaf maple is found on a variety of soils from deep and loamy
to shallow and rocky [<a href="#30">30</a>].

Common associates:  Common associates in the northern part of its range
are red alder, Douglas-fir, western redcedar, grand fir, western
hemlock, black cottonwood, Oregon white oak, vine maple (Acer
circinatum), Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia), and Oregon ash.  Common
associates in the southern part of its range include California-laurel
(Umbellularia californica), redwood, willows, Pacific madrone, white
alder, coast live oak, and California sycamore (Platanus racemosa) [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Elevation:  Upper elevational limits are as follows [<a href="#20">20</a>]:

    up to 1,000 feet (305 m) in coastal British Columbia
          1,500 feet (457 m) on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington 
          3,400 feet (1,036 m) in the central Coast Range, California
          5,500 feet (1,676 m) on west slope of the Sierra Nevada Mtns
          7,000 feet (2,134 m) in the southern Coast Range, California


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
The successional role of bigleaf maple in Pacific Northwest coniferous
forests is not clear.  It appears to be a seral species.  In the western
Cascades of Oregon, Hawk [<a href="#32">32</a>] found bigleaf maple to be more common in
early seral stages of Douglas-fir forests and attributed this to bigleaf
maple's inability to survive the dense shading which occurs in older
stands.  However, Bailey [<a href="#5">5</a>] observed that along the southern Oregon
coast, bigleaf maple was found under both dense and open canopy forests,
and in young, mature, and old growth forests.  Observations of bigleaf
maple occurrence over a wide range of forest conditions may possibly be
attributed to the fact that seedlings of bigleaf maple often establish
under overstories of conifers or other hardwoods.  However, they are not
particularly shade tolerant.  Seedling growth rates are very slow, and
seedlings can survive for only about 15 years, unless a disturbance
opens the overstory and allows better light penetration [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  An
Oregon coast study found that bigleaf maple seedlings were most abundant
in 40- to 80-year-old Douglas-fir stands [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Along low elevation streams and rivers, bigleaf maple often occurs in
hardwood forests which are maintained by flooding.  In the northern
Cascades, bigleaf maple, black cottonwood, and Douglas-fir are common
riparian dominants in areas disturbed by flooding during the past 50 to
80 years [<a href="#2">2</a>].  On the Olympic Peninsula of Washington, succession along
the Hoh River is dependent on the ages of four terrace levels formed
from the erosional activity of the river.  Bigleaf maple was found
primarily on the first (youngest) terrace, forming a 400-year-old Sitka
spruce-bigleaf maple-black cottonwood community which eventually gives
way to Sitka spruce-western hemlock forests [<a href="#19">19</a>].

In the interior valleys of Oregon, bigleaf maple and Douglas-fir are
considered late seral or climax and often follow Oregon white oak stands
[<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Flowering and leaf emergence occur simultaneously in late March or April
[<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  Fruit ripening generally occurs between September and October,
and seed is dispersed from October through January [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Leaf fall in
western Oregon is mostly completed by the third week in October [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].
An Oregon study found that about 90 percent of leaves fell within a few
weeks after the first frost [<a href="#13">13</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Acer macrophyllum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Bigleaf maple is well adapted to fire.  It sprouts prolifically from its
root crown following crown destruction by fire [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  On moist upland
sites in the Cascades, sprouting allows bigleaf maple to become a part
of the immediate postfire community when the conifer overstory is
removed or killed.  Its abundance on upland sites following fire seems
to change little, and it remains scattered [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Seedling establishment
on recently burned areas has not been reported, although it could
potentially invade burned sites via seed transported from off-site by
wind or birds and small mammals.  Fowells [<a href="#20">20</a>] reported that "In the
Oregon coast range and on the western slopes of the Cascades, [bigleaf
maple] frequently invades logged and burned areas, particularly in moist
locations."

Bigleaf maple often grows along streams and rivers where soils are moist
[<a href="#20">20</a>].  Trees in these habitats may escape fire or be subjected to fires
of lower intensity than those in adjacent uplands [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Stands of
bigleaf maple and red alder bordering streams of the Tillamook Burn of
Oregon were untouched by a severe fire in 1933 and survived light fires
in 1939 and 1945 [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Most fires top-kill bigleaf maple [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Severe fires which transfer
heat below the mineral soil surface damage maple root crowns and thus
prevent some plants from sprouting [<a href="#55">55</a>].  Following prescribed burning
in the western Cascades of Oregon, bigleaf maple was nearly eliminated
on severly burned plots but remained abundant in lightly burned areas
[<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Bigleaf maple survives fire by producing numerous root crown sprouts
[<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Reported annual sprout growth varies from 3.2 to 6.5 feet (1-2
m) [<a href="#50">50</a>] and 9.8 to 13.1 feet (3-4 m) [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Sprout development following
top-kill of bigleaf maple trees by fire in northern California is
summarized below [<a href="#50">50</a>]:

time since      height of tallest    crown diameter      sprouts/clump
fire            sprout in clump      of sprout clump    
                    (feet)               (feet)
                 Ave      Range       Ave     Range      Ave      Range

Second year      9.8    6.8-13.1      11.5   6.8-15.5     78      14-143
Third year      12.8    7.5-17.1      14.7  10.4-21.5     37       8-67

In this study, the number of living sprouts was reduced drastically
between the second and third growing season as weak sprouts died and
growth was concentrated on fewer stems.  Parent tree diameter was found
to be related to the number of sprouts per tree, with large diameter
trees producing the greatest number of sprouts per tree.
