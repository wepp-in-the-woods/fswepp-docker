<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Tridens muticus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Slim tridens is palatable and moderately nutritious.  It is eaten by all
classes of livestock, mule deer and other herbivores, and collared
peccary but is too scattered and low in abundance to be an important
forage species [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Seeds are a source of food for rodents
and birds [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Huston and others [<a href="#13">13</a>] reported the nutritional value of slim tridens as
follows:

    Ash                 7-12%
    Phosphorus          0.09-0.30%
    Protein             6-13%
    Digestible 
      organic matter    36-57% 

Fudge and Fraps reported similar levels for slim tridens (slender
triodia) [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In general, dryland range sites are easily degraded by overgrazing,
which decreases incidence of fire and allows woody species to invade
[<a href="#1">1</a>].  Steuter [<a href="#28">28</a>] reported that perennial grass production on sites
invaded by redberry juniper (Juniperus pinchotii) is less than half that
of sites that are controlled for shrub invasion.  McPherson and Wright
[<a href="#23">23</a>] reported an inverse relationship between pinyon (Pinus spp.) or
juniper (Juniperus spp.) and herb production (as pinyon or juniper cover
increases, herb production decreases), and that in closed-canopy stands,
junipers can exclude all herbaceous vegetation.  In a related study of
vegetative zonation around redberry juniper, slim tridens occurred at
least 3.4 feet (1 m) from the edge of the canopy [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Slim tridens is not usually a major component of grasslands but may
contribute up to 10 to 15 percent of the total production on some sites
[<a href="#20">20</a>].  Gehlbach [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>] and Blydenstein [<a href="#2">2</a>] reported that slim tridens
increased in importance on study sites where grazing was excluded, which
is in contrast to reports that slim tridens increases in response to
grazing [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  According to Leithead [<a href="#20">20</a>], abundance of slim
tridens indicates fair to poor range condition.

As a "warm-season", C4 grass, slim tridens has its highest rate of
carbohydrate storage during autumn; therefore defoliation in the fall
can contribute to winter-kill and cause loss of vigor during spring
regrowth.  It is recommended that pastures or ranges with an abundance
of such grasses be grazed during the winter and spring [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].

Slim tridens is not considered a management species due to its scattered
distribution and low importance value [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Tridens muticus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Slim tridens is a caespitose, stoloniferous, perennial grass, 8 to 30
inches (20-80 cm) tall.  The bunches are usually narrow, not more than 3
or 4 inches (7 or 10 cm) in diameter [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  It is considered a
warm-season grass and exhibits C4 photosynthesis, which is adaptive for
high temperatures and drought conditions [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Slim tridens perennates from a shallow rhizome.  Vegetative reproduction
occurs through production of stolons [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Slim tridens also reproduces
by seed.  Seed collected for restoration project seed mixes resulted in
a germination rate (without any attempt at stratification, etc.) of 19.8
percent after 14 days [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Slim tridens occurs on dry plains, gravelly slopes, canyons and rocky
hills up to 6,000 feet (1,829 m) [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  It is adapted to
well-drained, calcareous and rocky, sandy or clayey soils [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].
It tends to reach higher densities on the slightly wetter sites, such as
elevations between 4,220 and 5,200 feet (1,286 and 1,585 m) [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Common shrub associates not listed as SAF cover types include:
creosotebush (Larrea tridentata), wavyleaf oak (Quercus undulata), gray
oak (Q. grisea), one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma), lechuguilla
agave (Agave lechuguilla), smooth sotol (Dasylirion leiophyllum),
Opuntia spp., and catclaw mimosa (Mimosa biuncifera) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].

Other common associates (forbs and grasses) include:  skeleton goldeneye
(Viguiera stenoloba), hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsuta), sideoats grama
(B. curtipendula), threeawn (Aristida spp.), hairy tridens (Tridens
pilosum), and curly leaf muhly (Muhlenbergia setifolia) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

In a study of secondary succession on plots denuded by mechanical
disturbance, Gehlbach [<a href="#7">7</a>] listed slim tridens as dominant in undisturbed
plots.  It occurred on disturbed plots only after three growing seasons,
and it increased when cattle grazing was excluded from the site.
Conversely, other authors have listed it as an increaser on
cattle-grazed sites [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Slim tridens is a warm-season grass, beginning growth early in spring
(late March in New Mexico) and actively growing through the summer, but
with most growth in late spring.  Two periods of flowering occur:  from
April to May and then again September to October.  Seed heads are formed
3 to 5 weeks later [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Tridens muticus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Slim tridens perennates from rhizomes that are deep enough in the soil
to resist damage by all but the most extreme fires.  The types of
habitats in which it occurs are not usually subject to such extreme
fires because the fuel loading is usually low, and sparse grasses are
often the main carriers of fire [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Tridens muticus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
A moderately hot fire will kill the aboveground portions of slim
tridens, but survival of the rhizomes is usually good.  Extremely hot
fires will cause much more damage, especially among thin grasses not
well protected by the buildup of vegetative material [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Perennial grasses in general undergo rapid postfire recovery and are
usually improved as forage.  Three years after a wildfire, slim tridens
occurred in abundance with other grasses [<a href="#17">17</a>].  In a study to reduce
shrub cover on a site invaded by redberry juniper, slim tridens showed
no significant difference in cover value in the first two growing
seasons after the shrub layer was chained then burned [<a href="#28">28</a>].  In other
words, slim tridens was neither damaged nor improved by the fire.
