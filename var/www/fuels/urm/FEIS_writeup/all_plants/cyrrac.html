<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name for cyrilla is Cyrilla
racemiflora L. [<a href="#21">21</a>].  The species is divided into two recognized
varieties:  typical cyrilla, C. racemiflora L. var. racemiflora and
littleleaf cyrilla, C. racemiflora var. parvifolia Sarg.  The typical
variety has a wider distribution than littleleaf cyrilla and is easily
identified by its larger leaves [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  The name cyrilla is used to
refer to both varieties collectively.

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cyrilla racemiflora
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
The wood of cyrilla has little commercial value [<a href="#34">34</a>].  The only value
for this species is for fuelwood, for which there is no current demand
[<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Cyrilla is an important browse for white-tailed deer [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].
Utilization of cyrilla by white-tailed deer has been recorded as high as
40 percent in loblolly (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf pine (P. echinata)
communities [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Cyrilla browse is highly palatable to to white-tailed deer [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Cyrilla has a relatively high nutrient value.  Winter browse percent
nutrient content is as follows [<a href="#19">19</a>]:

                              N-free
protein     fat     fiber     extract     ash     phosphorus     calcium
4.99       4.64     20.64     52.73       2.00      0.04          0.56


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Cyrilla provides environmental protection for a variety of birds,
mammals, and aquatic wildlife in the Carolina Bays of the southeastern
United States [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Honey producers value cyrilla for the excellent honey that bees make
from its flowers.  Because of its attractive flowers, cyrilla is often
planted as an ornamental.  It can be propagated by seeds and cuttings [<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Cyrilla is highly tolerant of flooding [<a href="#30">30</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cyrilla racemiflora
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Cyrilla is a thicket-forming, tall, semievergreen shrub or small tree
growing to a height of 30 feet (9 m) [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  It typically has a
short trunk with spreading, irregular branches and a wide, even crown.
Its narrow, long, elliptical leaves are semipersistent, alternate, and
clustered at the twig tips.  The bark is thin and smooth.  The perfect
flowers are in narrow racemes near the tips of the twigs and open in the
spring before new leaves appear.  The fruit is a two-celled capsule with
two seeds in each capsule [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Cyrilla can reproduce sexually from seed, but most seeds do not
germinate.  Its primary mode of reproduction is by vegetative sprouting
from adventitious buds on the roots following disturbance [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Cyrilla is usually restricted to low elevation areas along streambanks,
river swamps, and bottomlands [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].  Cyrilla grows well where moisture
is abundant and fairly permanent [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].

Common tree associates of cyrilla include sweetbay (Magnolia
virginiana), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), sweetgum (Liquidambar
styraciflua), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), sassafras (Sassafras
albidum), loblolly-bay (Gordonia lasianthus), and red maple (Acer
rubrum).  Common understory associates include gallberry (Ilex glabra),
yaupon (I. vomitoria), southern bayberry (Myrica cerifera), zenobia
(Zenobia pulverulenta), swamp-bay (Persea borbonia var. pubescens), and
myrtle-leaved holly (I. myrtifolia) [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Cyrilla grows well under full sunlight and can survive under a closed
canopy [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Cyrilla is an early invader of disturbed sites.  It
eventually crowds out shade-intolerant species and becomes part of the
dominant overstory [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Cyrilla flowers appears from early May through July; the fruit ripens
from late August through early October [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cyrilla racemiflora
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fire does not usually invade the wetlands and lower slopes of the
floodplains because the soil duff layer is normally very damp.  When
fire does occur during dry periods, cyrilla will sprout from
adventitious buds on the roots or, less commonly, establish seedlings
from seed stored in the soil [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex

<pre>
<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cyrilla racemiflora
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire typically top-kills aboveground portions of cyrilla [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Survival
of shallow underground roots is most likely following light- to
moderate-severity fires which do not burn the peat moss [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Cyrilla will sprout from adventitious buds on the roots following fire
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Woody shrubs such as cyrilla are found in great abundance as
understories on moist sites and compete with pine for available light,
moisture, and seeding sites.  Periodic fires have been effective in
controlling cyrilla and other hardwoods [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Following two successive
burns in a 25-year-old slash pine plantation in Texas, 77 percent of 1
to 5 inch (2.5-12 cm) cyrilla were top-killed [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].
