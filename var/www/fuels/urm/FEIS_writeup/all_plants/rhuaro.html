<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Fragrant sumac has been described as dominant in a number of plant
communities.  It isw codominant with mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia
montana) in a Colorado habitat type.  Fragrant sumac also occurs as a
codominant with true mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus) in
mountain shrub communities in the Black Hills of South Dakota [<a href="#20">20</a>].
Fragrant sumac is included as a dominant or indicator in the following
publications:

Habitat types on selected parts of the Gunnison and Uncompahgre National
  Forests [<a href="#12">12</a>]

(Aristida longiseta), blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), cheatgrass
(Bromus tectorum), Arizonia fescue (Festuca arizonica), eastern redcedar
(Juniperus virginiana), bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata),
blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), and chinkapin oak (Quercus

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rhus aromatica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
The fruit of fragrant sumac is utilized by many species of small birds
and mammals.  Fruits of many species of sumac are consumed by robins,
Townsend solitaires, and chipmunks [<a href="#19">19</a>].  The foliage of most sumacs
(Rhus spp.) provide very little forage for domestic livestock.


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The fruit of fragrant sumac is palatable to many species of birds and
mammals.  However, the foliage is relatively unpalatable to most species
of wildlife and domestic livestock.


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Fragrant sumac, which frequently forms dense thickets, provides cover
for many species of birds and small mammals.  It offers good cover for
northern bobwhite in the Texas Panhandle [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Fragrant sumac has been used for rehabilitating disturbed sites.
'Konza,' a cultivar from Kansas, has been developed from the variety
serotina and has been successfully planted in some locations [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Properly treated seed can be planted at a depth of approximately 0.5
inch (13 mm) at a rate of 25 viable seeds per linear foot (Brinkman
1974).  Fragrant sumac can also be propagated from cuttings and
transplanted onto disturbed sites [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Fragrant sumac is planted as a ornamental and has been cultivated since
1759 [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rhus aromatica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Fragrant sumac is a variable, straggly to upright shrub which grows from
1.6 to 6.6 feet (0.5-2 m) in height.  The plant is so-named because it
emits a fragrant odor when bruised.  The slender ascending branches are
puberulent, glabrate, or densely pilose [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Leaflets grow in groups of
three [<a href="#1">1</a>], and are variable in shape, lobing, and margin [<a href="#8">8</a>].  They tend
to be smaller at the western edge of the range [<a href="#1">1</a>].

The nearly-sessile flowers are generally yellow to pale yellow in color
[<a href="#8">8</a>], and are borne in a terminal compound spike [<a href="#1">1</a>].  The fruit, which
turns red when ripe, is actually a small drupe approximately 0.2 to 0.3
inch (5-7 mm) in diameter.  Each fruit contains a single nutlet [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Fragrant sumac produces drupes, each containing a single nutlet, in
terminal clusters [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Seed dormancy is prevalent due to the presence
of a hard, impermeable seedcoat [<a href="#4">4</a>], and germination is poor unless
seeds are specially treated.  Various methods of pretreatment have been
tested including sulfuric acid, and hot water soaks, scarification, and
cold treatment.  Seeds treated with sulfuric acid in laboratory trials
responded as follows [<a href="#3">3</a>]:

                           Maximum % Germination
                 Untreated                  Sulfuric Acid Treatment
                     0%                              22%
                                       
Brinkman [<a href="#4">4</a>] reported good results when seeds were treated with acid and
then stratified at low temperatures.

                           Pregermination Treatment
     Scarification         Stratification          Time       Germination
       sulfuric            34-51 degrees F         30 -           60%
       acid-1 hr.          (1-11 degrees C)        90 days   
            
Pretreated sumac seeds generally begin germination within 10 to 20 days,
with germination complete in 30 days.  When fragrant sumac seed is
planted during the fall following scarification, no cold treatment is
necessary, but when seed is sown in the spring, stratification for 30 to
90 days is essential in ensuring germination [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Fragrant sumac can also be readily propagated from root cuttings [<a href="#4">4</a>],
and is known to sprout vigorously after fire [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Fragrant sumac commonly occurs along the forested eastern margins of the
central grasslands of North America [<a href="#14">14</a>], and under degraded conditions
on the margins of the Gulf Coast prairie [<a href="#15">15</a>].  It grows at a range of
sites including open rocky woodlands, valley bottoms, and lower rocky
slopes [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Fragrant sumac has been identified as a climax species in several plant
communities.  It quickly sprouts after fire or other disturbance, and is
common in a number of early seral communities.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Fragrant sumac typically flowers from March to May, with the flowers
developing before the leaves expand [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].  Fruit generally ripens in
July and August [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rhus aromatica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Most species of sumac are known to be very tolerant of fire [<a href="#5">5</a>], but
little specific information is available on fire adaptions of fragrant
sumac.  Although details are unavailable, this species reportedly
sprouts vigorously after fire in the southern Great Plains [<a href="#25">25</a>].
Recovery time as not been documented for fragrant sumac, but is rapid in
other species of sumac which sprout vigorously in response to fire.

Fragrant sumac may also re-establish a site through seed.  Evidence
suggests that some species of Rhus are effective "seedbankers," with
seed stored in the humus layer.  These seeds sprout when fire creates
conditions favorable for growth [<a href="#16">16</a>].  It is not known if fragrant sumac
is a seedbank species.

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rhus aromatica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Sumacs are generally very tolerant of fire.  Although documentation is
lacking, it appears that fragrant sumac is rarely killed by fire even when
aboveground vegetation is removed [<a href="#25">25</a>].  


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Fragrant sumac is reported to sprout vigorously after fire in the
southern Great Plains [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Jackson [<a href="#10">10</a>], however, found that the woody
cover of fragrant sumac was "permanently" thinned after an extremely hot
fire under drought conditions in the Texas Panhandle.

It appears that the primary mode of site reoccupation is through
sprouting.  However, some species of sumac have seedbanks stored in the
humus layer which sprout when the fire creates conditions favorable for
germination and growth [<a href="#16">16</a>].  More research is needed to determine if
this species of sumac "banks" seed.
