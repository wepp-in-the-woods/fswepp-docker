 The scientific name of whitebark pine is <i>Pinus albicaulis</i> Engelm.
(Pinaceae) [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>]. Whitebark pine is the only
stone pine (subgenus <i>Strobus</i>, section <i>Strobus</i>, subsection <i>Cembrae</i>)
native to North America [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>].


<p>Whitebark and limber pine (<i>P. flexilis</i>) have been crossed in the
laboratory, and putative hybrids between the 2 species have been identified on
the Rocky Mountain Front of Montana. Such entities are rare and
apparently infertile [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].</p>

Whitebark pine occurs in subalpine and timberline zones from west-central British
Columbia (55<sup>o</sup> N) east to west-central Alberta and south to central
Idaho, southwestern Wyoming, and southern California (36<sup>o</sup> N). Its distribution splits into 2 broad sections,
1 following the Coast and Cascade ranges and the Sierra Nevada, and the other
following the northern Rocky Mountains. Scattered populations occur between the
2 sections in Great Basin
regions of eastern Washington and Oregon and northern Nevada [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>].

Although its role in the plant community is changing 
(see <a href="management_considerations.html">Management Considerations</a>), 
whitebark pine historically dominated many of the upper subalpine plant
communities of the western United States. Whitebark pine was a major component of subalpine forests in the 
northern Rocky
Mountains, the northern Cascades, the Blue Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada. It
comprises 10 to 15% of total forest cover in the northern Rocky Mountains. It was a minor component of subalpine forests
in British Columbia and Alberta, and showed scattered occurrence on the Olympic
Peninsula, the southern Cascades and other ranges of southern Oregon and upper
northern California, and in northern Nevada [<a href="#17">17</a>].&nbsp;At high elevations, krummholz whitebark pine
communities merge into alpine vegetation. At
mid-elevation, whitebark pine communities merge into mixed-conifer forests
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].

<p>Several
other conifer species may share dominance with whitebark pine. At mid-elevation, whitebark pine throughout its range
is associated with lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i>) [<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#191">191</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>].
Whitebark pine is not commonly perceived as a mid-elevation species, but stand
reconstruction studies show that whitebark pine was an important historical component of mid-elevation forests.
On the Bitterroot National Forest of western Montana, whitebark pine dominated 14% of mid-elevation
(6,500-7,500 feet (1,950-2,250 m)) stands from the 1700s to 1900 [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>]. Where not
dominant, it was a common component of mid-elevation Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine
(<i>P. c.</i> var. <i>latifolia</i>) forest. By the time of the study
(1991), whitebark pine dominated none of the mid-elevation
study sites. At its lowest elevations throughout its range, whitebark pine overlaps with Douglas-fir
(<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>) [<a href="#200">200</a>]. In the coastal states, it associates with mountain hemlock (<i>Tsuga mertensiana</i>), with increasing
codominance of the 2 species to the south [<a href="#88">88</a>].
Subalpine fir (<i>Abies lasiocarpa</i>) and Engelmann spruce (<i>Picea
engelmannii</i>)
co-occur in northwestern states; subalpine fir is the most frequent codominant
where its range overlaps with that of whitebark pine [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#191">191</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>]. In the
Northwest, whitebark pine types between 6,600 and 7,800 feet (2,000-2,400 m) are often found
adjacent to alpine larch (<i>Larix </i><i>lyallii</i>) communities. The 2 species tend to be
complementary rather than competitive in distribution, with whitebark pine occupying dry south and west
aspects and alpine larch
restricted
to more mesic sites [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>].
Sadly, whitebark pine communities of the northern Cascades [<a href="#128">128</a>],
eastern Washington [<a href="#234">234</a>], Idaho, and Montana [<a href="#176">176</a>] are
often characterized as &quot;ghost forests&quot; of whitebark that have been dead for decades, with little regeneration
[<a href="#132">132</a>].</p>

<p>Washington: Whitebark pine communities in the Cascade Range are often mixed with or
adjacent to mountain big sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i> ssp. <i>vaseyana</i>) or mountain grassland communities. On some
sites, whitebark pine patches form &quot;islands&quot; within shrubland or grassland communities:
these mixed communities form highly diverse mosaics. At lower elevations (~ 6,230
feet (1,900 m)),
whitebark pine grades into subalpine fir, or sometimes (at ~ 5,720 feet), coast Douglas-fir
(<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> var. <i>menziesii</i>) communities. Depending on elevation, subalpine fir,
Engelmann spruce, lodgepole shore pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i> var. <i>contorta)</i>, and coast
Douglas-fir are common components of whitebark pine communities; subalpine fir
is the most common co-dominant. Shrubs typically show low cover; Oregon boxwood
(<i>Paxistima myrsinites</i>) is the only
constant shrub associate. The herb layer is often diverse.
Whitebark pine forms
fringe forests and woodlands at timberline. It is an important component of alpine
larch communities occurring below ~ 7,330 feet (2,230 m), and persists as krummholz
in
higher-elevation alpine larch communities&nbsp;[<a href="#128">128</a>].
In Mt. Rainier National Park, krummholz whitebark pine/common juniper (<i>Juniperus
communis</i>) forests
dominate high, rocky ridges above Yakima Park [<a href="#70">70</a>].</p>

<p>In eastern Washington and northern Idaho, whitebark pine is a seral component
of subalpine fir communities and dominates the highest peaks and ridges (&gt; 6,000 ft
(1,800 m)). Understory
cover is typically discontinuous on these high-elevation sites. Engelmann spruce,
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine, and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>
var. <i>glauca</i>) may associate,
especially on mid-elevation sites [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#234">234</a>].
Grouse whortleberry (<i>Vaccinium scoparium</i>) is the most widespread and constant dominant shrub in
whitebark pine communities throughout the Rocky Mountains [<a href="#17">17</a>]. Pinegrass (<i>Calamagrostis
rubescens</i>) is the most common and constant herb; smooth woodrush
(<i>Luzula hitchcockii</i>) and Drummond's
rush (<i>Juncus drummondii</i>) also occur in and sometimes dominate whitebark pine
understories [<a href="#234">234</a>]. Oregon boxwood and
common juniper are characteristic shrubs [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#234">234</a>].</p>

<p>Oregon: In the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon and Washington, whitebark
pine codominates with subalpine fir between 7,600 and 8,500 feet (2,300-2,550
m). Whitebark pine assumes increasing dominance with elevation; it is the only tree on the highest sites. Rocky Mountain lodgepole
pine, Engelmann spruce, and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir co-occur. Alpine larch assumes dominance on
cold, moist sites. Elk sedge (<i>Carex geyeri</i>) is usually
dominant on the ground layer; it is the most constant herb across sites [<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>]. In the Cascade Range yellow sedge (<i>C. pensylvanica</i>) and
Wheeler bluegrass (<i>Poa nervosa</i>) are dominant ground layer species [<a href="#17">17</a>].</p>

<p>Idaho: Limber pine, subalpine fir, and/or Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine
co-occur in whitebark pine communities. Elk sedge, Ross' sedge (<i>C. rossii</i>), or cushion plants such as
subalpine fleabane (<i>Erigeron peregrinus</i>) and rosy pussytoes (<i>Antennaria
rosea</i>) dominate the sparse understory
of high-elevation whitebark pine/barrengrounds [<a href="#191">191</a>]. On lower-elevation
sites (&lt; 9,000 feet (2,700 m)), grouse whortleberry, common juniper, pink
mountainheath (<i>Phyllodoce</i> <i>empetriformis)</i>,
Oregon boxwood, Idaho fescue (<i>Festuca idahoensis</i>), and/or smooth woodrush
are understory dominants [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#200">200</a>].</p>

<p>Wyoming: Whitebark pine occurs in the Absaroka, Teton, and Wind River ranges.
Best development of whitebark pine habitats occurs on the relatively dry
Wind River Range, where whitebark pine is at the edge of its distribution. Rocky
Mountain lodgepole pine is seral in this type. Rocky Mountain
Douglas-fir, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce occur occasionally, but rarely
reproduce well. Grouse whortleberry, heartleaf arnica (<i>Arnica cordifolia</i>), Ross' sedge, and
Wheeler's bluegrass (<i>Poa wheeleri</i>) are common dominant understory components;
common juniper and russet buffaloberry (<i>Shepherdia canadensis</i>) are occasional
dominants [<a href="#200">200</a>].</p>

<p>California: Pure or nearly pure whitebark pine
communities occur at treeline in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range. Western
hemlock typically codominates with whitebark pine in the Cascades and northern Sierra
Nevada but is
increasingly replaced by Sierra Nevada lodgepole pine (<i>P. c.</i>
var. <i>murrayana</i>) from the central Sierra
Nevada southward. In upper montane and subalpine forests (6,000-11,000
(1,830-3,350 m)), whitebark pine is common in mixed stands with Sierra Nevada
lodgepole pine, mountain hemlock, and/or foxtail pine (<i>P. balfouriana</i>)
[<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#138">138</a>,<a href="#188">188</a>].
At lower elevations (7,500 feet in the north and 9,000 feet in the south),
whitebark pine
merges with mixed Sierra Nevada lodgepole pine, red fir (<i>Abies magnifica</i>),
and/or Jeffrey pine (<i>P. jeffreyi</i>) forest. Krummholz whitebark pine
merges
into alpine fell-fields at high elevations (9,500-11,100 feet (2,900-3,4900 m), depending on
latitude) [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#208">208</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<p> In the Warner Mountains, whitebark pine co-occurs with Sierra Nevada
lodgepole pine, Washoe pine (<i>P. washoensis</i>), white
fir (<i>A. concolor</i>), and Jeffrey pine [<a href="#138">138</a>,<a href="#184">184</a>].</p>
<p>Klamath Mountain associates in whitebark pine/oceanspray (<i>Holodiscus
discolor</i>)
communities include mountain hemlock, Shasta red fir (<i>A. m.</i> var.<i> shastensis</i>), western white pine (<i>P. monticola</i>), Jeffrey pine, foxtail pine, and Sierra Nevada lodgepole
pine [<a href="#160">160</a>,<a href="#190">190</a>].</p>

<p>Nevada: Limber pine is the primary codominant [<a href="#17">17</a>]. Limber pine dominates the lower subalpine zone
(8,000-9,000 feet (2,400-2,700 m)) of the Ruby and Humboldt mountains, while whitebark pine
dominates vegetation in the upper subalpine zone (8,550 to 10,600 feet
(2,610-3,230 m)) [<a href="#127">127</a>]. In the Ruby Mountains, whitebark pine forms subalpine communities
with&nbsp;<br>
Great Basin bristlecone (<i>P.</i> <i>longaeva</i>) and limber pines; it is the only area where
the 3 <i>Strobus</i> species
overlap [<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>].</p>

<p>Due to inaccessibility and previously low interest in managing whitebark pine
types, whitebark pine communities are not well described compared to other subalpine types. There is
agreement in the literature that whitebark pine understories are diverse, and more whitebark pine types exist than have been
classified [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#200">200</a>,<a href="#201">201</a>].
Accurate descriptions of whitebark pine communities are further confounded by loss of the
overstory dominant to insects and disease, moving successional pathways onto new
trajectories. The following classifications present preliminary descriptions of whitebark pine
plant communities.</p>

Whitebark pine is a small to medium-sized native conifer. Tree height typically ranges from 40 to
60 feet (12-18 m) at maturity [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>], reaching 5 feet (1.5 m) in diameter
[<a href="#65">65</a>].&nbsp; The largest recorded specimen is in the Sawtooth National Recreation
Area of Idaho. It is 69 feet (21 m) tall with a 27.6-foot (8.4-m) circumference
and a 47-foot (14-m)
crown spread [<a href="#6">6</a>]. In pure, upper-subalpine stands, trees seldom
exceed 50 (15 m) feet in
height. Trees at the species' upper elevational limits grow in low shrub and krummholz
forms that
are <u>&lt;</u>  3 feet (1 m) tall [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#200">200</a>].&nbsp;Trees may have a
single-stemmed or a clumped, multi-stemmed habit [<a href="#234">234</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>].
Site differences and Clark's nutcracker seed-caching behavior may affect frequency of
clumping (see Regeneration Processes below). A survey of whitebark pine at 10,000 to 10,200 feet (3,000-3,100 m)
elevation on the
Inyo National Forest, California, showed that multi-stemmed forms were more
common: only 5.8% of sample trees were single-stemmed [<a href="#48">48</a>]. At 7,700 to 10,500 feet (2,300-3,200
m) on the Breccia
Cliffs of Wyoming, 53% of whitebark pine were single-stemmed [<a href="#117">117</a>].&nbsp;Several
to all stems in a clump may be genetically distinct individuals [<a href="#129">129</a>].<p> Bark thickness is
thin to moderate, seldom reaching over 0.4 inch (1
cm) [<a href="#22">22</a>]. Branches of mature trees are ascending [<a href="#90">90</a>]. Needles are in bundles of 5. They may reach 7 inches
(18 cm) in length, or as little as 1.5 inches (3.8 cm). Mature female cones are 1.6 to 3 inches (4-8 cm) long
[<a href="#65">65</a>]. They are located
mostly at the tops of the upswept branches and are readily recognizable from the
air, probably an adaptation to encourage seed foraging by Clark's nutcrackers.
The purple cast of mature cones may further aid Clark's nutcrackers in finding
ripe seed. Cone color is also the easiest way for humans to distinguish between
whitebark and the morphologically similar limber pine [<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>]. A
female whitebark pine cone contains an average of 75 seeds. Whitebark pine's wingless seeds
are large and heavy for <i>Pinus</i>  species: 7 to 10 mm in length and an
average mass of 72 mg (<u>+</u>
13 mg) per seed [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>].</p>

<p>Tree stocking in whitebark pine communities can be low [<a href="#111">111</a>], but whitebark
pine attains considerable cover on some sites. A stand on the Wenatchee National Forest of
Washington supported 143 to 358 whitebark pine/acre with 41-214 feet<sup>2</sup>/acre basal
area [<a href="#128">128</a>]. On the Okanogan National Forest of
Washington, mean overstory cover in a whitebark pine/pinegrass community was 27%
[<a href="#235">235</a>].
</p>

<p>Whitebark pines at high elevations often attain extreme age. Stands in the Wind
River Range, Wyoming, and Jasper National Park, Alberta, have been aged at <u>&gt;</u>
600 and 700 years, respectively [<a href="#135">135</a>,<a href="#200">200</a>]. The oldest
recorded specimen is on the Sawtooth National Forest of Idaho, over
1,270 years old [<a href="#174">174</a>].
</p>

<p>Whitebark pine is extremely wind firm. High-elevation trees on shallow,
undeveloped&nbsp; soils frequently endure near-hurricane-force winds [<a href="#33">33</a>].</p>

<a name="Breeding system"><b><font face="Bell MT">Breeding system:</font></b></a>
Most genetic diversity is
harbored within populations; between-population diversity is low in whitebark pine.
Gene flow is facilitated by wind dispersal of
pollen and bird
dispersal of seed [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>]. Probably due
to long-range movement of Clark's nutcrackers dispersing whitebark pine seeds over time, genetic diversity of 
whitebark pine is low compared to other North
American pine species [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].<p>On a fine scale, genetic structure of whitebark pine consists of clusters of
close relatives. As a consequence of Clark's nutcracker's habit of planting seeds
from a parent tree in the same cache, individuals within clusters often cross- or
self-pollinate. This results in inbreeding. Trees within clumps are usually&nbsp; related as half-siblings, full
siblings, or selfed. Neighboring clumps (probably planted by a different bird
and/or collected from a different parent tree) are not closely related to each
other [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#214">214</a>,<a href="#219">219</a>].
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed production:</b></font>     
Cone production requires 2 years, as is
typical for pines (<i>Pinus</i> spp.). Cones are 1st produced at 20 to 30 years
of age on good sites. Trees do not reach full cone production until 60 to
100 years of age on most
sites [<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>]. Peak cone production extends for another 250 years, then
gradually declines. Some 1,000-year-old trees still reproduce [<a href="#213">213</a>]<i>. </i> Cone
production is characterized by frequent years of small cone crops and less
frequent years of moderate to heavy crops [<a href="#105">105</a>]. In the Greater
Yellowstone area, moderate or large whitebark pine conecrop years occurred 2 or 3 times a
decade (1980-1990) [<a href="#164">164</a>].&nbsp;Best reproduction occurs when
day/night July temperatures are above 68/39 degrees Fahrenheit (20<sup>o</sup>/4<sup>o</sup> C), and there is no
summer water stress [<a href="#231">231</a>].</p>

<p><b>Factors limiting reproduction:</b> 
A number of agents reduce natural regeneration in whitebark pine. White
pine blister rust, fire exclusion, bark beetles, animals, and fungal
diseases reduce ability of mature trees to reproduce. White pine blister rust is the
greatest threat to whitebark pine
regeneration [<a href="#29">29</a>]. In blister rust-infected trees, branch die-off 1st occurs on the
ends of large, cone-producing branches. Although tree mortality may not occur
for decades, infected trees rapidly loose ability to produce seed [<a href="#17">17</a>]. By reducing
the gene pool, genetic consequence of white pine blister rust is inbreeding
depression (expression of maladaptive or lethal genes) [<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#237">237</a>]. However, other factors also contribute to poor
regeneration and decline 
(see  <a href="management_considerations.html#OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">Other
Management Considerations</a>). Using historical
stand reconstruction studies on the Bitterroot National Forest, Arno and others
[<a href="#18">18</a>] determined that whitebark pine dominated 14% of the landscape in 1900. By
the end of that century, combined effects of fire exclusion and white pine
blister rust had reduced whitebark pine to the point that whitebark pine&nbsp; longer
dominated any of the study sites. Remaining stands with cone-bearing
whitebark pine were one-half their former size. Mountain pine beetle epidemics can depress whitebark pine 

regeneration for decades by
killing mature, cone-bearing trees [<a href="#24">24</a>]. On the Sundance Burn in northern
Idaho, scant whitebark pine regeneration has been attributed to mountain pine beetle attacks
prior to large-scale wildfire coupled with blister rust damage to
whitebark pines on the burn's periphery [<a href="#216">216</a>].</p>

<p>Animal seed predation on whitebark pine seed is high. Except following good
conecrop years, whitebark pine seedling establishment is probably incidental due
to high rates of seed predation [<a href="#220">220</a>,<a href="#234">234</a>]. Even Clark's
nutcracker harvesting of whitebark pine seed, often presented as a classic example of
animal-plant
mutualism [<a href="#210">210</a>], may be detrimental on some sites. Although individual Clark's nutcrackers only
remove seeds that they plant themselves [<a href="#151">151</a>], researchers fear that in areas of
high blister rust infection, whitebark pine seed will become so rare that
Clark's nutcrackers will consume most of the seed they cache, leaving few seed
reserves for regeneration [<a href="#221">221</a>]. Clark's
nutcrackers were the most efficient harvesters of whitebark pine seed on the
Bridger-Teton National Forest of Wyoming, showing a 97% forage success rate
(measured as time spent harvesting/seeds collected).
Other
important predators that harvested directly from whitebark pine cones
included pine
grosbeaks (92% success rate), ravens (79%), red squirrels (60%), and chipmunks
(35%) [<a href="#90">90</a>]. Similarly, vertebrates harvested 100% of mature whitebark
pine seeds on the slopes of Batchelor Butte in
the Cascade Range of Oregon. Most successful seed collectors were Clark's nutcrackers, Douglas'
squirrels, least chipmunks, and golden-mantled ground squirrels, respectively
[<a href="#136">136</a>].&nbsp;Mammalian and bird seed predation reduced the amount of soil-cached seed significantly (p<u>&lt;</u>0.01) on the Gallatin
National Forest of Montana. Northern pocket gophers were the most important seed
predator [<a href="#151">151</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p>Little is known of insect cone predators and their possible effects on whitebark pine
regeneration. Further studies are needed in this area. Anderton and Jenkins [<a href="#8">8</a>]
have documented whitebark pine seed predation by seed bugs (<i>Leptoglossus
occidentalis</i>) and larch cone flies (<i>Strobilomyia macalpinei</i>) on the
Bitterroot National Forest, Montana. Insect damage ranged from 0.4 to 7.1%
of total seed crop in their study. A study across California, Oregon,
Washington, Idaho, and Montana found that seed bugs were the most serious insect
pest
(27% of total whitebark pine seedcrop destroyed), with fir coneworms (<i>Dioryctria abietivorella</i>)
damaging up to 13% of whitebark pine seeds [<a href="#105">105</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed dispersal:</b></font>   
Because cones are indehiscent, seed caching by
Clark's nutcrackers is the only important means of dispersal [<a href="#90">90</a>]. Clark's
nutcrackers break through the cone scales with their beaks to remove the seeds,
then bury the seeds in shallow caches for use as future food [<a href="#209">209</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>].
Whitebark pine seedbeds are, therefore, almost entirely the
choice of Clark's nutcrackers [<a href="#148">148</a>]. In good conecrop
years, the birds cache many more seeds than they recover for food [<a href="#210">210</a>]. Hutchins and
Lanner [<a href="#90">90</a>] estimated that 1 Clark's nutcracker
caches 98,000 seeds in a good conecrop year. Many unretrieved seeds
germinate and produce new trees [<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>].&nbsp;The birds
prefer burns and other
open, disturbed areas as cache sites, although they also select closed, shady sites
that are unfavorable for whitebark pine regeneration [<a href="#209">209</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>]. Norment [<a href="#172">172</a>]
found that Clark's nutcrackers are most abundant on small (0.1- to 2-ha),
disturbed patches or nonforested patches. Approximately 40% of caches on plots in the Sierra Nevada were on sites
favorable for whitebark pine regeneration [<a href="#210">210</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Germination:</b></font>    
Germination and the 1st
few weeks of&nbsp; seedling life may be the most critical stages of whitebark
pine's life history. Seedlings do not emerge until (a) embryonic development has
occurred and (b) the seedbed is moist [<a href="#218">218</a>]. Clark's nutcrackers often
cache whitebark pine seeds before they are fully ripe and developed [<a href="#119">119</a>].
Embryonic development continues after planting and requires stratification and
weathering of the seedcoat before germination occurs [<a href="#126">126</a>]. Germinants
typically emerge 2 or more years after caching, when embryos are mature and
seedbeds are moist long enough for seeds to fully imbibe (<u>&gt;</u> 4 days
under laboratory conditions) [<a href="#126">126</a>,<a href="#214">214</a>]. Some
germination occurs in fresh seed the 1st growing season after caching. Germination of 1st-year, mature seed
collected on the Bridge-Teton National Forest, Wyoming, ranged from 6.7 to 56.7%
[<a href="#90">90</a>]. Above-average precipitation may favor emergence. On the Gallatin
National Forest, seeds that were hand planted in 1988, a dry year, showed
reduced 1st-year emergence compared to seeds planted in 1989, a moist year. Emergence is best on burned or other mineral soils compared to
soils with litter [<a href="#151">151</a>]. Light-severity burns do not prepare as good a
seedbed as more severe burns [<a href="#151">151</a>,<a href="#230">230</a>]. Because they are
relatively free from competition, seedlings on burns have the best chance of
growing into mature trees [<a href="#149">149</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed banking:</b></font>   
Whitebark pine appears to be the only North American
pine (Pinaceae) with a seed bank. Due to seed caching by Clark's nutcrackers and
delayed seed germination, whitebark pine may show good seedling establishment even if the
previous year's cone crop was poor. Studies conducted after the 1988 fires on the Gallatin National
Forest and Yellowstone National Park found that germination
rates of&nbsp; natural regeneration were greatest 2 years after good cone crops.
Some seeds germinated the spring after Clark's nutcracker planting, while others
germinated in the 3rd (and last) year of the study. Synchronous germination
occurred in both seedling clusters and single germinants. As of 1995, mean
survivorship of seedling clusters <u>&gt;</u> 1 year of age was 25%. The role of
precipitation was unclear, but favorable precipitation was positively correlated&nbsp;
(r=0.935) with good
seedling establishment on the Yellowstone site [<a href="#214">214</a>]. Clark's nutcrackers have
been observed caching seed as far as 13 miles (22 km) from parent trees [<a href="#228">228</a>]. They sometimes relocate cached seed to new sites
[<a href="#90">90</a>], so
actual dispersal distances may be greater. Longer travel distances may translate
to fewer seedlings, however. Seedling density on the Sleeping Child Burn of
western Montana decreased significantly (p &gt; 0.05) as distance from seed
source increased [<a href="#205">205</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seedling establishment/growth:</b></font>  
 Due to delayed germination and Clark's nutcracker caching habits, good seedling
establishment requires many years. Clark's nutcrackers continue to cache seeds
on burns and other disturbed sites as long as sites remain open and soils are
bare. Burns where fire was exceptionally hot may not show good establishment for
several postfire decades [<a href="#11">11</a>]. For example, the Sleeping Child and Saddle
Mountain burns of western Montana 1st showed whitebark pine establishment&nbsp;
5 and 7 years after fire, respectively, with best establishment occurring 2 or
more years after favorable summer rains promoted cone production [<a href="#220">220</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p> Whitebark pine seedlings are generally considered hardy after their 1st few
weeks of life [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#214">214</a>]. Seedlings rapidly grow deep roots
and thick, drought-resistant stems [<a href="#41">41</a>], enabling whitebark pine
seedlings to better survive drought compared to their more sun-intolerant
conifer associates. Even so, droughty, coarse-textured soils may reduce whitebark pine
establishment. Light shade improves
seedling survivorship; however, McCaughey [<a href="#151">151</a>] found that heavy
shade increased drought-related seedling mortality on the Gallatin National
Forest. He suggested that&nbsp; in dry years, increased cover might intercept critical
precipitation. Shrub nurse plants may increase whitebark pine seedling
survivorship, but herbaceous species with abundant fibrous roots appear to inhibit
establishment. Based upon relative
species abundance, whitebark pine seedlings on the Sleeping Child and Saddle
Mountain burns were most frequently associated with grouse whortleberry, and seldom
associated with smooth woodrush and beargrass (<i>Xerophyllum tenax</i>)
[<a href="#205">205</a>,<a href="#220">220</a>].</p>

<p>Whitebark pine survivorship is generally considered best on burns [<a href="#151">151</a>];
however, given open conditions and mineral soil, seedlings may show good
survivorship on a variety of sites. In Yellowstone National Park, whitebark pine
seedlings showed best establishment on moist, moderately to severely burned
sites compared to moist, unburned sites and dry burned/unburned sites. On
the Gallatin National Forest, however, seedling establishment was similar on burned and
unburned sites with similar moisture regimes [<a href="#214">214</a>].</p>

<p>Most seedlings gain rapid root growth, acquiring top-growth more slowly.
First-year germinants on the Gallatin National Forest showed root lengths
ranging from 2 to 7.1 inches (5-18 cm) [<a href="#150">150</a>]. In Yosemite
National Park, mean top-growth rate of seedlings at 10,000 feet (3,050 m)
elevation was
0.9 inch (2.3 cm)/year, while seedlings at 10,810 (3,295 m) gained an average
0.7 inch (1.7 cm) per year [<a href="#210">210</a>].</p>

<p>A number of agents may damage or kill seedlings. Heat damage to unshaded
stem tissue is the common cause of death. Browsing animals also kill seedlings.
Northern pocket gophers cause highest mortality on whitebark pine seedlings on
the Gallatin National Forest, although browsing elk,
chipmunks, and birds - including Clark's nutcrackers - also consume seedlings
[<a href="#150">150</a>].
Tomback [<a href="#210">210</a>] found that 2 years after emergence, survivorship of natural
whitebark pine regeneration on 2 Sierra Nevada sites averaged 41 and 65% of 1st-year cohorts.</p>

<p> Most growth occurs
in mid-summer [<a href="#88">88</a>]. Growth on cold
sites may be very slow [<a href="#234">234</a>], taking as long as 17 years to produce a
5-inch-long (12-cm) branch [<a href="#203">203</a>]. Tree-ring data from the central
and southern Sierra Nevada show that best growth occurs following warm, wet
winters, and slowest growth occurs after cool, dry winters [<a href="#71">71</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Asexual regeneration:</font> </b> 
Whitebark pine reproduces by layering where
long-lasting snowloads bend lower branches and thin, flexible stems onto soil. Layering is most
common in krummholz whitebark pine [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>]. Krummholz whitebark pine rarely sets seed and when it does, the seed often shows poor
germination. Krummholz patches usually originate from lower-elevation seed
transported into the upper subalpine by Clark's nutcrackers. Once krummholz is
established, layering is its primary method of patch expansion [<a href="#211">211</a>].
Except in the upper subalpine, layering is not an important method of whitebark
pine regeneration [<a href="#17">17</a>].</p>

<b><font face="Bell MT">Climate:</font></b> 
Whitebark pine grows in cold, snowy,
and generally moist climates. On semiarid ranges it is most common on cold,
moist sites, whereas it is most common on warm, dry sites on moist ranges [<a href="#141">141</a>].
Whitebark pine is common on ridges and near timberline, where trees are exposed to
strong, desiccating winds. Hurricane-force wind velocities (<u>&gt;</u> 73 mi/h
(117 km/h)) occur every year on most whitebark pine sites and are especially
common on ridgetops. Precipitation in whitebark pine communities ranges from 24
to 63 inches (600-1,600 mm) per year [<a href="#231">231</a>], 2/3rds of which is snow [<a href="#17">17</a>].
Frost and snow are possible throughout the growing season,
which&nbsp; is about 90 days [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#208">208</a>]. Whitebark pine is more tolerant of wind and ice damage than any
other high-elevation conifer except alpine larch.
Whitebark pine sites often experience summer drought, especially in southern
latitudes of the tree's distribution. Whitebark pine is more drought tolerant than any other high-elevation
species [<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>].<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Topography:</font></b> 
Whitebark pine is most common on rocky, well-drained
sites [<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>]. Best
development occurs on sheltered, north-facing slopes and basins [<a href="#141">141</a>]. In the southern Sierra Nevada, whitebark pine is confined to moist north
slopes. Topography is rolling to rough with moderate to steep slope
[<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>]. Slopes on the Blue Mountains ranged
from 5 to 60% [<a href="#88">88</a>]. Whitebark pine occurs on all exposures but is most
common on south- and west-facing slopes [,76,128,200,235].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Soils: </font></b>
Soils in whitebark pine communities are classified as
cryochrepts [<a href="#77">77</a>]. Soils are moderately to poorly developed and well drained.
Coarse fragments are well represented [<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>].
Whitebark pine soils are nutrient poor and usually derived from granite or basalt
[<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>],
although whitebark pine occasionally grows on sedimentary soils [<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#191">191</a>]. Soil pH is usually strongly acidic, although
whitebark pine also occurs on basic soils [<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>,<a href="#232">232</a>].
Whitebark pine occurs on serpentine soils in the Blue, Klamath, and Siskiyou
mountains [<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#190">190</a>]. Soils
textures include coarse sands, sandy loams, and loams [<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>]. Rooting depth is
typically shallow; for example, maximum rooting depth at 1 site on the Okanogan
National Forest of Oregon was <u>&lt;</u> 12 inches (30 cm) [<a href="#235">235</a>]. Krummholz or matted whitebark pine grows mostly on high-elevation sites where

 Arno [<a href="#14">14</a>] characterizes
whitebark pine as a generally minor seral species in lower subalpine communities,
a
major seral species in the upper subalpine, a co-climax species in lower timberline, and
a climax species in upper timberline. Whitebark pine tolerates open, sunny to moderately shady sites
[<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>].
It is typically the 1st tree species found on sites where fire or another deforestation event
has occurred [<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>]. In Canada and
the northwestern United States, many subalpine whitebark pine communities are
seral, and subject to successional replacement by shade-tolerant conifers [<a href="#218">218</a>]. After whitebark pine cover is established,
shade-tolerant species often establish in the shelter of established whitebark pines
[<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>,<a href="#234">234</a>].
Callaway [<a href="#44">44</a>] found that in the Bitterroot Mountains of western Montana,
whitebark pine facilitated establishment and growth of later-successional
subalpine fir on high-elevation sites. Seedling and sapling subalpine fir were
highly aggregated around mature whitebark pine on upper subalpine sites (<u>&gt;</u>
8,580 ft (2,600 m)), but not at relatively low-elevation subalpine sites (7,260
ft (2,200 m)). On upper subalpine sites, mature subalpine fir adjacent to living
or dead mature whitebark pine showed more rapid growth rates compared to mature
subalpine fir growing in the open. Whitebark pine is most productive on sites
where it is seral [<a href="#109">109</a>]. On landscapes across the West,
whitebark pine is increasingly becoming displaced by later-successional species.
Murray and others [<a href="#170">170</a>] estimated that since 1753, 50% of 6 subalpine watersheds
on the Idaho-Montana border have shifted to late-successional subalpine fir. Only
3% of the subalpine landscape has shifted to seral whitebark pine.


<p>Whitebark pine in the Cascade Range occupies a seral role in
subalpine parklands and forests [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>].
Early to mid-seral conditions in these associations are mostly maintained by
occasional stand-replacement fire. In the absence of fire, subalpine fir usually
forms closed stands of mature trees [<a href="#128">128</a>]. In
high-elevation whitebark pine communities, stands are typically open even in&nbsp;
&quot;near-climax&quot; conditions [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].
Subalpine fir is sometimes present in the understory, suggesting eventual
replacement in even these high-elevation types. However, successional patterns
in high-elevation ecosystems are largely undocumented and difficult to predict
[<a href="#4">4</a>].
On Mount Rainier, whitebark pine and subalpine fir are invading subalpine
meadows simultaneously [<a href="#69">69</a>].</p>



<p>In Crater Lake National Park, Oregon, whitebark pine is the dominant tree on
Wizard Island. Sierra Nevada lodgepole pine is invading the island and appears
to be replacing whitebark pine in importance [<a href="#93">93</a>].

Male and new female cones are initiated from mid-July to mid-September, just
prior to winter bud formation. They resume growth in April or May. Pollen disperses
from male cones and 1st-year female cones open for pollination from May to mid-August, varying
with latitude, elevation, and temperature [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>]. Second-year female cones

IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Whitebark pine is a valuable source of food and cover for wildlife [<a href="#151">151</a>,<a href="#218">218</a>]. Bears,
rodents, and birds consume the seeds [<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#209">209</a>].
The trunks provide nesting sites for cavity nesters including northern
flickers and mountain bluebirds [<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#152">152</a>]. Blue grouse use the branches for roosting
and escape cover [<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>].<p><font face="Bell MT">Bears:</font> 
Whitebark pine ecosystems provide critical habitat for grizzly and black bears. Agee
and others [<a href="#5">5</a>] found that grizzly bear sightings in North Cascades National
Park, Washington, were more frequent than statistically expected in whitebark pine/alpine
larch habitats. Whitebark pine seeds are a high-quality bear food
[<a href="#143">143</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#156">156</a>].
Red and Douglas' squirrels provide an important ecological link&nbsp;between
whitebark pine and bears by making the seeds more readily available. Grizzly and black bears
rarely harvest whitebark pine cones from trees; they raid squirrel middens laden
with whitebark pine seeds [<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>]. Bear consumption of
whitebark pine seed peaks just before hibernation in late October and early
November. Bears feeding on whitebark pine seeds tend to feed on nothing else,
and a good supply of seeds increases bear fecundity. In
Yellowstone National Park, female grizzly bears were less likely to abort, and
more likely to have larger litters (3 cubs compared to 1-2 cubs) in good conecrop years.
Most importantly, grizzly bear death rate was nearly double when bear
consumption of whitebark
pine seeds was low [<a href="#146">146</a>]. Grizzly bears and humans have fewer troublesome encounters when
whitebark pine seeds crops are large. In Yellowstone National Park, grizzly bear
summer and fall movement is related to availability of whitebark pine seed. In
good crop years, grizzly bear tend to congregate in remote whitebark pine
communities. When seed is
limited, they tend to forage in more populated, lower-elevation sites. Yearling cubs and females with cubs-of-the-year
are most likely to be displaced to lower elevations in poor conecrop years
[<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>,<a href="#146">146</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Large ungulates: </font> Whitebark pine is a minor browse species for big game, but whitebark
pine understories often provide valuable forage. Rocky Mountain mule deer consume
trace amounts of whitebark pine [<a href="#115">115</a>]. Productivity in whitebark pine understories is highly
variable. Stands with
grassy understories are usually most productive. Herbage production on the
Wenatchee National Forest averaged 204 lbs/acre in whitebark pine/pinegrass
communities and 115 lbs/acre in whitebark pine/green fescue communities. In
contrast, a whitebark pine/grouse whortleberry/smooth woodrush community site
showed herbage production of 22 lbs/acre [<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#234">234</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Birds:</font> 
Many bird species use whitebark pine
ecosystems. Tomback and Kendall [<a href="#218">218</a>] provide a list of year-round and neotropical
species that nest in or otherwise use whitebark pine ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Whitebark pine
provides ecologically critical linkage between Clark's nutcracker and
lower-elevation, Clark's nutcracker-dependant pines (i.e.,
limber pine and pinyon pines (<i>Cembroides</i>)). When the seed crop of 1 pine species is
insufficient, Clark's nutcrackers migrate up- or downslope to harvest species
with more bountiful seed crops. Loss of whitebark pine, their preferred species,
reduces Clark's nutcracker populations, and may have negative consequences
for other pine species with seeds dispersed by Clark's nutcrackers [<a href="#218">218</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Palatability/nutritional value:</b></font> 
 Whitebark pine seeds are highly nutritious. They are especially high in lipids.
Content of seed collected from the Gallatin National Forest was 52%
fat, 21% carbohydrate, 21% protein, 3% ash, and 3% water. Major minerals present
were copper, zinc, iron, manganese, magnesium, and calcium [<a href="#123">123</a>]. Energy content of fresh, mature 
whitebark pine seed collected on the Bridger-Teton National Forest ranged from 5,526 to 7,308 calories/g
(�=6,800 calories/g) [<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>]. Tomback [<a href="#210">210</a>] reported similar energy
values (�=7,716 calories/g) for whitebark pine seed from the Sierra Nevada.</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Cover value:</font></b> 
Wildlife and livestock use whitebark pine/shrub communities for shade and
bedding cover [<a href="#128">128</a>]. In Silverbow County, Montana,
elk primarily used whitebark pine with a subalpine fir component as fall cover. Female mule deer used
whitebark pine communities 15% of their time in summer and 3% in fall. Male mule deer used whitebark pine
communities 4% of their time in summer; insufficient data precluded estimates of
their fall usage [<a href="#133">133</a>]. Whitebark pine ridgetops are prime calving
habitat for woodland caribou. Additional fire-created openings in whitebark pine
ecosystems might be an asset to
caribou reproduction [<a href="#192">192</a>].</p>

<b><font face="Bell MT">Restoration:</font></b> 
Increasing mortality from successional replacement, white
pine blister rust, bark beetles, and other agents foretell that whitebark pine will not
remain an important component of subalpine communities without long-term, active
management intervention [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>]. Whitebark pine researchers recommend the following:

<p>
1. Assess the local extent, successional status, and vigor of whitebark pine. If it appears that cone crops 
will dwindle in the future [<a href="#12">12</a>],<br>
2. inventory stands to document tree age, stand structure, cone-production potential, and projected time 
frame of successional replacement [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].<br>
3. Apply and evaluate management-ignited and wildland for resource benefit fires designed to kill late-successional 
trees and favor whitebark pine (see <a href="fire_effects.html#FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">Fire Management Considerations</a>).<br>
4. Conduct seed trials with blister rust-resistant stock in areas where natural whitebark pine seed sources 
have disappeared [<a href="#12">12</a>].  
</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Artificial regeneration:</font></b> 
Whitebark pine can be grown in the nursery from seed [<a href="#94">94</a>], and there is
considerable interest in outplanting nursery-grown, blister-rust
resistant stock to replace dead and dying mature whitebark pine [<a href="#121">121</a>]. Transplanted
whitebark pine has shown fair survivorship rates; further studies are needed to
determine which habitat/aspect/elevational combinations are best for artificial
regeneration. Whitebark pine appears to tolerate broad, possibly regional seed
transfer. Transfer guidelines are available [<a href="#137">137</a>,<a href="#224">224</a>]. 
Planting seed may be a good restoration option, as natural
dormancy of whitebark pine seed may help ensure germination under conditions favorable for
establishment 
(See <a href="botanical_and_ecological_characteristics.html#REGENERATION PROCESSES">Regeneration Processes</a>). 
On the Gallatin National
Forest, seedlings established from hand-planted seed showed mean 1st-year survivorship rates of&nbsp; 73% in a drought year
(1988) and 90% in a wet year (1989) [<a href="#151">151</a>].&nbsp;Kendall [<a href="#107">107</a>] recommends
developing a cold-stored genetic seed bank for whitebark pine, emphasizing that collections
from small, isolated populations should be a priority. Authorities from the
U.S. Forest Service Nursery in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, [<a href="#43">43</a>] provide
guidelines for collecting whitebark pine seed in the field, growing whitebark
pine in the greenhouse, and transporting seedlings to planting sites.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Genetic considerations:</font></b> 
Hoff and others [<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>] provide advice on managing whitebark pine in the field to promote
genetic resistance for blister rust. Experts on whitebark pine genetics have
raised the possibility of establishing &quot;seed orchards&quot; similar to
those successfully used for western white pine, an important timber species that
has also been decimated by blister rust. Seed orchard trees are started from
seed collected from parent trees showing blister-rust resistance. The seedlings
are planted on favorable
sites (sometimes even in greenhouses). Given ideal growth conditions, age of reproduction of parent trees
can be greatly reduced. (Some whitebark on moist sites on the Kootenai National
Forest have produced female cones at 10 years of age (pers. observ.); trees in greenhouses may set seed as early as 7
years). Natural and artificial cross-breeding of symptomless whitebark parents
will enhance genetic selection for blister-rust resistance and provide
opportunities for restocking blister rust-decimated landscapes with orchard
progeny, many of which will inherit mechanisms for blister-rust resistance [<a href="#85">85</a>].</p>

<p>Yanchuk [<a href="#238">238</a>,<a href="#239">239</a>] provides guidelines for prioritizing conifer species for genetic conservation programs in British
Columbia. Selection is based on species protection status, conservation breeding
programs already in place, and relative capacity for regeneration.
As of this writing (2002), whitebark pine was rated the species in greatest need of genetic
conservation management.</p>

<p>Due to its clumping habit, whitebark pine has an unusual genetic population structure 
(see <a href="botanical_and_ecological_characteristics.html#Breeding system">Breeding system</a>).
Planting whitebark pine without regard for its natural habit of growing in
clumped family groups may have
long-term consequences on natural selection processes operating on whitebark
pine [<a href="#213">213</a>].

     protects watersheds by reducing soil erosion and slowing snow runoff</font></li>
</ul>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Watersheds:</font></b> Whitebark pine's role in protecting watersheds may be
its most undervalued critical
function. Whitebark pine sites are highly valuable watersheds [<a href="#176">176</a>,<a href="#200">200</a>].
The open canopies of whitebark pine communities are thought to slow snowmelt and
retain more
snowpack than the closed canopies of late-succession communities [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#200">200</a>]. Studies are needed to provide estimates of water lost due to
successional replacement in subalpine communities. Loss of whitebark pine may result in
altered patterns of snow accumulation and melt, with watershed effects on
timing, levels, and quality of streamflows [<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#215">215</a>,<a href="#234">234</a>], and increased
potential for severe frost&nbsp; heaving, winter desiccation, and drought [<a href="#128">128</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Wood Products:</b></font>  
Mainly due to the species' inaccessibility, whitebark pine wood is not considered commercially valuable.
Large-diameter whitebark pine in mixed stands were harvested in the past.
Whitebark pine is classified as a soft-wood pine, and its wood has bending, compression, and
shearing properties similar to eastern (<i>P. strobus)</i> and western white pine. Wood
density is slightly higher than most white pines, and is similar to Douglas-fir
[<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Timber:</b></font> 
Whitebark pine reforestation techniques
are still in the trial stage. Whitebark pine sites are not recommended for timber production
at this time [<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#234">234</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Grazing:</font></b> 
A short growing season, drought, and commonly shallow, rocky soils make whitebark
pine habitats slow to recover from grazing&nbsp; [<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#234">234</a>]. 
Whitebark pine/grouse whortleberry
habitats seem more tolerant of grazing than whitebark/bunchgrass types [<a href="#200">200</a>].
&quot;Moderate overgrazing&quot; on whitebark pine sites may increase lupines (<i>Lupinus</i>
spp.),
luina (<i>Luina nardosima</i>), and other unpalatable herbs at the expense of
bunchgrasses. &quot;Severe overgrazing&quot; can create large, highly erosive
patches of bare soil [<a href="#234">234</a>].&nbsp;Willard [<a href="#233">233</a>] provides
guidelines for assessing range condition in whitebark pine ecosystems,
including plant species indicators and soil condition indicators.</p>

<p> Moderate grazing on subalpine mixed
conifer-meadow ecotones may encourage invasion of whitebark pine and other
conifers into meadows. Conifer invasion into meadows on the Wind River Mountains
of Wyoming began about 1890, concurrent with cattle grazing. Tree invasion
ceased in 1963, concurrent with cessation of cattle grazing. Dunwiddie [<a href="#59">59</a>]
suggests that moderate cattle grazing favors whitebark pine and other conifers
by reducing competition with meadow vegetation.</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Wilderness:</font></b> Half of whitebark pine's distribution lies in designated
Wilderness Areas or Parks [<a href="#98">98</a>]. 
See <a href="fire_effects.html#Wilderness">Fire Management Considerations/Wilderness</a> for further information.</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Other values: </font></b>As a long-lived species, whitebark pine tree-ring chronologies are a valuable
source of long-term climate information. Perkins and Swetnam [<a href="#174">174</a>] have correlated
patterns of tree growth and climate for more than 1,000 years from whitebark
pine stands in the Sawtooth Mountains of Idaho.</p>

<p>Whitebark pine is valued for its beauty, and whitebark pine ecosystems are
popular backcountry recreation sites [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>,<a href="#215">215</a>].</p>

<p>Whitebark pine is planted worldwide as an ornamental [<a href="#167">167</a>].</p>

<p>Whitebark pine seeds are a traditional Native American food [<a href="#222">222</a>] The
easternmost population of whitebark pine, isolated in the Sweetwater Mountains
of Montana, may have originally been planted by Native Americans as a food
source [<a href="#17">17</a>].</p>

Whitebark pine is declining at an unprecedented rate. Keane and others [<a href="#103">103</a>]
estimated a 45% decline in whitebark pine cover types in the Columbia River
Basin and the Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex of Montana. Ironically, whitebark
pine decline is greatest on seral sites, where its productivity was historically best.
The area occupied by seral whitebark pine has plummeted 98% [<a href="#103">103</a>]. Agents causing major whitebark pine mortality include white pine
blister rust, successional replacement, bark beetles, fire, root diseases, and weather. A study of 100
hectares on the Wenatchee National Forest, Washington, found that snag
recruitment of large, dominant whitebark pine was due to the following [<a href="#64">64</a>]:<br><br>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Blister rust:</b></font> 
White pine blister rust is an extremely serious threat to
whitebark pine. Accidentally introduced from Europe, the fungal pathogen has infected
white pine (<i>Strobus</i>) species in the United States and Canada. It has
affected whitebark
pine of all age classes throughout the species' range [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#198">198</a>,<a href="#198">198</a>]. Whitebark pine's genetic resistance to the rust is
 low compared to other North American white pines: it has variously been ranked from most susceptible
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>] to 4th most susceptible [<a href="#81">81</a>] to rust mortality
in greenhouse trials with white pine seedlings. Resistance of mature whitebark pine
in the field averages about 5%. Long-term mortality may be even greater than 95%,
as some trees that have apparently resisted the rust for decades are now
succumbing [<a href="#221">221</a>]. Whitebark pine infection rates are highest in the Pacific Northwest, where
 relatively cool, moist climate favors fungal growth and reproduction. A
 quarter to half of all whitebark pine in the region are dead [<a href="#109">109</a>],
 and some stands have lost nearly all the mature, cone-bearing trees [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. A 1999
survey of whitebark pine stands in British Columbia showed a 17% mortality rate, 46% of which was
directly attributable to blister rust. Thirty-two percent of live trees were
infected, with 64% mortality of infected trees expected within a few
years [<a href="#241">241</a>,<a href="#242">242</a>]. Keane and Arno [<a href="#100">100</a>] estimated a 2.1% average decrease in
basal area of whitebark pine per year on infected sites in western Montana, resulting in a 65%
mortality rate over 20 years. There is a distinct reduction in white pine blister rust
infection to the south; however, populations in southern portions of whitebark
pine's range are not immune to infection because substantial tree infection can
 occur in a single moist year. Infected trees may take from 2 years to decades to succumb, but infection is always 
 fatal [<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].</p>

<p>Gooseberries and currants (<i>Ribes</i> spp.) are the primary host of white
pine blister rust. Life cycle of white pine blister rust is complex.
Gitzendanner and others [<a href="#74">74</a>] and  McDonald and 
Hoff [<a href="#154">154</a>] provide
details of the rust's life history and ecology. Hoff [<a href="#82">82</a>] provides a diagnostic guide to aid managers in recognizing
symptoms of blister rust infection in white pines.</p>

<p>There are no known methods of <a href="https://www.nrmsc.usgs.gov/research/blister.htm">controlling
blister rust</a>  [<a href="#101">101</a>]. Fungicide application, pruning infected tree branches,
and/or removing <i>Ribes</i>  spp. have neither eliminated nor controlled white pine blister rust
[<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#154">154</a>], and such treatments have undesirable ecological effects [<a href="#101">101</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Bark beetles:</b></font> 
Mountain pine beetle is the most destructive insect pest of
mature whitebark pine. Ponderosa pine (<i>P. ponderosa</i>) and lodgepole pine are often described as
the primary hosts of mountain pine beetle; however, mountain pine beetle populations
have thrived using whitebark pine as their primary host [<a href="#173">173</a>,<a href="#175">175</a>].
Endemic levels of mountain
pine beetle are common in whitebark pine stands. Limited studies suggest that
when mountain pine beetle numbers are low, beetles may concentrate
their attacks on trees weakened by other stressors such as fungi or fire.
However, little research has been conducted on effects of&nbsp; endemic mountain pine
beetle populations on whitebark pine, and further research is needed [<a href="#24">24</a>]. Epidemic outbreaks cause high whitebark pine mortality
[<a href="#236">236</a>]. Millions of acres
of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine-whitebark pine forests were destroyed in the
1901-1942 outbreaks in northern Idaho and western Montana [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>].
Climate may trigger epidemics: mountain pine beetles are
favored by warm, droughty summers and mild winters. Temperatures at low- and
mid-elevations have historically been most favorable for mountain pine beetle
broods [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p>Periodic mountain pine beetle outbreaks are
a natural component of whitebark ecosystems [<a href="#175">175</a>]. Decaying
whitebark pine &quot;ghost forests&quot; provide woody fuels that spread fire, and
the openings created by fire provide favorable Clark's nutcracker caching sites
[<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#173">173</a>]. It is the
interactive effects of mountain pine beetle infestation, fire exclusion, and
white pine blister rust that have devastated whitebark pine populations [<a href="#47">47</a>].
Warming of
whitebark pine habitats due to global climate change may further stress whitebark pine by encouraging an
upward shift of 
mountain pine beetle
populations into whitebark pine habitats [<a href="#131">131</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>].</p>

<p>Because mountain pine beetle populations have historically been larger in
lower-elevation forests, it has been assumed that lower-elevation forests
serve as source points for attacks, with upper-elevation whitebark pine acting
as &quot;spill-over&quot; sinks for mountain pine beetles [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>].
However, experimental evidence is lacking. Even if once true, fugitive status of
mountain pine beetle in whitebark pine appears to be changing. Six [<a href="#196">196</a>]
found that in Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine and whitebark pine stands in western Montana, mountain pine beetle
preferred trees with relatively thin phloem
thickness, thin bark, and low sapwood moisture. Whitebark pine generally
fulfills these requirements better than lodgepole pine. Larval survivorship and adult
beetle emergence were significantly greater in whitebark pine compared to
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine of similar dbh. Previous studies have also
found that whitebark pine is a better host for mountain pine beetle than
lodgepole pine [<a href="#7">7</a>]. In Six's study, initial outbreaks occurred
in whitebark, not lodgepole, pine stands. Mountain pine beetle larvae
matured and emerged in 1 year, regardless if the host tree was whitebark or
lodgepole pine. Six concludes that mountain pine beetles will attack
high-elevation whitebark
pine without a source population of mountain pine beetles in
lower-elevation lodgepole pine [<a href="#196">196</a>].</p>

<p>Interactive effects of mountain pine beetles and white pine blister rust are unclear,
and further research is needed. In a related study on sites in northern Idaho
and western Montana, Six [<a href="#196">196</a>] found that whitebark pine attacked by
mountain pine beetle had a significantly lower moisture content than trees that
were not attacked. Further, blister rust-infected trees had an overall&nbsp;
higher rate of mountain pine beetle attack compared to uninfected trees.
However, mountain pine beetle choice was related to beetle population density:
at low numbers, beetles preferred apparently healthy whitebark pine. As
populations grew, beetles tended to select infected whitebark pine over healthy
trees.</p>

<p>Secondary beetles, which usually cause mortality only in whitebark pine
already stressed by other factors such as root rot fungi, include red turpentine
beetles, <i>Ips</i> spp., and <i>Pityogenes</i> spp. [<a href="#24">24</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Mistletoes:</b></font> Whitebark pine is an alternate host for limber pine dwarf
mistletoe (<i>Arceuthobium cyanocarpum</i>), which has caused heavy localized
losses of whitebark pine. A survey on Mt. Shasta in the southern Cascade Range
of California found a 96% infection rate in whitebark pine, with 58% mortality
[<a href="#142">142</a>].
Larch dwarf mistletoe (<i>A. laricis</i>) and mountain hemlock dwarf mistletoe (<i>A.
tsugense</i> ssp. <i>mertensianae</i>) sometimes infect whitebark pine
[<a href="#140">140</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Other pathogens:</font></b> 
A needle
blight (<i>Dothistroma septospora</i>) has caused serious localized disease in
whitebark pine of&nbsp; the Crazy Mountains, south-central Montana [<a href="#207">207</a>].
Hoff and Hagle [<a href="#83">83</a>] provide a review of other pathogens affecting whitebark
pine.</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Climate effects:</font></b> 
Modelling mostly predicts a decline in whitebark pine due to
global increases in temperature and more frequent summer droughts [<a href="#146">146</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>]. Climate modelling for Yellowstone
National Park predicts that independent of other agents of decline such as
blister rust, whitebark pine is the
most at-risk conifer in the Park due to drying conditions in high-elevation
habitats [<a href="#27">27</a>]. However, impact of climate change on whitebark pine
is inconclusive: Keane and others [<a href="#104">104</a>] predict expansion of whitebark pine in
Glacier National Park due to more frequent fire return intervals resulting from
global warming.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Old growth:</b> </font> 
Whitebark pine is rapidly losing its oldest age classes. Arno
and others [<a href="#107">107</a>] found mean diameter of overstory whitebark pine on the
Bitterroot National Forest was 7 inches (18 cm) in 1991. Most of the largest
trees had died during a severe mountain pine beetle outbreak in the 1930s.</p>

FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font>    
Two strategies allow whitebark pine to survive
in fire-prone ecosystems: survival of large and refugia trees, and postfire seedling
establishment facilitated by Clark's nutcrackers. Mature
trees usually survive low-, and sometimes moderate-severity surface fires. Bark thickness is
moderate: thinner than ponderosa pine but thicker than lodgepole pine.
Pole- and smaller-sized whitebark pine usually do not survive surface fires
[<a href="#101">101</a>],
but patchy
fires resulting from fuel-limited whitebark pine habitats reduces whitebark pine
mortality [<a href="#2">2</a>]. In western Montana, Arno [<a href="#11">11</a>] frequently found whitebark pine with multiple
fires scars dating from 1600 to 1900, demonstrating ability to survive low- and moderate-severity surface
fires [<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#234">234</a>].<p> Whitebark
pine seedlings establish on open
sites created by mixed-severity and stand-replacement fires [<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#220">220</a>,<a href="#228">228</a>]. Late-successional species
dominate when fire return intervals are long, but fires were historically likely to
return before whitebark pine was successionally replaced [<a href="#164">164</a>]. Although
whitebark pine recruitment is depressed in many areas, whitebark pine seedlings were historically highly competitive with other
conifer species in the postfire environment. For example, 25 years after an 1892
stand-replacement wildfire on Mt. Adams in Washington, whitebark pine
seedling establishment was equal to that of western hemlock (9% of total
recruitment) and better than that of lodgepole pine and Engelmann spruce.
Hofmann [<a href="#86">86</a>]&nbsp; noted that whitebark pine seedlings were fairly evenly
distributed over the 80-acre (32 ha) burn, even though parent seed trees were at
least a mile away.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font> 
Whitebark pine ecosystems
have a mixed-severity fire regime of widely ranging fire intensities and
frequencies [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>]. Mixed-severity fires create complex landscapes of dead
whitebark pine stands
intermingled with live stands of different ages [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>]. Whitebark pine stands
also experience nonlethal surface fires and infrequent stand-replacement fires
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>]. Under whitebark pine's highly variable fire regime, fire return intervals
range from 30 to 350+ years [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>]. In a review paper, Agee [<a href="#2">2</a>] lists mean fire
return intervals of 29 to 300 years in whitebark pine habitats, with
moderate-severity fire return interval means of 25 to 75 years and stand-replacement fire
return interval means
of 140+ years.</p>

<p> Whitebark pine wood is
highly flammable even when green, and&nbsp;the dry, windswept upper slopes where
whitebark pine grows are
predisposed to lightning strikes. Whitebark pine and mixed-conifer communities with a whitebark component experience 
fire frequently; however, fire is usually unable to spread
widely due to discontinuous canopies and sparse understory fuels [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#200">200</a>]. Fire severity is low where surface fuels are sparse,
and the resulting underburn kills mostly small trees and fire-susceptible
overstory species, leaving live, mature whitebark pine. Understory species such
as pinegrass and grouse whortleberry provide fine fuels that spread surface
fires [<a href="#169">169</a>], which crown and consume conifers in dense patches. On 3 sites on the
Bitterroot National Forest, Montana, Arno [<a href="#10">10</a>] reported minimum/maximum fire
return intervals of&nbsp; 2/68 (�=33), 4/78 (�=30), and 8/50 (�=41) years. Brown and others
[<a href="#39">39</a>] found fires in the subalpine mixed-conifer zone of the Selway-Bitterroot
Wilderness of Montana and Idaho were mostly mixed severity, with patchy,
fine-grained patterns. Return intervals ranged from 25 to 60 years. Fires were
still patchy and of mixed severity in pure whitebark pine stands at high
elevations, but fire return interval lengthened to a 115-year mean.</p>

<p> Infrequent
stand-replacement fires are an important component of whitebark pine's fire
ecology [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>]. Occasional
stand-replacement fire maintains whitebark pine as an early to mid-seral species
in subalpine fir communities in Washington's Cascade Range [<a href="#128">128</a>]
and elsewhere.
Arno [<a href="#11">11</a>] found that in the Bitterroot Mountains,
subalpine&nbsp; communities on moist, north-facing slopes were most likely to
experience long return-interval, stand-replacement fires. He stated, &quot;stand-replacement fire is essential to maintain 
whitebark on moist slopes
because of the rapid rate of succession&quot; [<a href="#12">12</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p>Small, patchy fires are also important to whitebark pine regeneration,
especially where whitebark pine is seral. Large and small fires create regeneration
opportunities, recycle nutrients and biomass, and maintain whitebark pine on
the landscape [<a href="#163">163</a>]. Fires historically started in summer and fall and burned over many weeks
[<a href="#98">98</a>].
Extent of stand-replacement burns varies; ranges from 2.5 to 120 acres (1-50 ha) are
typical [<a href="#171">171</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>]. Small-acreage fires were,
and are, more common. For example, a 12-year study (1979-1990) in the Selway-Bitterroot
Wilderness Area showed that 84% of wildland fires for resource benefit (prescribed natural
fires) burned less than 4 hectares.
A single year (1988) accounted for 39% of the area burned [<a href="#39">39</a>]. Large fires typically occurred in drought years, burned through
lower-elevation plant communities as well the subalpine, and lasted from weeks
to months [<a href="#163">163</a>].</p>


<p><font face="Bell MT">Fire regime examples:</font>  Fire histories of Yellowstone National
Park show the mean fire return interval in underburned whitebark pine stands ranged widely, from 66 to 204 years. Underburns
were often patchy and restricted to 1 or several stands. Whitebark pine and
mixed-conifer communities from 6,000 to 11,000 feet (2,000-3,300 m) experienced stand-replacement fire every 350
years or more. Slow fuel accretion and moist fuels restricted fire spread, and
large fires occurred only in extreme fire weather years such as 1988 [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>].</p>

<p> In the Sierra Nevada fuel loadings were historically light between 7,500 to
10,000 feet (2,300-3,050 m), and fires were usually of low severity. Large,
stand-replacing fires occurred rarely but played an important successional
role: fires created openings in which whitebark pine and the nonserotinous Sierra
Nevada lodgepole pine established. In the absence of fire, red fir is
successionally replacing the 2 pines at elevations below 10,000 feet.&nbsp;Fire records for Yosemite National Park from 1931 to 1978 show that
most subalpine fires occurred in the lower, red fir zone (representing 10% of
total Park area but 37% of total Park fires), where whitebark pine is seral. Although fires were not as common in the
mid-subalpine lodgepole
pine-mountain hemlock zone - where mature, cone-bearing whitebark pine is most
prevalent - the fires burned over larger areas (14% of total fires, equaling
19,677 acres). The upper subalpine zone (&gt; 10,000 feet) -&nbsp; where whitebark occurs in pure
to nearly pure stands - represents 14% of total Park area and experienced no
fires between 1931 and 1978.
Fires were rare in the upper subalpine, but were &quot;intense&quot; when they
did occur, especially in krummholz whitebark pine [<a href="#35">35</a>].</p>

<p> On the Cascade Range, fire regime
of westside whitebark pine forests is typically stand
replacement. Forests with a lodgepole pine component burn more frequently and
severely; stands without lodgepole pine burn less frequently and have greater
potential for creeping ground fire [<a href="#128">128</a>]. On the
east side, whitebark pine forests appear to have the shortest fire-return
interval of high-elevation forests [<a href="#2">2</a>]. Stand-replacement fires are rare on the
east side [<a href="#128">128</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Fire exclusion:</font></b> 
Fire exclusion has favored shade-tolerant, late-successional
species throughout whitebark pine's range [<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>,<a href="#197">197</a>].
Because fire return intervals are often long where whitebark pine is climax, fire exclusion
has affected high-elevation whitebark pine less than whitebark pine at
mid-elevations, where whitebark pine was historically a highly productive seral species
[<a href="#101">101</a>].
At the landscape level, however, fire exclusion in the upper subalpine has shifted succession away from
whitebark pine to later-successional species [<a href="#3">3</a>]. Murray and others [<a href="#169">169</a>] suggest that
livestock grazing in the 19th century reduced fire frequency even before fire
suppression was practiced. Small,
isolated mountain ranges may be most affected by anthropogenically altered fire regimes. Subalpine portions of the West Bighole Range, an
isolated spur of the
Bitterroot Range on the Montana-Idaho border, have experienced
reduced fire frequencies and an 87% decrease in area burned since
European-American settlement. From 1754 to 1873, actual fire rotation was 184 years;
modelling predicts a fire rotation of&nbsp; 1,364 years based upon fire
frequencies from 1874 to 1993.</p>

<b><font face="Bell MT">Modelling:</font></b> 
Several fire effects, fuel, and
fire behavior models applicable to whitebark pine ecosystems are available at <a href="https://www.fire.org/">fire.org</a>.
McKenzie and others [<a href="#155">155</a>] provide a model for predicting coarse-scale fire
effects in whitebark pine and other potential natural vegetation types of the
Columbia River Basin.&nbsp;Keane [<a href="#99">99</a>] summarizes several ecosystem processes and landscape fire succession models
that apply to whitebark pine and mixed-conifer subalpine ecosystems. FIRESUM is
specific to whitebark pine and models the interactive effects of fire, mountain pine beetles, and white pine blister
rust on whitebark pine growth, basal area, and regeneration [<a href="#102">102</a>].

<b><font face="Bell MT">Seedling establishment:</font></b> 
Whitebark pine establishes from seed
on open mineral soil seedbeds created by mixed-severity and stand-replacement
fires. Clark's nutcrackers prefer open sites with mineral soil for caching, and
readily cache seed on large openings created by stand-replacement fire and in
smaller openings created by mixed-severity fire. Most seed is cached in the 1st good conecrop
year following fire, but Clark's nutcrackers may continue to build up the seed
bank for decades as long as the site remains open and whitebark pine seed is
available. Cone-bearing trees close to burns are usually the parent trees,
but some Clark's nutcrackers collect and transport seed from distant trees
[<a href="#212">212</a>]. Because whitebark pine shows delayed germination and subalpine
climates are often unfavorable for germination and growth, good establishment
may not occur in the 1st few years after caching. Given a good seed bank, good
seedling establishment usually occurs within the 1st decade after fire.
Following a wildfire in the Bob Marshall Wilderness of western Montana,
whitebark pine showed no establishment at postfire years 1 or 2, but seedling
density was 264/acre at postfire year 3 [<a href="#20">20</a>]. In Yosemite National Park, a 2-hectare, mixed-severity August wildfire
killed the majority of krummholz whitebark pine; a few trees survived or were
missed. At postfire year 4, a total of 54 whitebark pine seedlings was counted
on burn transects. Only 3 whitebark pine seedlings were found on transects in
the adjacent, unburned control. Seedling heights ranged from 0.4 to 5 inches
(�=1.5 <u>+</u> 1.0 in.) (1-13 cm (�=3.9 <u>+</u>
2.6 cm)). Most seedlings were near objects such as rocks, logs, and bases of
burned trees. Such objects help Clark's nutcrackers remember where cached seed
was stored, but when the seed is not retrieved, such placement may aid whitebark
pine establishment by shading germinants. Tomback [<a href="#211">211</a>] noted that postfire
whitebark pine establishment was still underway at the Sierra Nevada study site.
At postfire year 4, she observed Clark's nutcrackers collecting seed from
lower-elevation, erect-form whitebark pine and caching it on the
burn.<p><b>Postfire growth: </b>
Few studies have been conducted on
postfire growth rates of whitebark pine. Sund [<a href="#205">205</a>] found that on the Sleeping
Child Burn described below, whitebark pine seedling heights at postfire year 26 ranged from 0.4
to 94 inches (1-238 cm), with seedling height highly correlated (p &lt; 0.001) with seedling age. Seedling height was 
greatest on ridges (�=10.3 in. (36.2 cm)),
followed by south and north slopes (�=12.0 and 11.9 in. (30.6 and 29.7 cm)),
and was least on roadside plots (�=7.6 in. (19.2 cm)).</p>

<p><b>Effects of fire size and other disturbance agents:</b> 
Large stand-replacement fires can favor whitebark pine over
wind-dispersed conifers if cone-bearing whitebark pine are nearby. For example,&nbsp; in 1961 the
lightning-ignited Sleeping Child Fire burned over 27,900 acres (11,300 ha) on
the Bitterroot National Forest, Montana. Blister rust infection in the area was light, so
whitebark pine seed sources were not limited. Clark's nutcrackers primarily collected whitebark pine seed from trees in
the adjacent unburned forest; however, some birds traveled 5 miles (8 km) or
more to collect seed. Conifer re-establishment was assessed at
postfire year 26 (1987). Whitebark pine and
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine dominated study plots, with whitebark
pine showing dominance on north slopes and lodgepole pine showing dominance on
south slopes and ridgetops. Lodgepole pine was absent from many upper subalpine plots. Although the oldest conifers in the 
burn were 25 years of
age, the oldest whitebark pine were 21 years old, demonstrating both whitebark
pine's tendency to delay postfire establishment and its ability to compete with
other conifers despite the delay. Typical of species with wind-dispersed seed on
large burns, subalpine fir showed good establishment at the burn's perimeter,
and poor establishment in the burn's interior [<a href="#211">211</a>].</p>

<p>The combination of mountain pine beetle attacks and blister rust infection
followed by large, stand-replacing fire is harmful because whitebark pine
seed sources are severely reduced. The Sundance Fire
in northern Idaho provides an example. A history of bark beetle infestation and
high incidence of blister rust in the area had already reduced whitebark pine
seed sources prior to the wildfire. A survey conducted at postfire year 25 revealed
a 27% blister rust infection rate in mature whitebark pine adjacent to the burn.
Most whitebark pine in unburned plots were snags with mountain pine beetle
galleries. On unburned plots, mean density of live whitebark pine <u>&gt;</u> 
0.4 inch (1 cm) in
diameter was 0.008 tree site (single tree or cluster)/m<sup>2</sup>. In contrast, seed source density
for the Sleeping Child Burn was 0.064 tree site/m<sup>2</sup>,<sup>
</sup>and the Sleeping Child Burn had more whitebark pine regeneration.<sup> </sup>Comparison
of whitebark pine regeneration on the 2 burns is given below. Data are mean
densities (1 standard deviation, range) [<a href="#216">216</a>].</p>

<p>Tomback and others [<a href="#216">216</a>] state that whitebark pine seed production near the
Sundance Burn was so low that Clark's nutcrackers were not caching many seeds.
Without active management including artificial regeneration, the long-term outlook for whitebark pine in the
area does not look good. Twenty-nine percent of the seedlings on the Sundance
Burn show symptoms of blister rust; actual rate of seedling infection is
probably higher.</p>

<p>Fire scorching may increase whitebark pine's susceptibility to mountain pine
beetle attack [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>]. A 1990s investigation of 2nd-order
fire effects following the 1988 wildfires in Yellowstone National Park revealed the

<b><font face="Bell MT">Effects of fire exclusion:</font></b> 
Kendall and Keane [<a href="#109">109</a>] state &quot;whitebark pine will
continue to decline if fire is not allowed to periodically set back the
successional clock.&quot; Secondary succession, accelerated by white pine
blister rust and bark beetle outbreaks, results in rapid replacement of
whitebark pine by shade-tolerant, fire-sensitive species such as subalpine fir
and mountain hemlock. Without burning, genetically valuable seed produced by
blister-rust resistant whitebark pine is wasted: no new
openings are created where Clark's nutcracker can cache seed and seedlings can establish
[<a href="#98">98</a>]. Based upon fire records from the U.S. Forest Service's Northern Region, Arno [<a href="#12">12</a>] estimated that less that one-half of 1% of the seral whitebark pine type
had burned in 1970-1985. At that rate, he calculated a theoretical fire return interval of
3,000+ years. Arno and other fire researchers caution that in reality, wildfire
inevitably returns to fire-prone ecosystems [<a href="#39">39</a>]. Fuel build-ups
resulting from long-term fire exclusion dictate that when fire does return, it burns more acreage
at greater severity than was historical. Estimated loss of whitebark pine from
the 1988 Yellowstone fires was 30% of cone-producing stands in the north of the
Park, and 12% in the east. Total reduction of whitebark pine cover was estimated
at 54% [<a href="#112">112</a>].

<p><a name="Wilderness"><b><font face="Bell MT">Wilderness:</font></b></a>
Across its range, the proportion of whitebark pine habitat that
falls within Wilderness boundaries is greater than that of nearly any other tree species
[<a href="#193">193</a>]. Whitebark pine in Wilderness Areas are not immune to decline:
Kendall and Arno [<a href="#108">108</a>] estimated that as of 1990, 90% of&nbsp; whitebark pine
in Glacier National Park, much of it in wilderness boundaries, had died from white pine blister rust. 
Fire management of whitebark pine is particularly problematic in
small Wilderness Areas, where management-ignited fires are seldom an option [<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#168">168</a>].
Yet conservation of
whitebark pine may be impossible without reintroduction of fire to Wilderness
Areas [<a href="#110">110</a>]. Since firelines in Wilderness areas are
costly, damaging, difficult to construct in remote areas, and often in violation
of the Wilderness Act, wilderness fires for resource benefit present the best management option
[<a href="#98">98</a>]. As of this writing (2002), studies are underway to determine
fire histories and explore management options in small, isolated Wilderness
Areas [<a href="#168">168</a>]. Renkin and Despain [<a href="#183">183</a>] summarized a 17-year trend
(1972-1988) of fire occurrence under the prescribed natural fire program in
Yellowstone National Park. They found that the high moisture levels in
whitebark pine ecosystems did not favor crown fires in most years (1988 being an
exception), and fire occurrence was less than expected (based on amount of
unburned area available) in whitebark pine communities. In
mixed-conifer forests where whitebark pine was a component of the
vegetation,&nbsp; fire occurrence was greater than expected in subalpine
fir-Engelmann spruce and old-growth
lodgepole pine with a subalpine fir-Engelmann spruce understory, and less than
expected in seral lodgepole pine. Keane [<a href="#98">98</a>] states, &quot;the most important management
action for conserving and maintaining vital whitebark pine ecosystems is to
allow fires to burn in wilderness areas and play a more natural role in the
ecosystem.&quot;</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Restoring whitebark pine with fire:</font></b>
Long-term outlook for whitebark
pine is not without hope, but restoring whitebark pine ecosystems cannot be
accomplished without returning fire to subalpine landscapes. Keane and Arno [<a href="#101">101</a>]
state, &quot;maintenance of native fire regimes is the single most important
management action to ensure conservation of whitebark pine.&quot; Whitebark pine
will continue to decline in the short term, but natural selection will probably increase
genetic blister-rust
resistance in whitebark pine populations [<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#204">204</a>].
It is also likely that future disturbances, particularly large fires and
mountain pine beetle attacks, will kill many of these genetically valuable
trees. Despite the dangers of landscape-level fire to whitebark pine
populations, returning fire to the landscape is best way to restore whitebark
pine. Kendall and Keane [<a href="#109">109</a>] state, &quot;It is important to note that fire
exclusion has a far greater negative than positive consequence for whitebark
pine. In the absence of fire, atypical amounts of fuel accumulate that&nbsp;
foster more fires that are lethal to mature whitebark pine trees.&quot;
Reintroduction of stand-replacing fire fosters whitebark pine regeneration
by providing open sites suitable for Clark's nutcracker caching and seedling establishment. It
also reduces impacts of mountain pine beetle infestations
by creating mosaics of mutiaged stands that are less conducive to beetle
epidemics [<a href="#79">79</a>]. It is encouraging that 40% of
the progeny of healthy trees in stands otherwise heavily infested with blister
rust show some genetic resistance to blister
rust [<a href="#85">85</a>]. Without intervention, it is
likely that the small proportion of whitebark pine resistant to white pine
blister rust will be killed in stand-replacement fires before they can reproduce
[<a href="#109">109</a>].</p>

<p> Management-ignited fires can be used for fire hazard reduction and whitebark
pine restoration treatments [<a href="#38">38</a>]. Fire researchers emphasize that it is less important to
reconstruct historic
stand structures than to reintroduce fire to whitebark pine ecosystems. It is
crucial to create open sites that are favorable for Clark's nutcracker
caching and growth of natural and artificial regeneration. Six Demonstration Areas have been established in the
Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Complex of Idaho and Montana as part of the Restoring Whitebark Pine
Ecosystems Project. Ongoing restoration treatments include prescribed fire and
silvicultural cuttings. Since the research is ongoing, conclusions and
recommendations are based on limited data, and further suggestions will be forthcoming
as the project continues [<a href="#101">101</a>].</p>

<p>Large, stand-replacement fires are not recommended in areas where whitebark
pine is in severe decline (for example, northern Idaho and northwestern
Montana). Small-scale prescribed burning is recommended; otherwise, natural
whitebark pine regeneration will
be extremely slow [<a href="#216">216</a>]. Prescribed burning is best conducted in fall,
after an early frost (&lt;25<sup>o</sup>F (-4<sup>o</sup>C)) kills herbaceous plants and shrub
foliage. Such foliage quickly cures and can propagate fire. In other seasons
whitebark pine ecosystems are usually too wet to burn, or in extreme fire years,
downslope vegetation is so dry that spotting may ignite fire in lower
elevations. Aids for conducting stand inventories, 
<a href="https://www.nrmsc.usgs.gov/research/whitebark_fire.htm">prioritizing whitebark pine habitat for prescribed fire</a>, 
designing and implementing treatments, and posttreatment monitoring and available
[<a href="#101">101</a>]. Follow-up thinning treatments, especially of subalpine fir,
are usually needed to encourage whitebark pine growth [<a href="#216">216</a>]. Augmenting natural regeneration with blister-rust resistant
seed sources is recommended in areas where whitebark pine seed sources are
absent or greatly reduced [<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>].</p>

<p>Unfortunately, restoration treatments may increase bark beetle predation on
whitebark pine. On the Beaver Ridge Demonstration Area in northern Idaho, Six [<a href="#196">196</a>]
found that&nbsp;<i>Pityogenes fossifrons</i>  beetles were the most serious
posttreatment pest species: they preferred young, apparently healthy whitebark
pine in Clark's nutcracker openings, but&nbsp; also attacked a few fire-damaged
mature trees. <i>Ips</i>  spp. colonized slash heavily and attacked a few
fire-damaged mature trees, but mostly left healthy trees alone. Mountain pine
beetle numbers, which are rising in the study area, rose on the treatment sites
but did not significantly respond to treatments. To reduce <i>Pityogenes fossifrons </i>infestation,
Six [<a href="#196">196</a>] recommended spraying high-value whitebark pine in Clark's nutcracker
openings with carbaryl for 2 posttreatment years. 
(Refer to the <a href="fire_case_studies.html">Fire Case Study</a>
for an explanation of nutcracker openings and other study treatments used on whitebark pine.)</p>

Information on tree biomass is useful in determining
fuel loads and predicting potential fire behavior. Moeur [<a href="#159">159</a>] provides a model for estimating crown widths and foliage
weights of whitebark pine and other northern Rocky Mountain conifers. Regression equations
[<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>] and tables [<a href="#199">199</a>] are available for estimating

Habitat type is subalpine fir/smooth woodrush (<i>Abies lasiocarpa/Luzula
hitchcockii</i>). The site was in late succession prior to treatment, with a
large component of subalpine fir and Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i> var. <i>latifolia</i>),
and minor 
amounts of Engelmann spruce (<i>Picea engelmannii)</i> and whitebark pine (<i>Pinus
albicaulis</i>). Grouse whortleberry (<i>Vaccinium scoparium</i>) and beargrass
(<i>Xerophyllum tenax</i>) are common in the understory. Historically, the
whitebark pine cover type occupied 8 km<sup>2</sup> on the Smith Creek
Watershed; current coverage is 2 km<sup>2</sup>. Whitebark pine dominated the
landscape until the early 1900s. Historical fire regime for the area is
mixed-severity fires with 80- to 250-year return intervals. It has been
approximately 170 years since the last fire. Successional replacement by
subalpine fir began in the 1930s as a result of a mountain pine beetle epidemic
that killed a major portion of mature whitebark pine. It was accelerated in the 1970s with
a buildup of white pine blister rust.&nbsp; Blister rust
infection of whitebark pine in the area averages 85% [<a href="#101">101</a>].

<p>A total of 4 treatments were used on the site. Two fire treatments were used: underburning and
silvicultural harvest/burning. Other treatments were silvicultural thinning to
promote seral whitebark pine, and an undisturbed control. Each unit averaged 2 hectares. The underburn unit was left undisturbed prior to fire
treatment. Objective of the underburn was to develop fire treatments that kill
late-successional subalpine fir and release whitebark pine. Objective of the harvest/burn treatment was to
develop silvicultural and fire treatments that promote natural whitebark pine
regeneration by creating burned openings for Clark's nutcracker seed caching. For the
harvest/burn treatment, three 0.2-ha circular areas were designated for
cutting, with slash left in place, to create fire-scarified areas. Nearly all trees within
the 3 target openings were harvested during late August to mid-September of
1995. The rest of the unit was thinned in late summer of 1995 for
underburning, with some slash
removed but most left in place as fuel. Healthy whitebark and lodgepole pine
outside the target openings were not cut, but all dying whitebark, dying lodgepole
pine, and all subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce were harvested. Fires were ignited
on 2 Oct., 1996. It was mostly sunny with light winds. Both fire-treatment units were
burned with 3-meter-wide strip headfires to keep intensities low.&nbsp;
Conditions on the day of burning were:</p>

The outcome of the burn was directly related to amount of fuel on the ground.
The harvest/burn unit had the highest fuel loadings because the cut slash
created a continuous fuelbed throughout the stand. As a result, the harvest/burn
unit had the highest fire intensities, with flame lengths averaging 1 to 2
meters compared to less than 1 meter in the underburn unit. Scorch heights,
scorched crown volume, and bole char height were also greater in the
harvest/burn unit. Tree mortality -- especially whitebark pine -- was greater in
the harvest/burn unit, as was fuel consumption and amount of exposed mineral
soil. Fire effects and fuels data (means) are given below. Mortality estimates
for the harvest/burn unit are for trees that remained after harvest. It was
expected that mortality would double by postfire year 5.<br><br>

<p> The nutcracker openings were created in the summer of 1995, a heavy cone
crop year for whitebark pine. Even though slash covered 20 to 30% of the ground
after harvest treatments, open spots were available
for caching. Clark's nutcrackers were observed caching whitebark pine
seeds in the harvested treatments over a 2-week period in late August and early September of
1995. The birds planted most heavily in the 3 open areas, which has not yet been
burned. The cone crop was poor after the 1996 fire treatments, but some Clark's nutcrackers were observed caching seeds in
the underburned areas as well as the 3 burned openings.
Clark's nutcrackers have not observed caching seed in the untreated control
unit. The study site is being monitored for postfire establishment of whitebark pine
and other conifer seedlings.&nbsp;</p>


<p>As of this writing (2002), the Restoring Whitebark Pine Ecosystems
Project has conducted prescribed burning and thinning treatments on 2 other
whitebark pine sites in the northern Rocky Mountains. Burning on those sites was
conducted in 1999, a good cone crop year. Clark's nutcracker use of the burns
was heavy. The birds began caching seed within 5 days after burning.</p>

FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />


A single low-intensity underburn may not be enough to restore whitebark pine
stands with mixed-fire regimes. Another fire, or cutting, would be needed
to achieve prescription goals in the underburn unit. Low subalpine fir mortality
in the underburn unit shows the need to enhance the fuelbed by slashing or burn under drier
conditions.<p>The harvest/burn treatment continues to be attractive to seed-caching Clark's
nutcrackers as of this writing (2002). Further monitoring is needed to determine
the rate of posttreatment whitebark pine establishment [<a href="#101">101</a>]. Consumption of downed
logs on the harvest/burn unit was comparable to that of natural mixed-severity
burns [<a href="#14">14</a>]. In retrospect, researchers could have harvested&nbsp; all mature
whitebark on the harvest/burn unit. Most were killed by the fire, and it would
have been difficult to reduce fire intensity enough to minimize mortality of
mature whitebark and still create openings for Clark's nutcrackers.</p>

<p>As of 2002, posttreatment information on the silvicultural (thinning) unit
has not been published.</p>

It is likely that subalpine fir will regenerate in the treatments more
quickly than whitebark pine. Mature subalpine fir are abundant adjacent to the
study units, and the majority of nearby mature whitebark pine are damaged by blister
rust, and thus have limited ability to produce cones.&nbsp; All stands would
benefit from understory cuttings of subalpine fir at about 20 posttreatment years to
release new whitebark pine saplings [<a href="#101">101</a>].
