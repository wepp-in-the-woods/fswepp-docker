 The scientific name of black cottonwood is <i>Populus balsamifera </i>L. ssp. <i>trichocarpa</i> 
 (Torr. &amp; Gray)&nbsp;Brayshaw (Salicaceae) [<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#156">156</a>]. <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/popbalb/index.html">Balsam poplar</a>
(<i>Populus balsamifera</i> ssp. <i>balsamifera</i>) is also
classified in the genus and is covered in a separate FEIS summary. Both
subspecies are in the <i>Tacamahaca </i>section of the <i>Populus </i>genus [<a href="#41">41</a>].

<p>Black cottonwood commonly hybridizes with other members
of the <i> Tacamahaca</i> section, such as narrowleaf cottonwood (<i>P. angustifolia</i>) and
balsam poplar [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>]. Balsam poplar × black cottonwood hybrids
have been reported in Alaska, British Columbia, and Alberta [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>].
</p>

<p> Hybrids
with members of the <i>Aigeiros</i> section are also observed. Eastern cottonwood
(<i>P. deltoides </i>var. <i>occidentalis</i>) × black cottonwood hybrids have been reported near Flathead Lake, Montana
[<a href="#69">69</a>], and Fremont cottonwood (<i>P. fremontii</i>) × black cottonwood hybrids (<i>P</i>. ×
<i>parryi</i>  Sarg.) [<a href="#86">86</a>]
grow in California [<a href="#35">35</a>]. Black cottonwood has also hybridized with black poplar (<i>P.
nigra</i>), a Eurasian species<i> </i>[<a href="#41">41</a>]. Intersectional hybridization does
not occur beyond the F<sub>1</sub> generation in most cases, but this type of introgression
probably occurred in the past where the ranges of eastern and western species
overlap [<a href="#41">41</a>].</p>

GENERAL DISTRIBUTION:</a>
</span>
<br />


Black cottonwood is distributed from the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska to Baja
California, east to Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana,
North Dakota, and Alberta [<a href="#77">77</a>].&nbsp; The <a href="http://climchange.cr.usgs.gov/data/atlas/little/">U.S. Geological Survey</a>
provides a map of black cottonwood's distribution.


<p>In Alaska and the Yukon Territory, black cottonwood
is primarily a coastal species, though 2 interior populations have been
studied in the Yukon [<a href="#73">73</a>]. Black cottonwood is present in British Columbia in
a thin strip along
the coast in the northern portion of the province and across most of the southern
portion [<a href="#28">28</a>]. It is present in only in the southwestern part of Alberta, often intergrading
with balsam poplar [<a href="#69">69</a>]. In Montana, black cottonwood is widespread west of the continental divide, and present in central and eastern Montana
in higher elevations [<a href="#59">59</a>]. In California black cottonwood is
widespread, though absent from the Mojave and Sonoran deserts of the southeastern
portion of the state [<a href="#67">67</a>]. The species is present throughout Idaho,
Washington, and Oregon. Black cottonwood is not widespread in Utah, Wyoming, or North Dakota. It is
found only in
Utah, Washington, and Wasatch counties in Utah; in Sweetwater,
Uinta, and Teton counties of Wyoming; and in
Foster, Golden Valley, Grand Forks, Grant, and Griggs counties of North Dakota
[<a href="#37">37</a>]. Black cottonwood is present only in the northern part of the Baja
California in 2 isolated populations [<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>].

</span>
<br />


Alaska: In the Tanana, Yukon, and Susitna valleys, black cottonwood and
balsam poplar stands are some of the most productive in Alaska. American green alder
(<i>Alnus viridus </i>var.<i> crispa</i>) and thinleaf alder (<i>A. incana </i>ssp.
<i>tenuifolia</i>) are usually present throughout stand development; willows (<i>Salix</i>
spp.) are less
common when cottonwood and balsam poplar are mature. Common
associates include prickly rose (<i>Rosa acicularis</i>), viburnum (<i>Viburnum </i>spp.),
red-osier dogwood (<i>Cornus sericea</i>), devil's club (<i>Oplopanax horridus</i>),
horsetails (<i>Equisetum</i>  spp.), and bluejoint (<i>Calamagrostis canadensis</i>)<i> </i> [<a href="#101">101</a>].
On Sheep Creek, near Juneau, Alaska, black cottonwood grows with salmonberry (<i>Rubus
spectabilis</i>), elderberry (<i>Sambucus</i> spp.), cranberry, and Sitka alder (<i>Alnus
viridis </i>ssp.<i> sinuata</i>) [<a href="#12">12</a>].&nbsp;On the Kenai Peninsula black cottonwood is common on wet
sites; co-dominants include balsam poplar, black spruce (<i>Picea mariana</i>),
Scouler's willow (<i>Salix scouleriana</i>), Barclay's willow (<i>S. barclayi</i>), and
American green alder [<a href="#135">135</a>,<a href="#155">155</a>].

<p>
Yukon: Stanek and others [<a href="#137">137</a>] describes &quot;<i>Populus balsamifera</i>&quot;
(likely including black cottonwood, balsam poplar, and their hybrids) in
the mountain alder (<i>Alnus incana)</i>-balsam poplar-field horsetail<i> </i> (<i>Equisetum arvense</i>)
vegetation type as well as the balsam poplar-arctic lupine (<i>Lupinus arcticus)</i>-bog birch (<i>Betula nana</i>) vegetation type. The
former is confined to permafrost-free terraces and floodplains,
and the latter is present on southwest aspects on lower slopes on alluvium.
</p>

<p>British Columbia: On floodplains, black cottonwood is
dominant, commonly with red-osier dogwood. Western redcedar (<i>Thuja
plicata</i>) and hybrid white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>)<i> </i>× Engelmann
spruce (<i>P. engelmannii</i>), though present,
typically do not become dominant because of frequent flooding and sediment
deposition [<a href="#57">57</a>]. Other codominants in these black cottonwood communities include
Pacific willow (<i>Salix lucida </i>ssp.<i> lasiandra</i>), red alder (<i>Alnus rubra</i>),
Sitka alder, Himalayan blackberry (<i>Rubus discolor</i>), devil's club, stink
currant (<i>Ribes bracteosum</i>), and
occasionally Sitka spruce (<i>Picea sitchensis</i>) [<a href="#81">81</a>]. Forbs in
black cottonwood dominated floodplains include fragrant bedstraw (<i>Galium triflorum</i>), horsetails,
liverleaf wintergreen (<i>Pyrola asarifolia</i>), small enchanter's nightshade (<i>Circaea
alpina</i>), common lady
fern (<i>Athyrium filix-femina</i>), starry false Solomon's-seal (<i>Maianthemum
stellatum</i>), sweetcicely (<i>Osmorhiza berteroi</i>), dwarf red blackberry (<i>Rubus
pubescens</i>), bride's feathers (<i>Aruncus dioicus</i>), common cowparsnip (<i>Heracleum
maximum</i>), stinging nettle (<i>Urtica dioica</i>), slough sedge (<i>Carex obnupta</i>), and
arctic sweet coltsfoot (<i>Petasites frigidus </i>var.<i> palmatus</i>) [<a href="#57">57</a>].&nbsp;
Along the Blaeberry River near Golden, British Columbia, black cottonwood and
white spruce are codominant on &quot;stable&quot; islands; dwarf fireweed (<i>Epilobium latifolium</i>)
is dominant in the understory
and Hervey's aster (<i>Aster hesperius</i>), Lindley's aster (<i>A. ciliolatus</i>),
scarlet Indian paintbrush (<i>Castilleja
miniata</i>), northern green orchid (<i>Platanthera hyperborea</i>), and
Aleutian selfheal (<i>Prunella vulgaris</i>) are also present [<a href="#46">46</a>].
Other woody species in these floodplain communities include quaking aspen (<i>Populus
tremuloides</i>), Farr's willow (<i>Salix farriae</i>), and Wolf's willow (<i>S. wolfii</i>).
</p>

<p>Western Washington: Black cottonwood is an early
seral species in western hemlock (<i>Tsuga heterophylla</i>) communities including
western hemlock/skunk cabbage (<i>Lysichiton americanus</i>), western hemlock/common lady fern, and western
hemlock/devil's club habitat types. It is also present in wet and/or cool
grand fir (<i>Abies grandis</i>), Douglas-fir, and western redcedar habitat
types [<a href="#147">147</a>]. On the Hoh River on the Olympic Peninsula, a Sitka spruce-bigleaf maple-black cottonwood association occurs
on first terraces. Subdominant trees include red alder and Douglas-fir and
western hemlock if the site is not disturbed. The understory of these communities includes
the grasses redtop (<i>Agrostis gigantea</i>) and fowl bluegrass (<i>Poa palustris</i>) and the forbs
Oregon oxalis (<i>Oxalis oregana</i>), western sword fern (<i>Polystichum munitum</i>), and
small enchanter's nightshade [<a href="#44">44</a>].
</p>

<p>Eastern Washington and northern Idaho: Black
cottonwood frequently occurs (though never in great abundance) in the seral
stages of the development of western hemlock and western redcedar habitat types,
and is sometimes a minor component of old-growth stands of these types [<a href="#99">99</a>].
Black cottonwood is prevalent at lower elevations on floodplains and
terraces where frequently it is mixed with ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir
[<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>]. In drier
areas, like the Palouse River, black cottonwood is dominant with western water
hemlock (<i>Cicuta douglasii</i>) dominant in the understory. Many of these communities have been
disturbed by human activities [<a href="#32">32</a>]. In mountainous areas of
eastern Washington, Idaho, and northwestern Montana, black cottonwood sometimes
grows in avalanche chutes with mountain alder, Saskatoon serviceberry, Rocky Mountain maple (<i>Acer glabrum</i>), and quaking aspen
[<a href="#56">56</a>].
</p>

<p>Oregon: In bottomland forests of the Willamette
Valley of western Oregon, black cottonwood, Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga
menziesii</i>), big-leaf maple (<i>Acer macrophyllum</i>), and
white ash (<i>Fraxinus americana</i>) are common, all occurring with about the same density.
Subdominant trees in these communities include
Oregon white oak (<i>Quercus garryana</i>), California laurel (<i>Umbellularia californica</i>),
alder (<i>Alnus spp.</i>), bitter cherry (<i>Prunus emarginata</i>), and willows, and the understory usually includes Oregon- grape (<i>Mahonia
repens</i>), salmonberry, rose (<i>Rosa</i>  spp.), Douglas' spiraea (<i>Spiraea
douglasii</i>), Pacific ninebark (<i>Physocarpus capitatus</i>), and Pursh's
buckthorn (<i>Frangula purshiana</i>).
Many of
these community types have declined due to cultivation and hydrologic
alterations [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#136">136</a>]. In the Catherine Creek watershed of eastern
Oregon, black cottonwood is dominant with ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus
ponderosa</i>) in structurally diverse riparian communities.
Subdominants include mountain alder, black hawthorn (<i>Crataegeus
douglasii</i>), Woods' rose, Kentucky bluegrass (<i>Poa pratensis</i>), and common snowberry
(<i>Symphoricarpos albus</i>). Black
cottonwood is commonly the only tree present on recently formed gravel bars
[<a href="#79">79</a>].
</p>

<p>
California: In the North Coast Ranges and Klamath Mountains,
black
cottonwood grows with red alder; older stands with less disturbance also
support grand fir, Sitka spruce, Douglas-fir, western redcedar, or western
hemlock.&nbsp;Black cottonwood is dominant in montane riparian forests of the Sierra Nevada
where Jeffrey pine (<i>Pinus jeffreyi</i>) is a common associate; shrub cover
(red-osier
dogwood, western juniper (<i>Juniperus occidentalis</i>), willows, and common
chokecherry) is commonly about 25% [<a href="#70">70</a>]. In southern California, Fremont cottonwood is dominant along
washes and streams in lower elevations and black cottonwood is dominant in
similar habitats at higher elevations [<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#146">146</a>]. Common associates
in the black cottonwood communities include bigleaf maple, white alder (<i>Alnus rhombifolia</i>),
willows, and California laurel [<a href="#146">146</a>]. In the South Coast Ranges, Fremont cottonwood and
California sycamore (<i>Platanus
racemosa</i>) are dominant, but black cottonwood and coast live oak (<i>Quercus agrifolia</i>) are also
present [<a href="#70">70</a>]. Off the coast near Santa Barbara, on Santa Rosa,
Santa Cruz, and Santa Catalina islands, riparian woodlands are dominated by
black cottonwood with Fremont cottonwood; Tracy willow (<i>Salix lasiolepis</i> var.
<i> lasiolepis</i>) and blue elder (<i>Sambucus mexicana</i>) are also present. Herbaceous vegetation
consists of saltgrass (<i>Distichlis spicata</i>), annual rabbitsfoot
grass (<i>Polypogon monspeliensis</i>), redtop, and tropical medicineplant (<i>Adenostoma
verbesina</i>) [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>]. Near drainageways in the San Dimas Forest near Los Angeles, black
cottonwood is a dominant with coast live oak, California sycamore, bigleaf
maple, white alder, and willows in open stands [<a href="#40">40</a>].
</p>

<p>Alberta: In southern Alberta, most riparian
communities in the semi-arid portion of the province are dominated by cottonwoods, including black
cottonwood, eastern cottonwood (<i>Populus deltoides</i>),&nbsp; narrowleaf
cottonwood (<i>P. angustifolia</i>), and balsam poplar. Shrubs include common chokecherry (<i>Prunus virginiana</i>), Saskatoon serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier
alnifolia</i>), Wood's rose, and
western snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos occidentalis</i>) [<a href="#49">49</a>].
</p>

<p>North Dakota: Black cottonwood occurs with green ash
(<i>Fraxinus pennsylvanica</i>) and American elm (<i>Ulmus americana</i>) in riparian areas in western North Dakota
[<a href="#71">71</a>].
</p>

<p>Montana: In
western Montana, the most common codominant tree with black cottonwood is ponderosa
pine. Others include Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, western redcedar, Rocky Mountain juniper
(<i>Juniperus scopulorum</i>), and
quaking aspen. The shrub component includes Wood's rose, mountain alder, Bebb willow (<i>Salix
bebbiana</i>), common chokecherry, red-osier dogwood,
western snowberry, and common snowberry
[<a href="#60">60</a>]. Herbaceous
species commonly dominant include quackgrass (<i>Elytrigia repens</i>),
Kentucky bluegrass, creeping bentgrass (<i>Agrostis
stolonifera</i>), starry false Solomon's seal, Virginia strawberry (<i>Fragaria virginiana</i>), and
fragrant bedstraw [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>]. In central and eastern Montana black cottonwood grows with narrowleaf and
eastern cottonwoods in transitional zones (narrowleaf and eastern cottonwoods
are dominant at lower elevations) [<a href="#60">60</a>]. Along the North Fork of the
Flathead River, near Glacier National Park, 3 black cottonwood community
types were studied by Jenkins and Wright [<a href="#75">75</a>].&nbsp; In early successional
communities the black cottonwood overstory is approximately 50%. Coniferous
canopy cover is low (&lt;5%), and shrubs are not prominent. Other species
present on these sites include common yarrow (<i>Achillea millefolium</i>),
mountain alder, asters (<i>Aster</i> spp.), fireweed (<i>Epilobium</i> spp.),
prairie Junegrass (<i>Koeleria macrantha</i>), timothy (<i>Phleum pratense</i>),
bluegrass (<i>Poa</i> spp.), and Canada goldenrod (<i>Solidago canadensis</i>).
In later-successional community types the canopy cover of hybrid spruce (white
spruce<i> </i>× Engelmann spruce) increases to approximately 50% and gradually
replaces black cottonwood. Shrubs include red-osier dogwood, roses (<i>R</i><i>osa</i>
spp.), and common snowberry; these species become less prominent with increasing
hybrid spruce canopy cover.
</p>

<p>Eastern and southern Idaho: Black cottonwood/red-osier dogwood is a common community type; it develops best along large rivers but
is also present in narrow bands along small streams in the subalpine zone [<a href="#58">58</a>]. Subdominant members of the
overstory include narrowleaf cottonwood,&nbsp; lanceleaf cottonwood (<i>P. acuminata</i>),
and peachleaf willow (<i>Salix amygdaloides</i> var. <i>wrightii</i>). Common shrub associates include
sandbar willow (<i>Salix exigua</i>), water birch (<i>Betula occidentalis</i>), yellow willow
(<i>Salix lutea</i>), and Wood's rose [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].
</p>

<p>Nevada: Confined to riparian areas, black cottonwood commonly grows with
lanceleaf and narrowleaf cottonwoods, with these 3 species having
approximately 85% canopy cover. Wood's rose is prominent in
these habitats (25-90% canopy cover); currants (<i>Ribes</i>  spp.) and
red-osier
dogwood are also common [<a href="#90">90</a>]. In central Nevada, black cottonwood
is sometimes associated with big sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i>) [<a href="#15">15</a>].&nbsp;

GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS:</a>

<br />

 Black cottonwood typically has a straight, branch-free trunk for more than half
its length and a broad, open crown [<a href="#11">11</a>]. In closed stands, the crown tends to be
narrow, with few branches growing into the lower 2/3<sup>rds</sup> of the trunk [<a href="#117">117</a>].
Black cottonwood develops extensive forests along major rivers, narrow forests
along smaller streams, and sometimes irregular populations on gravel bars,
floodplains, and terraces [<a href="#58">58</a>]. Establishment by seed is episodic, often creating
stands of several well-defined age groups [<a href="#89">89</a>]. Black cottonwood is a fast growing,
native deciduous tree, growing to 100 feet (30 m)
high [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>] though occasionally as high as 160 feet (50 m) [<a href="#159">159</a>]. Basal diameter is commonly 3.5 to 5 feet (1-1.5 m)
[<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>]. Black cottonwood commonly lives 100 to 200 (or occasionally more)
years [<a href="#19">19</a>].

<p>
Flowers grow in catkins. Staminate catkins are
usually about 1 inch (2-3 cm) long, though occasionally up to 2 inches (5 cm)
long. Pistillate catkins are 3 to 8 inches (8-20 cm) long
[<a href="#68">68</a>].&nbsp;Capsules are subsessile and 0.2 to 0.32 inch (5-8 mm) long; each
capsule contains 3 (occasionally 2 or 4) carpels [<a href="#156">156</a>]. Seeds bear long, white, &quot;cotton&quot; fibers that aid in
dispersal via wind and/or water [<a href="#57">57</a>]. Each cottonwood seed weighs approximately
0.3 to 0.6 mg [<a href="#19">19</a>].
</p>

<p>Much
genetic variation occurs in black cottonwood with respect to flooding
tolerance [<a href="#130">130</a>] and cold tolerance [<a href="#92">92</a>]; responses to these
extremes are influenced by the site from which experimental
cuttings are gathered [<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>].
</p>

<p>Roots: Black cottonwood develops a &quot;shallow,
spreading root system&quot; [<a href="#11">11</a>]. In the <i> Tacamahaca</i> section rooting depth
is commonly 10 to 16 feet (3-5 m), occasionally deeper [<a href="#19">19</a>]. Roots
of the <i>Populus</i> genus have well-developed laterals. Eighty percent of the roots of a black cottonwood × plains
cottonwood hybrid were horizontal roots (oriented between 0° and 30°).
Horizontal roots grow between approximately 2 and 8 inches (5 to 20 cm) below
the soil surface. Some roots observed in this study, termed
&quot;sinker&quot; roots, originated as horizontal roots, extended laterally a
short distance, and then grew downward much like a taproot [<a href="#113">113</a>].&nbsp;
Fine root production in black cottonwood is episodic and much
more variable than the production and survival of leaves [<a href="#113">113</a>].
</p>

<p>Mycorrhizal colonization of cottonwoods may be influenced by
stand development stage and site characteristics. Members of the <i>Populus </i>genus are typically
ectomycorrhizal [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>], but may be colonized by
arbuscular mycorrhizal
fungi early in stand development or when the site is flooded [<a href="#38">38</a>].

REGENERATION PROCESSES:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT">
Breeding system:</font>   Flowers are unisexual and all members of the genus are dioecious
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>], though a small number of hermaphroditic or male flowers
have been observed on female trees in black cottonwood [<a href="#139">139</a>].&nbsp;In some black
cottonwood populations sex
ratio is skewed, with male trees dominant on
warm, dry sites. In other populations the relationship between site and sex
ratio is apparently random [<a href="#19">19</a>].<br><br>

<font face="Bell MT">
Pollination:</font> Black cottonwood is wind pollinated [<a href="#41">41</a>].&nbsp;<br><br>

<font face="Bell MT">
Seed production:</font>  Black cottonwood is typically produces seed after
7 to 10 years of age [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>]. Seed production is &quot;copious&quot; [<a href="#2">2</a>], with about 30 to 50 seeds per capsule
[<a href="#16">16</a>]. Seed production is consistent, with large crops every year [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>].<br><br>

<font face="Bell MT">
Seed dispersal:</font>  Seeds are lightweight; this characteristic, as well as
the
&quot;cotton&quot; from the seed pod, allow seeds to be carried by water or wind [<a href="#57">57</a>]. These are the general means of dispersal for all cottonwoods; seeds
travel &quot;several hundred meters&quot;, in some cases up to
&quot;several kilometers&quot; (distances are estimates). Seed dispersal occurs when river flows begin to decline
after spring peak flows, sometimes as late as mid-summer. If flows are too high
seeds may be carried for so long that they lose viability before they reach
a favorable microsite [<a href="#19">19</a>].<br><br> 

<font face="Bell MT">
Seed banking:</font>   As is common in plants that colonize disturbed habitats,
initial viability is high, but propagules are short-lived [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>]. Seed
viability under natural conditions is estimated to be
1 to 2 weeks, and once a seed is wetted it needs to be deposited within 2 to 3
days to establish [<a href="#19">19</a>].<br><br>

<font face="Bell MT">Germination:</font>   When moist mineral soil is exposed
germination rates are high, particularly when moist conditions persist for a
month after seed deposition [<a href="#57">57</a>]. The process of germination is
about 24 hours long. The
high initial mortality of seedlings&nbsp; is &quot;clearly a limiting factor in
the life cycle of cottonwoods&quot; [<a href="#19">19</a>].<br><br> 

<font face="Bell MT">Seedling establishment/growth:</font> Seedling mortality is very
high because of specific moisture requirements after germination; root growth in members of the
<i> Populus</i> genus during
the first 12 hours after germination is suppressed by low moisture [<a href="#113">113</a>].
Mortality in seedlings most commonly arises when root growth rates are<font face="Bell MT">
not as fast as the recession of the water table </font>[<a href="#57">57</a>]. Root growth rates
for black cottonwood seedlings are some of the highest among cottonwoods: up to
0.48 inch per day (12 mm/day) [<a href="#19">19</a>]. Thus moisture
conditions in the 1<sup>st</sup> month of establishment are a defining factor in survival
[<a href="#126">126</a>]. The
rate of root development is much greater than that of the shoot in cottonwoods;
after 46 days of growth a group of balsam poplar × eastern cottonwood hybrid
seedlings had a mean leaf area of 0.16 inch<sup>2</sup> (1 cm<sup>2</sup>) and a
root system that was 7 inches (17 cm) in length (in a &quot;simulated riparian
environment&quot;) [<a href="#113">113</a>]. Seedling density on new point bars can range from 2 to 40/foot<sup>2</sup> 
(23- 460/m<sup>2</sup>). The seeds have little endosperm: optimal
sunlight and moisture are required for carbohydrate synthesis early in establishment,
and, for this reason, seedling establishment in existing vegetation is very low. Though floods often distribute seeds widely, few seedlings survive where vegetation is developed [<a href="#121">121</a>]. Seedlings are able to withstand inundation and sediment deposition; this
process aids cottonwood establishment as it removes possible competitors [<a href="#19">19</a>].&nbsp;Because of differential soil
moisture conditions, &quot;banding&quot; of seedlings with respect to elevation rather than
distance from the river has been observed at Oldman River near Lethbridge,
Alberta. Following flood on the Oldman River, seedling growth was rapid.
Mean height was 0.8 inch (2 cm) with a range of 0 to 6 inches (15 cm) after 1 growing
season. After
2 growing seasons mean height was 3 inches (8 cm), with a maximum of 20 inches (51 cm) [<a href="#121">121</a>].&nbsp; Black cottonwoods
that had established from seed near Camas, Washington grew in 9 years to 50 feet
(15 m) tall and 7 inches (17 cm) in diameter [<a href="#11">11</a>]. At another site in Washington average height in a pure stand of 4-year-old
trees was 33 feet (10 m) [<a href="#57">57</a>]. Though floods can initiate seedling establishment, ice jams
and turbulent
melting associated with spring runoff often scour seedlings established in
preceding years [<a href="#121">121</a>].<br><br>

<p>
Cottonwood establishment by seed is episodic, depending on seed viability at time
of deposition (which depends on the magnitude of flows) and on moisture
conditions in the first month of growth [<a href="#89">89</a>]. Suitable conditions for seedling
establishment sometimes occur (erratically) in approximately 5 to 10 year
intervals [<a href="#19">19</a>]. Scott and others [<a href="#128">128</a>] studied patterns of cottonwood recruitment with respect
to different fluvial processes. They found that studying recruitment is
often biased by dating trees from growth rings at ground surface; this method
was found to underestimate by an average of 5.1
years (range was 0 to 34 years) because of sediment deposition after establishment.
Because of light requirements seedling establishment seldom occurs
on sites where cottonwood is already dominant and other vegetation is established [<a href="#19">19</a>]. Most regeneration in
established forests is by
&quot;root suckers&quot; or coppice sprouts. On &quot;older islands&quot; studied in southern British Columbia,
root suckers were the most common means of regeneration. On more recently exposed
sites seedlings were 95% of dense stands; the other 5% were derived from twigs [<a href="#47">47</a>].
</p>

<p> Scott and
others [<a href="#128">128</a>] summarized how different geomorphic processes influence the type
of cottonwood stand that will be established:&nbsp;

<font face="Bell MT">
Asexual regeneration:</font>    Cottonwood recruitment is commonly
asexual, via root suckering [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>], coppice sprouting [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>], or cladoptosis (the physiological abscission of
twigs with leaves still attached) [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>]. The means of
regeneration depends site characteristics and whether or not
black cottonwood is already present.
</p>

<p>
Cladoptosis is an important means of regeneration of black cottonwood on gravel
bars [<a href="#36">36</a>]. This
means of asexual reproduction is most viable in moist climates; because of hot,
dry summers it apparently does not occur in Alberta [<a href="#50">50</a>]. In laboratory conditions up to 95% of
freshly collected, abscised twigs produced roots (the greatest rooting was in twigs
shed in October) [<a href="#47">47</a>]. Branches of black
cottonwood that are broken off often grow when deposited in fresh alluvium; this
was observed following the Mt. St. Helens mudflows [<a href="#1">1</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
 Rood and others [<a href="#120">120</a>] studied origins of cottonwood saplings
along the Oldman River in Alberta. Where sprouting occurred it was most
 often the result of flood damage. When floods removed stems, root suckering was
 induced, and when floods buried stems, shoot sprouting was induced [<a href="#120">120</a>]. Hansen and others [<a href="#59">59</a>] stated that the sprouting ability of black cottonwood is less than
that of narrowleaf cottonwood but greater than that of eastern cottonwood [<a href="#59">59</a>]; the findings of Rood and others
[<a href="#120">120</a>], given below, at least partially refute
that.

Soils: Hansen and others [<a href="#60">60</a>] state that black cottonwood mature stands &quot;occur
on a wide range of soil textures but are most numerous on medium- to
coarse-textured, well-drained soils [<a href="#60">60</a>]. Soils are Mollisols in older
communities and Fluvents in younger communities [<a href="#62">62</a>]. Black cottonwood
has high nutrient requirements, particularly for calcium and magnesium and is,
for this reason, not common on soils characterized by acid humus [<a href="#57">57</a>].
Optimal soil pH for black cottonwood growth is between 5 and 7 [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>]. On the Blaeberry River,
British Columbia, black cottonwood grew on stable coarse-textured
islands, never in silty depression areas; these were dominated by sedges (<i>Carex</i> spp.)
[<a href="#46">46</a>].

<p>
Climate: Black cottonwood grows in a wide variety of climates, including coastal
areas receiving 140 inches (3,500 mm) of annual precipitation and arid areas receiving
6 to 8 inches (150 to 200 mm), though in the latter climate the species is more
restricted to wet habitats [<a href="#11">11</a>].&nbsp; Black cottonwood is not present in the most humid areas
of British Columbia (immediately along the coast); it is more common in &quot;marginally subalpine
climates&quot; [<a href="#57">57</a>].

Water table: Harrington [<a href="#63">63</a>] states that black cottonwood is very tolerant of short-duration flooding,
and Hansen and others [<a href="#60">60</a>] have found it to be &quot;very tolerant of frequent and
prolonged flooding.&quot; In any case, the water
level is close to the surface in nearly all areas where black cottonwood is
dominant [<a href="#45">45</a>], though sometimes black cottonwood colonizes avalanche
chutes on steep slopes [<a href="#56">56</a>]. Because black cottonwood requires water with
dissolved oxygen content, it grows better along moving water than near stagnant
water [<a href="#57">57</a>].

Black cottonwood is a pioneer and early seral species [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>]. It and
other members of the <i>Populus</i> genus are some of the fastest growing temperate trees, an
adaptation useful for pioneering disturbed sites [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>]. Any activity that exposes moist, mineral soil
in full sunlight creates a
favorable habitat for black cottonwood seedlings, particularly when seed trees are nearby
[<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].&nbsp; Black cottonwood is very shade intolerant [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>]. The species can tolerate flooding and
sediment deposition; when young stems are covered by sediment during floods, sprouts grow from the
stem towards the current [<a href="#2">2</a>].

<p>
In wet
climates in forest clearings on non-alluvial sites black cottonwood is a common pioneer, but these
stands are generally small and soon overtaken by secondary succession conifers
such as Douglas-fir, western hemlock, western redcedar, Sitka spruce, Engelmann
spruce, white spruce, or grand fir. Similarly, black cottonwood, in moist
climates like that of the Pacific Northwest, colonizes agricultural clearings
where mineral soil is exposed and light penetration is high [<a href="#19">19</a>].
</p>

<p>In southeastern Alaska, stages of community development
include pioneer, mid-successional willow-alder, and climax white spruce-western hemlock communities.
The pioneer community includes mosses and lichens (<i>Rhacomitrium</i> and <i>Sterocaulon</i>)
with mountainavens (<i>Dryas</i> spp.). The mid-successional willow-alder stage
includes Sitka alder, black cottonwood, Sitka
willow (<i>Salix sitchensis</i>), and Alaska bog willow (<i>S. fuscescens</i>).
Following the willow-alder stage, in the absence of
disturbance, white spruce and western hemlock eventually become dominant [<a href="#6">6</a>]. In a generalized model of forest succession following
fire in Alaska, Viereck [<a href="#153">153</a>] stated that balsam poplar and black cottonwood
were not &quot;climax&quot; species but were invaders, along with quaking
aspen,
after fires on relatively warm sites. Stands 70
to 80 years after fire consist &quot;of white spruce and hardwood trees without a
closed overstory&quot; [<a href="#155">155</a>].
</p>

<p>On the Hoh River of the Olympic Mountains in Washington,
5 successional
stages are defined with respect to site age. Red alder and Scouler's willow are
dominant on the newest gravel bars, red alder alone dominates 80- to
100-year-old floodplains, an Engelmann spruce-bigleaf maple-black cottonwood
association is present on &quot;1<sup>st</sup> terraces&quot; that are approximately 400
years old, Sitka spruce and western hemlock dominate on &quot;2<sup>nd</sup>
terraces&quot; approximately 750 years old, and western hemlock is the dominant on
&quot;3<sup>rd</sup> terraces&quot; [<a href="#44">44</a>].
</p>

<p>On the McKenzie River of Oregon, 3 early distinct
types of early successional vegetation were identified: black cottonwood communities, red alder communities,
and willow communities. In the absence of fire or flooding the black cottonwood
stage is succeeded by a western hemlock/western sword fern/ Oregon oxalis climax; in the presence of fire, the black cottonwood stage
is followed by a Douglas-fir/ beaked hazelnut (<i>Corylus cornuta</i>)/ western
sword fern community [<a href="#64">64</a>].
</p>

<p> In black
cottonwood habitat types of southern and eastern Idaho, black cottonwood
establishes on recent gravel bars and remains dominant if there is continual
flooding and sediment deposition. Without this disturbance the community is
gradually replaced by Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, or Rocky Mountain
juniper, but occasionally yellow willow or Geyer's willow (<i>Salix geyeriana</i>) will become dominant
[<a href="#58">58</a>]. Similar succession has been described in California, where it was
found that flood control leads to conifer types in California [<a href="#70">70</a>].
</p>

<p>
In the Swan Valley of western Montana, on wet portions of grand fir habitat
types, paper birch (<i>Betula papyrifera</i>) and black cottonwood pioneer clearcuts or seed-tree cuts where
mineral soil has been exposed; after these partially develop, Douglas-fir, grand
fir, western white pine (<i>Pinus monticola</i>), and spruce establish [<a href="#7">7</a>]. In Glacier National Park, as well as Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia,
black cottonwood is a common, though often short-lived component of early to mid-seral successional stages in western redcedar-western hemlock forests [<a href="#55">55</a>]

<br />

In poplars, shoot elongation continues after bud burst. Leaves mature and
expand throughout the growing season which is defined, at least partially, by photoperiod
[<a href="#117">117</a>].&nbsp; All temperate members of the genus flower in the spring before
leaf growth initiation [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>], as is typical of plants that depend on wind dispersal
[<a href="#57">57</a>]. Three or four weeks before flowers develop in the
spring, the following year's inflorescences develop at leaf nodes [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<p>Seasonal development of black cottonwood has been
studied in detail in British Columbia, Yellowstone National Park, and northern
Idaho. Black cottonwood flowers in late March or early April
until late May in coastal British Columbia, though in the interior flowering may not
occur until the middle of June. Leaves appear after flowers. Fruit ripens about a month after flowers appear; seed dispersal occurs between
late April and July [<a href="#57">57</a>].
</p>

<p>Phenology of black cottonwood was studied in
Yellowstone National Park (east of continental divide) [<a href="#125">125</a>]:&nbsp;

<font face="Bell MT">

Fire Adaptations:</font> Black cottonwood is frequently damaged by fire with low-severity burns even often causing &quot;considerable injury&quot; [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].
Young black cottonwood trees and seedlings are usually killed by fire regardless
of severity [<a href="#24">24</a>]. Severe fire kills or top-kills even older trees. In low- and moderate-severity fires older trees with
thick bark may not be top-killed [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>]. In members of the <i>Populus</i> genus
stem bark remains thin for longer than in other trees [<a href="#41">41</a>]. Though old trees have increased fire resistance due to
thicker, furrowed bark, they have higher fuel loading and more heartrot,
which can increase fire severity [<a href="#49">49</a>].&nbsp;Trunks that are not top-killed may
be more susceptible to <i> Cytospora</i> spp., and other fungal pathogens; this was observed
near D'Arcy in southern British
Columbia [<a href="#34">34</a>].<p class="subframeContent">Black cottonwood sprouts from stumps,
charred boles, root crowns, or lateral roots following fire [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>] and
because of this has been referred to as a fire &quot;endurer&quot; rather than
&quot;resister&quot; [<a href="#3">3</a>]. Fire-induced sprouting is more common in the <i>Tacamahaca</i>
section than in the <i>Aigeiros</i> section. Rates of sprouting are highest
if fire occurs when
cottonwoods are dormant [<a href="#49">49</a>]; this time also has the highest
probability of fire, with late summer and fall, or late winter (in low snow
years) most common [<a href="#58">58</a>]. In general older trees sprout less than
young trees [<a href="#49">49</a>], and sprout survival is highest when the water
table is close to the surface [<a href="#58">58</a>]. In 1986, Coates and
Haeussler [<a href="#28">28</a>] stated that there was little information regarding black
cottonwood sprout vigor
after fire, or impact of fire severity on sprouting potential. Though this is
still at least partially true, a study of clonal reproduction after fire in
Alberta by Gom and Rood [<a href="#49">49</a>] provides much useful data that is summarized in
the &quot;Fire Effects&quot; section of this species summary.<p class="subframeContent">
Black cottonwood is not only a fire &quot;endurer&quot; but also a fire
&quot;invader.&quot; Fire can improve seedling establishment by increasing light
penetration and exposing mineral soil to allow seedling
establishment if moisture is available [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>]. Increases in light
penetration following fire also aid establishment [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Black cottonwood seedlings have been observed 1 year after
stand-replacing fire in upland ponderosa pine/ Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir
habitat on the Bitterroot National Forest, Montana. The seedlings
grew in cavities in mineral soil after the root systems of large
trees had burned [<a href="#131">131</a>]. A study of seedling establishment (artificially seeded)
of balsam poplar after experimental fires in a black spruce habitat demonstrated
the dependency of the species on mineral soil exposure for germination and
survival. Fire was prescribed on 1 m<sup>2</sup> plots.
On moderately burned plots 17 black cottonwood germinated, 1 survived 1 year, and 0 survived 3
years. On heavily burned plots 71 germinated, 39 survived 1 year, and 39
survived 3 years [<a href="#158">158</a>].

<p>
Fire is infrequent on recently formed gravel bars, but when it does occur, damage to
cottonwoods is greatest because their root systems have not developed [<a href="#58">58</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Fire Regimes: </font> Historic fire regimes have not been explicitly studied in black
cottonwood communities [<a href="#10">10</a>]. It has been speculated that because of high moisture content and rapid decomposition of litter in riparian
forests,
frequency of fire is less than it is in adjacent areas [<a href="#132">132</a>]. These factors could
protect forested riparian sites when severe fires occur on adjacent uplands.
Conversely, wind-driven fires
beginning in adjacent upland communities may spread to riparian forests,
particularly when fuel accumulation on upland sites has increased as a result of
fire suppression [<a href="#132">132</a>]. Arno [<a href="#10">10</a>] states that black cottonwood forests along
major rivers of the Pacific Northwest likely burned frequently, as they were
historically surrounded by communities characterized by high fire frequency,
such as ponderosa pine savannas or sagebrush steppes. Fires could have
easily spread from adjacent communities; prior to widespread livestock grazing
and irrigation, dry grassy fuels were more continuous than they are currently
[<a href="#10">10</a>]. When fires do occur, they are most severe in older cottonwood stands where fuel accumulation is highest [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>].<p class="subframeContent">Fire regimes for plant
communities and ecosystems in which black cottonwood is dominant are summarized
below. For further information regarding fire regimes and fire ecology of
communities and ecosystems where black cottonwood is found, see the &quot;Fire
Ecology and Adaptations&quot; section of the FEIS species summary for the plant

Black cottonwood sprouts from the lateral roots, root crown, and bole after
top-kill by fire [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>]. It also establishes from seed [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>,<a href="#158">158</a>]. Gom and Rood [<a href="#49">49</a>] studied the effects of
severe fires along the Oldman River near Lethbridge, Alberta, which occurred in early and mid-April before cottonwoods' spring bud burst. The fires burned during the afternoon; strong Chinook winds increased fire severity.

Black cottonwood,
narrowleaf cottonwood, plains cottonwood, and hybrids among them dominated
these riparian areas. All cottonwoods observed were girdled by the fires. Fire damage to trunks varied from &quot;slight bark
charring to complete trunk incineration.&quot; This caused 100% top-kill in trees even though not
all canopies were severely damaged, demonstrating the susceptibility of these
cottonwood species to severe fires. The exact amount of mortality was not
determined (because it is difficult to tell from which tree's lateral root
system suckers originate), but mortality was definitely less than 25%, as 75% of
trunks (including all species) produced coppice sprouts. The most severe fires were in older
stands, likely the result of higher fuel accumulation, and there were many pits
in the ground on these sites where root systems were burned. Young stands close to the
river (without as much fuel loading) experienced less canopy damage but were top-killed via girdling.


<p>
Hardwood saplings (cottonwood, alder, willow) less than 2 inches (5 cm) in
diameter experienced 100% mortality in 168 and 42 BTU/second/foot
intensity fires in a
white spruce, quaking aspen, and balsam poplar (likely including some black cottonwood
and hybrids) stand northeast of Edmonton, Alberta [<a href="#80">80</a>].&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
Hall and Hansen [<a href="#58">58</a>] stated that in low and moderate severity fires older black
cottonwood trees
with thick bark may not be top-killed, but little quantitative data examining
the relations between fire severity, tree age, and top-kill or mortality is
available.

One year after the fires along the Oldman River in Alberta (described above),
approximately 75% of the top-killed cottonwoods (including all narrowleaf and
black cottonwoods, and balsam poplar)
produced shoots from remnants of trunks. Sprouting was not observed on
control&nbsp; transects (on adjacent unburned areas). Of the trunks producing sprouts, 90% were from either
narrowleaf or black cottonwood (the 2 species' sprouts were not easily
differentiated). The average number of coppice sprouts was 17 per trunk with a
range of 1 to 60. Height of the tallest sprout on each tree averaged
16 inches (41
cm) and ranged from 3.5 to 30 inches (9-77 cm). The authors speculated that the high
rate of sprouting was in part due to the occurrence of the fires while the
cottonwoods were dormant. The degree of canopy or trunk damage did not have much impact on coppice
sprouting frequency or vigor. Sprouts were even observed from trunks that had burned
to 10 inches (25 cm) below ground. Of trees that experienced &quot;heavy&quot; canopy damage,
60% produced shoots from stumps; 80% of those with &quot;light&quot; damage produced coppice sprouts. The average height of coppice sprouts was not
significantly (p&gt;0.05) affected by the degree of trunk damage, and trunk diameter had no significant (p&gt;0.05)
effect on either the number of coppice
sprouts or the height of sprouts. Over 1,000 root suckers were observed on the study transects, 80% of which were
either narrowleaf or black cottonwood. The density of root suckers (including
all species) was about 1/ 3 m<sup>2</sup>). Suckers were
more common near trees that had many coppice sprouts. After 1 growing season the average height of
root suckers was approximately 3 feet (1 m) [<a href="#49">49</a>]. 

<p>
Transects on the Oldman River were surveyed again 5 years after fire. At this time there
was an average of 4 coppice sprouts per trunk on the
30% of the cottonwoods that still had living sprouts. Average sprout height was
approximately 10 feet (3 m) with a range of 5 to 16 feet (1.5 to 5 m). Of the 34
trunks with surviving coppice sprouts 33 were either narrowleaf or black
cottonwood and 1 was plains cottonwood. Survival of root suckers over the 5 years was about 50%. A density of 1 sprout
per&nbsp; 7 m<sup>2</sup> was observed as 550 sprouts still survived on the transects. The
average height of root suckers increased from about 3 feet (1 m) to 8 feet (2.4
m). Seven root suckers were present on unburned control sites; the authors
stated that these might have been induced by flooding damage 2 years prior to
the survey [<a href="#49">49</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
Gom and Rood [<a href="#49">49</a>] summarized the response of several cottonwood species to
fire, showing the high sprouting/suckering ability of balsam poplar and black
and narrowleaf cottonwoods relative to Fremont and eastern cottonwoods:

FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

To increase the longevity of cottonwood stands managers may choose to prescribe
fire when the stand is in the &quot;pole&quot; stage, as sprouting is high at this point
[<a href="#58">58</a>]. Dormant season, particularly fall, fires induce the most sprouting [<a href="#49">49</a>]. Gom and Rood [<a href="#49">49</a>] suggest that fire- induced sprouting, particularly in old stands,
may be used to regenerate stands much the way flooding disturbance allows
development of new stands. They also state that regeneration may be more rapid
after fire than after flooding because the growth rate of sprouts is about 3 times
greater than that of seedlings.

<p>
If the goal of prescribed fire is to maintain a cottonwood stand, 5 years of grazing exclusion
after fire are recommended [<a href="#58">58</a>].&nbsp;Herbivory and fire interactions
have been well documented for quaking aspen stands. In
the Rocky Mountains (study sites ranged from Jasper National Park, Canada to
Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado), White and others [<a href="#157">157</a>] found that prolific quaking
aspen sprouting after fire could not overcome
the effects of elk grazing, and, with a short fire return interval, quaking aspen stands
would decline.</p>


Fire can be used to maintain black cottonwood stands, but it may cause negative impacts such as erosion and sedimentation. These impacts both on the site of fire and
on sites downstream can be increased by heavy postfire rainfall [<a href="#132">132</a>].

The wood of cottonwood is light-colored, lightweight and uniform in texture, but
it is easily decayed and not very strong [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>]. Wood properties of black
cottonwood were described by Overholser [<a href="#106">106</a>]: weight per cubic foot
is 24 pounds (when moisture is 12%), specific gravity when oven dry is 0.37,
volumetric
shrinkage is 12.4%, radial shrinkage is 3.6%, and tangential shrinkage is 8.6%.

<p>
 Uses of black cottonwood include high-grade book and magazine paper
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>], biomass production for alternative energy [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>], pallets, boxes, and
crates [<a href="#35">35</a>], veneer and panelling [<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>], and fiberboard and flakeboard for
concealed parts of furniture [<a href="#35">35</a>]. Because of their rapid growth rates and propensity for sprouting
from stumps after harvest,
black cottonwood and its hybrids have been studied for use in
intensive culture [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>].&nbsp;Dickmann and Stuart [<a href="#36">36</a>]&nbsp;provide much information about hybridization and
genetics, planting considerations, and plantation management of cottonwoods.

Streamside black cottonwoods contribute to favorable fish habitat by providing
streambank stability and reduced siltation, maintaining low water temperatures through
shading, increasing debris recruitment for variable stream habitats, and providing nutrient-rich litter for aquatic food webs
[<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>]. Black cottonwood is an important source of cover and forage (to a
lesser extent) for wildlife and livestock. Use of black cottonwood by

<p>Black cottonwood is most important as a source of
cover rather than forage for big game species. Elk and deer use is high in black
cottonwood stands in Montana, particularly when a shrub canopy layer is well
developed [<a href="#58">58</a>].
White-tailed deer in the Umatilla River drainage of northeastern Oregon used
mature forest structural types during winter. These sites provide hiding cover
which is needed in areas that are otherwise rather open. The deer used
ponderosa
pine, Douglas-fir, Englemann spruce, or grand fir stands during the summer
[<a href="#14">14</a>]. A study of habitat partitioning among elk,
white-tailed deer, and moose near Glacier National Park, Montana found a
significant (p&lt;0.1) preference of white-tailed deer for later-successional
spruce-black cottonwood communities over early or mid- successional communities.
Elk and moose had significantly preferred mid-successional black-cottonwood
communities. None of the 3 ungulates was observed to prefer early successional
communities [<a href="#75">75</a>]. Black cottonwood is used by beavers for forage and dam
building [<a href="#60">60</a>].
</p>

<p>In the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska, many plants are summer
moose forage; winter forage consisted of&nbsp;willows (38% of diet in winter),
Kenai birch
(45%), alder (9%), black cottonwood and
quaking aspen (5%) and huckleberries (<i>Vaccinium</i>) (2%) [<a href="#155">155</a>].
In British Columbia, Roosevelt elk and white-tailed deer forage on buds during
winter [<a href="#57">57</a>]. A study of black cottonwood use by Roosevelt elk in
Olympic National Park found it to be 9% of diet volume in both winter and autumn
[<a href="#127">127</a>].
Rocky Mountain mule deer generally do not consume black cottonwood (&lt;1% of diet) [<a href="#85">85</a>].
</p>

<p>
 Rabbits and hares also consume black cottonwood inner
bark and sometimes girdle stem bases. Black cottonwood is the most palatable species for
beavers and is also a frequent source of building materials [<a href="#57">57</a>]. Flying squirrels nest in trunk cavities [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].
</p>

<p>Livestock: Because of proximity to water, livestock
use of black cottonwood sites is often heavy, even though the species is of poor
to fair palatability. Grazing of black
cottonwood community types in Idaho and Montana can lead to the decline
of shrubs and maintenance of an open stand with Kentucky bluegrass, timothy, smooth
brome (<i>Bromus inermis</i>), and &quot;weedy&quot; forbs in the understory.
Ranchers sometimes use these sites as
winter ranges for livestock (early season rest is recommended for continued
grass productivity) [<a href="#58">58</a>].

Black cottonwood provides thermal cover, debris recruitment, and bank stability
for streams [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>]. Hansen and others [<a href="#60">60</a>] suggest that managers&nbsp; &quot;give serious consideration to maintaining a buffer strip of the black cottonwood
dominance type immediately adjacent to rivers and streams.&quot;.

The longevity of cottonwood riparian forests makes decline in populations
gradual; changes in management may take decades to restore mature cottonwood
stands [<a href="#122">122</a>]. Protection of a Fremont cottonwood-velvet ash (<i>Fraxinus velutina</i>)-Goodding
willow (<i>Salix gooddingii</i>) association in Prescott National Forest,
Arizona showed little recovery after 4
years [<a href="#145">145</a>].<p>
Plummer [<a href="#112">112</a>] evaluated the potential of intermountain plant species for
rehabilitation efforts. Black cottonwood was classified as &quot;good&quot; for
establishment via transplanting, growth rate, soil stabilization, and adaptation
to disturbance, &quot;fair&quot; for natural spread by seed or vegetative
reproduction, and &quot;poor&quot; for seed handling and artificial seedling establishment.
</p>


<p>
Ground
scarification is critical for planting to establish a microsite favorable to
light requirements. Where a living black cottonwood root system is
already present, scarification may also be used to induce sprouting
from roots [<a href="#19">19</a>]. 
</p>

<p>The following guidelines have been provided for
collecting and planting black cottonwood cuttings [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>]: </p>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">avoid saline or alkaline sites and clay soils</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">make cuttings from young trees in open stands</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">remove the side branches of the cutting (leave the tip and the two highest side branches)</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">cut from trees when they are dormant</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">soak the cuttings for 10 to 14 days</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">dig the planting holes to the lowest expected groundwater level</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">plant the cuttings the day they are removed from soaking</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">select cuttings long enough so that they are 3 to 6 feet (1-2 m) high when planted</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">back fill the holes and avoid air pockets</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">exclude livestock and big game for 2 or 3 growing seasons</font></li> 
</ul>

<p> McCamant and
Black [<a href="#92">92</a>] tested black cottonwood clones from different regions for
differential cold hardiness. They found considerable variation between sites,
and suggested that source of material for hybrid programs or rehabilitation is
an important consideration [<a href="#92">92</a>]. Variation between populations and
even within populations has been observed with respect to flooding tolerance as
well. Plants may be monitored for flooding tolerance to select
appropriate cutting sources [<a href="#130">130</a>]. Similarly, race differentiation in
photoperiodicity has also been observed [<a href="#117">117</a>]. Regardless of how the selection is
chosen, a variety of genotypes is recommended to increase likelihood of
population survival [<a href="#19">19</a>]. 
</p>


<p>The University of Washington continues
experimentation with genetic engineering of members of the <i>Populus </i>genus
to produce hybrids that can hyperaccumulate or detoxify industrial pollutants.
These species are well suited to environmental rehabilitation of this sort
because they have a high transpiration rate and large, spreading root systems. A
black cottonwood × plains cottonwood hybrid has been shown to absorb and
metabolize trichloroethylene from soil. More trials are needed to test the effectiveness and environmental impacts of such hybrids [<a href="#38">38</a>].&nbsp;

The exact amount of decline in riparian cottonwood stands is unknown. In the
Southwest, an estimated 70 to 95% of riparian vegetation has been lost or
disturbed; in the Sacramento Valley of California the area of riparian

<p>Rood and Mahoney [<a href="#122">122</a>] examined decline
of cottonwood forests in southern Alberta. They listed many of the
above-mentioned activities. Causes of decline were, from largest to smallest
impact, 1) livestock grazing, 2) agricultural clearing,
3) water diversion, 4) domestic settlement, 5) stream reservoirs, 6) increase
in beaver population,
7) gravel mining, 8) direct harvesting, 9) channelization, and 10) herbicide
spraying. 
</p>


<p>Major causes of decline of black cottonwood stands in
eastern Oregon include: conversion of stands for pasture, farmland, or
urbanization, conversion of streams from multiple to single channel systems,
restriction of lateral movement of streams across floodplains, and control of
flooding with dams. Overbrowsing by livestock, elk, and deer, reduced fire
frequency, and logging for firewood, lumber, and pulp have also had impacts
[<a href="#31">31</a>]. 
</p>


<p>Livestock management: Though they require flooding disturbance for establishment,
black cottonwood seedlings are generally not tolerant of much grazing disturbance. In
southern Alberta, stress from livestock use, including foraging and trampling, is &quot;the greatest overall impact on riparian
cottonwood&quot; stands according to Rood and others [<a href="#121">121</a>]. In the
Wallowa Mountains of eastern Oregon, an exclosure study showed that livestock
use slowed the development of black cottonwood stands and delayed succession
from shrub-dominated to black cottonwood dominated communities [<a href="#78">78</a>]. Gravel bar vegetation surveys in the Catherine Creek watershed
of eastern Oregon also highlighted the sensitivity of black cottonwood to
livestock pressure. In exclosure plots mean height increased from 6 to 40 inches (15
to 101 cm) in
10 years; on plots with grazing (1.3- 1.8 ha/AUM), mean height increase was only
from 5 to 10 inches (12-26 cm) in the same time period. During this study
shrub (mountain alder, Bebb willow, and Missouri River willow (<i>Salix
eriocephala</i>)) density increased
significantly (p&lt;0.01) on sites excluded from grazing, but the density of
black cottonwood was not significantly different between grazed and ungrazed
sites [<a href="#51">51</a>]. Management has
sought to control livestock foraging and trampling effects on black cottonwood
via short-rotation grazing and exclosure; this allows young trees approximately
5 years to establish [<a href="#19">19</a>].&nbsp; 
</p>

<p>Prolonged heavy grazing of black
cottonwood community types can cause decline in shrub canopy cover and thus big
game use of the site. Shrub cover can sometimes be restored with a &quot;dramatic
change&quot; in management including elimination of grazing. The success of this depends most heavily on the level of the
water table. Whether or not the goal is to restore shrub cover, early
season rest from grazing is beneficial for forage production alone [<a href="#58">58</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
Timber management: Though black cottonwood has beneficial effects on bank
stability, black cottonwood can have detrimental competitive
effects on more economically valuable trees. This effect is greatest during the
first 5 years after clearing; self-thinning at this point reduces black
cottonwood abundance but many persist throughout rotation times [<a href="#57">57</a>]. Logging mature cottonwood produces abundant
rapidly growing stump sprouts. Sprouts grow whenever the tree is cut, but cutting
in November through February produces the most.&nbsp; Even repeated cutting (up
to 5 times in 10 years) does not harm the ability to sprout from stumps. In
addition twigs or roots that are covered with soil during logging often take
root.&nbsp; When mature trees are still present, seeding is rapid.
Because of these characteristics manual treatment is not effective in reducing
density or cover of black cottonwood [<a href="#28">28</a>]. 
</p>


<p>
To increase habitat for
nesting birds, habitat management plans are best developed for each individual
species, but some general considerations include: within a 1,000 acre (400 ha) area about 50 to
100 acres (20 to 40 ha) with an old-growth structure of ponderosa pine, western larch, or
black cottonwood should meet most nesting needs. This 50- to 100-acre area is
most effective if scattered
throughout the larger area rather than isolated, and in the remaining 900 acres (360 ha) snags
are retained. Also suggested for bird habitat maintenance
is that the collection of ponderosa pine, western larch, or black cottonwood for
firewood be discouraged, particularly collection of snags greater than 15 inches (38 cm) in
diameter
[<a href="#94">94</a>].</p>

<p>Watercourse damming and water diversion: Often listed as a
major detriment to cottonwoods, damming and water diversion have a multi-faceted
impact on establishment, growth, and mortality. These factors
were summarized by Rood and Mahoney [<a href="#122">122</a>] as follows:&nbsp;

<p>The effects of altered flood magnitude, frequency, and
duration on the establishment and success of black cottonwood are thought to be
less severe than those effects on other cottonwoods [<a href="#83">83</a>]. This is because black
cottonwood is adapted to flow regimes of smaller streams with more variable
flood magnitude and duration than large rivers. Stromberg and Patten [<a href="#143">143</a>] noted
&quot;subtle&quot; effects of diversion on black cottonwood in the eastern
Sierra Nevada, California. On Bishop Creek, where water diversion is nearly
complete in normal and dry winters, black cottonwood had higher mortality (and
thus lower age and size), lower
density, and lower canopy foliage density than on Pine Creek, a similar size
watershed with no diversion. Means (standard errors in parentheses) from the two
watersheds are presented below [<a href="#143">143</a>]:&nbsp;

<p>Chemical treatments: Black cottonwood is
&quot;extremely sensitive&quot; to glyphosate. In southern Alberta this
herbicide and picloram are believed to have caused unintended mortality in even
large trees [<a href="#122">122</a>]. The 2,4-D ester can damage
the canopy but does not cause much mortality [<a href="#28">28</a>]. High black cottonwood
mortality was observed following summer and fall
applications of glyphosate. A mid-May spot treatment with hexazinone produced
80% to 95% defoliation and little sprouting in the Nelson Forest region of
British Columbia. Broadcast treatments with 2,4-D amine have been
observed to cause moderate or severe damage [<a href="#57">57</a>]. Balsam poplar in
Alberta were susceptible to metsulfuron and 2,4-D, alone or in combination [<a href="#18">18</a>]. 
</p>

Disease and other management considerations: Black cottonwood is susceptible to <i>Cytospora</i>
canker, particularly in fire-damaged stands or in young trees or
cuttings in nurseries. Wood-decaying fungi also grow on black cottonwood; the most significant parasites of this sort include <i> Polyporus
delectans</i> and <i> Philota destruens</i> [<a href="#117">117</a>]. Young seedlings
are particularly susceptible to pathogenic fungal infection [<a href="#113">113</a>]. Trees, particularly young saplings, may be injured or
killed by late frost either directly or indirectly via increased susceptibility
to fungal decay. High winds sometimes cause damage on sites where adjacent
vegetation is much shorter [<a href="#35">35</a>], and scouring by ice during spring runoff
sometimes kills or induces sprouting from young trees [<a href="#19">19</a>].
