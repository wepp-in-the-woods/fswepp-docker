<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
California wild grape is a conspicuous vine of riparian forests and
woodlands.  It is a minor to major component of valley oak (Quercus
lobata) riparian, mixed-oak riparian, Fremont cottonwood (Populus
fremontii), black cottonwood (P. trichocarpa), cottonwood-willow,
mixed-hardwood riparian, red alder (Alnus rubra), and white alder (A.
rhombifolia) communities [<a href="#28">28</a>].  It may dominate the lower and midstories
and reach into the canopy, particularly in valley oak and Fremont
cottonwood forests [<a href="#10">10</a>].  The following classifications name California
wild grape as a dominant in community types:

Terrestrial natural communities of California [<a href="#10">10</a>]
The vascular plant communities of California [<a href="#28">28</a>]

Tree associates of California wild grape not listed in Distribution and
Occurrence include California black walnut (Juglans hindsii), California
sycamore (Platanus racemosa), interior live oak (Quercus wislizenii),
California box elder (Acer negundo var. californicum), Oregon ash
(Fraxinus latifolia), California bay (Umbellularia californica), and
California buckeye (Aesculus californica) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].

Common shrub associates are Mexican tea (Chenopodium ambrosoides),
California blackberry (Rubus vitifolius), coyote bush (Baccharis
pilularis var. consanguinea), California wild rose (Rosa californica),
valley willow (Salix hindsiana), and arroyo willow (S. lasiolepis)
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  Dutchman's pipe vine (Aristolochia californica), poison-oak

fern (Polystichum lonchitis), and blue vervain (Verbena hastata)
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vitis californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Riparian vegetation provides important habitat for wildlife [<a href="#15">15</a>].
California wild grape is among the most valuable of the riparian plant
species.  As well as providing cover, it is an important animal food.
The fruits are a fall staple for many animal species, including coyote,
opossum, western spotted skunk, striped skunk, wood duck, band-tailed
pigeon, California quail, mountain bluebird, and other passerines
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Black-tailed deer browse the leaves and young stems.
Additionally, it is browsed by all classes of domestic livestock [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
California wild grape browse has been rated fair to poor for sheep,
goats, and black-tailed deer and poor to useless for cattle and horses
[<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
California wild grape is planted for riparian restoration [<a href="#8">8</a>].  It is
easily started from cuttings [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>] and shows favorable rates of
establishment.  Containerized cuttings transplanted onto the north banks
of the Crescent Bypass and the South Fork of the Kings River showed less
than 2 percent mortality after 2 years [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
California wild grape is of great importance to wine industries
throughout the world.  This species was used to save the European wine
industry between 1870 and 1900 when most wine grapes (Vitis vinifera)
were killed by leaf- and root-attacking grape phylloxera aphids
(Daktulosphaira vitifoliae).  Since that time, nearly all commercial
wine grapes grown anywhere in the world have been grafted onto
rootstocks of resistant California wild grape cultivars.

The grapes of this species are palatable to humans.  They are eaten raw
or made into jelly.


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Trees such as valley oak and Fremont cottonwood often die after
California wild grape climbs into their canopies [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

California wild grape is a host of the western grapeleaf skeletonizer
(Harrisina brillians).  This moth can decimate commercial vinyards [<a href="#25">25</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vitis californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
California wild grape is a native, usually dioecious, deciduous woody
vine.  Stems are from 6.6 to 60 feet (2-20 m) long.  When support such
as trees or shrubs is available, California wild grape attaches to and
climbs the support using branched tendrils located opposite its leaves.
It has a sprawling and bushlike form when support is unavailable.
California wild grape leaves are from 2.8 to 5.6 inches (7-14 cm) broad.
The fruit is a pulpy berry.  The seeds have a thick, hard testa; hard
endosperm; and minute embryo [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
California wild grape reproduces from seed [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Plants require
outcrossing to effect pollination [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Seeds are presumably
disseminated by frugivorous animals.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
California wild grape grows in mesic riparian areas such as swales,
streambanks, and canyon bottoms [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  It is found at elevations
below 4,000 feet (1,219 m) [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Faculative Seral Species

California wild grape is found in climax valley oak riparian forests.
It is also named as a component of communities (such as Fremont
cottonwood and Great Valley mixed-hardwood riparian forests) that
undergo recurrent flooding [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
California wild grape flowers from May to June [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Fruits ripen in
September.  Leaves are shed from mid-October to November (pers. obs.).

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vitis californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Literature concerning California wild grape adaptations to fire is
scant.  Sampson and Jesperson [<a href="#24">24</a>] list California wild grape as a root
crown sprouter.  Its hard-coated seeds may be cracked by fire, but
documented evidence linking fire with increased germination of
California wild grape seed is lacking.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vitis californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
California wild grape is probably top-killed by fire [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
California wild grape sprouts from the root crown after fire [<a href="#24">24</a>].  It
probably colonizes from animal-dispersed seed.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
California wild grape is probably a ladder fuel, carrying fire into the
canopies of the trees upon which it climbs.
