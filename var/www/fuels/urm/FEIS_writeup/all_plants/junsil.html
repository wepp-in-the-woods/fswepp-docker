<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The accepted scientific name for southern redcedar is Juniperus
silicicola (Small) Bailey [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  However, a number of authors of
recent publications [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>] contend that this entity is better
treated as J. virginiana var. silicicola.  Adams [<a href="#1">1</a>], who did a
multivariate analysis of morphological and chemical characteristics,
found that such analysis failed to separate the coastal populations
(silicicola) on the basis of scale leaf length, pollen cone length,
ovulate cone size, and twig size (characters used to distinguish
silicicola from virginiana).  Furthermore, although multivariate
analysis of terpenoid profiles gives discrete status to adjoining inland
and coastal groups, these groups are very close.  The coastal
populations tend to have cinnamon-colored rather than brownish bark, and
a rounded rather than pyramidal crown.  Also, eastern redcedar will
naturally hybridize with southern redcedar [<a href="#15">15</a>]

<center><h2>VALUE AND USE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juniperus silicicola
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
The wood of southern redcedar is close grained, light, soft, fragrant,
and very durable.  The wood is used for chests, wardrobes, closet
linings, flooring, and scientific instruments.  The decay-resistant
heartwood is valued for fenceposts.  Young trees are used as Christmas
trees [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Southern redcedar is commercially important but the supply
of timber is limited [<a href="#36">36</a>].

Southern redcedar was in great demand for pencil production in Florida
in the nineteenth century; the majority of the wood used by two large
pencil factories in the town of Cedar Key.  A hurricane in 1896 destroyed
these factories and terminated a major portion of such use [<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Southern redcedar "berries" are used for food by birds (particularly
cedar waxwings, grosbeaks, and finches) and mammals (including the
armadillo, black bear, gray fox and opossum).  The twigs and foliage are
browsed by cottontail rabbits and by hoofed browsers [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Johnsen
and Alexander [<a href="#18">18</a>] list southern redcedar as useful for wildlife habitat
and for environmental forestry.  Junipers (Juniperus spp.) provide
important protective and nesting cover.  They are preferred nest sites
for chipping sparrows, robins, song sparrows and mockingbirds [<a href="#27">27</a>].  The
cover types that southern redcedar occurs in are important as nesting
habitat for many birds that feed in aquatic habitats.  Many migratory
birds occur in this habitat in winter [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Southern redcedar "berries" are highly palatable to many species of
birds and mammals [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Southern redcedar is valued as an ornamental, both for residential uses
and along roads [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Selective harvesting of southern redcedar in the nineteenth century for
pencil manufacturing essentially eliminated it as an overstory species.
Leaving the live oak (Quercus virginiana) overstory in place probably
prevented regeneration of southern redcedar, reducing its abundance in
coastal and inland forests [<a href="#39">39</a>].

Seeds of southern redcedar can either be sown in fall or spring, but
spring-sown seeds should be cold stratified [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Germination of
seeds takes from 4 to 5 weeks. The seedlings are sensitive to
overheating and should be placed under light shade [<a href="#39">39</a>].

Southern redcedar can be propagated by cuttings or grafting [<a href="#39">39</a>].

Southern redcedar can be infested by cedar-apple rust (Gymnosporangium
juniperi-virginianae) and consequently should not be planted near apple
orchards [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Bagworms (Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis) have been
observed feeding on the foliage [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Eastern redcedar can be heavily
damaged by cedar blight (Phormopsis juniperovora); presumably the blight
can also attack southern redcedar [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Junipers are also susceptible
to various wood rots [<a href="#39">39</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juniperus silicicola
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Southern redcedar is a native, dioecious evergreen tree.  The average
height in secondary forests is 30 to 50 feet (9-15 m) [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  The
Texas champion tree is 75 feet tall [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Some of the virgin redcedar
stands along the Apalachee Bay in Florida may have been over 100 feet
tall (30 m).  It is possible that second-growth forests of this
slow-growing, long-lived species have not yet reached mature height
[<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  When southern redcedar is grown in the open, the branches
spread to form a broad irregular crown, with the upper branches erect
and the lower branches pendulous.  In more crowded stands, southern
redcedar tends to have a more symmetrical, narrow, pointed crown [<a href="#36">36</a>].
As are other junipers, southern redcedar is aromatic [<a href="#36">36</a>].  The bark of
southern redcedar is thin and shreddy [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  The mature ovulate cones
are berrylike and bright blue [<a href="#29">29</a>].  The root system is shallow [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction:  The seeds of southern redcedar have dormant
embryos; germination may be delayed until the second or third spring
after seeds are mature [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Cold stratification hastens germination; it
is also likely that scarification by passage through animal digestive
tracts is also effective [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Data on frequency of good seed crops are
lacking.  Eastern redcedar is known to produce some seeds every year,
with irregular heavy seed crops; it is likely that southern redcedar
behaves in a similar fashion.  Seed dispersal is usually by birds.
Cleaned seeds average from 37,000 to 55,000 per pound
(81,600-121,300/kg) [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].

Eastern redcedar is reported as a nonsprouting species; southern
redcedar is probably similar, although Godfrey [<a href="#12">12</a>] mentions sprouting
of young trees after injury.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Southern redcedar almost always occurs within 30 miles (50 km) of
seawater or in areas with shallow water tables [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Although it
usually occurs on sandy, moist but not saturated soils, it occasionally
occurs on acidic clay soils in Texas [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Southern redcedar may be
found on soil types that include Alfisols, Entisols, Inceptisols,
Spodosols, and Ultisols [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Southern redcedar occurs on calcareous
hammocks, coastal hammocks, brackish flats, shell middens, dunes,
bluffs, and secondary woods, and will colonize dredge spoil islands
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Southern redcedar is found inland in river swamps and along
stream and creek margins in low woods [<a href="#36">36</a>].

Southern redcedar is abundant in hydric hammock communities in Florida,
most often occurring with cabbage palmetto (Sabal palmetto) and live oak
in areas between pine flatwoods and freshwater marshes [<a href="#35">35</a>].

Southern redcedar occurs in oak (Quercus virginiana, Q. marilandica)
scrub and in live oak forests that are established on the backdunes of
barrier islands off the east coast of the Florida peninsula [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Overstory associates not listed in Distribution and Occurrence include
spruce pine (Pinus glabra), live oak, laurel oak (Quercus laurifolia),
southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), American holly (Ilex opaca)
[<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Understory associates include yaupon (Ilex vomitoris),
southern bayberry (Myrica cerifera), devilwood (Osmanthus americanus),
Carolina laurelcherry (Prunus caroliniana), beautyberry (Callicarpa
americana), bumelia (Bumelia spp.), tree sparkleberry (Vaccinium
arboreum), muscadine grape (Vitis rotundifolia), and greenbriers (Smilax
spp.) [<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Southern redcedar is classified as intolerant to very intolerant of
shade, although it can become established in partial shade.  The dense
shade of hardwoods may retard reestablishment of cedar-dominated
maritime forests [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Southern redcedar tends to occur in open forests
or on sand dunes where light is not limiting.

Southern redcedar is not an early colonizer of sand dunes; it is usually
found in established dune communities such as oak scrub or live oak,
inland of the foredunes [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Southern redcedar pollen is shed from staminate cones in January and
February; ovulate conelets are pollinated at this time and mature slowly
through the spring and summer.  Ovulate conelets are mature by October
to November of their first year; conelets persist into winter, but most
are eaten by birds [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Seeds are dormant and germination of
seeds occurs in the spring, although it may be delayed 2 to 3 years
[<a href="#39">39</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juniperus silicicola
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Southern redcedar occurs on outer coastal sites that rarely burn.  Fire
is considered the worst natural enemy of eastern redcedar; southern
redcedar is similar to eastern redcedar in that it has thin bark and
shallow roots which are easily damaged by fire.  It is probable that
southern redcedar is equally susceptible to fire damage and mortality
[<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  On inland sites where it is a minor species and fires are more
frequent, southern redcedar suffers damage and mortality due to fire.
However, at current levels of fire suppression, fire damage may be less
prevalent now then in the past [<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juniperus silicicola
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Southern redcedar seedlings and saplings are killed by light-severity
fire [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Mature trees are also easily damaged or killed by fire
[<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Southern redcedar is probably a nonsprouting species, since the closely
related eastern redcedar is nonsprouting [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Godfrey [<a href="#12">12</a>], however,
mentions the existence of sprouts of damaged saplings or seedlings.
Further information is lacking.

As a result of fire suppression, eastern redcedar has colonized areas
where it has not existed for a long time, and it is probable that
southern redcedar would do the same if hardwood invaders are controlled
[<a href="#34">34</a>].  Southern redcedar seeds are dispersed by birds and could colonize
opened areas.
