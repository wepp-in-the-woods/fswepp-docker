<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix brachycarpa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Barren-ground willow grows throughout Alaska except for the Aleutian
Islands and along the southeastern coast.  In northern Canada it grows
from the Yukon Territory to adjacent British Columbia and east to the
Hudson Bay.  In the contiguous United States barren-ground willow grows
from the Canadian border southward in the cordilleras to Utah and
Colorado [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Barren-ground willow codominates in several willow and mixed shrub
floodplain communities in Alaska and northern Canada [<a href="#2">2</a>].  In
northwestern Colorado, it is a codominant along rivers and streams along
with diamondleaf willow (Salix planifolia), marsh marigold (Caltha
leptosepala), and water sedge (Carex aquatilis) [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Other riparian
community associates include Alaska willow (S. alaxensis), littletree
willow (S. arbusculoides), grayleaf willow (S. glauca), and alders
(Alnus spp.) [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Barren-ground willow is an important forage for moose in the floodplains
of interior Alaska and has been planted for moose habitat restoration on
the North Slope of Alaska [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

Willows (Salix spp.) are generally a preferred food and building
material for beaver [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Willow shoots, catkins, and buds are eaten by
numerous small mammals and birds [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Willow stems are commonly planted for restoration of wildlife habitat,
streambank protection, and the reclamation of sites disturbed by mining
and construction [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Barren-ground willow is apparently well suited
for these purposes.  Barren-ground willow is also planted for windbreaks
[<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
All willows produce salacin which is closely related chemically to
aspirin.  Native American used various preparations from willows to
treat toothache, bee stings, stomachache, and diarrhea [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Native
Americans also used flexible willow stems for making baskets, bows,
arrows, and fish and muskrat traps [<a href="#14">14</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix brachycarpa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Barren-ground willow is a much-branched, low-growing, and often
prostrate shrub typically between 1 and 3 feet (0.3-0.9 m) tall.  Male
and female flowers occur on separate plants in 0.7- to 2-inch-long
(1.5-5 cm) catkins that persist throughout the summer and often through
the following winter.  The fruit is a two-valved capsule [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Like all willows, barren-ground willow's primary mode of reproduction is
sexual.  It produces an abundance of lightweight seed and begins seed
production at an early age (between 2 and 10 years) [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Willow seed has an extremely short period of viability.  Under natural
conditions, most seeds remain viable for only a few days.  Seeds usually
germinate within 12 to 24 hours of landing on a suitable seedbed.  At
maturity, the capsular fruits split open to release the minute downy
seeds that are dispersed by either wind or water [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Willows are prolific sprouters.  Barren-ground
willow sprouts from the root crown if aboveground stems are broken or
destroyed by cutting or fire [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Barren-ground willow occurs on a wide variety of sites including open
woodlands, bogs, muskegs, meadows, streambanks, alpine slopes, swamp
margins, and moraines.  It also occurs on serpentine barrens, salt
marshes, alkaline meadows, and salt flats [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

Barren-ground willow is an early seral species.  It is one of the first
species to become established on exposed silt and gravel bars and the
inside of river meanders [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Barren-ground willow flowers in June and July, and the seed is dispersed
in July and August [<a href="#28">28</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix brachycarpa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Information on barren-ground willow's ability to sprout after fire is
lacking.  Like most willows it probably sprouts prolifically after fire.
Barren-ground willow's wind-dispersed seed are probably important in
colonizing recently burned sites [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Small shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix brachycarpa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Low- to moderate-severity fires generally top-kill willows.  Severe fire
can kill willows by completely removing soil organic layers and charring
the roots [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Like most willows barren-ground willow will probably sprout vigorously
after fire [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  Information regarding postfire establishment for
barren-ground willow is lacking.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY
