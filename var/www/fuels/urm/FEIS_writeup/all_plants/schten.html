<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Schizachyrium tenerum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Cattle graze slender bluestem when it is young and tender.  As
seedstalks form, palatability declines rapidly [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Slender bluestem new growth is most palatable to cattle following a
fire, which retards slender bluestem maturity and the development of
wiry unpalatable flower stalks [<a href="#26">26</a>].  By June slender bluestem in
central Louisiana is rank and unpalatable on unburned range.  New growth
on range burned in May remains palatable [<a href="#9">9</a>].

In south-central Mississippi in early spring cattle readily grazed
slender bluestem, preferring it to little bluestem (Schizachyrium
scoparium) and carpetgrass (Axonopus compressus).  During late summer
and fall grazing of slender bluestem was largely confined to areas where
grass had been kept short and maturity retarded [<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Slender bluestem was collected in north-central Texas and analyzed.  At
an early growth stage it was fair in protein content and deficient in
both phosphoric acid and lime in comparison with other range grasses of
the area.  At maturity it was deficient in both protein and phosphoric
acid, but had good lime content [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Chemical analysis of slender bluestem dry material from burned and
unburned ungrazed plots in central Louisiana showed higher values from
burned than unburned plots for ash, crude protein, crude fat, calcium
oxide, and phosphorus pentoxide.  Values were lower on burned plots for
crude fiber and nitrogen-free extract [<a href="#36">36</a>].

Slender bluestem taken on May 1 from unburned plots on the lower Coastal
Plain in south-central Georgia had crude protein content of 3.5 percent;
protein content from burned plots was 8.5 percent.  By full leaf stage
around June 15, samples from both treatments showed 4.5 percent protein
content.  Values dropped concurrently for both treatments through
November.  Phosphorus content was also lower on May 1 for unburned
plots, but by June 15 it was the same for both treatments; both dropped
after August 15.  Calcium content was the same for both treatments
throughout testing.  Cattle made greater weight gain on burned than on
unburned plots [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Slender bluestem and pinehill bluestem are inadequate for the nutritional
needs of cattle during the winter [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Close grazing and trampling tend to kill slender bluestem and encourage
the spread of carpetgrass (Axonopus spp.) and weeds.  Slender bluestem
is also susceptible to smothering by litter, and in the absence of fire
decreases more on ungrazed areas than on moderately grazed pastures
[<a href="#36">36</a>].

Excessive grazing by cattle in central Louisiana on longleaf
pine/bluestem (principally slender bluestem and pinehill bluestem) range
converted the range under longleaf pine canopy to forbs and to
carpetgrass (Axonopus affinis) on patch cuts [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Moderate repeated close grazing can retard slender bluestem maturation,
which prolongs the period of palatability and prevents the formation of
the wiry, persistent flower stalks [<a href="#7">7</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Schizachyrium tenerum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Slender bluestem is a native, warm-season, perennial bunchgrass [<a href="#26">26</a>].
Culms are slender, sometimes reclining, and 24 to 39 inches (60-100 cm)
long [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>], the upper half sparingly branched [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Leaves are wiry
and 2 to 8 inches (5 to 20 cm) long [<a href="#26">26</a>].  The inflorescence is a single
slender raceme [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Spikelets are paired.  The lemma of the sessile
fertile spikelet is awned.  The fruit is a caryopsis [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Slender bluestem sprouts from perennating buds at the base of culms.  It
also reproduces by seed [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Slender bluestem occurs on prairies and in dry pine woods [<a href="#21">21</a>], second
growth pinelands, pine-hardwood sites, and sandhills [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Slender bluestem in south-central Louisiana occurs on deep,
medium-textured silty loam [<a href="#8">8</a>] and also on predominantly sandy loam on
an upland site at elevations of 130 to 295 feet (40-90 m) [<a href="#6">6</a>].  It
occurs on the West Gulf Coastal Plain in Louisiana on upland ridges of
well-drained to excessively drained sandy soil with frequent water
deficits and nutrient limitations; it occurs on hillside seepage bogs
with loamy sand, sandy loam, sandy peat, or shallow mucky peat soil with
poor nutrient availability; and it occurs on wetland longleaf pine
savanna of the outer Coastal Plain Terraces on imperfectly drained sand
based, somewhat calcareous soils [<a href="#4">4</a>].  It also occurs in pitcher plant
bogs in west-central Louisiana on fine, slow-draining loam with pH
4.5 to 5.1 at elevations of 197 to 276 feet (60-84 m) [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].

In Pearl River County in south-central Mississippi slender bluestem
occurs on fine sandy loam and loamy sand at elevations of 230 to 285
feet (70-87 m) [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].

Slender bluestem on the lower Coastal Plain in south-central Georgia
occurs in flatwood second-growth longleaf pine-slash pine (Pinus
elliottii) forest on coastal terrace made up of marine sand 8 to 10 feet
(2.4-3.0 m) thick.  Soil is low-fertility, loamy fine sand and sand to a
depth of 40 inches (100 cm).  Elevation is 290 feet (88 m) [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Slender bluestem in extreme northwestern Florida occurs on acidic,
nutient-poor quartz sands which are low in minerals and clay nutrients.
Organic content of soils is generally low.  There is a high degree of
leaching, and extreme fluctuations of the water table occur [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Slender bluestem is not as shade tolerant as many associated grasses,
particularly pinehill bluestem [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Slender bluestem decreases in abundance when it is covered by plant
litter, including its own accumulated growth [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Slender bluestem growth starts in early spring and continues into summer
[<a href="#26">26</a>].  It matures early, usually by mid-June [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Seedheads can form by
mid-July; seed shatter occurs soon after seed maturation.  In fall and
winter foliage tangles and mats.  Slender bluestem tends to grow in
colonies [<a href="#26">26</a>].

In the Florida panhandle slender bluestem blooms from July to October [<a href="#5">5</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Slender bluestem has basal culm buds [<a href="#21">21</a>] which sprout after aerial
portions are burned [<a href="#19">19</a>].  If thick tufts form they may protect the
basal buds from fire damage.  Slender bluestem benefits when fire
removes accumulated litter and mulch.

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Schizachyrium tenerum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Slender bluestem culms and leaves are killed by fire [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Aboveground parts of slender bluestem are killed by fire, but the
underground portions usually survive and produce new topgrowth as soon
as conditions are favorable [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Slender bluestem in Georgia had higher seedstalk production on recently
burned than on unburned sites.  Unburned plants produced 35 seed stalks
per square foot of vegetation; burned plants produced 112 stalks.  At
anthesis slender bluestem had a higher percentage of nitrogen on burned
than on unburned sites [<a href="#38">38</a>].

Slender bluestem is suppressed by accumulating litter in unburned areas
[<a href="#36">36</a>].  There is reduction in number of plants and plant vigor as slender
bluestem is forced to grow through mulch to reach light [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Slender
bluestem tends to increase slightly in relative abundance when burned
annually or every 2 to 3 years.  It may decrease slightly if burned
sites are moderately grazed.  Slender bluestem decreases under grazing
alone.  Under both grazing and fire protection, slender bluestem
relative abundance decreases considerably [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  However, severe fire
can almost completely remove slender bluestem [<a href="#36">36</a>] (see DISCUSSION AND
QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE).


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
With biennial burning slender bluestem on longleaf pine/bluestem sites
in central Louisiana was dominant in the herbaceous layer; woody plants
had reduced growth.  On an unburned control unit a dense overstory of
shrubs and trees with resulting heavy litter restricted slender bluestem
growth to scattered canopy openings [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Productivity of slender bluestem often increases with burn treatment.
South-central Mississippi longleaf pine savanna pasture which included
slender bluestem was burned every January or February from 1924 to 1933.
A similar pasture was not burned.  Half of each pasture was grazed from
approximately April 5 to November 8 each year.  Percent total herbage
values of slender bluestem for the first and last years reported were:

              unburned      grazed       burned       grazed
              ungrazed     unburned     ungrazed      burned
  
      1924       39           35           39           25
      1933       12           17           43           21

A plot that had been protected from fire and grazing for 8 years was
burned with a very hot fire in October.  Slender bluestem was almost
completely killed.  A similar plot was burned in January when fire
temperature was less.  Some bunches of slender bluestem were killed,
but most survived [<a href="#36">36</a>].

In south-central Mississippi longleaf pine savanna, slender bluestem
produced 1,206 pounds per acre per year green plant weight on land which
had not been burned or grazed for 8 years; on a similar plot burned
annually during winter or early spring but not grazed slender bluestem
produced 6,957 pounds per acre [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Plots in longleaf pine-slash
pine/bluestem range in southwestern Louisiana were burned annually,
biennially, or triennially in March or May, or were unburned.  Cattle
were excluded from the plots.  After 8 years of treatment slender
bluestem herbage, measured in October, was highest on plots burned
annually in May and lowest on unburned plots.  Slender bluestem percent
of total herbage yield was as follows [<a href="#16">16</a>]:

<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
The longleaf pine-bluestem savanna of the southeastern United States
Coastal Plain, where slender bluegrass is a dominant, is a fire
subclimax community which requires fire at relatively frequent intervals
to be maintained.  When fire is excluded, loblolly pine (Pinus taeda),
slash pine, hardwood trees, and shrubs invade; slender bluestem is
shaded out [<a href="#24">24</a>].

In the absence of fire in dense stands of longleaf pine on the
southeastern Coastal Plain, slender bluestem is eliminated by pine
needle litter [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].

Burning increases slender bluestem nutrient content and palatability.
Increases do not last more than a few months after spring burning.
However, this is usually the time when livestock and wildlife need extra
protein and minerals [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Rotational winter burning at 3-year intervals in longleaf pine/bluestem
range, combined with periodic tree thinning (to maintain 12 to 20 sq
m/ha longleaf pine basal area), can maintain productive forage
(including slender bluestem) and provide concurrent production of wood
fiber [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Three major studies on the effect of fire on slender bluestem forage
have been done in south-central Louisiana:

A 6-year test of rotation burning to increase forage value during summer
and fall and to improve distribution of grazing by cattle was conducted
in south-central Louisiana.  Slender bluestem and pinehill bluestem were
the principal grasses.  A system of rotational burning was recommended
for longleaf pine/bluestem range for both cutover and timbered lands.
One-third of each area was burned in winter or early spring each year.
Low-intensity early March backfires were used in subunits with
regenerated pines to minimize damage to trees.  Free-running early May
headfires were used on cutover land to destroy herbage after
palatability of normal spring growth started to decline.  Wildfire
hazard in the forest was reduced, range vegetation and grazing
distribution were improved, litter was removed, undesired scrub
hardwoods were top-killed, and unpalatable perennials were curtailed.
Both types of sites were grazed by cattle.  The heavy grazing of slender
bluestem during the growing season following fire, when cattle
concentrated on freshly burned range, improved forage palatability and
nutritive content by retarding maturation.  Cattle began concentrating
on newly burned range within 1 to 4 weeks of burning [<a href="#9">9</a>].  The ensuing 2
years of lighter use restored slender bluestem vigor [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Dry cows
and cows with calves gained weight throughout the growing season on
rotation-burned ranges; forage values on unburned ranges during summer
and fall were too low to sustain body weight [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

In south-central Louisiana longleaf pine-bluestem range was subjected to
alternate burning rotations from 1967 to 1970.  Dominant grasses were
slender bluestem and pinehill bluestem.  One range was treated with a
single fire in late winter or early spring each year.  The other range
was burned a third at a time during each year, one fire in winter (March
1), one in spring (May 1), and one in summer (July 1).  Cattle grazed
the burned area of the annual winter-only fire almost continuously,
which maintained a supply of new palatable and nutritious growth as well
as if later burning had been done.  A single winter fire, being simpler
and less expensive than spring and summer fires, is recommended for
forage management on forested or clearcut native range in longleaf
pine-bluegrass range [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Longleaf pine-bluestem range in south-central Louisiana was subjected to
burning or mowing and raking treatments.  Dominant groundcover was
slender bluestem and pinehill bluestem.  In 1962, four plots were burned
by headfire; four others were mowed to near ground level and residue was
raked and removed.  The treatments were reapplied in 1963.  Fire did not
stimulate early growth or increase nutrient content of slender bluestem
more than did mowing and raking.  Removal of litter by either treatment
appeared to be the major cause of improvement in the status of slender
bluestem [<a href="#17">17</a>].
