<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juglans major
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
The range of Arizona walnut extends from central Texas westward to
southwestern New Mexico and central Arizona [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Its
distribution continues southward into northern Mexico, where it is found
from eastern Sonora to western Coahuila [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  Several authors
[<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>] reported that Arizona walnut was found in Colorado; however,
Harrington [<a href="#23">23</a>] stated that no specimens had been found to support this
range extension.

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Arizona walnut occurs in pure or mixed stands or as scattered
individuals.  It is dominant or codominant in the southwestern or
interior deciduous broad-leaved habitat series with Arizona sycamore
(Platanus wrightii), Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), velvet ash
(Fraxinus velutina), and western soapberry (Sapindus saponaria var.
drummondii) [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  Arizona walnut is an indicator species in
the mixed conifer series in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), white fir
(Abies concolor), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and quaking aspen
(Populus tremuloides) habitat types [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Additionally, in
southwestern oak woodlands or chaparral, Arizona walnut is seral
throughout the Emory oak (Quercus emoryi) series and is a minor
component of Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) community type [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].

Some of the publications that list Arizona walnut as a dominant or
indicator species include:

(1)  Classification of riparian vegetation [<a href="#16">16</a>]
(2)  Classification of mixed broadleaf riparian forest in Tonto National
        Forest [<a href="#27">27</a>]
(3)  A forest habitat type classification of southern Arizona and its
        relationship to forests of the Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico [<a href="#37">37</a>]
(4)  Classification of riparian habitat in the Southwest [<a href="#39">39</a>]
(5)  Riparian forest and scrubland community types of Arizona and New
        Mexico [<a href="#52">52</a>].

Species associated with Arizona walnut that were not previously
mentioned in Distribution and Occurrence information are canyon grape
(Vitis arizonica), deergrass (Muhlenbergia rigens), and common hoarhound
(Marrubium vulgare) [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juglans major
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Arizona walnut is not an important timber tree due to its limited
distribution and small bole size [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Its durable wood is suitable for
furniture, gunstocks, veneer, and fenceposts [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Arizona walnut provides habitat or food to wildlife [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Squirrels,
birds, and other wildlife consume its fruits [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  Squirrels eat the
fruits immediately and do not cache them [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Arizona walnut
communities have high species richness of breeding birds [<a href="#51">51</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Arizona walnut is the least desirable species for cattle browsing in
southeastern Arizona riparian areas [<a href="#45">45</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The branches and trunks of Arizona walnut provide cavities to acorn
woodpeckers in riparian bottoms and drainages of southeastern Arizona [<a href="#38">38</a>].



<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Arizona walnut is valued as a shade tree [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Throughout its range,
the fruits are gathered and eaten by people [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>OHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Arizona walnut may compete with marketable timber species following the
harvest of mixed conifer stands in Arizona.  In an Arizona reforestation
project, herbicide treatment of Arizona walnut gave limited (16 percent)
control [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Even though Arizona walnut is sometimes a community dominant, it usually
is present in low densities or frequencies [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Arizona walnut
densities in south-central Arizona riparian areas may be as low as one
tree per 1,345.5 square feet (125 sq m), with maximum basal areas of
27.8 square inches per 1,345.5 square feet (179.4 sq cm/125 sq m) [<a href="#54">54</a>].

Vegetative propagation of Arizona walnut by stem cuttings and tissue
culture has not been successful [<a href="#40">40</a>].

Arizona walnut fruits were evaluated for use as a multipurpose energy
producing crop in arid areas.  Yields of oils and other organic
compounds from the fruits were reasonable and warrant further study [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Arizona walnut is highly susceptible to walnut anthracnose (Gnomonia
leptostyla) which defoliates trees [<a href="#6">6</a>].  This fungus transmits
easily to commercial walnut cultivars.  Arizona walnut seedlings are
susceptible to root and crown rots [<a href="#32">32</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juglans major
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Arizona walnut is a native, deciduous, small to medium tree that may
grow up to 65.6 feet (20 m) tall and to 4 feet (1.2 m) in diameter
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  The stout branches spread widely and form a rounded
crown.  Pinnately compound leaves are 7 to 14 inches (17.8-35.6 cm) long
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Arizona walnut is monoecious with separate staminate and
pistillate catkins [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  The fruit is 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5-3.8 cm)
in diameter with a husk and a thick, hard shell surrounding a single
seed [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Arizona walnut reproduces sexually.  It produces large amounts of fruits
every 2 to 3 years [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  Periodic crops are attributed to the need
for above-average spring precipitation for seed production [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Female
flower production decreases during times of stress, for example, during
drought years [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Seedlings grow rapidly and have a well-developed
taproot [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Beyond the seedling stage, Arizona walnut grows
relatively slowly at 1 foot per year (0.3 m/yr) until it reaches
maturity [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Arizona walnut is long-lived and may reach 400 years
old [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Some seed predation occurs; moderate amounts of seed are consumed by
Arizona gray squirrel [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].

Germination rates of Arizona walnut are usually less than 50 percent
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  Seeds germinate in the shell during the year following
production [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  Buried seeds had higher germination rates than seeds
lying on the soil surface [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Seed viability increases as seed size
increases; however, seed weight declines as trees become larger and
older [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Germination rate is influenced by light.  Arizona walnut
germination was lower under dense herb cover than under open canopy
cover [<a href="#48">48</a>].  High densities of Arizona walnut occurred in stands with a
sparse overstory canopy cover in southwestern New Mexico [<a href="#33">33</a>].

Arizona walnut seedlings establish over wide elevational and moisture
gradients from wet streambanks to dry hillsides [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Seedlings are
susceptible to drought.  In a central Arizona study where drought
occurred annually, only one seedling from a cohort of 374 was alive
after 2 years [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Seedling recruitment is decreased by grazing and
flooding [<a href="#45">45</a>].



<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Arizona walnut is the only walnut to occur in the desert; it is a
facultative riparian species [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  It occurs along ephemeral streams
with subsurface flows or perennial streams in moist sites that are
occasionally flooded [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  Arizona walnut also is found
scattered along river bottoms, canyons, floodplains, dry terraces and
hillsides [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  It occurs at elevations from 2,600 to 6,500 feet
(800-1,981 m) and may extend up to 8,200 feet (2,500 m) in elevation
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].

The alluvial soils that Arizona walnut commonly occurs on have a wide
range of textures; they are often coarse, rocky, or cobbly sandy loams
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  The soils often are stratified and may be up to 28 feet
(8.5 m) deep [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Two examples of epipedons that Arizona walnut can
occur on in southwestern New Mexico are mollic soils on terraces and
aquic soils in active channel zones [<a href="#33">33</a>].  The nutrient status of the
soils is variable; organic matter is usually low due to the coarse
textures and frequent flooding [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Arizona walnut occurs in various seral stages from early to climax.  It
is present in early seral riparian communities following periodic
flooding disturances such as scouring.  Arizona walnut may be seral to
or climax with any of the species in the mixed broadleaf and coniferous
communities [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  It is relatively shade tolerant [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
The flowers of Arizona walnut appear shortly before or after the leaves
in the spring [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Fruits mature in 3 months.  Depending upon
elevation, fruits ripen from July to September [<a href="#50">50</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juglans major
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Arizona walnut has few adaptations to fire. Arizona walnut occurs
predominantly in montane riparian woodlands which probably burn
infrequently.  Although no reference to Arizona walnut seed survival
following fire was found in the literature, the thick shell and tendency
to germinate better when covered by soil may allow some onsite seeds to
survive.  A covering of moist soil may offer Arizona walnut seeds some
degree of insulation from fire.



<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tree without adventitious-bud root crown
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juglans major
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Arizona walnut is probably killed by fire.  Wildfire in a central
Arizona riparian woodland killed mature Arizona walnut [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Very little is known about the response of Arizona walnut to fire.
Although no report of Arizona walnut sprouting was found in the
literature, other Juglans species sprout after fire.  Following
top-kill, surviving small or young trees or saplings of butternut (J.
cinerea) and black walnut (J. nigra) may sprout from the root collar or
higher on the trunk [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  The age of sprouting individuals was not
mentioned for southern California walnut (J. californica) which sprouts
from the root collar or basal platform following top-kill [<a href="#57">57</a>].  No
sprouting information was available for another western species, little
walnut (J. microcarpa).

If Arizona walnut populations do not sprout, rates of establishment will
vary depending on the proximity of seed trees.  Without animals
facilitating seed dispersal (i.e., squirrels do not cache fruits),
colonization rates of Arizona walnut may be slow.

Following a 1959 wildfire that burned all of the Three Bar experimental
watersheds in central Arizona, a shrub control program using herbicides
was established to create perennial stream flows.  Arizona walnut was
not present before the treatments.  Twenty-four years after burning,
small amounts of Arizona walnut were found in the untreated stream
channel downstream from the treatment area.  It did not occur on the
untreated control area which had also burned in 1959.  No suggestions
were made by the authors about the source of the Arizona walnut [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Prescribed burning is not recommended for the established southwestern
riparian woodlands that Arizona walnut occurs in because fire is
difficult to manage in this habitat [<a href="#7">7</a>].
