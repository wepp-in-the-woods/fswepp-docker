<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently recognized scientific name of Sandberg bluegrass is Poa
secunda Presl. [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].  Based upon different chromosome numbers,
Soreng [<a href="#59">59</a>] recognizes two subspecies of Sandberg bluegrass:  P. secunda
ssp. secunda and P. secunda ssp. juncifolia (Scribn.) R.J. Soreng.  Most
systematists consider the entities listed under the SYNONYMS heading
above to be ecotypes, forms, or cultivars within the Poa secunda complex
[<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].  Characteristics used to separate these entities vary
even within a single population and can result from environmental
conditions or a tendency for individual plants to be self-fertile
[<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].

Hickman [<a href="#33">33</a>] describes delicate bluegrass as a distinct species, P.
tennerrima Scribn.  Kartesz [<a href="#38">38</a>], however, lists it as a synonym for P.
secunda.

Sandberg bluegrass hybridizes with Wheeler bluegrass (P. nervosa) [<a href="#70">70</a>]
and Kentucky bluegrass (P. pratensis) [<a href="#33">33</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Sandberg bluegrass is a widespread and highly drought-resistant forage
grass.  It is one of the earliest grasses to green up in spring and is
sought by all classes of livestock.  Sandberg bluegrass matures early
and remains choice for a shorter time than other forage bunchgrasses.
Horses and cattle continue to make some use of it during the summer
months.  In the fall, horses, cattle, and domestic sheep graze the cured
foliage [<a href="#66">66</a>].  Townsend's ground squirrels apparently consume Sandberg
bluegrass in portion to the grass' relative adundance [<a href="#42">42</a>].  On the Arid
Land Ecology Reserve of eastern Washington, where Sandberg bluegrass is
a dominant grass, Sandberg bluegrass averaged 49 percent of the Townsend
ground squirrel's diet [<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife species for
Sandberg bluegrass in several western states is rated below [<a href="#21">21</a>].  The
values reported are a compilation of ratings given to plant populations
identified as Sandberg bluegrass, Nevada bluegrass, big bluegrass, and
Canby's bluegrass.  For this reason some entries have more than one

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Sandberg bluegrass has a fair energy content but is generally considered
to be a poor source of protein [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The degree to which Sandberg bluegrass provides cover for wildlife
species has been rated as follows [<a href="#21">21</a>]:

In shrub-steppe of eastern Washington, elk preferred big sagebrush
(Artemisia tridentata)-Sandberg bluegrass habitat for bedding and
Sandberg bluegrass-cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) habitat for foraging
[<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Sandberg bluegrass is often included in native seed mixes [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].
Maguire and others [<a href="#45">45</a>] provide information on processing Sandberg
bluegrass seed.

Rehabilitation case examples:  Sandberg bluegrass was included in a
herbaceous seed mix used on coal spoils in northwestern Colorado.
Sandberg bluegrass established successfully and remained an important
component of the vegetation for at least 7 years after seeding [<a href="#55">55</a>].

After the level of a lake in the Columbia River Basin of eastern
Washington was raised, native riparian species were planted on the new
shoreline to prevent establishment and spread of noxious weeds.  A
Sandberg bluegrass cultivar, `Sherman' big bluegrass (Poa ampla sensu
Hitckcock and Cronquist [<a href="#35">35</a>]), and `Durar' hard fescue (Festuca ovina
ssp. duriuscula) were seeded in.  Five years after planting, dense grass
cover had established.  Few forbs, shrubs, or trees had established
except on spots that were missed during grass seeding operations [<a href="#13">13</a>].

`Sherman' big bluegrass was rated among the 10 top performing grasses for
erosion control in the Tahoe Basin of California [<a href="#57">57</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Wildlife habitat restoration after fire:  Sage grouse disappeared from
the Fitzner/Eberhardt Arid Lands Ecology Reserve of north-central
Washington following large-acreage wildfires that removed big sagebrush.
Postfire vegetation was dominated by Sandberg bluegrass and bluebunch
wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata).  In order to reduce grass cover
and increase sagebrush cover for sage grouse, big sagebrush seeds from
unburned, remnant plants were hand-seeded on plowed, herbicide-treated
(glyphosate) plots and on untreated plots.  Sandberg bluegrass cover was
reduced the most, and big sagebrush establishment was best, on
herbicide-treated plots.  Bluebunch wheatgrass did not respond to
herbicide treatment [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Range:  Sandberg bluegrass is a palatable species, but its production is
closely tied to weather conditions.  It produces little forage in
drought years, making it a less dependable food source than other
perennial bunchgrasses [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Sandberg bluegrass increases under grazing pressure [<a href="#65">65</a>].  In
bluebunch wheatgrass-Sandberg bluegrass habitat types of eastern
Washington, cheatgrass and Sandberg bluegrass often occur on the same
site.  One or the other may be favored depending on the class of
livestock.  With heavy grazing by domestic sheep, Sandberg bluegrass is
favored.  When cattle are the dominant grazers, cheatgrass often
dominates [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Some forms of Sandberg bluegrass are of interest to range managers
because thay are better forage grasses than the typical Poa secunda.
For example, P. ampla, P. canbyi, P. juncifolia, P. nevadensis, and P.
scabrella (sensu Hitckcock and others [<a href="#35">35</a>] and Munz [<a href="#49">49</a>]) tend to have
longer basal leaves, and P. ampla and P. scabrella continue to grow
longer into the summer [<a href="#41">41</a>].

Sandberg bluegrass has been identified as a high water indicator plant
along Idaho waterways [<a href="#54">54</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Poa secunda
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sandberg bluegrass is a shallow-rooted, cool-season perennial
bunchgrass.  Growth form ranges from small tufts with only one or two
culms to large tussocks up to 1 foot (0.3 m) in diameter [<a href="#66">66</a>].  Sandberg
bluegrass is relatively short lived, and its populations tend to
fluctuate with annual weather conditions [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sandberg bluegrass regenerates by tillering and by seed.  Plants are
pollinated by wind or are self-fertile.  Sandberg bluegrass can also
produce viable seed without pollination (facultative apomixis)
[<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Sandberg bluegrass produces significant amounts of seed
in most years.  In the laboratory, fifty percent germination was
obtained from fresh seed after a 3-month afterripening period [<a href="#64">64</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sandberg bluegrass occurs on flats and ridgetops, slopes, meadows, and
open timberline.  It grows well in rich clay loam soils but most often
inhabits shallow, rocky, or sandy soils.  It is the characteristic grass
of the scablands of eastern Washington and Oregon [<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].  It is
usually found on well-drained soils.  Sandberg bluegrass is fairly
shallow-rooted and is favored over deeper-rooted perennials in areas
receiving frequent light rains or where soil moisture is otherwise
limited [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  In intermountain grassland of northeastern Nevada,
Sandberg bluegrass-dominated communities occurred on the driest sites
[<a href="#46">46</a>].  In southeastern Washington cheatgrass-Sandberg bluegrass
communities, Sandberg bluegrass generally dominated north-facing slopes,
while cheatgrass dominated south-facing slopes [<a href="#44">44</a>].  In southern Idaho,
Sandberg bluegrass was found to decrease on periodically flooded
streambanks [<a href="#54">54</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Sandberg bluegrass occurs in open sun to partial shade.  In fallow
fields in western Montana, it returned 7 years after plowing [<a href="#69">69</a>].
Sandberg bluegrass tends to persist with fire and/or grazing.  In the
absence of fire in sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) steppe, it may be shaded
out by sagebrush [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].  Sandberg bluegrass succession in plant
communities other than sagebrush steppe is poorly documented, but it is
likely that with canopy closure, Sandberg bluegrass becomes shaded out
in any plant community in which it occurs.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Sandberg bluegrass completes spring growth earlier than many other
perennial grasses.  Because it is a shallow-rooted species, it must
complete growth and seed production before available soil moisture has
been depleted on summer-dry ranges [<a href="#10">10</a>].

In eastern Washington, Sandberg bluegrass has two periods of maximum
leaf height:  midwinter and May.  Leaves begin growing in fall as soon
as rains begin.  Soaking rains are not necessary; light showers are
sufficient to initiate growth.  The decline in growth after midwinter
may be due to autosenescence of fall leaves.  Spring leaves generally
reach maximum development late in the season.  Cessation of growth
coincides with depletion of soil moisture in the top 4 inches (10 cm) of
soil.  Sandberg bluegrass roots appear to be active in the temperature
range of 42 to 59 degrees Fahrenheit (5.5-15 deg C) [<a href="#19">19</a>].

The following data were collected from 1941 to 1947 on the upper Snake
River Plain of Idaho at 5,500 feet (1,676 m) elevation.  Average
precipitation was 10 inches (254 mm).  The average date of snowmelt
during this period was March 30 [<a href="#10">10</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Sandberg bluegrass is generally unharmed by fire.  It produces little
litter, and its small bunch size and sparse litter reduces the amount of
heat transferred to perennating buds in the soil [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Its rapid
maturation in the spring also reduces fire damage, since it is dormant
when most fires occur [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Sandberg bluegrass cover often increases
when interference from other species is reduced by fire [<a href="#9">9</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Sandberg bluegrass is usually unharmed or only slightly damaged by fire
[<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].  In a big sagebrush-Thurber needlegrass (Stipa thurberiana)
community near Boise, Idaho, Wright and Klemmedson [<a href="#71">71</a>] observed no size
reduction of dormant Sandberg bluegrass 1 to 3 inches (2.5-7.6 cm) in
basal area after either June, July, or August fires (see the Summer
Fire/Combustion Chamber/ID fire case study).  Fire may cause damage if
litter has accumulated at the base of the plant, and/or if plants are
old and pedestaled [<a href="#72">72</a>].  Large bunches are more susceptible to damage
than small ones, probably because of greater litter buildup [<a href="#71">71</a>] and/or
because the growing points of the elevated plants are no longer
insulated by soil [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].  Tisdale [<a href="#62">62</a>] reported some damage to
pedestaled Sandberg bluegrass in sagebrush with 7 to 14 percent big
sagebrush cover [<a href="#52">52</a>].

Seed mortality and postfire seedling emergence:  Fire effects on the
Sandberg bluegrass seedbank are not well documented, but fire may kill
some seed in the upper layer of soil.  In one study, Sandberg bluegrass
seedling emergence was significantly reduced by both "cool" and "hot"
prescribed fires.  In a burning chamber, used onsite in a mountain big
sagebrush community in eastern Oregon, soil surface temperatures reached
a maximum of 219 degrees Fahrenheit (104 deg C) after 30 seconds with
prescribed cool fire and a maximum of 781 degrees Fahrenheit (416 deg C)
after 60 seconds with hot fire.  After the fires, soil samples were
collected from the burn sites from two depths (0-1 cm and 1-2 cm),
samples from the two depths were mixed, and the mixed-depth samples were
used for greenhouse emergence trials.  Number of emerging Sandberg
bluegrass seedlings follows.  Means followed by different letter differ
at the 5 percent significance level; means followed by an asterisk also
differed at the 1 percent significance level [<a href="#14">14</a>].

<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Sandberg bluegrass generally increases after fire [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].  Some
variablity in repsonse has been reported, however.  Conditions that may
produce variability such as site differences, prefire plant condition,
and postfire weather are not well documented.

Variability in fire effects is reported for Sandberg bluegrass on big
sagebrush-bunchgrass sites on the Snake River Plain of Idaho.  The sites
were prescription burned in 1936, protected from grazing for 1 year, then
lightly grazed in spring and fall by domestic sheep.  At postfire year
15, Sandberg bluegrass on severely burned plots was producing less than
plants on less severely burned plots.  At a different location in the
same study, there was no difference in Sandberg bluegrass production on
plots of different burn severity after 12 years [<a href="#10">10</a>].  After 30 years,
all burned plots were producing more Sandberg bluegrass than unburned
plots, and the differences in Sandberg bluegrass production attributed
to fire severity were negligible.  Annual production of Sandberg
bluegrass (lb/acre, air-dry) on unburned (UB) and burned (B) plots was
as follows [<a href="#32">32</a>]:

     |__________________________________________________________|

Increases:  Fire generally favors production of Sandberg bluegrass and
other bluegrasses (Poa spp.) over bluebunch wheatgrass when bluegrasses
and bluebunch wheatgrass occur together.  Bluegrasses may also compete
successfully with cheatgrass as a result of the tillering that occurs
following the reduction of litter and improved insolation caused by fire
[<a href="#20">20</a>].  But these postfire gains last only a few years, after which
cheatgrass resumes prefire dominance.

After a mid-July fire in western Montana, an increase in Sandberg
bluegrass cover was noted the first postfire year.  Additionally, the
percentage of Sandberg bluegrass plants bearing flowering stalks was 73
percent on burned plots compared to 44 percent on unburned control
plots [<a href="#48">48</a>].

Sandberg bluegrass cover increased significantly (p < 0.05) on burned
plots compared to unburned control plots following September and October
(1978) prescribed burning in Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata
ssp. wyomingensis)-bluebunch wheatgrass near Boise, Idaho.  In postfire
year 1 (1979), precipitation was below normal in spring and near normal
for the rest of the year.  In 1980, precipitation was two times above
normal.  Percent cover of Sandberg bluegrass was [<a href="#15">15</a>]:

                    |_______________|______________|

Four years after August wildfire in a big sagebrush-bunchgrass community
in southeastern Oregon, Sandberg bluegrass and other bunchgrasses
dominated burned sites.  Big sagebrush and forbs dominated adjacent
unburned sites [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Decline:  Sandberg bluegrass cover was less on burned plots relative to
unburned plots 2 years after spring or fall prescribed burning in Wind
Cave National Park, South Dakota [<a href="#12">12</a>].

<b>SEASON/SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION : </b>
Lava Beds:  late spring/moderate
Crooked River:  fall/severe


<b>STUDY LOCATION : </b>
The study was conducted at two locations.  The first study area was on
Lava Beds National Monument,  California.  The second was on the Crooked
River National Grassland near Prineville, Oregon [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>PREFIRE VEGETATIVE COMMUNITY : </b>
Four plant communities on two locations were burned.  Mountain big
sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana) was the dominant prefire
shrub in all four communities.  At Lava Beds National Monument, the
relatively mesic north-facing slopes were occupied by mountain big
sagebrush/Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis) communities that included
Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda), bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria
spicata), Thurber's needlegrass (Stipa thurberiana), prairie junegrass
(Koeleria macrantha), and cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), in descending
order of frequency.  Swales and hilltops were dominated by mountain big
sagebrush/bluebunch wheatgrass-Thurber's needlegrass communities.
Sandberg bluegrass and prairie junegrass were also present in these
communities, with lesser amounts of bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus
elymoides) and cheatgrass.  At Crooked River National Grasslands, the
prefire community was mountain big sagebrush/bluebunch wheatgrass.
Cheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, Idaho fescue, and bottlebrush
squirreltail were also present, in descending order of frequency [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>TARGET SPECIES PHENOLOGICAL STATE : </b>
Sandberg bluegrass was dormant and desiccated at time of burning on both
sites [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>SITE DESCRIPTION : </b>
Lava Beds site:  Mean annual temperature is 47.7 degrees Fahrenheit (8.7
deg C); mean annual precipitation is 14.5 inches (363 mm).  The site is
on a broken monocline at 4,465 feet (1,353 m) elevation.  Slopes vary
from 0 to 8 percent.

Crooked River site:  Mean annual temperature is 45.1 degrees Fahrenheit
(7.3 deg C); mean annual precipitation is 14.0 inches (349 mm).  The
site is on a 60 percent, northwest-facing slope at 3,379 feet (1,024 m)
elevation.  The upper 8 inches (20 cm) of soil is tuffaceous gravel less
than 0.8 inch (2 cm) in diameter with little soil between the coarse
material [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>FIRE DESCRIPTION : </b>
The purpose of the prescribed fires was to reduce mountain big sagebrush
cover and increase cover of bunchgrasses.  Four plant communities were
burned in 1976.  Ten 20 x 50 cm plots were located along four 15-m
transects for determining herbaceous frequency, basal cover, height, and
production [<a href="#1">1</a>].  The Lava Beds fire was a late spring burn conducted 2
days after 0.5 inch (13 mm) of rain.  The Crooked River fire was a fall
burn conducted 4 days after 0.4 inch (10 mm) of rain.  Shrub fuel
loading was similar at the four sites.  Strip head fires were used to
ignite each area.  Flame lengths were 3 times greater and rate of fire
spread 10 times faster at Crooked River than at Lava Beds, resulting in
a fire intensity much greater than at Lava Beds [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Average weather conditions at the two study locations during prescribed
burning were [<a href="#1">1</a>]:

<b>FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES : </b>
Sandberg bluegrass productivity generally increased after prescribed
burning, although response differed by site, fire intensity, and
postfire weather conditions.  At Lava Beds, precipitation in the first
postfire winter was 130 percent of normal.  Precipitation at Crooked
River in the first postfire winter was 86 percent of normal [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>].
Sandberg bluegrass on the driest site at Lava Beds (hilltop) showed no
response.  Production increased on the north slope and swale sites of
Lava Beds and on the Crooked River site [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Two years after burning at Lava Beds, Sandberg bluegrass had
significantly increased basal cover in Idaho fescue communities, and had
regained prefire basal cover in swale and hilltop bluebunch
wheatgrass-Thurber's needlegrass communities.  Sandberg bluegrass showed
little change on bluebunch wheatgrass communities at Crooked River.
Basal cover of Sandberg bluegrass before burning (1976) and after
burning (1977 and 1978) was [<a href="#1">1</a>]:

<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS : </b>
The prescribed fires generally favored Sandberg bluegrass growth,
especially on the more mesic sites.  At both Lava Beds and Crooked
River, the fires reduced mountain big sagebrush cover to less than 1
percent.  Removal of shrubs and litter contributed to increased soil
temperatures and therefore, to earlier growth of Sandberg bluegrass.
Early growth and Sandberg bluegrass' shallow, spreading root system
enabled Sandberg bluegrass to take advantage of early spring rains.
With reduced competition from other species, Sandberg bluegrass
increased in height and basal area [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>].  At Lava Beds, Sandberg
bluegrass and bluebunch wheatgrass apparently increased at the expense
of Idaho fescue and Thurber's needlegrass.  This advantage was
especially evident on the relatively moist Idaho fescue and swale sites,
but also evident on the hilltop site [<a href="#2">2</a>].

The timing of the two fires in relation to drought conditions of 1977
may have influenced the rapid recovery of Sandberg bluegrass cover at
the Lava Beds site.  At Lava Beds, a heavy 3.1-inch (79-mm) August rain
occurred less than 1 month after the fire.  At Crooked River, drought
followed immediately after the fire.  In addition, Lava Beds received 61
percent of its normal precipitation between September 1976 and June
1977, while Crooked River received only 41 percent of its normal
precipitation during that period.

were on a site which had been burned and seeded to crested wheatgrass
(Agropyron cristatum) in 1957 (3 years prior to the study).  Crested
wheatgrass establishment was poor to fair.  Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum)

<b>FIRE DESCRIPTION : </b>
Sandberg bluegrass plants were burned individually.  Plants were
selected by two basal area size classes.  Classes were 0.5 to 1.5 inches
(1.27-3.81 cm) in diameter, and greater than 2 inches (5.08 cm) in
diameter.  A combustion chamber made from a 55-gallon oil drum and a
metal ring restricted the fire to the vicinity of the study plant.
Other plants and litter within a 1-foot (30.5-cm) radius from the study
plant were removed.  Shredded paper was used for fuel.  Fuel levels were
predetermined to give maximum soil temperatures of 200 degrees
Fahrenheit and 400 degrees Fahrenheit (93 and 204 deg C).  Burning
treatments occurred on June 9, July 8, and August 18, 1960.

There was no significant change in basal area at any season for either size
class.


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS : </b>
Sandberg bluegrass was relatively unaffected by fire in this study.
Dormancy and the unpedestaled condition of the plants were probably
responsible for their survival.  Pedestaled plants may be more
susceptible to fire damage, since their growing points are uninsulated
by soil.
