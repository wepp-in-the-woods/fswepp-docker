<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juniperus californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
California juniper is distributed from Shasta County, California, south
as far as Baja California Norte [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  California juniper occurs
through the inner Coast Ranges and in interior cismontane southern
California to the western slope of the southern Sierra Nevada.  It
occurs on desert slopes from the western edge of the Colorado Desert and
Joshua Tree National Monument to Kern County, California [<a href="#25">25</a>].
California juniper also occurs in isolated parts of Nevada and Arizona,
near their border with California [<a href="#7">7</a>].  It is cultivated in Hawaii [<a href="#41">41</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
California juniper is codominant primarily with singleleaf pinyon (Pinus
monophylla) in the pinyon-juniper type.  This type occupies lower
elevations than the Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) type [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].
California juniper is an understory associate in the blue oak (Quercus
douglasii)-narrowleaf goldenweed (Haplopappus linearfolius) community
found in the central and southern coastal foothills [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  It also
occurs frequently as a scattered tree in grasslands, in interior live
oak woodlands (Quercus wislizenii), and microsites in chaparral [<a href="#6">6</a>].  On
the desert side of mountain ranges, it is associated with desert
chaparral [<a href="#18">18</a>].  California juniper is an indicator of Joshua tree
(Yucca brevifolia) woodland [<a href="#29">29</a>] and occurs in widely dispersed small
groves in southern California [<a href="#38">38</a>].

California juniper is listed as a codominant or dominant species in the
following classifications:

Desert scrub communities in the Sonoran Desert of California and Arizona
  [<a href="#8">8</a>].
General vegetation communities of southern California [<a href="#17">17</a>].
General vegetation plant associations of southern California [<a href="#28">28</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juniperus californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
California junipers are rarely used for sawn products because they are
small and have poor growth form [<a href="#24">24</a>].  California juniper has a low tree
volume and is too poorly formed to have measurable volume in main-stem
sections [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Juniper fenceposts are well known in rangelands, where it
is said that "a juniper post will outlast two post holes" [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Besides
a source of fenceposts, California juniper is also a source of fuelwood
and Christmas trees.  As technology improves and demand increases,
California juniper may become more important [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
California juniper in pinyon-juniper woodlands provide food and shelter
for deer, elk, pronghorn, wild horses, Merriam's turkeys, and other
animals.  The berry crops that are produced annually are consumed by
birds and mammals [<a href="#2">2</a>].  As California juniper matures, its foliage
becomes too high for deer to reach, thus providing little winter forage
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  On winter range, California juniper serves as emergency food for
sheep and goats and as staple browse for deer [<a href="#31">31</a>].

On Christmas Tree Pass, Nevada, areas of dense California juniper
supported birds such as Scott's oriole (Iclerus parisorum), Lesser
goldfinch (Carduelis psaltria), bushtit (Psaltriparus minimus), mourning
dove (Zenaida macroura), ladder-backed woodpecker (Picoides scalaris),
ruby-crowned kinglet (Regulus calendula), and ash-throated flycatcher
(Myiarchus cinerascens) [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability of California juniper is fair to poor for deer and goats,
poor to useless for sheep, and useless for cattle and horses [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
California juniper provides fair to poor cover for deer and other
similar-sized mammals when vegetation is sparse; the cover value
improves as vegetation becomes more dense [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Native Americans used California juniper wood for sinew-backed bows.
They also ground up the berries (ie. fleshy cones) and molded them into
cakes, which were said to taste sweet [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Silvicultural information pertaining to pinyon-juniper is sparse.
Silvicultural situations and methods depend on management and stand
characteristics.  California juniper is not suitable for seed-tree
regeneration [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Rotations for wood production are long because of
slow growth rates.  These vary from 100 years at best sites to 300 years
at poor sites.  For Christmas trees, the rotation is 20 to 50 years
[<a href="#24">24</a>].

Harvests of California juniper should remove merchantable trees with
poor growth form that are infested with mistletoe, or those not expected
to survive until the next harvest.  Slash burning after a harvest should
reduce fire hazard to acceptable conditions.  Christmas tree cutting
should be exclusive to younger stands [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Thinning pinyon-juniper woodlands is usually not cost effective unless
Christmas trees or some other product can be removed [<a href="#32">32</a>].  

California juniper can be important for watershed management [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Juniper mistletoe (Phoradendron juniperinum ssp. juniperinum) is
specific to juniper species and is the most important pathogen in
pinyon-juniper woodlands [<a href="#24">24</a>].  In lower parts of the Sierra San Pedro
Marti, California, juniper is susceptible to another mistletoe,
Phoradendron bolleanum ssp. densum [<a href="#16">16</a>].

For trees infected with dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium spp.), the
shelterwood method (even-aged management) can be effectively used for
treatment in stands if seedlings are not infected.  In severely infected
stands, clearcutting is often the only effective method for treatment
and preventing its spread.  Prescribed fires when used with clearcutting
to increase forage yield kill infected seedlings and reduce logging
slash [<a href="#32">32</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juniperus californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
California juniper is a native conifer that is adapted to xeric sites
[<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  As a seedling under 12 inches (30cm) in height, it is shade
dependent [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Its growth is crooked, forked, and multistemmed [<a href="#6">6</a>].
Its branches are stiff with irregular stems [<a href="#25">25</a>].

Its scalelike leaves are denticulate at the margins, glandular, pitted
on the back, and bluntly pointed [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  The leaves occur in whorls of
two.

At maturity, California juniper reaches 3 to 15 feet (1-4.5 m),
occassionally reaching 40 feet (12 m) in height [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].

Each fruit contains one to two seeds, and the ripe berries are reddish
brown [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
California juniper seeds are dispersed by birds and mammals, which eat
the berries and then excrete viable, scarified seeds [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Minimum
seed-bearing age is not reported [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
California juniper most commonly occurs in pinyon-juniper woodlands that
border and integrate with chaparral along desert margins [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  This
woodland type also occurs with montane forest elements, with Joshua tree
woodland, and with coastal sage scrub [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  California juniper is a
dominant species in desert chaparral [<a href="#14">14</a>].

California juniper occurs in a climate that has mild, moist, sunny
winters and hot, dry summers.  Most precipitation falls between December
and April, with annual precipitation ranging from less than 12 to more
than 40 inches (300-1,000 mm) at higher elevations [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Winter
temperatures range from 25 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit (-4 - 18 deg C), and
summer temperatures range from 55 to more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit
(12-38 deg C).  The growing season of California juniper is 340 to 360
days [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Soils of chaparral are porous, rocky, coarse, and sandy or silty.  These
soils are low in clay and in nutrients in comparison to agricultural
soils.  These soils are also very shallow [<a href="#14">14</a>].  California juniper also
occurs on alluvial fans and steep slopes [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  

The altitude at which California juniper occurs varies as follows
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>]:

Location                      Feet            Meters
Christmas Tree Pass, NV    3,220-4,020        975-1,218     
Sonoran Desert, CA         3,500-10,000       1,060-3,030
San Beradino and 
San Gabriel Mountains, CA  3,000-9,000        900-2,700

California juniper is most commonly associated with singleleaf pinyon.
Associates other than those previously mentioned vary between habitats.
Montane conifer forest associates are mentioned in the Distribution and
Occurrence frame.  Pinyon-juniper woodland associates are
mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus spp.), bitterbrush (Purshia spp.),
snakeweed (Gutierrizia brecteata), narrowleaf goldenweed, and California
buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum) [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  Desert edge and chaparral
associates include oaks (Quercus spp.), blackbrush (Coleogyne
ramosissima), creosotebush (Larrea divaricata), chamise (Adenostoma
fasciculatum), manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.), ceanothus (Ceanothus
spp.), birchleaf mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus spp.), desert
bitterbrush (Purshia glandulosa), Dorrs sage (Salvia dorii), and
cliffrose (Cowania spp.)  [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Climax Species

Mature California juniper is not shade tolerant.  Seedlings, however,
appear to be shade dependent, possibly because these seedlings will
replace the juniper they grow up under [<a href="#24">24</a>].  In the absence of
disturbance (fire or other), junipers tend to replace themselves as
mature stands gradually die out [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Severe fires result in
elimination of nonsprouting junipers, such as California juniper, and
favor fire-adapted species of desert chaparral [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  On rocky breaks
where it is protected from fire, California juniper is a climax species,
but in grasslands frequently disturbed by fire, California juniper is
not a climax species [<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Despite a growing season that is between 340 and 360 days, height growth
of dominant juniper trees is only 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm) per year and
diameter growth only 0.04 to 0.2 inch (1-5 mm) per year [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Water is
the growth-limiting factor; tree age is not a major influence on the
growth rate [<a href="#24">24</a>].

California juniper flowers in the spring [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>], and seeds germinate in
early spring [<a href="#22">22</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juniperus californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
California juniper is a nonsprouting, fire-sensitive species [<a href="#15">15</a>].  It
may depend on protected areas to survive fires.  Unburned "islands" of
California juniper were observed on a lightly burned slope [<a href="#34">34</a>].
Frequency of fire in grasslands prevents California juniper from
becoming a dominant species in those areas.  Several years are required
for nonsprouting species to set seed [<a href="#39">39</a>].  In the pinyon-juniper type,
fires are infrequent due to sparse understory growth [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Secondary colonizer - on-site seed
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juniperus californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
California juniper is usually killed by fire [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
After fire, other chaparral species may become dominant [<a href="#15">15</a>].  No
California juniper seedlings were found in burned areas in the first and
second postfire years [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Years are required for nonsprouting
conifers to establish after a fire [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Due to effective fire control practices during the last 50 years, stands
of California juniper have extended their range to areas that formerly
supported grasses only [<a href="#32">32</a>]. 

Pinyon-juniper woodland can be converted to chaparral by severe burning
because fire eliminates nonsprouting dominant woodland species [<a href="#15">15</a>].
Fires often result in conversion of pinyon-juniper woodland to open
chaparral or sagebrush [<a href="#18">18</a>].

A burning frequency of 15 years or less is considered desirable for
maintenance of nonsprouting shrubs [<a href="#32">32</a>].
