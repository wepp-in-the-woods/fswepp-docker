<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Western huckleberry grows as an understory dominant in certain moist
lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and/or
Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) forests.  In parts of California
and the Northwest, it grows with lodgepole pine, red fir (A.
magnifica), and white fir (A. concolor) [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Western huckleberry is
also an important understory shrub in mixed subalpine forests in the
Sierra Nevada [<a href="#40">40</a>] and is a common component of slow-draining bogs in
the northern Sierra Nevada and Klamath Mountains [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Shrub
communities dominated by western huckleberry often occur in narrow bands
or patches in bogs or mesic forest openings.  Common codominants in
western huckleberry shrub communities include bluejoint reedgrass
(Calamagrostis canadensis), Sitka sedge (Carex sitchensis), water sedge
(C.  aquatilis), few-flowered spikerush (Eleocharis pauciflora),
widefruit sedge (C. eurycarpa), tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia
cespitosa), and sweetberry honeysuckle (Lonicera caerulea).

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vaccinium uliginosum ssp. occidentale
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Browse:  The young twigs and leaves of western huckleberry provide high
quality browse for deer in some locations [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Certain lodgepole
pine/western huckleberry-forb wetlands of central Oregon are critical
habitat for mule deer during spring, summer, and fall [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Green
foliage of western huckleberry often appears prior to snowmelt [<a href="#21">21</a>], and
browse may be particularly valuable to deer and elk during the early
spring when food is scarce.  In other areas it is rarely used by deer or
elk in any season [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  The value of western huckleberry browse to
domestic sheep and goats ranges between good and poor [<a href="#30">30</a>].  In some
areas, it is considered fair to good sheep and goat browse, particularly
during the fall.  Western huckleberry receives some local use by cattle
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Use of western huckleberry by wildlife and livestock may be
limited by its restricted and often rather localized distribution [<a href="#8">8</a>].
On particularly wet microsites, it can be used only after the ground
dries sufficiently for animals to access the area [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Fruit:  Berries of western huckleberry are readily eaten by many birds
including blue and spruce grouse.  Thrushes, towhees, ruffed grouse, and
sharp-tailed grouse consume the fruit of many huckleberries (Vaccinium
spp.).  Mammals such as chipmunks, red fox, gray fox, skunks, and
squirrels also feed on huckleberry fruit [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Berries of western
huckleberry are readily eaten by both black and grizzly bears [<a href="#14">14</a>] and
by many small mammals.


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability of western huckleberry browse is described as low to
moderate for deer, elk, and domestic livestock [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Mattson [<a href="#28">28</a>]
reports that it is relatively unpalatable to wild ungulates in the
vicinity of Yellowstone National Park.  However, Dayton [<a href="#8">8</a>] observed
that western huckleberry is "one of the more palatable browse species of
the genus."  Fruit is highly palatable to many birds and mammals.


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Huckleberry (Vaccinium spp.) foliage is relatively high in carotene,
manganese, and energy value [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Huckleberry fruits are sweet and
contain high concentrations of both mono- and di-saccharides [<a href="#42">42</a>].
Berries are rich in vitamin C and energy content but low in fats
[<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Western huckleberry provides good cover for a variety of wildlife
species.  It commonly forms dense thickets beneath lodgepole pine [<a href="#28">28</a>],
which can serve as favorable nesting, resting, or hiding cover for many
smaller birds and mammals.  Engelmann spruce/western huckleberry habitat
types of western Oregon provide good cover for deer and elk.  These
sites, which commonly border bogs or marshes, are preferred locations
for calving and rearing young [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Most huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.) can be propagated from hardwood
cuttings or from seed.  Seedlings grown in the greenhouse can be
transplanted onto favorable sites 6 to 7 weeks after emergence.  Seed
collection and storage techniques have been examined in detail [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Fruits of western huckleberry were traditionally used by many native
peoples.  Berries of the western huckleberry are eaten fresh, cooked, or
made into jams and wine [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Berries are sweet and pulpy but rather
dry and "of poor quality" compared with the fruit of many other species
of Vaccinium [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Consequently, western huckleberry is not
considered to be one of the most important berry producers [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Many huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.) have value as ornamentals.  Schultz
[<a href="#41">41</a>] reports western huckleberry-evergreen huckleberry (V. ovatum)
hybrids may have horticultural value.


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Chemical control:  Huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.) exhibit variable
susceptibility to herbicides such as 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, glyphosate,
karbutilate, and picloram [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Wildlife considerations:  Huckleberries are an extremely important food
source for grizzly bears [<a href="#26">26</a>] and both black and grizzly bears typically
exploit areas with dense concentrations of berries.  The habitat value
of huckleberry shrubfields to grizzly bears can be increased by
permanent or at least seasonal road closures, by coordinating timber
harvest dates to have minimal impact on habitat use patterns, and by
considering the cumulative effects of habitat modification across a
broad area.  In general, site preparation should include minimizing soil
compaction, using cool broadcast burns rather than hot slash burns, or
by eliminating site preparation entirely wherever possible.  Grizzly use
is favored where hiding cover is retained by treating small, irregular
patches instead of large contiguous areas, and by leaving stringers of
timber within larger cuts [<a href="#50">50</a>].  In many areas, bear-human conflicts are
most likely to occur during years of huckleberry crop failure [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>],
as hungry bears come into contact with recreationists or wildland
residents.  Damage to crops and beehives, and livestock losses also
typically increase during poor huckleberry years [<a href="#38">38</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vaccinium uliginosum ssp. occidentale
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Western huckleberry is a branching, erect or low semispreading shrub
[<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Plants are sometimes compact and decumbent [<a href="#31">31</a>] and can
form dense, extensive thickets or clones [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Western huckleberry
typically reaches 8 to 36 inches (20-91 cm) in height [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  Twigs are
yellow-green, smooth, round, and glabrous [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].

Small, thin, alternate leaves are oblanceolate to obovate, acute at the
base and rounded to obtuse at the apex [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  Leaves are
generally less than one-half as long as broad [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Leaves are glaucous
bluish-green, and often paler or with a waxy, whitish bloom on the lower
surface [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Leaves turn a bright red or yellow in the fall [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].

The urn-shaped flowers of western huckleberry are pink or white [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].
Flowers are generally borne singly or in clusters of two to four in the
leaf axils [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Fruit is an ellipsoid or spherical berry 0.16 to
0.2 inch (4-5 mm) thick [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Berries are blue or bluish-black,
with a dense, waxy bloom [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  Western huckleberry, a
cluster-fruited species, can produce 10 to 20 times more fruit than
single-fruited species of similar size [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Berries are sweet but
rather dry, and contain approximately 10 individual seeds [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].
Seeds are small, brown, compressed, and "cellular-pitted" [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Western huckleberry is capable of reproducing through seed or
vegetatively through sprouting of rhizomes or "underground stems" [<a href="#41">41</a>].
Vegetative regeneration appears to be of primary importance in most
species of huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.) that occur in western North
America [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Seed:  Seeds of most huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.) are not dormant and
require no pretreatment for germination.  Seedlings first emerge in
approximately 1 month and continue to emerge for long periods of time in
the absence of cold stratification [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Schultz [<a href="#41">41</a>] reports that
western huckleberry "spreads readily by underground stems as well as by
seed."  However, other researchers report that seedlings of western
huckleberries are rarely encountered in the field [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Seed banking does not appear to be an important regenerative strategy in
western huckleberry.  The morphologically and ecologically similar bog
bilberry is characterized by seeds of short-viability which are readily
destroyed by fire [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Where plants are killed by disturbance,
reestablishment presumably occurs from off-site seed.  Edible berries
are widely dispersed by birds [<a href="#24">24</a>] and mammals.

Vegetative regeneration:  Most species of huckleberry regenerate from
basal sprouts or underground regenerative structures such as roots or
rhizomes [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Clones of western huckleberry generally expand through
rhizome sprouting even in the absence of disturbance [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Rhizome
sprouting is also likely where aboveground vegetation has been
eliminated but where underground regenerative structures remain
undamaged.  Basal stem sprouting has also been observed after much of
the aboveground portions of the plants have been destroyed by fire [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Western huckleberry grows well on open, moist, wet, swampy or boggy
sites [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Dense stands often develop on favorable sites such as
along the edges of fens, wet meadows, ponds, and streams, and at the
drier edges of mountain swamps [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  Since its presence is
largely restricted to moist sites, extensive thickets may be common
[<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>] but somewhat localized [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Clinal boundaries between western
huckleberry shrub communities and adjacent drier upland types are often
quite abrupt [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Soil:  Huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.) require acidic conditions and can
survive on infertile soils which have relatively low amounts of many
essential elements [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Western huckleberry often grows on sandy loams
with a pH of 4.2 to 5.2 [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Soils are wet to saturated, cold,
and with "appreciable" amounts of organic matter [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Extensive stands
of western huckleberry are commonly associated with a high water table
[<a href="#48">48</a>].

Elevation:  In the Pacific Northwest, western huckleberry generally
occurs at moderate to moderately high elevations [<a href="#22">22</a>].  However, it is
generally restricted to the highest elevations in the Great Basin [<a href="#30">30</a>].
Generalized elevational range by state has been documented as follows
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>]:

          from  5,000 to 11,000 feet (1,524-3,355 m) in CA
                5,700 to 8,100 feet (1,737-2,469 m) in MT
               10,800 to 11,513 feet (3,294-3,294 m) in UT
                6,800 to 11,000 feet (2,042-3,355 m) in WY


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
The successional role of western huckleberry is poorly known.  Taylor
[<a href="#43">43</a>] found no definite successional trends in western huckleberry
communities which border small ponds in Yellowstone National Park.  In
parts of western Oregon, western huckleberry forms climax associations
with Sitka sedge on poorly drained sites with undulating microtopography
[<a href="#21">21</a>].  It also codominates climax communities on boggy, poorly drained
soils with few-flowered spikerush [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Many moist sites dominated by
western huckleberry experience disturbances at infrequent intervals and
this shrub apparently persists between disturbances.

Western huckleberry often assumes prominence during early seral stages
if underground regenerative structures remain undamaged.  It may become
common during the second stage of succession in western redcedar (Thuja
plicata)-western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla)-grand fir (Abies grandis)
forests of Idaho following the decline of initial weedy invaders such as
fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium).  Sprouts of western huckleberry grow
rapidly and this shrub can become a prominent component of vegetative
communities within 2 to 3 years after disturbance [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Western huckleberry typically flowers in June or July [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Fruit
ripens in July or August [<a href="#47">47</a>].  Seasonal development by geographic
location has been documented as follows [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>]:

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vaccinium uliginosum ssp. occidentale
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Western huckleberry typically occurs on relatively moist to wet
microsites which burn infrequently [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Fire intervals for some boggy
sites dominated by this shrub have been estimated at 100 to 300 years
[<a href="#22">22</a>].  Many, if not most, fires occur when the soil is still at least
somewhat moist and plants typically resprout from stem bases or from
"underground stems" or rhizomes after light to moderate fires [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].
However, fires which occur when the flammable peaty soil is dry can
damage or destroy underground regenerative structures [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Limited seedling establishment may occur from off-site seed transported
by various birds and mammals.

<pre><center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vaccinium uliginosum ssp. occidentale
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Western huckleberry is described as "sensitive" to cool fires [<a href="#21">21</a>].
Even low-intensity fires can remove much of the crown [<a href="#30">30</a>].  However,
portions of the stem base, as well as underground regenerative
structures, often survive these light fires [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Western huckleberry
commonly occurs on peaty soils which are very flammable when dry.
Plants are often killed when the peat is deeply burned [<a href="#21">21</a>] and
underground regenerative structures destroyed by heat.

Fire generally destroys the heat-sensitive seeds of closely related
huckleberries such as bog bilberry [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Vegetative response:  Western huckleberry generally sprouts after light
to moderate fires [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Plants may be "naturally pruned" by light
fires which consume the crown but which remove little soil or duff [<a href="#30">30</a>].
Basal sprouting commonly occurs where stem bases remain relatively
undamaged [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Sprouting from rhizomes or "underground stems" is
likely if the crown has been destroyed but underground regenerative
structures left intact [<a href="#41">41</a>].

Seed:  Western huckleberry may occasionally reestablish a site through
seed [<a href="#41">41</a>].  However, many researchers report that postfire seedling
establishment is extremely rare in huckleberries of western North
America [26,(P. Stickney, pers. comm. 1990)].  Seeds of closely related
species, such as the bog bilberry, are of short viability and are
readily killed by heat [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Consequently, seed banking does not appear
to be an important postfire regenerative strategy.  Some seed may be
transported from off-site by birds [<a href="#24">24</a>] and mammals.

Postfire reestablishment:  Stem bases often sprout during the first year
after fire [<a href="#21">21</a>] and the length of time required for vegetative postfire
reestablishment is described as "moderate" [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Shrubs which develop
from resprouts can become prominent within 2 to 3 years after fire [<a href="#24">24</a>].
Postfire reestablishment from seed, if it occurs at all, is likely to be
slow.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Berry production:  Berry production is generally reduced for at least 5
years after fire in most huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.) of western North
America. On some sites, berry production may be significantly reduced
for 20 to 30 years or more [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Wildlife:  Evidence suggests that fire suppression may be having an
adverse impact on bear habitat in some areas [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Once productive
seral berry fields are now being invaded by conifers.  Since plants
beneath a forest canopy generally produce few berries, fruit production
has been steadily declining [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Logging treatments which include
severe soil scarification or slash burns may also result in decreased
berry availability.  Even where timber harvest favors berry production,
lack of cover in early years can limit bear use.  However, wildfires
often create diverse habitat mosaics which incorporate elements of
hiding cover and favor bear use [<a href="#50">50</a>].
