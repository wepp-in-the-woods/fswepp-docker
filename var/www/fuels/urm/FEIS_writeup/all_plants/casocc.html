<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Castilleja occidentalis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Western paintbrush occurs in the Rocky Mountains from British Columbia,
Alberta, and Montana south to Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico.  It is not
known to occur in Idaho or Wyoming.  In Montana, it has been found only
in Glacier National Park [<a href="#10">10</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability of western paintbrush has been rated as fair to good for
sheep, poor to fair for cattle, and poor for horses [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Western paintbrush has poor energy value and poor protein value.  Its
forage value has been rated as good for mule deer and fair for elk,
upland game birds, nongame birds, and small mammals [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Western paintbrush may provide cover for some small mammals [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Growth of western paintbrush is good on moderate slopes and fair on
steep slopes.  It has low to medium erosion-control potential.
Establishment requirements are medium.  Revegetation and biomass
production potentials are low [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Western paintbrush often occurs in fragile, wet meadows that are subject
to damage from trampling by humans and ungulates [<a href="#9">9</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Castilleja occidentalis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Western paintbrush is a woody-based, native, perennial, autotrophic forb
that grows 2 to 8 inches (5-20 cm) tall.  It has a short, dense
inflorescence, which is predominately yellow but varies to red and
purple and displays all intermediate colors [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Western paintbursh reproduces sexually by pollination and fertilization
and dispersal of resulting seed [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Western paintbrush grows in the high mountains on alpine slopes or
meadows, and on talus or rock slides.  It is common above timberline.
It grows best on sandy loam or loam.  Western paintbrush grows in areas
with late snowmelt.  It is often associated with tufted hairgrass
(Deschampsia caespitosa), golden avens (Geum rossii), and Bellard
kobresia (Kobresia myosuroides) [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].

In several western states, western paintbrush occurs at the following
elevational ranges:

        10,500 to 13,000 feet (3,385-4,195 m) in Colorado [<a href="#5">5</a>]
         6,500 to  7,500 feet (2,095-2,420 m) in Montana [<a href="#9">9</a>]
        10,100 to 11,160 feet (3,260-3,600 m) in Utah [<a href="#16">16</a>]


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Western paintbrush generally flowers in July and August [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Flowering
may begin as early as June in Montana and may end as late as September
in Colorado and Montana [<a href="#2">2</a>].
