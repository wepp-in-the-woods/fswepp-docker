<b>COMMON NAMES: </b>
pygmy sagebrush


<b>TAXONOMY: </b>
The fully documented scientific name of pygmy sagebrush is <i>Artemisia
pygmaea</i> A.Gray (Asteraceae) [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Pygmy sagebrush was formerly placed in the
monotypic section Pygmaeae by Rydberg (1916) [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Many later
researchers, including Beetle [<a href="#1">1</a>] and Ward [<a href="#22">22</a>], grouped <i>Artemisia
pygmaea</i> into the section Tridentatae.  According to McArthur [<a href="#12">12</a>],
karyotype, stem anatomy, and chromatography all suggest an affinity with
the section Tridentatae.  This unique species is, however, considered by
many to be difficult to place taxonomically [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Possible origins
of pygmy sagebrush are also unclear.  Beetle [<a href="#1">1</a>] maintains that pygmy
sagebrush has more features in common with black sagebrush (<i>Artemisia
nova</i>) and may have diverged from this stalk long ago.  Other researchers
believe that a prototype of the Tridentatae line may have given rise to
pygmy sagebrush [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  According to Beetle [<a href="#1">1</a>], pygmy sagebrush is one
of the most uniform types in Tridentatae and shows little evidence of
hybridizing with other species.  Both diploid and tetraploid forms occur
[<a href="#13">13</a>].

<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION: </b>
Pygmy sagebrush occurs from northern Arizona throughout the Great Basin
of Nevada and Utah and the Uinta Basin of Utah and Colorado [<a href="#18">18</a>].  It is
uncommon but locally abundant throughout its range [<a href="#22">22</a>], which covers
approximately 21 square miles (5,000 ha) [<a href="#13">13</a>]. <a href="https://plants.usda.gov/">Plants database</a> provides

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Pygmy sagebrush grows in desert grassland, pinyon-juniper (<i>Pinus-Juniperus</i> spp.), 
and salt desert shrub communities of the Great Basin and Uinta Basin.  On some
mesic, less saline, salt desert sites, pygmy sagebrush, black sagebrush
and/or budsage (<i>Artemisia spinescens</i>) dominate the plant community [<a href="#23">23</a>].  

In Utah, pygmy sagebrush occurs in pinyon-juniper communities, and also occurs in 
large stands with black sagebrush [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>]. In Nevada it is most often associated 
with the halophytic threadleaf rubber rabbitbrush (<i>Chrysothamnus nauseosus</i> ssp. 
<i>consimilis</i>) [<a href="#13">13</a>].&nbsp; Pygmy sagebrush often grows in association with other cushion-formers 
[<a href="#22">22</a>], many of which are rare or narrowly endemic [<a href="#8">8</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="green"><b>SPECIES: Artemisia pygmaea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS: </b>
Pygmy sagebrush is a dwarf, depressed, perennial cushion-like evergreen
shrub or half-shrub which grows up to 8 inches (2 dm) in height [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].
Both diploid and tetraploid forms occur [<a href="#13">13</a>].

This desert species exhibits numerous morphological adaptations which
enable it to survive on extremely xeric sites.  Leaves are green,
glabrous, and pinnately divided into 3 to 11 lobes [<a href="#22">22</a>].  The numerous
stomates are sunken, and water vessels are extremely narrow which
facilitates water conservation [<a href="#17">17</a>].  The bark of older branches is
brown and fibrous, whereas younger branches are straw-colored and
puberulent [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Heads made up of three- to five-toothed disk flowers
are arranged in a spike-like inflorescence [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  Ray flowers are
lacking [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM [<a href="#15">15</a>]: </b>
Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES: </b>
Pygmy sagebrush regenerates readily from seed which matures in October
[<a href="#13">13</a>].  Seed is large for the genus Artemisia and averages 440,000 per lb
(970 per g) [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Pygmy sagebrush generally spreads well from naturally
dispersed seed, although artificial seeding has to date been largely
unsuccessful [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Pygmy sagebrush does not sprout after fire or other disturbance
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  It does, however, establish readily when individual plants are
divided and transplanted [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Information on seed dispersal mechanisms, germination, and establishment
is lacking.  Beetle [<a href="#1">1</a>] noted that seedlings of pygmy sagebrush are
"unknown."


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS: </b>
Widely disjunct populations of pygmy sagebrush grow on calcareous desert
soils of the Great Basin and Uinta Basin [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  Pygmy sagebrush occurs
on shale barrens at lower elevations [<a href="#18">18</a>] and has also been reported on
white gypsum outcrops in the Great Basin of Nevada [<a href="#4">4</a>]. It typically occurs 
extremely xeric sites [<a href="#17">17</a>].&nbsp; Growth on sandy loam, loam, and clay loam is 
described as "good" [<a href="#14">14</a>].&nbsp; Pygmy sagebrush grows well on alkaline soils 
[<a href="#14">14</a>].&nbsp; Optimum soil depth is 10 to 20 inches (25-51 cm) [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Pygmy sagebrush grows from 4,000 to 6,000 feet (1,220-1,830 m) elevation
throughout its range [<a href="#10">10</a>].  It occurs from 5,300 to 6,000 feet (1,617-1,830 m) 
in Utah [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS: </b>

<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT: </b>
Pygmy sagebrush flowers during August and September.  Seed matures

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS: </b>
Pygmy sagebrush is killed by fire, but readily established on burned

fire or other disturbance [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].

<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE: </b>
Pygmy sagebrush does not sprout after aboveground vegetation is killed

<pre><center><h2>Management Considerations</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="green"><b>SPECIES: Artemisia pygmaea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Pygmy sagebrush is small and relatively scarce and consequently provides
little forage for livestock or wildlife [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
In some areas of Utah, mule deer use of pygmy sagebrush is 
moderate [<a href="#16">16</a>].  However, Brunner [<a href="#4">4</a>] reported that pygmy sagebrush was
rarely browsed in the Great Basin of Nevada.  The overall value of pygmy
sagebrush as browse is probably low [<a href="#10">10</a>].  The palatability of pygmy 
sagebrush for wildlife in Utah is as follows [<a href="#5">5</a>]:

Cattle                Poor
Domestic sheep        Fair
Horses                Poor
Pronghorn             Fair
Elk                   Poor
Mule Deer             Poor
Small mammals         Fair
Small nongame birds   Poor
Upland game birds     Fair
Waterfowl             Poor                         


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Pygmy sagebrush is rated poor in energy and protein value [<a href="#5">5</a>].
Average utilization by mule deer and relative concentrations of 3
major volatile compounds from a Utah study are as follows [<a href="#16">16</a>]:

      utilization        methacrolein       alpha-pinene        arthole
          54%               0.35%             28.42%             1.62%



<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Pygmy sagebrush provides little cover for larger species of wildlife due
to its dwarf, cushion-like growth form.  Cover value of pygmy sagebrush
for wildlife in Utah is rated as follows [<a href="#5">5</a>]:  

Pronghorn            Poor
Elk                  Poor
Mule deer            Poor
Small mammals        Fair
Small nongame birds  Poor
Upland game birds    Poor
Waterfowl            Poor



<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Dittberner and Olson  [<a href="#5">5</a>] report that pygmy sagebrush has low value for 
erosion control and for long- and short-term revegetation.  Others claim
that this species has good potential for soil stabilization and is at
least moderately adapted for growth on many types of disturbed sites
[<a href="#14">14</a>].

Although pygmy sagebrush spreads well from naturally dispersed seed,
artificial plantings have been unsuccessful [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Seed preparation is
apparently difficult [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Individual plants can be divided and successfully 
transplanted onto disturbed sites [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
No additional information is available on this topic.


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Pygmy sagebrush provides valuable ground cover on dry alkaline sites
where few other species can survive [<a href="#13">13</a>].
