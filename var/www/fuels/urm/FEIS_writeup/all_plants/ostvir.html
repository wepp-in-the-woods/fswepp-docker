<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Eastern hophornbeam is found from Prince Edward's Island to Nova Scotia
west through Ontario and Manitoba, and south to the Black Hills of South
Dakota.  Its range includes all eastern states to northern Florida and
eastern Texas.  It also extends to the highlands of southern Mexico, and
south to Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Eastern hophornbeam most commonly occurs as a subordinate species in
maple(Acer spp.)-beech (Fagus spp.) and maple-basswood (Tilia spp.)
communities.  It is not an indicator of any particular habitat type
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ostrya virginiana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
The wood of eastern hophornbeam is strong, hard, heavy, and takes a fine
polish.  It is not harvested for timber because of its relatively small
size and scattered distribution.  The wood is used for posts, golf club
handles, tool handles, mallets, and woodenware [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Throughout its range, eastern hophornbeam is browsed by white-tailed
deer only incidentally.  White-tailed deer usually browse more desirable
species when available [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].

Buds and catkins of eastern hophornbeam are important winter food for
ruffed grouse, and the nuts are a secondary food in the fall.  The nuts
are also a preferred food for sharp-tailed grouse and wild turkey, and
is eaten to a lesser extent by northern bobwhite, red and gray
squirrels, cottontails, ring-necked pheasant, purple finch, rosebreasted
grosbeak, and downy woodpecker [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Eastern hophornbeam browse is rated low in palatability to white-tailed
deer [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The calcium content of the foliage of eastern hophornbeam is considered
high.  Concentrations frequently exceed 2 percent on the basis of
ovendry leaf weight.  Nitrogen concentrations range from moderate to
high but concentrations of phosphorus and potassium are usually low [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Eastern hophornbeam exhibits fast juvenile growth, indicating its
potential to provide vegetative cover in areas that have been disturbed
by overstory cutting.  Great increases in eastern hophornbeam have
occurred after northern hardwood stands less than 40 years old were
clearcut [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Propagation:  The seed may be sown in either fall or spring.  Seed can
be planted immediately in the fall in mulched beds using straw or
leaves.  For spring sowing the seed may be stratified over winter in
sand or peat at 41 degrees Fahrenheit (5.6 deg C).  Seeds are usually
planted 0.25 inch (0.6 cm) deep in well-drained loamy soil.  Expected
germination is 85 to 90 percent [<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Eastern hophornbean has been cultivated as an ornamental in the eastern
United States [<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Eastern hophornbeam is considered a weed species throughout most of its
range.  It is usually discriminated against in stands managed for
timber.  Silviculturally, more interest has been given to eradicating
it.  Tordon 101 and 2,4,5,T, applied by mist blowing, have been
successful in killing eastern hophornbeam [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

Damaging agents:  Eastern hophornbeam is relatively free of insect and
other disease problems.  The species is not readily injured by cold
temperatures until temperatures drop below 17 degrees Fahrenheit (8 deg
C).  It is sensitive to air pollutants.  In the upper Ohio River valley
it does not grow in areas with moderate levels of the oxides of sulfur,
nitrogen, chlorine, and fluorine.  The tough branches resist wind, snow,
and ice damage [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ostrya virginiana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Eastern hophornbeam is a small, slow-growing, shapely tree usually not
more than 35 feet (11 m) tall and 12 inches (30 cm) in d.b.h.
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  The tree develops a broad top (sometimes as much as 50 feet
[15 m] across) of small, spreading branches [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  The leaves are
alternate with slender hairy stems.  The twigs are tipped with slender,
cylindrical buds.  The pistillate flowers are in slender catkins.  The
hoplike fruit is 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) long and borne on short,
slender stems.  The thin, gray bark forms narrow, platelike scales
[<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Seed production and dissemination:  Eastern hophornbeam can easily be
propagated from seed [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  The hoplike stobile begins to break up
immediately after ripening, and the lightweight seeds are dispersed by
wind and birds throughout the fall and early winter.  Trees begin to
produce fruit at age 25 [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].

Seedling development:  Seeds usually germinate in the spring the year
after they are shed.  Germination is epigeal.  Seeds require
stratification to overcome a form of internal dormancy.  Germination
capacity is 27 to 65 percent [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Cut, burned, or injured trees commonly sprout
from the stump.  The proportion of stump sprouting increases with stump
height [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Eastern hophornbeam grows on a wide variety of sites but is most common
on dry-mesic and mesic valley bottoms and lower slopes.  Best
development occurs on loamy soils in ravines, on lower slopes, and on
well-drained floodplains of major rivers.  The lowest slope that it
occupies is determined by its intolerance to flooding [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Soil
pH ranges from 4.2 to 7.6 in the northern half of its range and 4.6 to
5.6 in the southern half .  Elevation ranges from 250 to 750 feet
(75-230 m) in Quebec to 5,000 feet (1,520 m) in the southern
Appalachians, but the species is most common at elevations ranging from
2,800 to 3,200 feet (850-980 m) [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].

Common tree associates include American elm (Ulmus americana), blackgum
(Nyssa sylvatica), sassafras (Sassafras albidium), flowering dogwood
(Cornus florida), hickories (Carya spp.), American holly (Ilex opaca),
and American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana).  Shrub associates include
mountain maple (Acer spicatum), roundleaf dogwood (Cornus rugosa), witch
hazel (Hamamelis virginiana), American elder (Sambucus canadensis),
American yew (Taxus canadensis), hobblebush (Viburnum alnifolium),
beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), southern bayberry (Myrica cerifera),
and greenbriers (Smilax spp.)  [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Climax Species

Eastern hophornbeam typically grows in climax forests in the northern
parts of its range.  It is classed as tolerant and will reproduce well
under full shade.  It is ranked high as a species climax potential
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  In the Southeast, eastern hophornbeam is associated with a
later seral stage that follows the pioneer pine communities.  It first
appears in Peidmont pine stands after about 90 years and in the
bottomland hardwoods after about 36 years [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
In the North, flowering occurs from mid-May to mid-June, and in the
South from late March to mid-April.  The fruits ripen by the end of
August in the North and as late as October in the South [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
After aboveground portions are killed by fire, eastern hophornbeam can
reestablish by sprouting from the root crowm [<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tree with adventitious-bud root crown/root sucker
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ostrya virginiana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Eastern hophornbeam can be killed by severe fires.  Areas burned
severely enough to kill most of the overstory in oak (Quercus spp.)
stands in Rhode Island contained no eastern hophornbeam 50 years later
[<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Eastern hophornbeam will sprout from the stump following fire.
Following spring fires in New York, 62 percent of the top-killed stems
sprouted, and in Minnesota, 100 percent of the top-killed stems sprouted
[<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>]. 


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Management practices that utilize periodic burning are highly effective
in controlling and eventually eliminating eastern hophornbeam [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

The initial incidence of fire in the Big Woods of Minnesota converted
the forest into a thicket of basswood and eastern hophornbeam.
Subsequent fires converted them to a bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa)
savanna [<a href="#23">23</a>].
