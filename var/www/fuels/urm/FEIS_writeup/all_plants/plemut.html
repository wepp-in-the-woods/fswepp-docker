<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
In the southwestern United States tobosa is an important forage
species for cattle and horses.  Although it is a highly productive grass
of southwestern rangelands, it is generally considered to be unpalatable
after maturity as the tough dry stems and leaves have little nutritional
value.  It is palatable to livestock only when it is green and succelent
during the summer months [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>], at which time it is considered good for
cattle and horses [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Grazing is generally restricted to spring
through early fall when its main growth occurs [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>]. It withstands
grazing very well during the summer at which time up to 60% of its
herbage production may be utilized without injury [<a href="#11">11</a>].  During drought
years it is considered a reserve feed by southwestern ranchers [<a href="#53">53</a>].
Tobosa has also been cut for hay.  The hay is readily eaten by
cattle if it is cut when green and succelent, and cattle fed on it will
remain in good condition throughout the winter [<a href="#37">37</a>].

On bottomland sites where tobosa occurs in almost pure stands it is
capable of producing abundant forage, sometimes several times that of
upland sites.  In Texas, during years of average precipitation,
tobosa yields are normally about 1,000 pounds per acre (892 kg/ha)
[<a href="#52">52</a>].  In southern New Mexico yields are normally 1,000 to 1,500 pounds
per acre (892-1338 kg/ha) [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Under management plans to remove dead
old growth, these stands can produce considerably larger amounts of
forage.  Early spring burns followed by sufficient moisture have
increased tobosa yields two to three fold in Texas [<a href="#53">53</a>].
   
In Texas it has been shown that tobosa may become infested with
ergot (Claviceps cinerea) [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Ingested tobosa infested with ergot
can cause a nervous condition in cattle.  The signs of poisoning
include excessive salivation, muscular twitching, staggering gait,
knuckling over the rear fetlock, and frequent urination.  There is
limited literature on this condition and the extent of outbreaks is
unknown.


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Throughout its range, the forage value of tobosa has been under
rated either because cattle prefer upland grama ranges (Bouteloua spp.)
where plants are more nutritious, or because after maturity plants
become coarse and unpalatable [<a href="#51">51</a>].  But during late spring to early
fall when plants are green and succulent their forage value is good for
cattle and horses, fair for sheep, and poor for wildlife [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].
This was observed in a New Mexico study where cattle would eat
tobosa only from July to October [<a href="#32">32</a>].  After growth has ceased the
stems and leaves become so dry and tough that they retain little value
and are refused by livestock if other feed is available [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The nutritional value of tobosa is highest during late spring to
early fall at which time plants are green and succulent.  At the end of
the growing season the crude protein content of tobosa's current years
growth was found to be 8.4%, while that of the previous years growth was
4.7 % [<a href="#1">1</a>], which is considered an unaceptable nutritional level.

Seasonal trends in the chemical composition of tobosa on the
Jornada Experimental Range in New Mexico are as follows [<a href="#28">28</a>]:

<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Deferred grazing is considered best for tobosa stands with utilization
occuring in the summer.  In areas where tobosa and black grama
(Bouteloua eripoda) occur in separate stands, it is best to fence large
areas of tobosa into permanent pastures.  This allows cattle to stay on
the tobosa during the summer months when it is most palatable;
black grama can then be grazed during the winter when it is palatable
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  Grazing utilization should not exceed 50% during any one year
[<a href="#56">56</a>].

One important characteristic about tobossagrass is its growth from
perennial stems.  With insufficient grazing, large quantities of
standing dead grass accumulate which decreases yields and palatability.
In Texas, it was shown that when this dead material is allowed to
increase, annual new growth will decrease until the yield stabalizes at
about 800 to 1100 pounds per acre (714-981 kg/ha) [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Removing old
growth may be done by heavy grazing, burning, or mowing it for hay.
Conservative continuous stocking during the growing season has been the
traditional stocking method on tobosa range.  But recent studies show
that flexible rotation grazing is not only more effective at reducing
this old growth than is continuous stocking, but that heifer live weight
gains per ha ranged 43 to 24 % less under continuous stocking than under
rotation grazing management [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Generally tobosa withstands
grazing well and is considered an increaser [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  Studying the
effects of different grazing intensities on tobosa in southern New
Mexico, it has been shown that protected areas tend to stagnate with
plants having the lowest basal area of four grazing intensities, while
in stands that were intermediately grazed plants had the highest basal
area [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Fire, which is discussed in more detail in the "Fire Effects" catagory,
is a very effective tool in managing tobosa stands in areas with
sufficient rainfall.  It is the most effective and the least expensive
method of removing old litter.  In Texas decadent stands of tobosa were
made productive and palatable by burning during a wet spring.  Here
cattle normally utilized only 10 % tobosa but following fire this
increased to 66 % [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Grazing should take place immediately after
burning so cattle can eat it while it is young and tender [<a href="#53">53</a>].  If it
is rested for three to four months after burning it will become coarse
and unpalatable.

Under most circumstances fertilization is not an economical way to
increase tobosa yields.  But ranchers with a limted amount of
tobosa could fertilize in some years to obtain additional summer
forage in order to defer their upland areas for winter-spring grazing.
Areas to be fertilized should have dense stands of tobosa and be
situated so they are likely to receive run off water even during drought
years.  Rates of 60 or 90 pounds of nitrogen per acre plus 0 or 13.1
pounds of phosphorus per acre seem best [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Benefits from
fertilization are not carried on to succesive years.

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pleuraphis  mutica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Tobosa is a native, warm season, perennial, rhizomatous, sod-
forming grass [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  Plants grow up to 3 feet (0.9 m), but 1 to
2 feet (0.3-0.6 m) is more the norm.  The smooth erect culms have
decumbent bases and are normally 1.2 to 3 feet (30-75 cm) tall [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].
Leaves are up to 6 inches (15 cm) long, stiff, harsh and hairless
[<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>], occuring mainly as a mass of basal leaves with only a few
located along the stem [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Rootstocks are strong, creeping, woody and
scaly.  Dense coarse and fibrous roots grow to depths of nearly 6 feet
(1.8 m) [<a href="#37">37</a>], but are poorly adapted to efficient absorption of moisture
from the soil [<a href="#9">9</a>].  The inflorescence consists of an erect spike 1.5 to
3 inches (4-8 cm) long, broad, and white, straw colored or occassionally
purplish [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  Spikelets are upright in clusters of three [<a href="#49">49</a>],
with about 30 fascicles on each spike [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Each fascicle is shed as a
unit [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Throughout its range, tobosa is capable of both vegetative and
sexual means of reproduction.  Vegetative reproduction through the
initiation of coarse rhizomes is most prevalent.  Tobosa has very
low seed production [<a href="#46">46</a>], with very few seedlings found in wild
populations [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Very few fertile seeds are produced.  This high
percentage of sterility may be attributed to a high ovule abortion rate
[<a href="#8">8</a>], and from heavy parasitism of the inflorescence by fungi [<a href="#18">18</a>].  For
seeds that are fertile, many fail to germinate; percent germination is
reported at 55 % [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Seed germination and seedling survival are
dependent upon adequate moisture and soil temperature.  Fluctuating
climatic conditions of late spring and early summer may be responsible
for poor germination and lack of subsequent seedling success.  When
viable seeds of tobosa were planted in high vs low temperature
regimes, the percentage of emergence was much higher at a low soil
temperature.  Viable seeds planted in a low soil temperature of 102
degrees F (39 C) had a 73.3% emergence, while those planted in a high
soil temperature of 127 degrees F (53 C) had only 24 % emergence [<a href="#41">41</a>].
In this study, growth and survival of emerging seedlings was also
lowered by high soil temperatures.  Due to all these factors seedling
survival in the field is generally low, making vegetative reproduction
the primary means of propogation.

Vegetative reproduction is through a system of well developed, large
rhizomes connected to a coarse root system [<a href="#9">9</a>].  This allows tobosa
to spread vegetatively into adjacent communities, although this spread
is relatively slow.  On favorable sites, it may form a dense, coarse sod
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  Frequent clipping stimulates vegatative reproduction.  Canfield
[<a href="#10">10</a>] postulated that clipping aided in activating buds which otherwise
may have remained dormant, but this stimulus is dissipated if plants are
clipped too closely.  He found that clipping plants weekly to a 4 inch
(10 cm) stubble produced 110% more total herbage than plants clipped at
2 inches (5 cm).


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Throughout its range, tobosa is found on both lowland and upland
sites.  Most characteristically though, it is found in soils that have
developed from basin fill material.  These are clay soils which are
tight and relatively impervious [<a href="#37">37</a>].  In these depressions where
surface runnoff accumulates and stands for a few days, it attains its
best development.  Here it is found in almost pure stands forming a
dense, coarse sod [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  Although tobosa prefers areas
subject to flooding, it is one of the first grasses to die when
submersed for periods of several months [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Typically the majority of
pricipitation occurs in the summer months, with 50% or more occuring
from July through September [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  It is found in mean annual
precipitation zones of 9 inches (23 cm) in New Mexico to 20 inches (50
cm) in Texas.

Tobosa also occurs on dry mesas, sandy-loam hills and rocky slopes.
On these dryer sites it grows in scattered stands of large, individual
tufts and is fairly resistant to drought [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  During extended
drought periods though it suffers more than its associates.  It is
intolerant of shifting sand [<a href="#9">9</a>].  

Typically growing on clay soils it is commonly associated with honey
mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa).  Other common associates on adobe clay
soils include burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolius), alkali sacaton
(Sporobolus airoides) and sacaton (S. wrightii).  On sandy clay or
gravelly clay loams, tobosa is often found with tarbush (Flourensia
cernua), black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda), side-oats grama (B.
curtipendula), dropseeds (Sporobolus spp.) and muhly grasses
(Muhlenbergia spp.).

Elevational ranges for some western states are presented below
[<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>]:

from  2,460 to 5,906 feet (750 to 1800 m) in AZ
from  3,000 to 6,500 feet (914 to 1981 m) in NM
from  1,600 to 3,300 feet (488 to 853 m)  in TX


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Tobosa along with black grama (Bouteloua eripoda) are two of the
most common grasses in the semi-desert grassland [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Black grama is
most characteristically found on gravelly upland sites, while tobosa is
the climax diminant of lowland sites with heavy soils which receive some
surface runoff from upland sites.  Where it reaches climax on these clay
soils it often forms dense almost pure stands.  In some areas burrograss
(Scleropogon brevifolius) and dropseed (Sporobolus auriculatus), which
are indicitive of late seral stages on these clay soils, increase during
drought years as the tobosa stands do not receive surface runoff [<a href="#9">9</a>].
When sufficient moisture returns tobosa is able to recover and will
eventually dominate the stand.
   
Tobosa is able to outcompete other grass associates unless overgrazing
or drought occur [<a href="#9">9</a>].  In some areas the native grasses have been
replaced by introduced annuals due to grazing.  Brown [<a href="#6">6</a>], notes that in
these areas tobosa may be the only native grass still remaining,
but the reasons for this are not stated.  Vast areas of tobosa
range are now dominated by creosotebush (Larrea tridentata), tarbush
(Flourensia cernua), and honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), having
the appearance of a short statured "soft chaparral".  Suppression of
fire and dispersal of seeds by cattle and rodents have caused this
disclimax vegetation which simulates the climax in terms of stability,
but is replaced by the true climax in the absence of disturbance
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Generally plants survive burning to become an early seral
component of the postburn community.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Tobosa begins its growth in the late spring or early summer after
sufficient precipitation ensures high soil moisture.  In many areas the
first rains of summer are torrential in character and flood the low
swales occupied by tobosa; until the flooding occurs little or no growth
takes place [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Most of the growth begins from terminal nodes on solid
perennial stems, with only a small amount of growth occuring from
tillers [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Most growth occurs in the spring and about 20 % occurs in
the early fall [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  Growth may occur any time during the frost free
season as long as sufficient moisture is available [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Tobosa is
drought tolerant and has the ability to become completely dormant as
soil moisture approaches the wilting point [<a href="#26">26</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pleuraphis  mutica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Tobosa has been widely cited as being stimulated by fire [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].
This warm season, sod forming grass has well developed rhizomes that are
deep enough in the soil that they are protected from fire.  It is from
these rhizomes, and basal root crowns that resprouting occurs following
fire.  Recovery is dependent upon moisture and season of burning.
Spring burns followed by sufficient precipitation produce the most rapid
recovery, when production often exceeds 2-3 times that of unburned
stands by the end of the first growing season [<a href="#5">5</a>].  In southern New
Mexico where there is only 9 inches (22.8 cm) of precipitation annually,
there is no increase in tobosa yields the first year after burning, no
matter what season the burning occurs [<a href="#15">15</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pleuraphis  mutica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Tobosa is very resistant to fire mortality.  New growth begins about two
weeks after the burn [<a href="#3">3</a>], with resprouting occuring from extensive
rhizomes and basal root crowns.  In Arizona and New Mexico tobosa grows
on both upland and lowland sites, but only in the lowland swales are
stands dense enough to carry a fire.  In Texas where moisture is not as
limiting, tobosa tends to grow more often in pure stands.  When found in
these pure stands it accumulates large amounts of litter (3,000 to 6,000
pounds per acre of continuous grass fuel [<a href="#5">5</a>]) which carries a fire quite
easily.  This litter and old growth are virtually entirely consumed as
was demonstrated in a Texas study where 97% was removed by fire, leaving
ash and small amounts of charred vegetation [<a href="#42">42</a>].






<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
Accumulation of tobosa litter with its compact and somewhat woody
growth form usually insures a complete burn.  Compared with other grass
species tobosa burns hot when in pure stands, upto 1260 degrees F (682
C), with a duration over five minutes with temperatures over 150 degrees
F (66 C) [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Although tobosa normally burns hot, it has been shown
that the intensity of the fire does not influence plant response
following fire.  In Texas, it was shown that high intensity fires do no
more harm than low intensity fires, as yields following fire are the
same for different fire intensities [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Soil temperatures after
burning have been found to be 39 to 41 degrees F (4-5 C) warmer than
control plots at a soil depth of 3 inches (7.5 cm) [<a href="#42">42</a>].  During the year
after burning, it has been shown that soil bacterial growth increases
ten fold, which is apparently due to higher soil temperatures and increased
organic carbon levels [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
The response of tobosa following fire is dependent upon site
characteristics, geographic location, soil moisture, season of burn, and
precipitation in the months following burning [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Generally early
spring burns during moist years will show the greatest increase in
herbage production [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  Tobosa quickly revegetates the bare ground
after fire, dominating the community by the middle of the first growing
season.  Precipitation following burning seems to be the most important
factor.  In western Texas where mean annual precipitation is
approximately 19 inches (48 cm), tobosa yields can be expected to
increase 2 to 3 fold within the year following burning if burning is
conducted during a moist spring [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  But in contrast, in this
same area of Texas, burning during a dry spring will decrease tobosa
yields slightly during the current growing season [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  In southern
New Mexico where the mean annual precipitation is only 8.86 inches (22
cm) herbage production following burning declined no matter what time of
year burning took place [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Yields of tobosa on concave sites following burning is greater than on
convex sites.  In Texas concave sites yielded 1462 pounds per acre (1646
kg/ha) while convex sites yielded 893 pounds per acre (1005 kg/ha).
This is probably due to the fact that lowland sites generally have
denser stands of tobosa due to accumulation of surface runoff.  But the
average increase in yield was 103.7% on concave sites and 232% on convex
sites.  On these drier convex sites, fire increased tobosa
frequency, entending plant distribution from the convex sites into the
more mesic midslope and concave sites [<a href="#35">35</a>].

Culms produced following fire will stand erect for several years before
they die, break off, and contribute to the litter layer.  At this time
litter consists mostly of dead leaf blades, but by the end of the fourth
or fifth growing season following fire there are large amounts of
standing dead material and litter from stems that have died and fallen
[<a href="#43">43</a>].  If precipitation is average or above average, then yields should
dramatically increase (2 to 3 times that of unburned sites) in the
current growing season following early spring burning, and then
successively decrease until equilibrium with unburned areas is reached
about 5 years later [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  Studying the nitrogen levels of tobosa in
west Texas, postfire nitrogen levels reached prefire levels in five
years on concave sites, but convex sites were slower to recover, and
eight years is the estimate to reach prefire nitrogen levels on these
upland sites [<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Burning is a very effective tool for stimulating forage production in
stagnant tobosa stands.  Tobosa range is considered one of the simplest
to burn because of the nonvolatile nature of tobosa and mesquite.
Burning should take place in the spring while plants are still dormant
and the soil is wet [<a href="#54">54</a>].  At this time it can be determined whether
ranchers need to use tobosa as a reserve feed for cattle as they
sometimes do [<a href="#53">53</a>].

Guidelines for burning tobosa range in Texas are as follows [<a href="#5">5</a>].

A dozed line cut out of mineral soil should surround the area to be burned.
A second dozed line is cut 100 feet inside the perimeter line on the
north and east sides.  This 100 foot strip should be burned when the
following weather conditions prevail:

   1. 40 to 60 % relative humidity
   2. 40 to 60 degrees F (4.4 to 15.5 degrees C) air temperature
   3. wind speed less than 10 miles per hour (16 kilometers/hour)

This creates a fireline that will contain the head fire to be ignited at
a later date.  Firelines should be burned between late January and early
March.  

The main area should be burned in early spring (March) before green up
of tobosa.  Weather conditions for head fires should be as follows:

   1. 25 to 40 % relative humidity
   2. 70 to 80 degrees F (21 to 26.7 degrees C) air temperature
   3. wind speed 8 to 15 miles per hour (12.8 to 24 kilometers/hour)

Tobosa is a important forage species for Southwest ranchers.  Burning
tobosa stands is also able to reduce some undesirable plants that are
often found there.  Prickly pear (Opuntia engelmannii) and cholla (O.
imbricata) are moderately harmed the first year after burning, and
continue to die in years following the burn (82 % mortality at the end
of the second growing season) [<a href="#53">53</a>].  Annual broomweed (Gutierrizia
dracunculoides) is a major winter annual in tobosa stands and is
esssentially eliminated for the first two years after spring burning
[<a href="#52">52</a>].  But by the second or third year after burning, broomweed
infestations are similar to preburn levels.  Mesquite (Prosopis
glandulosa) which is commonly associated with tobosa stands, is only
moderately harmed by fire alone; plants less than 3.5 years of age are
easily killed by fire, but plants over 3.5 years old are virtually
impossible to kill with fire alone [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Broomweeds and firewhirls are the two primary dangers to be concerned
with when burning tobosa stands [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  Broomweeds burn off at the
base and tumble across pastures having the potential to ignite nontarget
areas. Firewhirls generally develop where windshears occur such as a
head fire running into a backfire.  With wind speeds of more than eight
miles an hour fire whirls are unlikely to occur unless there is a
windshear.

Prescribed burning can be used on tobosa stands on a five to eight year
frequency.  Bottomland sites should not be burned more frequently than
every five years while upland sites may be burned every eight years
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  For grazing purposes burn areas on a rotational basis.  One
fifth to one eighth of each tobosa pasture can be burned each year [<a href="#55">55</a>].

<b>CASE NAME : </b>
Post-Montgomery Estate, Lynn County Texas


<b>REFERENCE : </b>
Heirman, A. A.; Wright, H. A. 1973 [<a href="#23">23</a>]


<b>SEASON/SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION : </b>
Spring burn


<b>STUDY LOCATION : </b>
Lynn County Texas


<b>PREFIRE VEGETATIVE COMMUNITY : </b>
The vegetation is dominated by nearly pure stands of tobosa and
buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides).  Mesquite (Prosopid glandulosa),
cholla (Opuntia imbricata) and Pricklypear (O. phaeacantha) are the
dominant brush species.  


<b>TARGET SPECIES PHENOLOGICAL STATE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>SITE DESCRIPTION : </b>
Data on the site are given below:
Elevation: between 3,000 and 3,300 feet (914-1006 m)
Relief: level to gently undulating
Mean annual precipitation: 19 inches (48 cm)
Siol: Deep hardland soils of Amarillo loam with slow surface drainage
      and medium internal drainage.


<b>FIRE DESCRIPTION : </b>
This fire was started at 3:30 p.m. on March 23, 1970, and was completed
by 4:30 p.m.  A total of 300 acres were burned.  The fire was considered
to be spotty and incomplete due to insufficient fuels in some areas,
especially where buffalograss had been overgrazed.

Conditions reported:

             Air temperature = 75 degrees F (24 C)
             Relative humidity = 25%
             Wind speed = 12 to 20 mph from the southwest
             Fuel moisture of grass = 15%
             Surface soil moisture = 20%
             Maximum soil surface temperature = 460 degreed F (238 C) 
                                                in tobosa stands


<b>FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES : </b>
Tobosa yields increased three fold, but there was no effect on
buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides).  Tobosa's unpalatable old growth was
removed by burning.  New growth following fire was tender and succulent
and cattle prefered it to the buffalograss.  Total tobosa grazed on the
burned area was 2,388 pounds per acre while only 371 pounds per acre
were utilized on the control.  Burning also decreased annual weeds.  By
the second year after burning 50% of pricklypear plants (Opuntia
phaeacantha) died.  Most mesquite trees (Prosopis glandulosa) were top
killed but resprouted after fire.


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS : </b>
