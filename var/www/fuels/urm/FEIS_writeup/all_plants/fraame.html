<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Fraxinus americana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
The wood of white ash is economically important due to its strength,
hardness, weight, and shock resistance [<a href="#17">17</a>].  It is second only to
hickory (Carya spp.) for use in the production of tool handles.  Nearly
all wooden baseball bats are made from white ash [<a href="#11">11</a>].  The wood is also
used in furniture, antique vehicle parts, railroad cars and ties, canoe
paddles, snowshoes [<a href="#23">23</a>], boats, doors, and cabinets [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
White ash is an important source of browse and cover for livestock and
wildlife.  The samaras are good forage for the wood duck, northern
bobwhite, purple finch, pine grosbeak, fox squirrel, and mice, and many
other birds and small mammals [<a href="#27">27</a>].  White ash is browsed mostly in the
summer by white-tailed deer and cattle [<a href="#22">22</a>].  The bark of young trees is
occasionally used as food by beaver, porcupine, and rabbits [<a href="#27">27</a>].

White ash's ability to readily form trunk cavities if the top is broken
and its large d.b.h. (24 to 48 inches [61-122 cm]) at maturity make it
highly valuable for primary cavity nesters such as red-headed,
red-bellied, and pileated woodpeckers.  Once the primary nest excavators
have opened up the bole of the tree, it is excellent habitat for
secondary nesters such as wood ducks, owls, nuthatches, and gray
squirrels [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability of white ash browse for deer and cattle varies from
poor in the fall and winter to fair in the summer [<a href="#22">22</a>].  The samaras are
good forage in the fall [<a href="#27">27</a>].

The relish and the degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife species
for white ash in several eastern states has been rated as follows
[<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>]:

                        ME        PA        WV        MI        KY

Waterfowl               good      good      good      good      good


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
White ash browse has a low protein content and low phosphorus:calcium
ratio, giving it a poor nutritional rating in the winter; however, in
the spring and summer the protein content increases to 7.7 percent,
increasing its rating to fair [<a href="#19">19</a>].

The nutrient values for white ash browse collected on January 16 were as
follows (data presented is in percent composition) [<a href="#19">19</a>].

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
White ash provides hiding and thermal cover for a variety of mammals and
birds.  The degree to which white ash provides environmental protection
during one or more seasons for wildlife species in several eastern
states has been rated as follows [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>]:

                         ME        PA        WV        MI        KY

Waterfowl               good      good      good      good      good


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
White ash has been used in Ohio, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania in the
reclamation of surface coal mines, with 45 percent survival after 30
years.  White ash should be planted in mixtures with other hardwoods;
interplanting with European alder (Alnus glutimosa) nearly doubled the
height and d.b.h. of white ash on a site in eastern Kentucky.  White ash
seedlings are recomended for planting; direct seeding in Ohio produced
poor results.  On acid spoils the lower pH limit for white ash is 4.0
[<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The juice from the leaves of white ash can be applied topically to
mosquito bites for relief of swelling and itching [<a href="#17">17</a>].  White ash has a
specialized use as a prophylactic measure for snake bite.  If one
carries the crushed leaves in his/her pockets the odor has been "proved"
offensive to rattlesnakes [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Open-grown white ash is useful as a shade and ornamental tree [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
White ash is susceptible to a variety of natural and man-made pathogens.
Ash decline (also called ash dieback or ash yellows) has increased over
the last 40 years and is especially prevalent in New York, Pennsylvania,
and Vermont.  Mortality rates are as high as 90 percent in some areas of
New York.  Nearly all of the ash decline from 1980 to 1986 occurred in
areas with high levels of atmospheric deposition of sulfur (S0x) and
nitrous (NOx) oxides.  Although there is no concrete evidence that acid
deposition is the causal agent, it can not be dismissed [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Ash
decline probably results from multiple factors--the disease, ash
yellows, caused by a mycoplasmalike organism; canker fungi (Fusicoccum
spp.); viruses; acid deposition; and drought [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Maintaining good
tree vigor is the primary control recommendation.  Preventative measures
that seem to abate ash decline include [<a href="#16">16</a>]:  watering, fertilizing,
applying fungicide, covering wounds with a fungicide-augmented dressing,
and avoiding planting white ash in areas of high acid deposition.

White ash has been found to be sensitive to ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide
(SO2), and acid deposition.  Chappelka and others [<a href="#3">3</a>] found that total
biomass was reduced 14 percent after exposure to these atmospheric
contaminants.  Visible evidence is characterized by initial purple-white
stippling on the adaxial leaf surface which turns into necrotic lesions.
This occurred on 66 percent of the plants.

White ash varies in cold hardiness with the latitude of origin.  Trees
grown in the North have a lower lethal temperatures than those from the
South.  When revegetating an area, seed and seedlings must be procurred
from a source that is climatically and geographically simalar [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].

Clark and Schroeder [<a href="#4">4</a>] have developed equations to calculate the green
volume, green weight, and dry weight of white ash.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Fraxinus americana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
White ash is a native, deciduous, long-lived tree [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Leaves are
compound, 8 to 15 inches (20-38 cm) in length, and usually have seven
oval, entire leaflets [<a href="#17">17</a>].  White ash is dioecious.  The male flowers
bloom first, before the leaf buds break.  The pollen is already airborne
during the 7 to 10 days when the female flowers are receptive [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].
The flowers are borne in panicles near branch tips.  White ash will
start to flower when it is 3 to 4 inches (8-10 cm) in d.b.h., but
abundant flowering does not occur until the tree is 8 to 10 inches
(20-25 cm) [<a href="#10">10</a>].

White ash obtains heights of 60 to 70 feet (18-21 m).  The bole is long,
straight and free of branches for most of its length, and the crown is
narrow and pyramidal when grown in a mixed stand.  Open-grown specimens
have a short bole with a rounded crown [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (megophanerophyte)
   Undisturbed State:  Chamaephyte
   Burned or Clipped State:  Chamaephyte
   Burned or Clipped State:  Cryptophyte (geophyte)


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  White ash samaras remain viable on the forest floor for 3 to 4
years [<a href="#5">5</a>].  The samaras require cold stratification; in the laboratory
stratification at 41 to 14 degrees F (5 to -10 degrees C) for 2 to 3
months resulted in a mean germination of 54 percent.  Germination is
epigeal and can occur on mineral soil, humus, or leaf litter, but the
substrate must be moist [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Vegetative:  White ash resprouts from the root crown after logging or
fire.  Sprouting ability decreases with age [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Silviculture:  Young stands (5 to 10 years) respond to the addition of
nitrogen and thinning by increasing the number of stems per acre and
increasing in height growth by 1 to 2 feet (0.3-0.6 m) [<a href="#15">15</a>], whereas
older stands (35 to 85 years) do not exhibit increased growth from
fertilization or release [<a href="#8">8</a>].

White ash responds well to shelterwood cutting.  Advanced regeneration
grows best with 60 percent of the overstory removed [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
White ash grows best on deep, well-drained, moist soils with other
hardwoods [<a href="#17">17</a>].  In the Northeast white ash occurs on middle mesophytic
slopes, and it is reduced or lacking on dry, cold ridges and
mountaintops.  White ash occurs on slightly elevated ridges in the
floodplains of major streams in the Coastal Plain and on slopes along
major streams in the Central States [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Soil:  White ash has a strong affinity for soils high in nitrogen and
calcium [<a href="#27">27</a>]. 

Climate:  Climate varies widely within white ash's range.  The
frost-free period ranges from 90 to 270 days.  Annual precipitation
ranges from 30 to 60 inches (76-152 cm) per year.  Snow depths vary from
0 to more than 100 inches (254 cm) [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Elevation:  White ash grows from near sea level on the Coastal Plain to
3,450 feet (1,050 m) in the Cumberland Mountains [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Associates:  White ash's primary associates are eastern white pine
(Pinus strobus), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), white oak (Q. alba),
sugar maple (Acer saccharum), red maple (A. rubrum), yellow birch
(Betula alleghaniensis), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), black
cherry (Prunus serotina), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), and yellow
poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Understory associates are downy serviceberry (Amelanchier arborea),
pawpaw (Asimina triloba), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana),
flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), and eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya
virginiana) [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
White ash is a pioneer species.  It is characteristic of early and
intermediate stages of succession.  Although mature white ash is
classified as shade intolerant, the seedlings are shade tolerant.  A
seedling can survive at less than 3 percent of full sunlight for a few
years.  This attribute allows the species to regenerate in gaps [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
White ash flower buds break dormancy from April to May, with the
vegetative buds breaking immediately after the flowers [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  The
fruit ripens from August to October [<a href="#24">24</a>], and seeds are dispersed from
August to November [<a href="#2">2</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Fraxinus americana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire kills the aboveground stem and crown of white ash [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
Fire wounds can increase a tree's susceptibility to insects and decay by
weakening the plant and providing entry points.  Compared with other
hardwoods, white ash is moderatley susceptible to fire-damage-induced
decay [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
McGee [<a href="#21">21</a>] found that after fires of varying intensity in a stand of
5-year-old saplings the number of white ash stems per acre increased as
follows:

                    Area 1         Area 2         Area 3         Area 4
