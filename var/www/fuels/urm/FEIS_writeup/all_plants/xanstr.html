<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The genus Xanthium exhibits considerable variation in fruit morphology,
and in the past more than 20 species have been recognized within this
genus [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Love and Dansereau's [<a href="#18">18</a>] revision of the Xanthium genus
reduced the number of Xanthium species to two:  common cocklebur (X.
strumarium L.) and spiny cocklebur (X. spinosum L.).  This
classification is widely accepted today.

Currently recognized common cocklebur varieties include [<a href="#12">12</a>]:

<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Common cocklebur has a nearly worldwide distribution between latitude 53
degrees N. and 33 degrees S.  In North America it is widespread across
southern Canada, most of the contiguous United States, and Mexico.
Areas devoid of this plant in the United States include northeastern New
York and Maine.  It is rare in mountainous terrain [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Common cocklebur occasionally forms a dominant ground cover in open
riparian woodlands, intermittent streambeds, and beach habitats
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  A common cocklebur habitat type was described in the
following publication:

Range ecology and relations of mule deer, elk, and cattle in the
  Missouri River Breaks, Montana [<a href="#20">20</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Xanthium strumarium
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Common cocklebur is considered a nuisance by livestock producers.  The
plant grows in barnyards, pastures, and around farm ponds where it is
commonly encountered by livestock.  The spine-covered burs become
entangled in the hides of farm animals.  Wool value is decreased if
entangled with common cocklebur [<a href="#32">32</a>].

Common cocklebur seeds and cotyledon leaves are poisonous to all classes
of livestock.  Beyond the cotyledon stage, plants are not poisonous.
Consumption of seeds is fatal at about 0.3 percent of an animal's body
weight; however, the seeds are rarely eaten.  Poisoning usually occurs
from consumption of seedlings.  It takes several hundred coytledons
(about 1 to 2 percent of body weight) to poison pigs [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].

Mourning doves eat common cocklebur seeds to a limited extent [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Common cocklebur is unpalatable to all classes of livestock.  Adult
plants, however, are relatively nutritious [see Nutritional Value].  Its
unpalatability is apparently due to the rough texture of stems and
leaves [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].

In a ranking of foods eaten by Rocky Mountain elk, Kufeld [<a href="#16">16</a>] listed
common cocklebur as a "highly valuable" elk forage.  The ranking was
based on one study conducted in Montana.


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
A 3-year study which analyzed the nutritional parameters of weedy
species found that common cocklebur foliage in June and July is only
slightly less nutritious than alfalfa.  Over the 3-year period, crude
protein and in vitro digestible dry matter in July averaged 24 and 77
percent, respectively [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In the United States, common cocklebur is a major weed in cotton and
soybean fields.  Infestations in soybean fields can cause severe crop
losses, as much as 60 to 75 percent [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Common cocklebur is
effectively controlled by a number of soil- or foliar-applied systemic
herbicides commonly used in agricultural fields [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Xanthium strumarium
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Common cocklebur is a native, broadleaved, taprooted, annual forb
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Stems are erect, ridged, rough and hairy, and frequently
branched, resulting in somewhat bushy plants from 8 to 59 inches (20-150
cm) tall.  It has small, green unisexual flowers occurring in separate
clusters at the end of the branches and main stem.  The fruit is a
brown, hard, woody bur from 0.4 to 0.8 inch long and covered with stout,
hooked prickles.  Each fruit contains two seeds [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Therophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Common cocklebur reproduces by seed only.

Pollination and fruit production:  Pollen transfer is by wind.  The
plant is self-compatible and predominantly self-pollinated.  Common
cocklebur may also set seed without fertilization of the ovule.  Because
of self-compatibility and apomixis, local populations are often
genetically very similar.  A single, open-grown plant typically produces
400 to 500 fruits [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].

Fruit dispersal:  The fruits cling to the hide of animals and the
clothing of humans and are dispersed in that manner.  Fruits not
transported by animals fall from the plant during the fall or winter
[<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  In riparian habitats, fruits on the soil surface may later be
dispersed by water as they float for up to 30 days [<a href="#32">32</a>].  The fruit does
not dehisce, and thus seeds germinate within the fruit.

Seed viability, dormancy, and germination:  Seed viability is usually
high, at least 80 percent [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Each bur contains two seeds, one larger
than the other.  The large seed is nondormant and typically germinates
the first spring following production, while the smaller seed germinates
later in the season or, more frequently, the following year [<a href="#32">32</a>].
Occasionally, the two seeds germinate simultaneously.

Depth of burial also influences germination.  Seeds lying on the soil
surface and those buried more than 6 inches (15 cm) below the soil
surface rarely germinate.  In Illinois, seed buried in November at
various depths in silty loam soil began to emerge after April 1 and
continued emerging until May 19.  Maximum seedling emergence was from
seed buried at 1 or 2 inches (2.5 and 5.1 cm) [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Another study found
that 11 to 16 percent of common cocklebur seeds germinated after 30
months of burial at depths ranging from 3 to 9 inches (8-38 cm) [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Common cocklebur occurs primarily in disturbed, open habitats.  It grows
in cultivated fields, vacant lots, sandpits, and dry washes; on beaches
and sand dunes; and along the shores of ponds and rivers, especially
riverbeds left barren by receding floodwaters [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  In
noncultivated settings, it primarily occupies beaches and dunes in
eastern North America and floodplains in the West.  In ruderal habitats,
such as agricultural fields, common cocklebur often occurs in dense
stands, but in natural habitats, such as along shorelines, it often
occurs as scattered individuals [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].

Common cocklebur is tolerant of a variety of soil conditions ranging
from moist clay to dry sand but grows best on compact sandy soil that is
slightly moist below the soil surface and contains a small amount of
organic matter [<a href="#32">32</a>].  It is tolerant of flooding at all growth stages
[<a href="#32">32</a>].

Herbaceous associates in various habitats are as follows [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>]:

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

Common cocklebur is a weed of ruderal (sandpits, old fields, cultivated
fields, etc.) and naturally disturbed habitats (beaches, dunes, and
floodplains) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  As a pioneer, it persists only as long as the
ground ramains mostly bare and the site remains unshaded.  It rarely
grows in sod, and plants will not flower or fruit in full shade [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Seed germination:  

  Illinois - April through mid-May, with lesser numbers through June.  
             Small germination flushes occur throughout the summer with
             adequate moisture [<a href="#32">32</a>].  

  southern Ontario - late May [<a href="#32">32</a>].

Flowering:  Flowering is controlled by photoperiod.  The plant will not
flower at all or only poorly when day length exceeds 14 hours.  Thus in
the northern portion of its range, flowering does not occur until late
summer [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Flowering time by state is as follows:

  Carolinas - July to frost [<a href="#23">23</a>]
  Colorado - July to October [<a href="#5">5</a>]  
  Kansas - July to November [<a href="#1">1</a>]
  Montana - August to September [<a href="#5">5</a>]
  North Dakota - July to September [<a href="#5">5</a>]
  Wyoming - July to September [<a href="#34">34</a>]
  Utah - July to September [<a href="#34">34</a>]

Seed dispersal:  Seeds ripen in the fall.  Fruits not removed by animals
fall off the plant in the winter or occasionally remain on the plant
until the next spring [<a href="#18">18</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Xanthium strumarium
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Most postfire environments are favorable for the establishment of common
cocklebur, which requires bare ground and full sunlight for germination.
Postfire establishment would depend, however, on local seed sources.
These would include animal- or water-transported off-site seeds and/or
on-site soil-stored seeds.

Common cocklebur is an annual that survives fire only if the seeds
survive.  This seems likely because the seeds are encased by a hard,
woody bur and are thus somewhat insulated from the heat of fire [<a href="#12">12</a>].
Seeds which become even shallowly buried by soil are further insulated
by heat during fire.  Seedbanking, at least to a limited extent, is
probable, since some seeds have innate dormancy for 1 or more years
[<a href="#18">18</a>].

No fire studies have been conducted on common cocklebur.  Discussions by
Duabenmire [<a href="#4">4</a>] and Vogl [<a href="#29">29</a>], however, suggest that seeds of most
annuals will survive grassland fires if they on the ground at the time
of burning.  This is because the fire front passes quickly, which
prevents high soil surface temperatures lethal to seeds.

In beach and dune habitats, common cocklebur typically occurs in
sparsely populated communities with much bare ground between individuals
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Here fire spread seems unlikely.
