<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Partridgeberry is part of the climax undergrowth vegetation in several
forest communities in the eastern United States.  It is not an indicator
or dominant species in any habitat types [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
The fruit of partridgeberry is eaten by ruffed grouse, northern
bobwhite, sharp-tailed grouse, and prairie chicken.  The fruit is also
frequently eaten by racoons and red fox [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Keegan [<a href="#13">13</a>] reported
that partridgeberry made up 2.9 to 3.4 percent (dry weight) of the
summer and fall diets of white-tailed deer.

Partridgeberry has been planted as an ornamental in several parts of its

commercially [<a href="#15">15</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Mitchella repens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Partridgeberry is a creeping, rhizomatous, evergreen, woody vine up to
1.5 feet (50 cm) tall.  It roots at the nodes and often forms loose
mats.  The flowers are borne in axillary, single stalks at the tip of
the branchlets.  The fruit is a drupe containing eight seeds
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Although partridgeberry is a seed producer, information regarding its
propagation by seed is scant. The primary mode of reproduction is
vegetative [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Partridgeberry grows on a variety of sites but generally prefers mildly
acidic, well-drained mesic soils [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>] It grows on leached banks,
shaded sandstone ledges, and mossy hammocks and bogs [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].

In addition to those identified under Distribution and Occurrence,
common associates of partridgeberry include red mulberry (Morus rubra),
strawberry-bush (Euonymus americanus), Carolina silverberry (Halesia
carolina), southern black-haw (Viburnum prunifolium), devil's
walkingstick (Aralia spinosa), Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus
quinquefolia), Canada mayflower (Maianthemum canadense), yaupon (Ilex
vomitoria), huckleberry (Gaylussacia spp.), blueberry (Vaccinium spp.),
hickory (Carya spp.), grape (Vitis spp.), wintergreen (Gaultheria
procumbens), and fetterbush (Lyonia ferruginea) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  A complete
list of trees associated with partridgeberry would include a majority of
trees growing in the eastern United States.


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Partridgeberry is a shade tolerant, mid- to late-seral species.  It is a
component of climax forests in the eastern United States [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Partridgeberry flowers between April and June, and often again in
autumn.  The fruit ripens between July and October, and often persists
throughout the year [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Mitchella repens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Partridgeberry is not well adapted to fire.  The rhizomes are usually in
the litter layer and not well protected from fire [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  However,
protected and underground rhizomes probably sprout following fire.
Partridgeberry probably colonizes burned area by animal-dispersed seed
or by trailing vines, but these regeneration strategies have not been
documented in the literature.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous low woody plant, rhizome in organic mantle

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Mitchella repens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Most fires probably top-kill partridgeberry, and severe fires may kill
the plant.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Partridgeberry's response to fire is not well documented.  Reports in
the literature suggest that it is a fire decreaser, although postfire
density, frequency, or growth rates for partridgeberry were not given
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].
