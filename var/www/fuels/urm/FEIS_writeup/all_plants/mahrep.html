<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Oregon-grape frequency becomes greater in moist habitats.  The
Oregon-grape phase of the Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
menziesii)/Oregon-grape habitat types in Idaho is restricted to leeward
aspects where site protection and deep soils permit development of a
closed tree canopy.  Taller shrubs are eventually suppressed, leaving
Oregon-grape dominant [<a href="#61">61</a>].  Oregon-grape occurs is dominant or
subdominant in the following habitat type, plant association, and
community type classifications:

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Mahonia repens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Oregon-grape fruits are eaten by a number of bird and mammal species,
including black bears [<a href="#72">72</a>].  Season of use determines the amount of
foliage browsed by mule deer, white-tailed deer, and elk.  Moose and
bighorn sheep make little use of the plants regardless of the season
[<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>], but it provides a winter food source for mule and
white-tailed deer in the Black Hills of South Dakota [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Mule deer
use is high in the fall and winter in Montana and Nevada [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>], and
low in the summer in Utah [<a href="#57">57</a>].  In Idaho it provides an important
spring browse for white-tailed deer and elk [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].

Oregon-grape may be poisonous to livestock; they make virtually no use
of the plants [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Oregon-grape browse has only fair food value.  Protein contents range
from 4.7 to 5.5 percent.  It provides a high source of carotene in July
[<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Oregon-grape is currently used for landscaping and xeriscaping because
it provides evergreen ground cover that is both heat and drought
tolerant [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].  Though sometimes browsed by deer, it generally
recovers during the growing season [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Game rangelands, old mines,
roadsides, and recreation areas are suggested sites for planting this
species.  Oregon-grape should comprise 10 to 25 percent of a seed
mixture for these uses.  Successful stand establishment requires
reduction of competing vegetation before and during establishment [<a href="#73">73</a>].

Plants are propagated by seeds, suckers, cuttings, and layering [<a href="#72">72</a>].
Seeding or transplanting in rows, strips, or blocks may improve stand
establishment and survival.  A seeding rate of 10 to 20 pure live seeds
per square foot is recommended for full stands.  Seeds can be sown in
the fall without treatment, but they require stratification prior to
planting in the spring [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>].  Transplanting rootstocks is possible
but difficult in less humid, interior climates [<a href="#73">73</a>].



<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Dye:  Navajo Indians produced a yellow dye from the roots and a lavender
dye from the fruit [<a href="#46">46</a>].

Medicinal:  Great Basin tribes used tea obtained by boiling the roots
for thickening blood and curing dysentery.  The tea was considered
efficacious for curing coughs, kidney problems, and venereal diseases
[<a href="#46">46</a>].

Food:  Preserves, drinks, and pies are made from the berries [<a href="#46">46</a>].



<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Oregon-grape shows little change after silvicultural treatments such as
clearcutting and mechanical scarification [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Oregon-grape has low short-term resistance to trampling by people but
recovers steadily if trampling is eliminated for long periods.  Overall,
it is considered moderately resistant to trampling since it does recover
[<a href="#15">15</a>].

Oregon-grape is an alternate host for black stem rust, a serious
pathogen of cereal crops, and should not be planted where cereal crops
are grown [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Mahonia repens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Oregon-grape is a native, evergreen, perennial shrub with a low or
prostrate growth form [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Stem heights of 4 to 12 inches (10 to 30
cm) are common [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].  Each stem arises from a rhizome [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].
Roots have been observed extending to 6 feet (1.8 m) without being
concentrated at any depth, suggesting a long taproot that would make it
adaptable to a wide variety of sites [<a href="#47">47</a>].  The leaves are pinnately
compound and spine-tipped, and the berries are born in grapelike
clusters [<a href="#72">72</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Oregon-grape flowers are cross-pollinated by bees, but those
not receiving pollen from another source are selfed.  Selfing frequently
does not result in fruit production [<a href="#46">46</a>], but good fruit crops are borne
almost annually from cross-pollinated plants.  Wildlife consume the
berries and may aid in seed dispersal.  Seed can remain viable for up to
5 years in sealed containers stored in unheated sheds [<a href="#49">49</a>].

Vegetative:  Vegetative growth is initiated from horizontally growing
rhizomes, found 0.5 to 2 inches (1.2-5 cm) below the mineral soil
[<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Oregon-grape grows on thinly wooded slopes or shaded hillsides in rocky,
slightly moist soil, or occasionally on open hillsides [<a href="#63">63</a>].  It is
among the most resistant plants to leaf burn from exposure to the winter
sun [<a href="#73">73</a>].

Soils:  Oregon-grape is found on sandy loams to silts, sedimentary
shales and sandstones, and granitic soils in coniferous forests
[<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].  In western Montana it is found on limestone soils and is
absent or nearly so on granitic and quartzite soils [<a href="#24">24</a>].  In the Black
Hills it is confined to calcareous soils developed from limestone parent
material [<a href="#66">66</a>]. 

Elevation:  Oregon-grape has a wide elevation range, from near sea level
on the Pacific Coast to 10,000 feet (3,048 m)in the Rocky Mountains
[<a href="#72">72</a>].  It is found in high-elevation coniferous forests throughout the
Great Basin [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Elevations in Utah range from 4,000 to 9,800 feet
(1,125-2,980 m) [<a href="#74">74</a>].

Major overstory associates include ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa),
Douglas-fir, grand fir (Abies grandis), quaking aspen (Populus
tremuloides), and western larch (Larix occidentalis).  Major understory
associates include snowberry (Symphoricarpos alba), Rocky Mountain maple
(Acer glabrum), twinflower (Linnaea borealis), blue huckleberry
(Vaccinium globulare), dwarf huckleberry (V. scoparium), and ninebark
(Physocarpus malvaceus) [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Oregon-grape is a climax dominant which is shade-tolerant, but also does
well in full sunlight [<a href="#51">51</a>].  In the cedar-hemlock (Thuja spp./Tsuga
spp.) zone, it initially responds to open canopies produced by logging,
but begins to decrease within 25 years [<a href="#75">75</a>].  Oregon-grape is the
dominant shrub in closed canopy stands of Douglas-fir [<a href="#61">61</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
In the northern Rocky Mountains Oregon-grape first develops new leaves
from the end of April until late May.  Flowering starts in early May and
may extend to early August.  Fruit ripens from late June until
mid-September [<a href="#55">55</a>].  In South Dakota and Nebraska, flowering occurs in
early June, and fruit is ripe by late August [<a href="#63">63</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Mahonia repens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Oregon-grape is adapted to fire and survives by sprouting from dormant
buds on the rhizomes [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Seedling establishment occurs from on-site
seed [<a href="#48">48</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Small shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Mahonia repens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Oregon-grape usually survives all but severe fires that remove duff and
cause extended heating of the upper soil [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  One study reported
that a severe fire favored Oregon-grape [<a href="#11">11</a>], but fire conditions were
not specified.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Oregon-grape was absent after severe fires in northern Idaho but
unharmed by moderate fires [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Density and height increases have been
noted in the second postfire growing season [<a href="#48">48</a>].



<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Five years following a moderate- to high-intensity fire, Oregon-grape
reached 60 percent of prefire biomass in a mixed aspen/conifer stand, 65
percent in an upper elevation aspen stand, and 85 percent in a lower
elevation aspen stand [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Four different fires were studied to determine successional responses of
Oregon-grape following fire.  At postfire year 1 cover had decreased,
remained the same at postfire year 2, decreased in postfire year 9, and
was much higher at postfire year 18.  Fire severity may be related to
the survival of Oregon-grape.  Generally, an increase in cover should
occur by 9 postfire years [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Oregon-grape cover increased during postfire years 1 and 2 following an
April fire in western Montana.  It invaded an burn resulting from an
October fire during the second postfire year [<a href="#48">48</a>].


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Oregon-grape may be supressed in areas seeded to grass following
wildfires.  This should be considered before planting grasses in areas
where Oregon-grape is an important food for wildlife [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Prescribed
fire has a low probability of success in the aspen/low forb community
type, of which Oregon-grape is a main component, because of the sparse
vegetation [<a href="#13">13</a>].
