<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Knobcone pine is the most widely distributed of the West Coast
closed-cone species.  Discontinuous populations occur from southwestern
Oregon south through the Klamath, Cascade, and Coast ranges and the
Sierra Nevada.  Stands in the South Coast Ranges are widely disjunct,
occurring in the Santa Ana and west San Bernadino mountains, at Cuesta
Pass, San Luis Obisbo County, and near Encinada, Baja California
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
The knobcone pine community occupies a transitional position between
chaparral and woodland and higher elevation forests.  Because of its
patchy distribution, it is usually surrounded by other communities.  At
lower elevations, it is most often associated with chamise (Adenostoma
fasciculatum)-manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.) communities and various
oak (Quercus spp.) woodlands.  At higher elevations, it is associated
with a variety of coniferous communities (see SAF Cover Types) [<a href="#44">44</a>].
Within the knobcone pine community, the pines are usually widely spaced.
The community is sometimes described as woodland rather than as forest
[<a href="#24">24</a>].  On favorable sites, knobcone pine forms dense, even-aged stands
or dwarfed thickets.  Understory herbaceous species are usually
fire-followers and endemics.  Shrubs occur individually or in small
patches between pines.  Mosaics of chaparral, woodland, knobcone pine,
and other coniferous forests sometimes occur due to topographical and
substrate differences [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
There is no commercial market for knobcone pine wood [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Knobcone pine is unpalatable browse [<a href="#13">13</a>].  The heavily spiked, closed
cones deter most seed predators, although the western grey squirrel
consumes some seed.  Jays eat seeds of opened cones [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Knobcone pine is planted for riparian and watershed rehabilitation in
areas with shallow, ultramafic, or sandy dry soils [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  Survival and
growth rates are favorable.  Plantation seedlings used for erosion
control in southern California attained heights of about 15 feet (4.6 m)
in 10 years.  Trees are usually planted on-site from bareroot nursery
seedlings, although knobcone pine can be cloned if cuttings are taken
from trees less than 5 years of age.  Seed collection and processing
techniques and details on seedling care are outlined in the literature
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Knobcone pine populations are currently stable.  The species is
apparently not subject to heavy insect or disease attack [<a href="#44">44</a>].  It may
become infected with dwarfmistletoe (Arceuthobium campylopodum), but the
literature is inconsistent on severity of infection.  Mathiasen and
Hawksworth [<a href="#23">23</a>] believe that it is immune to such infestation.  Kimmey
[<a href="#16">16</a>] reported it as "rarely infested" with western dwarf mistletoe (A.
campylopodum f.  campylopodum), while Hempel [<a href="#12">12</a>] stated that it is
"often infected" with dwarfmistletoe.  There are unconfirmed reports of
infestation in southwestern Oregon [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Feral pigs, which damage trees by tusking trunks with their canines,
commonly attack knobcone.  Trees so tusked are often girdled for
distances of 3 to 4 inches (8-14 cm) up the trunk, resulting in death of
the tree.  The motivation for this behavior in swine is unknown [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus attenuata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Knobcone pine is a rapidly growing, native tree from 20 to 40 feet (6-12
m) tall and 13.5 to 23 inches (34-58 cm) in d.b.h. [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  The crown
is dense and broad when young, becoming open when mature.  Trees
typically have multiple trunks with thin bark [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Excavtion of
knobcone pine roots in the Santa Ana Mountains showed that vertical
roots grew to bedrock in the shallow soil.  Average root depth was 10.4
inches (26.2 cm) [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Roots in less restrictive sites are reported as
"wide and deep" [<a href="#36">36</a>].

Trees produce female cones in groups of four or five, all firmly
attached to stout branches in a tight whorl.  The asymmetrical cones are
arched in configuration, as are the individual ovuliferous scales.
Cones remain closed and attached to the tree for life [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  The
enclosed seeds are small and light, with thin seed coats and long seed
wings [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  The lifespan of knobcone pine is relatively short.  Some
trees reach ages of 75 to 100 years [<a href="#14">14</a>], but in a typical 60-year-old
stand, over half the pines are dead [<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Knobcone pine reproduction is controlled exclusively by fire; trees
occur in even-aged stands dating back to the last fire [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  Unlike
other closed-cone species whose cones open with hot weather, upon
falling, or with age, unburned knobcone pine cones remain closed even
after trees have decayed and fallen.  Cones are sealed with a hard resin
that requires high temperatures (average: 397 degrees Fahrenheit [203
deg C]) to liquefy, boil, and vaporize.  Cone scales open gradually
following heating.  The first seeds fall within 1 to 12 hours after
fire, when the ground has cooled.  The arched scales continue to slowly
expand and drop seed for at least 4 postfire years.  Scales partially
contract during periods of rain or other high relative humidity, but
resume expansion when relative humidity drops [<a href="#41">41</a>].  The small, light
seeds are wind dispersed.  Knobcone pine has the greatest seed wing
length:seed size ratio of all the California closed-cone pines, allowing
for seed dispersal well beyond the edges of a fire [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Santa Ana
foehn winds, which blow during periods of low relative humidity, spread
seed for great distances.  Seed wings from charred or scorched cones
often have fire-seared tips, causing seeds to fall in a slower spin than
seeds with unburned wing tips.  Seeds with burned wings fall closer to
the parent tree.  Birds aid in disseminating some seed.  Steller and
scrub jays, attracted to partially opened cones, pound them heavily to
extract seeds.  This results in additional seed dropping to the ground.
Hairy and downy woodpeckers may also jar seed from cones as they work
over burned stems in search of insects [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Western grey squirrel are
sometimes able to chew through unopened cones and may disseminate small
amounts of seed [<a href="#42">42</a>].

Trees begin seed production between 10 and 12 years of age.  Average
production of trees over 20 years old is 176 cones per tree [<a href="#41">41</a>].
Limited tests show seed viability does not decline with age.  Seeds
enclosed in cones for 27 [<a href="#45">45</a>] and 60 [<a href="#41">41</a>] years have proved viable.
Following release, seeds require cold stratification for 60 days [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].
Germinative capacity of seeds from mechanically opened cones has varied
from 57 to 91 percent [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Hot fire probably kills some seed.
Laboratory tests show that germination rates of seed from mechanically
opened cones are greater than those of cones opened by oven heat
treatment.  Seeds may require a rise from normally low soil pH for
germination, and fire creates such a condition [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Knobcone pine
germinates earlier than other pines.  Tested against Coulter and sugar
pines, it was the first of the three species to germinate [<a href="#47">47</a>].
Seedlings require bare mineral soil for establishment.  They are drought
tolerant, with a strong tendency toward deep rooting [<a href="#47">47</a>].  Seedlings
establishing on fertile sites compete poorly with chaparral shrubs and
other tree species.  Knobcone pine seedlings, however, can tolerate
nutrient-deficient soils which restrict the growth of most competitors
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Knobcone pine does not vegetatively reproduce [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
The climate in which knobcone pine grows is mediterranean, characterized
by wet, mild winters and hot, dry summers.  Fog drip often precipitates
heavily beneath pines during summer months in coastal regions,
ameloirating the effects of hot weather [<a href="#41">41</a>].  The pines grow at
elevations between sea level and 5,500 feet (1,676 m) [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Soil parent materials are usually of volcanic origin [<a href="#43">43</a>]; serpentine is
the most common substrate [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Soils are typically shallow, rocky,
infertile, ultramafic, acid, and/or dry.  They may contain levels of
magnesium, chromium, nickel, and/or cobalt that are toxic to most plants
[<a href="#44">44</a>].  Calcium, nitrogen, and phosphorus are usually deficient [<a href="#43">43</a>].
Soil pH at a knobcone pine site in the Santa Ana Mountains was 5.0 [<a href="#43">43</a>].
Water-retaining capacity of knobcone pine soils are often favorable to
its growth.  The average saturation percentage of serpentine soils is
nearly double that of adjacent chaparral [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Slope angles range
between 0 and 38 degrees but are most commonly steep and subject to
continual erosion.  Knobcone pine communities often occur along fault
blocks where earthquake activity has produced fresh serpentine
escarpments [<a href="#41">41</a>].

showy phlox (Phlox speciosa), and brome grasses (Bromus spp.) [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

Knobcone pine is a shade-intolerant pioneer species [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Fire
creates the conditions necessary for its continued survival.  Old
knobcone pine stands, undisturbed for 60 or more years, will show signs
of invasion and competition from surrounding communities because the
resultant soil genesis and organic matter deposition have begun to
reduce or cover the restrictive barriers produced by serpentine [<a href="#41">41</a>].
In the absence of fire, knobcone pine is replaced by chaparral shrub
species at lower elevations and other conifers at higher elevations
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Seeds germinate from early February through late March, depending on
elevation [<a href="#47">47</a>].  Pollination occurs from March until May [<a href="#33">33</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus attenuata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Knobcone pine is an obligate fire type with a strict closed-cone habit.
This adaptation, along with the general absence of animal agents that
might open cones, leaves the species dependent upon stand-replacing
crown fire for reproduction.  Continued production and accumulation of
cones throughout the life of a tree assures that large quantities of
seed are released when fire opens cones.  The open, multitrunked growth
form of knobcone pine promotes fire crowning [<a href="#41">41</a>].

Fire creates seedbed conditions favorable for germination and seedling
recruitment.  It temporarily raises soil pH and increases soil nutrient
content, particularly phosphorus and nitrogen.  A longer-term benefit of
fire to the species is the retrogressive role it plays in soil genesis.
By removing litter and ground cover vegetation, fire contributes to soil
erosion.  Wind-felling of fire-killed trees results in further churning
up of nutrient-deficient soils.  Most plant species cannot compete with
knobcone pine on such poor sites.  The discontinuous nature of
serpentine prevents all the pines in an area from being killed by any
one fire [<a href="#41">41</a>].

Natural fires are probably less frequent in knobcone pine forests than
in other western closed-cone communities [<a href="#25">25</a>].  The infertile sites
where knobcone pine occurs support little undercover.  Litter layers
are usually moderate [<a href="#13">13</a>].  A 20-year-old plantation in the San Dimas
Experimental Forest, southern California, produced 10.9 tons of forest
floor per acre (24.5 t/ha) [<a href="#17">17</a>].  The average interval between fires is
undocumented.

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus attenuata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Crown fire kills knobcone pine of all size classes and vaporizes the
resin sealing their cones [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  The effect of surface fires on
mature trees is undocumented.  The thin bark, however, probably provides
little protection from all but low-severity surface fire.  Saplings are
killed by surface fire.  Fire is not a threat to young trees, however,
since the preceding stand-replacing fire has removed most of the fuel
load [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Cones are extremely fire resistant and are seldom consumed
by fire [<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Fire-opened cones remain attached to standing dead trees.  Released seed
quickly germinates with late winter or early spring rains [<a href="#47">47</a>].
Seedlings continue to establish over a period of several years as cones
slowly open and release seeds.  Aerial photographs taken at postfire
year 16 of a burn on Cerro Miracielo, Baja California, showed that
saplings had established throughout the burn [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fire is essential for the completion of knobcone pine's life cycle.
Cones of senescent or dead trees must be opened by fire to perpetuate
the groves before trees succumb and add the unopened cones to the
decomposing litter [<a href="#40">40</a>].
