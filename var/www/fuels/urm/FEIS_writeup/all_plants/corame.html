<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
American hazel is a dominant or codominant shrub in maple-basswood
(Acer-Tilia) forests of Wisconsin and Minnesota [<a href="#12">12</a>].  In Nebraska,
American hazel is a dominant shrub in the ecotone of forest and praire
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  It is a dominant understory species in jack pine (Pinus
banksiana), paper birch (Betula papyrifera), trembling aspen (Populus
tremuloides), and nothern pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis) communities of
northern Wisconsin [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Corylus americana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
The leaves, twigs, and catkins of American hazel are browsed by deer and
moose [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  The nuts are eaten by small mammals, northern bobwhite,
ruffed grouse and other large birds, and deer [19.20].  Beaver eat the bark
[<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
American hazel has a fairly high protein and energy value.  Percentage
composition (dry weight) of the nuts is as follows [<a href="#32">32</a>]:

     crude protein       25.81
     crude fiber          2.10
     available protein   23.25 
     calcium              0.28
     phosphorus           0.39


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
American hazel has been cultivated as an ornamental since 1798.  It is
also commercially cultivated for nut production.  The sweet nuts may be
eaten raw or ground and made into a cakelike bread [<a href="#31">31</a>].  The nuts were
used by Native Americans to flavor soups [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
American hazel often competes with hardwoods and pines for light and
moisture [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Because of shading and agressive growth, it has long
been recognized as a major deterent to the successful regeneration of
upland conifers [<a href="#6">6</a>]. American and beaked hazel (C. cornuta) are
responsible for much of the failure of red pine (Pinus resinosa)
regeneration in Minnesota [<a href="#13">13</a>].

American hazel can be controlled with herbicides [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Corylus americana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
American hazel is a large, deciduous, rhizomatous shrub from 3 to 10
feet (1-3 m) tall [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  It has a straight trunk with spreading,
ascending branches, and can form dense thickets. The leaves are 3 to 5
inches (8-12 cm) long.  The male catkins are 8 inches (20 cm) long,
straight, slender, and regularly spaced along the upper stem.  The
female flowers are tiny, almost completely enclosed by bracts, and near
the end of the twigs.  The acornlike nuts are enclosed in two leafy
bracts [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  The roots are typically in the upper 6 inches (15 cm)
of soil [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Some of the smaller roots run vertically toward the
surface and branch profusely into very fine laterals [<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
American hazel reproduces both sexually and asexually.  It begins
producing seed after the first year, and produces good seed crops
every 2 to 3 years.  Seed dispersal is chiefly by mammals or birds [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Vegetative Reproduction:  The most important mode of reproduction of
American hazel is from rhizomes [<a href="#6">6</a>].  The large, woody rhizomes are 4 to
6 inches (10-15 cm) below the surface.  Rhizomes give rise to new shoots
1 to 2 feet (30-60 cm) from the parent plant [<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
American hazel occurs along streams, hedgerows, meadows, woodlands,
roadsides, and forest margins.  It grows best on rich, moist,
well-drained soils [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>]

Common understory associates of American hazel include shagbark hickory
(Carya ovata), raspberry (Rubus spp.), smooth sumac (Rhus glabra),
chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), arrowwood (Viburnum rafinesquianum),
eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), and dogwood (Cornus spp.)
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>]. 


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Faculative Seral Species

American hazel is shade tolerant [<a href="#33">33</a>].  It can grow under a light
intensity of 15 percent or less; even as low as 1 percent [<a href="#1">1</a>].  It is a
mid-seral species, and is usually absent in old-growth forest
communities [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
The flowers of American hazel are formed in the summer and open the
following spring, before the leaves emerge.  By late summer or early
fall, the fertilized flowers develop into fruits [<a href="#5">5</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Corylus americana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Low- to moderate-severity fires top-kill American hazel [<a href="#7">7</a>].  It
survives fire by sprouting from rhizomes [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].

The underground roots and rhizomes can survive low- to moderate-severity
fires when the humus is moist.  They are relatively shallow, however,
and are vulnerable to fire when the humus is dry and combustible [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous shrub, rhizome in soil
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Corylus americana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
The aerial portions of American hazel are easily killed by spring and
summer fires [<a href="#7">7</a>].

On four oak savanna restoration sites in Minnesota, annual fires reduced
the frequency of American hazel from 65 percent on unburned plots to 39
percent on burned plots.  Although annual burning increased the density of
hazel stems, stems on burned sites were shorter and smaller than stems
on unburned sites [<a href="#3">3</a>]


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
American hazel sprouts from rhizomes following fire [<a href="#6">6</a>].

A volume equation for determining biomass, growth response, and woody
density for American hazel following fire has been developed [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In areas where fire has been excluded, a heavy density of American hazel
has developed, suppressing desirable tree species and contributing to
fuel buildup [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].

Repeated summer fires inhibit the ability of American hazel to sprout by
exposing and damaging underground stems and roots and exhausting stored
food reserves.  Single fires may eliminate American hazel if humus is
sufficiently dry to be completely consumed [<a href="#6">6</a>].
