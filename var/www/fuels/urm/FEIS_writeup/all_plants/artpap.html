<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Artemisia papposa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Fuzzy sagebrush grows in southwestern and south-central Idaho from
Owyhee County in the west to Blaine County in the east [<a href="#5">5</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Fuzzy sagebrush occurs in certain dry sagebrush communities of
southwestern and south-central Idaho.  It has not been included as an
indicator in published classification schemes.

Common plant associates of fuzzy sagebrush include alkali sagebrush
(Artemisia longiloba), Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis), bottlebrush
squirreltail (Elymus elymoides), Columbia needlegrass (Stipa
columbiana), narrowleaf pussytoes (Antennaria stenophylla), longleaf
phlox (Phlox longifolia), Hood's phlox (Phlox hoodii), Wyeth's eriogonum
(Eriogonum heracleoides), and littleflower collinsia (Collinsia
parviflora) [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Patches of basin big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata
ssp. tridentata) or antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) are
present on some sites [<a href="#10">10</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Feral horses browse fuzzy sagebrush in spring.  Both deer and domestic
sheep readily consume the flowerstalks in late summer (R. Rosentreter,
pers. comm. 1989).


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Flowerstalks are highly palatable to a variety of livestock and wildlife
species including domestic sheep and deer.  Browse is at least
moderately palatable to feral horses (R. Rosentreter, pers. comm. 1989).


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Fuzzy sagebrush presumably provides only very limited cover for larger
mammals due to its short stature.  It may, however, provide escape cover
for smaller birds and mammals on some dry, open sites in southern Idaho.
Because it is deciduous, fuzzy sagebrush provides little thermal cover
during winter (R. Rosentreter, pers. comm. 1989).

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Artemisia papposa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Fuzzy sagebrush is a low, dwarf shrub or subshrub which reaches 3.9 to
7.9 inches (1-2 dm) in height [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Leaves are 0.22 to 1.2 inches (1-3
cm) long, canescent, and trifid or irregularly palmatifid [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].  The
inflorescence is racemiform with 4 to 10 heads [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Fuzzy sagebrush occurs on open, dry, alkaline sites in parts of
southwestern Idaho and the Snake River Plain [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].  It is commonly
associated with shallow depressions or intermittent drainageways where
extra moisture is available only during early spring [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Sites are
described as semiarid, with cold winters and hot, dry summers.  Average
annual precipitation at a representative Idaho site was 14.6 inches (360
mm) [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Elevation at several Idaho sites ranged from 4,800 to 5,500
feet (1,464-1,678 m) [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Fuzzy sagebrush occurs in sagebrush communities of southern Idaho where
it is often found on sites dominated by alkali sagebrush and Idaho
fescue [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Fuzzy sagebrush types appear to be climax communities on
very shallow, stony basalt (R. Rosentreter, pers. comm.  1989).


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Fuzzy sagebrush flowers during May and June [<a href="#5">5</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Artemisia papposa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Little is known about adaptations of fuzzy sagebrush to fire.
Resprouting or other types of vegetative response have not been
documented, and reestablishment probably occurs through seed.  This
dwarf shrub is commonly associated with drainageways which tend to carry
fire more readily than do surrounding areas (R. Rosentreter, pers. comm.
1989).  However, on some fuzzy sagebrush sites, fires may not carry due
to the lack of understory herbs or other fuels.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Artemisia papposa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
The effect of fire on fuzzy sagebrush has not been documented.  Plants
are presumably killed when aboveground vegetation is consumed by fire.
On some harsh alkali sites which support fuzzy sagebrush, fire does not
carry because of insufficient fuels [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Little is known about the response of Owyhee sagebrush to fire.
Resprouting after fire or other disturbance has not been documented.
Reestablishment presumably occurs through seed.  Recovery may be slow
where Owyhee sagebrush was uncommon in preburn communities.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
NO-ENTRY
