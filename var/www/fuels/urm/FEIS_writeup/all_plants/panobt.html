<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Panicum obtusum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Vine-mesquite is an important forage species for a variety of wildlife
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>] and all classes of livestock [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Livestock graze the
foliage and inflorescence [<a href="#31">31</a>].

The use of vine-mesquite by wildlife is varied.  The seed, where locally
available, comprises 5 to 10 percent of the diet of northern bobwhite
(Colinus virginianus) [<a href="#27">27</a>] and is important in the diets of scaled
quail, Gambel's quail, and mourning doves [<a href="#19">19</a>].  The foliage and
inflorescence are consumed by deer, elk [<a href="#33">33</a>], jackrabbits, ground
squirrels, prairie dogs, and pronghorn [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability of vine-mesquite to livestock varies seasonally.  When
vine-mesquite is green and succulent, palatability is rated as good; but
as the grass matures and cures, it becomes coarse, and its palatability
decreases to fair [<a href="#21">21</a>].  In pinyon-juniper woodlands vine-mesquite
is considered an "ice cream" species.  Cattle seek out the inflorescence
first, then graze the cured as well as the green vine-mesquite [<a href="#31">31</a>].

The degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife species for
vine-mesquite in several western states is rated as follows
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>]:

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Vine-mesquite provides good overall nutrition for cattle [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Huston
and others [<a href="#22">22</a>] reported the following nutritional values for
vine-mesquite in the summer and fall:

                                Percent Composition
Date            Water   Ash     Cellwall   Phosphorus   Protein   DOM*
 7/27/73        53      8       70         0.14         7         53
10/25/73        57      10      71         0.10         7         42

* DOM - digestible organic matter (a measure of the digestible energy
value of feeds)


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Due to its dense stand characteristics vine-mesquite provides hiding
cover for various rodents and upland game birds [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Vine-mesquite provides effective erosion control due to its rhizomatous
and stoloniferous characteristics [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

Dahl and other [<a href="#13">13</a>] looked at the establishment of new stands of
vine-mesquite.  Their findings showed that the ease of establishing a
stand was rated as only fair, but once established, stand maintenance
was rated as good.  Vine-mesquite readily established on silt and clay
soils, whereas establishment on sandy soils was only fair.  Site
preparation involved disc plowing and rolling.  Rolling increased the
moisture-holding capabilities of the soil and improved seed placement
when planted.  The seed drill was set at a depth 0.5 inch (1 cm) with a
seeding rate of 6.1 pounds of pure live seed (PLS) per acre (6.9 kg PLS
/ha).


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Vine-mesquite decreases in response to moderate or heavy grazing
pressure [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Therefore, stands growing in areas subject to erosion
should be lightly grazed [<a href="#21">21</a>].  After fire, vine-mesquite should be
protected from grazing for 3 to 4 months [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Vine-mesquite is susceptible to broad-spectrum dicot herbicides such as
picloram and dicamba.  These herbicides reduce the growth and
development of its root system [<a href="#36">36</a>].

When reestablishing vine-mesquite on a site, one should plant in the
spring when soil temperature regimes are cool to warm, and soil moisture
is adequate.  Planting at this time aids in germination and seedling
establishment [<a href="#38">38</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Panicum obtusum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Vine-mesquite is a native, perennial, warm season grass from 12 to 24
inches (35-70 cm) tall that produces rhizomes and stolons.  The rhizomes
are short and fibrous, whereas the stolons can be up to 10 feet (3 m) in
length.  The stolons have many rooting points at their swollen nodes.
The inflorescence is a densely flowered, narrow panicle up to 5 inches
(12 cm) in length; as it matures the seed turns brown [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Vine-mesquite reproduces by seed, rhizomes, and stolons [<a href="#18">18</a>].  To
achieve germination rates of approximately 30 percent vine-mesquite
requires a cool to warm soil temperature regime of 65 to 100 degrees
Fahrenheit (18-39 deg C).  Soil temperatures above this range result in
a germination rate of only 6 percent and a reduction of average shoot
height from 3 inches (7 cm) to 0.75 inches (1.8 cm) [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Vine-mesquite is an indicator of moist microsites in arid environments.
It is found along streams, roads, gullies, swales, playas, and arroyos
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].

Soils:  Vine-mesquite occurs in the Alfisol, Entisol, Inceptisol,
Mollisol, and Vertisol soil orders [<a href="#30">30</a>].

Climate:  Vine-mesquite inhabits areas where the winters are short and
mild, and the summers are characterized by long periods of high
temperatures [<a href="#4">4</a>].  The average annual precipitation is 10 to 18 inches
(25-45 cm) [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Elevation:  Vine-mesquite generally grows in an elevational range of
1,000 to 6,000 feet (305-1,800 m) [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Vine-mesquite is a component of the climax vegetation in a mixed- grass
prairie association [<a href="#6">6</a>].  It decreases in response to grazing but
increases in response to fire [<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Vine-mesquite is warm-season grass; thus it is summer active.  It is
actively growing from May to October [<a href="#24">24</a>]; it flowers from July to
August, depending on latitude and elevation [<a href="#14">14</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Panicum obtusum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire destroys the aboveground vegetation of vine-mesquite.  A wildfire
during drought conditions with fuel buildup will remove all humus and
may have an adverse effect on some of the rhizomes.  A prescribed burn
during moist years with sufficient vegetation to carry the burn will
leave humus in the center of the plant protecting the regenerative
features [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Following fire, long stolons occupy burned areas [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Productivity
after fire can increase by as much as 112 percent if soil moisture is
adequate [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Wright [<a href="#44">44</a>] found that vine-mesquite thrives and
produces more herbage on burns than on controls for several years
following a fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
When planning a prescribed burn on the shortgrass prairie, soil
moisture should be high, the relative humidity greater than 70 percent,
and wind speed should be less than 10 miles per hour (17 km/hr) [<a href="#35">35</a>].
Ueckert [<a href="#40">40</a>] found that production and vigor of vine-mesquite was
enhanced by a late winter fire.  Burning during dry years increases the
drought stress on the plants, which lowers overall production in the
community.  Lower production subjects the soil to wind and water erosion
for longer periods of time [<a href="#43">43</a>].

<b>CASE NAME : </b>
Effects of fire on an ashe juniper community


<b>REFERENCE : </b>
Wink, R. L.; Wright, H. A. 1973 [<a href="#43">43</a>]


<b>SEASON/SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION : </b>
Spring 1970/light
Spring 1971/moderate


<b>STUDY LOCATION : </b>
The study occurred on 2,632 acres (1,053 ha) of the Beckham Ranch in
Callahan County, 15 miles (24 km) southeast of Baird, Texas.
 


<b>PREFIRE VEGETATIVE COMMUNITY : </b>
The vegetative community is a mixed-grass prairie interspersed with ashe
juniper (Juniperus ashei) and several species of oak (Quercus spp.).
The major grass species are little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium),
sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), buffalograss (Buchloe
dactyloides), vine-mesquite, Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha), and
tall grama (Bouteloua pectinata).  The large junipers were dozed in
1965.


<b>TARGET SPECIES PHENOLOGICAL STATE : </b>
Vine-mesquite was dormant.


<b>SITE DESCRIPTION : </b>
The site is level to undulating with a few slopes greater than 20
percent.  Elevation is 1,205 to 1,405 feet (365-425 m).  The soils are
sandy loams which are slowly to moderately permeable.  Moisture
retention is moderate, and soils are fertile enough to provide good
grass production.  The limestone bedrock is cracked, forming deep
pockets capable of supporting deep-rooted grasses.  The average
precipitation is 24 to 28 inches (60-70 cm) per year.  During the course
of the study the precipitation varied from a near normal year in 1970,
with 23 inches (58.2 cm) falling from November 1969 to May 1970, to a
dry year in 1971, with 6.5 inches (16.5 cm) falling from November 1970
to May 1971.


<b>FIRE DESCRIPTION : </b>
The amount of heavy fuels on the site varied from 40,000 to 60,000
pounds per acre (44,800-67,200 kg/ha).  Light fuels varied from
685 to 3,185 pounds per acre (768-3,568 kg/ha).  The leeward sides were
ignited prior to the start of the headfires.  

Atmospheric conditions at the time of the ignition of the headfires were
as follows:

                                25 March 1970   27 March 1971

air temperature                 75 degs F       86 degs F
                                (24 degs C)       (30 degs C)  
humidity                        35%             25%
wind speed                      10 mi/hr        15 mi/hr
                                (16 km/hr)      (25 km/hr)              

Fire intensity depended on the amount of fuels.  A cool to moderate fire
was carried in areas with 1,000 pounds per acre (1,120 kg/ha) of light
fuels.  Those areas with heavy fuels yielded hot fires. 


<b>FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES : </b>
During the dry year (1971) vine-mesquite opportunistically used the
higher soil temperatures and litter removal to produce twice the
vegetative growth of the control.  During the wet year (1970)
vine-mesquite had a significant growth increase, but not as dramatic as
in the dry year.  The production of vine-mesquite (kg/ha) was as
follows:

Year            Burned          Unburned        Difference

1970            4458            3434            +30%
1971            7777            3669            +112%

The burn in the dry year (1971) resulted in the increased growth of
vine-mesquite because it occupies mesic microsites, but resulted in the
reduced growth of litle bluestem, tall grama, and side-oats grama.  This
reduced growth resulted from increased drought stress brought on by the
fire.  Because vegetative recovery was slow, the soil was exposed to
wind and water erosion for several months, thus increasing soil loss.

The burn in the wet year (1970) resulted in an increase in growth of all
species but one, side-oats grama.  With good soil moisture the plants
recovered rapidly, and soil loss was negligible.


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS : </b>
When planning a prescribed burn, soil moisture should be a primary
concern for the land manager.  With high soil moisture, the vegetation
recovers rapidly, and the loss of soil from wind and water erosion is
minimal.
