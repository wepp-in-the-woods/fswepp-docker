<b>ABBREVIATION : </b>
JUNTRIA
JUNTRI

<b>SYNONYMS : </b>
   Juncus albescens


<b>SCS PLANT CODE : </b>
   JUAL2


<b>COMMON NAMES : </b>
   three-flowered rush
   albino rush


<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of three-flowered rush is Juncus
triglumis var. albescens Lange.  The species proper is circumboreal and
has two varieties.  Some authorities list J. triglumis var. triglumis as
a Eurasian variety and J. triglumis var. albescens as a New World
variety.  The second is commonly referred to by its synonym, Juncus
albescens [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Other authorities argue that the two entities are in
fact separate species, both occurring in North America.  Juncus
triglumis var. triglumis is more of an arctic-alpine species, while J.
Triglumis var. albescens is calcareous-soil limited [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>LIFE FORM : </b>
Graminoid

<b>FEDERAL LEGAL STATUS : </b>
No special status

<b>OTHER STATUS : </b>
Three-flowered rush is rare in Montana [<a href="#15">15</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juncus triglumis var. albescens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Three-flowered rush is transcontinental in North America.  It extends
from Alaska to Greenland, south in the east to New York and in the Rocky
Mountains to New Mexico [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
If autogenic changes are slow, three-flowered rush may be useful as an
indicator of global climatic changes [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
The fragile, boggy habitat of three-flowered rush should be protected
from trampling [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Three-flowered rush had 2 percent greater cover on
a 35-year-old oil spill than on undisturbed sites.  This indicates that
the species was at least resilient to, if not benefited by, a reduction
in competition.  Water-soaked roots are protected from hydrocarbons
[<a href="#10">10</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juncus triglumis var. albescens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Three-flowered rush is a loosely tufted perennial which grows 1.5 to 8
inches (4-19 cm) tall.  The 0.5- to 2.8-inch-long (1-7 cm) basal leaves
rise from branching rootstocks.  The inflorescence consists of two to
five (usually three) flowers in a capitate cluster.  The capsule has
three cells and three sides and contains numerous seeds [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  The
flowers, fruits, and seeds of the two varieties of J. triglumis differ
inconstantly [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Three-flowered rush reproduces from its branching rootstocks [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Three-flowered rush is an arctic-alpine species, which grows in wet
meadows, on edges of streams and river bars, and near snowbanks.  It
grows on wet sites, although not the wettest available.  It grows in
areas that have been gouged out by heavy runoff, and it is tolerant of
relatively deep standing water for part of the season [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].
Three-flowered rush is more abundant on the limestone edge of its range.
It grows in wet microsites of shallow soils, saturated, sandy gravel
subject to needle ice disturbance, or frost hummocks subject to soil
frost action.  It has been reported on gleysolic, crysolic, or organic
soils [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].

Three-flowered rush has been reported at 11,000 to 12,000 feet
(3,550-3,870 m) in Colorado [<a href="#4">4</a>] and 8,680 to 11,810 feet (2,800-3,810 m)
in Utah [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Three-flowered rush is often associated with other rushes
(Juncus spp.), sedges (Carex spp.), kobresia (Kobresia spp.),
cottongrass (Eriophorum spp.), knotweed (Polygonum spp.) fescue (Festuca
spp.), and millet woodrush (Luzula parviflora) [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Three-flowered rush is a species of mid-hydrarch succession.  It grows
in shallow soils of former lakebeds and decreases as more soil develops
[<a href="#14">14</a>].  It grows in the intermediate stage between lake and meadow [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Three-flowered rush has mature fruit anytime between June and September
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].
