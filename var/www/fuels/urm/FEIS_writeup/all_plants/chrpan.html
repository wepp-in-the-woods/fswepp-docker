Desert rabbitbrush is often found in creosotebush (Larrea tridentata)
scrub, Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia) woodland, and baccharis (Baccharis
spp.) desert communities [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  It is commonly associated with white
burrobush (Hymenoclea salsola), desert saltbush (Atriplex polycarpa),
and catclaw acacia (Acacia greggii) [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Chrysothamnus paniculatus 
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Desert rabbitbrush communities provide a home for many bird species.  In
desert rabbitbrush washes in the Mojave Desert, winter bird densities
were 50 to 60 times higher and the number of species was eight times higher
than in the surrounding open desert.  At the same site, breeding bird
densities were 15 times higher with 6 times the number of species [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Some arroyo habitats where desert rabbitbrush occurs provide den sites
for the desert tortoise [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Rabbitbrush species (Chrysothamnus spp.) are useful for erosion control
because of their deep roots, heavy litter production, and ability to
establish on harsh sites.  They establish well naturally from seed and
artifically by transplanting [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Desert rabbitbrush has been used for
revegetation of sulfur mine spoils in Nevada.  One year following
planting container-grown desert rabbitbrush on the Leviathan Mine in
Nevada, desert rabbitbrush showed 88 percent survival; 4 years later,
survival had decreased to 9 percent.  Desert rabbitbrush can be
transplanted on spoils without site preparation [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Desert rabbitbrush reportedly has a rubber content of 2.5 percent or
more [<a href="#11">11</a>].  

Rabbitbrush species are burned by the Hopi in religious ceremonies.  The
Hopi also use them in windbreaks, for making arrows, and in wicker work.
A yellow dye is obtained from the flowers, and a green dye from the
inner bark [<a href="#11">11</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Chrysothamnus paniculatus 
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Desert rabbitbrush is a native, deciduous, highly-branched, rounded
shrub 2 to 6.5 feet (0.6-2 m) tall [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  The leaves are 0.8 to
1 inches (0.4- 3 cm) long [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Desert rabbitbrush flowers are arranged
in small, densly clustered heads on the ends of numerous short branches.
Numerous small bracts are tightly assembled in a series of rows at the
base of each flower head [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Desert rabbitbrush reproduces by seed.  Ripe achenes are easily
dislodged from the plant by wind or any abrasive action [<a href="#15">15</a>].  The
majority of rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus spp.) seeds are wind
disseminated.  Dissemination distances ranging from 130 to 165 yards
(117-148 m) have been recorded for other species of rabbitbrush [<a href="#26">26</a>].

No specific information was available on germination or viability of
desert rabbitbrush seeds; however, information is available on other
rabbitbrush species [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Stevens and others [<a href="#27">27</a>] found that 80
percent of rubber rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus nauseosus) seeds stored for
2 years germinated, but seeds stored for 3 and 4 years had reduced
germination of 65 and 34 percent, respectively.  Seedlings of most
rabbitbrush species are easily established by shallow planting on rough
soil surfaces [<a href="#15">15</a>].
 
If consistent with other rabbitbrush species, desert rabbitbrush can
also reproduce by sprouting from the root crown [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Desert rabbitbrush is found along roadsides, streambanks, terraces,
sandy washes, and dry rocky slopes and arroyos at elevations between
2,500 and 4,000 feet (762-1,219 m) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  It can grow in
extremely poor soils and is resistant to low temperatures [<a href="#25">25</a>].
Rabbitbrush species are tolerant of moisture stress and salt stress [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Desert rabbitbrush flowers mainly from September through December, but
may also flower in May and June [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Seeds of many
rabbitbrush species ripen over 2 to 4 weeks, and many are dislodged from
the bush during that time.  Seeds normally ripen in the late fall and
early winter [<a href="#15">15</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Chrysothamnus paniculatus 
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Specific information is not available regarding the fire ecology and
adaptations of desert rabbitbrush. However, most rabbitbrush species
vigorously sprout from the root crown after fire and therefore establish
well on burned sites.  They also have prolific seed production and
vigorous spring growth [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Rabbitbrush species are prolific litter producers and investigations
have shown that this has contributed to excessive fire fuels on some
sites [<a href="#20">20</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Information is not available regarding the effects of fire on desert
rabbitbrush; however, this shrub is probably top-killed by moderate to
severe fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Information is not available regarding desert rabbitbrush response to
fire.  However, if consistent with other rabbitbrush species, desert
rabbitbrush probably recovers well after fire by sprouting from the root
crown.  Desert rabbitbrush sprouts and seedlings are probably abundant
the first years after fire.
