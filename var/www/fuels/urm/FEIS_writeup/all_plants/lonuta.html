<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Utah honeysuckle is an understory component of mature forests [<a href="#69">69</a>].  It
is a major or minor shrub component, depending on the phase, in grand
fir/Rocky Mountain maple (Abies grandis/Acer glabrum) habitat types in
central Idaho [<a href="#71">71</a>].  It may be codominant in the shrub layer at
mid-elevations with grouse whortleberry (Vaccinium scoparium) in
subalpine fir/common beargrass (Abies lasiocarpa/Xerophyllum tenax)
habitat types in Idaho [<a href="#69">69</a>].  At low to mid-elevations, Utah honeysuckle
is present in cool lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and Douglas-fir
(Pseudotsuga menziesii) habitat types.  At higher elevations it occurs
in dry to moist, warm and cold Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii),
grand fir, western redcedar (Thuja plicata), and subalpine fir habitat
type series [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].

Utah honeysuckle is listed as a dominant, codominant, or minor
understory species in habitat types described in the following
publications:

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lonicera utahensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Utah honeysuckle has little value as browse for livestock [<a href="#81">81</a>].  It is
valuable summer and fall browse for elk, but a minor browse species for
white-tailed deer [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>].  On sites in the Garnet Range of
Mountain that had been logged within the last 50 years, radio-collared
elk used Utah honeysuckle 2 to 4 percent of the time throughout the
summer.  The relative availability of Utah honeysuckle and use by the
elk did not change over the summer [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Moose used Utah honeysuckle in
trace amounts as summer and winter forage in Wyoming [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Moose in
north-central Idaho consumed it from October through April [<a href="#62">62</a>].
Grizzly bear eat Utah honeysuckle fruits summer and fall [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].
Utah honeysuckle occurs with 14 to 80 percent frequency in various types
of grizzly bear habitat in the northern Rocky Mountains [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Black
bear utilized Utah honeysuckle with 15 to 45 percent frequency during
the summer in central Idaho [<a href="#71">71</a>].  Ruffed grouse consumed Utah
honeysuckle during the summer in northern Idaho [<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability of Utah honeysuckle is poor to fair for sheep and poor
for cattle and horses in Utah and Montana [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Palatability of Utah
honeysuckle for moose is intermediate [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Utah honeysuckle has poor protein and energy value [<a href="#12">12</a>].  The elemental
content of 10 compounds in Utah honeysuckle leaves and stems has been
determined on plants growing in areas subjected to seven different
silvicultural treatments [<a href="#70">70</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
In Utah and Wyoming, Utah honeysuckle provides poor cover for pronghorn,
elk, and waterfowl; poor to fair cover for mule and white-tailed deer;
and fair to good cover for small mammals and nongame and upland game
birds [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Utah honeysuckle is recommended for reclamation plantings in the
Intermountain region on riparian sites, such as wet meadow and forest
types [<a href="#56">56</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Utah honeysuckle is recommended for ornamental use in gardens [<a href="#41">41</a>].  It
can be artificially propagated by stem cuttings [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Silviculture:  Utah honeysuckle can survive light to moderate site
preparation following logging [<a href="#69">69</a>].  It significantly (p<0.05) increased
in cover at 5 and 11 years after logging in western hemlock/pachystima
(Tsuga heterophylla/Pachystima myrsinites) and grand fir/pachystima
habitat types in northern Idaho [<a href="#86">86</a>].

In a comparison of clearcuts and shelterwood cuts in northern Idaho,
Utah honeysuckle was present in areas opened up 0.25 mile or more, and
its frequency was not influenced by increased evaporation due to canopy
removal [<a href="#43">43</a>].

Natural regeneration of six conifer species was compared under various
silvicultural methods and site prepartations in three different habitat
types in west-central Idaho.  Utah honeysuckle provided light or
efficient cover for Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and
grand fir seedlings; and moderate or very efficient cover under which
western larch (Larix occidentalis), lodgepole pine, and Engelmann spruce
seedlings established well [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].

A salvage cut was done following a Douglas-fir tussock moth outbreak in
Douglas-fir and grand fir forests in the Blue Mountains of Oregon and
Washington.  Utah honeysuckle was considered an important facilitative
shrub; regeneration of Douglas-fir, grand fir, and Engelmann spruce was
abundant [<a href="#68">68</a>].

Other Uses:  Regression equations have been developed for predicting
Utah honeysuckle aboveground biomass based on stem diameter and/or shrub
height [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].  Other equations predict Utah honeysuckle development
following various silvicultural treatments [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Regression
equations were developed for shrub production following logging; Utah
honeysuckle had no significant (p>0.05) relationships between biomass,
twig production, and cover with the environment or habitat type
overstory characteristics [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Regression equations also allow the
prediction of understory production for maintenance of wildlife
populations [<a href="#77">77</a>].

Utilization studies and clipping projects in northern Idaho have
estimated forage production of Utah honeysuckle.  Intense clipping
levels caused decreased vitality over time [<a href="#21">21</a>].  However, Utah
honeysuckle can withstand up to 60 percent removal of the annual growth
of twigs if clipped in the fall [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Control:  Herbicide treatments are not always needed in Utah honeysuckle
management.  Utah honeysuckle is one of the shorter shrubs in the
understory of the cedar-hemlock zone in northern Idaho.  After logging,
container-grown Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine transplants soon were
taller (0.9 foot [0.27 m]) than Utah honeysuckle (0.5 foot [0.15 m])
[<a href="#56">56</a>].

Where control is required for site preparation and conifer release,
various herbicides have been successfully used on Utah honeysuckle.
Utah honeysuckle had more than 50 percent damage 2 years after treatment
with glyphosate.  Aerial broadcast application of 2,4-D caused 58
percent top-kill by year 2.  After this, Utah honeysuckle recovered in
two out of three treatments [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Herbicides must reduce shrub cover by
50 percent, or shrubs may recover within 1 or 2 years [<a href="#54">54</a>].  Herbicide
selection and application seasons and rates have been discussed in
detail [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lonicera utahensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Utah honeysuckle is a native deciduous shrub that grows 3.2 to 6.6 feet
(1-2 m) tall [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>].  It may form clumps.  Branches are slender and
spreading [<a href="#81">81</a>].  Fruit is a small, several-seeded berry [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Utah honeysuckle sprouts from the root crown [<a href="#19">19</a>].  It begins sexual
reproduction at 5 to 10 years [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Fleshy fruits are dispersed by
birds, rodents, and bears [<a href="#69">69</a>].  The seeds of Lonicera species require
stratification before germinating [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Utah honeysuckle seeds are
short lived [<a href="#40">40</a>].  In a seedbank study in the Blue Mountains of Oregon,
Utah honeysuckle was present at 4 percent frequency in a grand
fir/pachystima habitat type where some trees were 150 years old.  No
seedlings of Utah honeysuckle emerged from soil samples [<a href="#75">75</a>]. 


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Utah honeysuckle is found on moist, open or wooded slopes and canyons
[<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  It also occurs on glaciofluvial flats or stream valley plains
[<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>].  It occurs from 2,240 to 11,000 feet (683-3,353 m) in elevation
[<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>].

In northern Idaho, Utah honeysuckle was associated with soils of
intermediate depth, 14 to 20 inches (35.6-50.8 cm) [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].  There was
no difference in the amount of Utah honeysuckle cover on northern and
southern exposure; it was common on northwestern to eastern exposures
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  Soil textures may be fine sandy loams to loamy sands
[<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].

Utah honeysuckle occurs in a continental climate that is influenced by
maritime air masses or is semiarid [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Precipitation ranges from 28.3
to 45.3 inches (719-1,150 mm) [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>].

Common associated species not mentioned in Distribution and Occurrence
are white spirea (Spiraea betulifolia), ninebark (Physocarpus
malvaceus), Scouler willow (Salix scouleriana), Sitka alder (Alnus
viridis ssp. sinuata), thinleaf huckleberry (Vaccinium membranaceum),
pinegrass (Calamagrostis rubescens), queencup beadlily (Clintonia
uniflora), and sweetscented bedstraw (Galium triflorum) [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Utah honeysuckle is an important shrub in late seral to climax
communities in mesic coniferous forests [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].  It can tolerate
moderate to dense shade and is common beneath relatively closed canopies
[<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].  Utah honeysuckle was a common understory plant in stands aged
60 to 325 years in the cedar-hemlock/spruce-fir ecotone in Glacier
National Park, Montana [<a href="#27">27</a>].  It had similar frequencies (average of 2.4
percent) in stands aged approximately 50 and 400 years [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Seedlings
may establish in an early successional stage [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Utah honeysuckle
comes in after the herb stage following disturbance in the western white
pine (Pinus monticola) zone in northern Idaho [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Under closed
canopies of Douglas-fir-lodgepole pine/northern twinflower (Linnaea
borealis) community types of western Montana, Utah honeysuckle was
sparsely distributed with 3 percent mean cover [<a href="#30">30</a>].  In the Swan
Valley, Montana, it was present at 33 percent frequency in immature
(less than 90 years old) grand fir forests and at 67 percent frequency
in old-growth (150 or more years old) stands [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Beneath the climax
cedar-hemlock canopy, no Utah honeysuckle occurred.  Under the almost
closed canopies (3 to 5 percent of full sunlight) of Douglas-fir and
western white pine seral stands, Utah honeysuckle was present at 10 to
40 percent frequency [<a href="#35">35</a>].  In central Idaho, Utah honeysuckle may be
either a major or minor seral species in different phases of grand
fir/Rocky Mountain maple habitat types [<a href="#71">71</a>].  Utah honeysuckle was one
of the dominant shrubs in mid-successional stages (11 to 79 years)
following clearcutting of spruce-fir forest [<a href="#67">67</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Utah honeysuckle leaves expand in late March to early May [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].
Flowers bloom April through June [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].  Fruits mature from June to
September [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>].  Leaves drop in the fall [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lonicera utahensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fire often injures Utah honeysuckle, and results in temporary reductions
in cover and frequency [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Utah honeysuckle sprouts from the
root crown after top-kill by fire [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].

For some of the communities that Utah honeysuckle occurs in, such as
grand fir/queencup beadlily in northwestern Montana or mixed-conifer
subalpine forests of the southern and central Rocky Mountains, fire-free
intervals or stand-destroying fires occur on average every 150 years
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lonicera utahensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire top-kills Utah honeysuckle.  Surviving plants will sprout from the
root crown.  Regrowth is slow [<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Utah honeysuckle is a decreaser following fire in the cedar-hemlock zone
of the Rocky Mountains [<a href="#87">87</a>].  A site in southeastern British Columbia
was logged, burned, and planted with Engelmann spruce.  The burning
inhibited Utah honeysuckle growth compared to unburned sites after 3
years [<a href="#83">83</a>].  Fire in Douglas-fir zone in Montana and Idaho eliminated
Utah honeysuckle from study areas.  Before burning, Utah honeysuckle was
present at 2.9 plants per 1,000 square feet (2.9 plants/92.9 sq m).  One
to four years following the fire, no Utah honeysuckle plants were
recorded [<a href="#47">47</a>].  In Douglas-fir-western larch forests of Montana, cover
of Utah honeysuckle was 1 to 2 percent on several sites.  Following
clearcuts and prescribed burns, cover was 0 to 3 percent by postfire
year 2 and 6 percent by postfire year 8.  At one site, it was not
present until postfire year 5 and had 1 percent cover [<a href="#72">72</a>].

In spruce-fir forests of Montana, Utah honeysuckle neither increased nor
decreased following fire [<a href="#82">82</a>].  In Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming,
mean frequency (27 percent) and cover (9 percent) of Utah honeysuckle
were higher on unburned spruce-fir sites than on burned sites (differing
ages and severities).  On a 1-year-old moderate-severity burn, frequency
was 5 percent; on a 1-year-old severely burned site frequency was 3
percent; and on a 43-year-old severely burned site frequency was 2
percent [<a href="#6">6</a>].

There was no difference in frequency (52-67 percent) of Utah honeysuckle
in closed stands compared to logged sites and sites logged with slash
piled and then burned.  However, a single broadcast burn on logged sites
reduced honeysuckle frequency to 35 to 40 percent, and multiple
broadcast burns on logged sites reduced it to 25 percent [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>].

In a 19-year-old clearcut with no postcut treatment in west-central
Montana, Utah honeysuckle biomass was 0.064 pounds per 10.8 square feet
(29 g/sq m).  In a 10 year-old stand that had been clearcut and
broadcast burned, Utah honeysuckle biomass was 0.01 pounds per 10.8
square feet (4 g/sq m) [<a href="#64">64</a>].

In a lodgepole pine forest in Montana, Utah honeysuckle was present in
the postfire community by year 2.  It remained constant for about 8
years and then increased for another 10 years.  Herbicides were applied
at postfire year 6.  Utah honeysuckle sharply decreased for 1 year;
after this, it steadily increased [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Based on growth curves
developed from lodgepole pine understory, projections were made about
Utah honeysuckle response following a clearcut and broadcast burn.  The
model assumed that all aboveground vegetation and duff were consumed,
and 30 percent of the area was exposed mineral soil.  Surviving Utah
honeysuckle were projected to have spacing similar to prefire
communities but with less cover.  Height of Utah honeysuckle was
expected to be 2 feet (0.61 m) at year 5 and about 3 feet (0.91 m) at
year 20 [<a href="#37">37</a>].

One year following a severe fire in northern Idaho, Utah honeysuckle was
present on six out of 21 sites.  On two sites, it achieved 3.28 square
feet per 0.004 acre (1 sq m/0.01 ha) cover at postfire years 6 to 11.
It was not an important species on the other sites [<a href="#73">73</a>].

Repeated fires in the cedar-hemlock zone of the northern Rocky Mountains
will maintain the seral shrub stage, of which Utah honeysuckle is a
component, for about 50 years [<a href="#87">87</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In grand fir/pachystima habitat types in Idaho, Utah honeysuckle fuel
loadings were 5 to 141 pounds per acre (2.3-64 kg/ha) [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Although it
was suggested that overstory removal would increase Utah honeysuckle
fuel loading, there was no significant (p>0.05) difference in Utah
honeysuckle cover following a mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus
ponderosae) epidemic that killed the lodgepole pine overstory [<a href="#3">3</a>].
Overall fuel loads are about 20 tons per acre (4.5 kg/sq m) in the moist
lower subalpine habitat types in which Utah honeysuckle occurs [<a href="#19">19</a>].
Utah honeysuckle stem diameters range from 0.12 to 0.67 inch (0.3-1.7
cm) [<a href="#9">9</a>].
