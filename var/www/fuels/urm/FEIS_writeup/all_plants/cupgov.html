<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of Gowen cypress is Cupressus
goveniana Gord. (Cupressaceae) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  There are two recognized
subspecies [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>]:  
   
C. goveniana ssp. goveniana Gord.           Gowen cypress
C. goveniana ssp. pygmaea (Lemm.) Bartel    Mendocino or pygmy cypress
 
As used in this write-up, "Gowen cypress" refers to both subspecies
unless C. goveniana ssp. goveniana is specifically indicated.

Mendocino cypress was previously considered a variety of Gowen cypress,
but has been given subspecies status by J. Bartel [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Santa Cruz
cypress (C. abramsiana), listed as a variety of Gowen cypress by Wolf
[<a href="#27">27</a>] and Little [<a href="#13">13</a>], has since been given species status by Hickman [<a href="#5">5</a>].

<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cupressus goveniana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Gowen cypress is restricted to the Coast Ranges of central and
northwestern California [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Gowen cypress (Cupressus goveniana
ssp. goveniana) occurs in only two areas of Monterey County, California:
Huckleberry Hill, and between San Jose Creek and Gibson Creek [<a href="#26">26</a>].
Mendocino cypress occurs in a narrow, discontinuous strip along the
Mendocino County coast known as the "Mendocino White Plains" or "pine
barrens" [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  A grove also occurs in Sonoma County [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Gowen
cypress is cultivated in Hawaii [<a href="#32">32</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Gowen cypress can occur in dense thickets as well as in open groves.
Dense thickets are common in regenerating burns [<a href="#26">26</a>].  In Monterey
County, Gowen cypress (Cupressus goveniana ssp. goveniana) and bishop
pine (P. muricata) form almost impenetrable thickets [<a href="#16">16</a>].  In some
areas Gowen cypress is associated with closed-cone coniferous woodlands
and closed-cone pine-cypress forests [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  

Mendocino cypress is associated with redwood (Sequoia
sempervirens)-Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and other north coast
coniferous forests in Mendocino County [<a href="#26">26</a>].  This subspecies is also a
component of the Mendocino pygmy cypress forest, which intergrades with
upland redwood and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis)-grand fir (Abies
grandis) forests [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Gowen cypress (C. g. ssp. goveniana) is a component of the Monterey
pygmy cypress forest, which intergrades with Monterey pine (Pinus
radiata) forest on deep soils [<a href="#6">6</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cupressus goveniana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Cypress (Cupressus spp.) wood is generally durable and stable.  It is
suitable for a wide range of exterior uses including joinery, shingles,
and boats.  Possible interior uses include moulding and panelling [<a href="#29">29</a>].
Cypress shelterbelts provide good firewood.  Most cypress species
develop a large proportion of heartwood, which splits well, dries
quickly, and is clean burning.  Cypress wood is moderately fast burning
because of its medium density.  As cypress woods are prone to sparking,
they are recommended only for enclosed fires [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Rodents and deer consume cypress seedlings [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Cypress are considered
undesirable forage for livestock, although young plants are occasionally
browsed [<a href="#27">27</a>].

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Grazing and trampling by livestock are detrimental to cypress seedlings.
Fire followed by intensive grazing could eliminate a cypress grove [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Gowen cypress grows best on the coast.  Although waterlogged soils may
result in dwarfed trees, Gowen cypress could be safely used for low
hedges and windbreaks because of its dense growth habit [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].

Gowen cypress seedlings are susceptible to damping-off fungi [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Both
subspecies are highly susceptible to coryneum canker (Coryneum
cardinale), which can kill trees [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Fungicides are effective in
preventing the spread of the disease but cannot eradicate it once
infection has begun [<a href="#27">27</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cupressus goveniana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Gowen cypress is a native, evergreen tree.  The typical subspecies
(Cupressus goveniana ssp. goveniana) has a bushy growth form and grows
from 16.5 to 23 feet (5-7 m) tall [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Mendocino cypress has a
single, slender trunk and sparse crown [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  It grows from 3.3 to
6.6 feet (1-2 m) tall on sterile soils and from 33 to 165 feet (10-50 m)
tall on richer soils [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Mature leaves of both subspecies are
0.04 to 0.08 inches (1-2 mm) long, although they can be up to 0.4 inch
(10 mm) long on vigorous shoots [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Ovulate cones are solitary, up to
0.8 inch (20 mm) long.  Staminate cones are 0.12 to 0.16 inch (3-4 mm)
long [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  The bark is smooth and fibrous, becoming rougher with
age.  It can be several centimeters thick [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  The bark of Mendocino
cypress occurs in strips, peeling easily after death of the tree, but
otherwise intact [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Gowen cypress forms a well-defined taproot and
numerous laterals the first year [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  The root systems of
Gowen cypress are extensive and shallow, less than 1 foot (30 cm) deep
[<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Gowen cypress reproduces exclusively from seed.  Mendocino cypress cone
production is abundant on dwarfed and mature trees, but is rare or
absent on young vigorous trees [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Staminate cones are usually first
produced when trees are 6 to 7 years old, but have developed on 1- and
2-year-old seedlings of Mendocino cypress and Gowen cypress (Cupressus
goveniana ssp. goveniana), respectively [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Ovulate cones are
produced on trees that are 4 years of age or older.  The cones require 2
years to mature [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>], and contain from 90 to 130 seeds [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  The
cones of California cyress are closed; they persist on the tree until
opened by the heat of a fire or from desiccation due to age [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].
Seeds are shed gradually over several months after the cones open [<a href="#26">26</a>].
Detached cones will open, but they rarely result in seedling
establishment, usually due to lack of a suitable seedbed [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Seed
dispersal is primarily by wind and rain [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Gowen cypress germination rates range from 23 to 53 percent [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Seeds
require bare mineral soil for germination and establishment.  Seedling
mortality is high on shaded sites with abundant litter because of
damping-off fungi [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Seedlings are sensitive to excessive moisture
[<a href="#27">27</a>].
 


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Gowen cypress is confined to poorly drained, acidic, podzolic soils,
usually on exposed sites [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  In Mendocino County, these areas are
flooded during the winter, forming shallow bogs or ponds [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].

Gowen cypress (Cupressus goveniana ssp. goveniana) occurs at elevations
from 100 to 990 feet (30-300 m).  Mendocino cypress occurs at elevations
below 1,650 feet (500 m) [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Site requirements for cypress seedlings are typical of those for pioneer
conifers.  Seedlings are shade intolerant and survive best in full
sunlight on bare mineral soil [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  According to Armstrong [<a href="#1">1</a>],
cypress trees of southern California are very sensitive to lack of
light, losing their foliage when growing in shade.  


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Cypress species pollination occurs in late fall and spring [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Seeds
mature 15 to 18 months after pollination.  Ovulate cones remain closed
until opened by heat or age [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cupressus goveniana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Gowen cypress is a fire-adapted, fire-dependent species [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  It has
slightly fire-resistant bark and serotinous cones.  Its low branching
habit makes it susceptible to crown fires [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  The serotinous cones
of the California cypress species persist on trees for years [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].
Cone opening is erratic and almost negligible except when cones are
exposed to extreme heat; then it is rapid and uniform [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  When
opened by the heat of a fire, the seeds fall on exposed mineral soil
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Most seed falls in the first few months following fire [<a href="#28">28</a>].
Fires that occur in late summer and fall and are followed by winter
rains ensure seed dissemination on bare mineral substrates and moist
conditions for germination [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Successful cypress reproduction is
generally restricted to burned sites [<a href="#26">26</a>].  No information was available
on fire-free intervals for communities dominated by Gowen cypress.
Tecate cypress (Cupressus guadalupenis var. forbesii), however, a
cypress found in southern California, has an average interval between
fires of 25 years, ranging from 15 to 63 years [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Cypress trees of
southern California generally reach cone-bearing age before another fire
occurs [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tree without adventitious-bud root crown
   Crown residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cupressus goveniana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Most fires probably kill Gowen cypress.  Cypress thickets are conducive
to crown fires, which kill most trees.  Some trees survive when fires
are patchy [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Large trees could probably survive surface fires.

Cones of the California cypress species open as the resin melts and
boils.  Rapid charring of the thick cone scales extinguishes the flames,
leaving seeds unburned [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Gowen cypress trees release large quantities of seed after fire [<a href="#27">27</a>].
Both subspecies produce dense thickets after fire [<a href="#26">26</a>].  The Huckleberry
Hill grove of Gowen cypress (Cupressus goveniana ssp. goveniana) in
Monterey County was reduced from over 100 acres (40 ha) to only a few
hectares by a 1901 fire.  By 1948, the grove had almost returned to its
prefire size [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fires occurring too frequently in Gowen cypress groves may destroy them,
as reproduction could be eliminated before it has a chance to produce
cones.  Conversely, fire suppression could threaten the species [<a href="#1">1</a>].
