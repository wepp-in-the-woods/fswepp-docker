<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Mountain fern moss is often an indicator of stable, late stages of
succession stands dominated by white spruce (Picea glauca) or black
spruce (P. mariana) [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Publications listing mountain fern moss as a
dominant ground cover are as follows:

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
In the past mountain fern moss has been used for covering dirt floors
and lining fruit and vegetable storage boxes [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Mountain fern moss
is still used for chinking log structures in Alaska.  The wet moss is
pressed into cracks between logs using a wooden chisel.  When the moss
is dry, it remains compressed and stays green for the life of the cabin.
In many ways it is preferable to modern material [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Mountain fern
moss is used by florists to form banks of green in show windows [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Mountain fern moss is used in locating pollution sources and determining
levels of pollution of heavy metals in the environment [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Mountain
fern moss absorbs metals over its entire surface and is little
influenced by variations in substrate mineralization.  Close to the
source, this moss accumulates high levels of metals [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
It has been shown that tree canopy removal will kill mountain fern moss,
but removal of only the shrub canopy has a less severe effect [<a href="#7">7</a>].
Mountain fern moss growth is better in undisturbed areas than in
disturbed areas.  Moss growth is so closely balanced with its
microclimate that even the removal of a rather open shrub layer can have
a measurable effect on growth rates [<a href="#7">7</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Hylocomium splendens 
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Mountain fern moss is a perennial, relatively large, robust moss,
occurring in wide loose patches, and often forming mats [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Stems
are 3.9 to 5.9 inches (10-15 cm) in length.  Mountain fern moss has
tiny, long, filamentous rhizoids that can transport soil water
remarkably long vertical distances to green surface tissues [<a href="#23">23</a>].  The
average life span of this moss is 8 years [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction:  Mountain fern moss reproduces sexually by spores.
These spores are wind dispersed.  The period for gametangicel (structure
containing the gametes) development for mountain fern moss is 11 months
[<a href="#34">34</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Mountain fern moss reproduces vegetatively by
branching laterally.  A new, readily identifiable segment is produced
each year arising from the stems of the previous year's growth in a
layered or steplike fashion [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  In mountain fern moss, the bud
which will develop into the following year's growth layer is formed at
the same time that the lateral branches are initiated in the current
year's layer, but further development is somehow delayed.  The buds do
not start to elongate until the previous segment has completed its
growth [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Cold treatment is not required for further development, as
buds show normal development in material brought into a growth chamber
later in the season and kept at temperatures above freezing.
Photoperiod also seems not to be a factor.  A small proportion of buds
showed some elongation in late September and October, whereas
development in the field does not usually take place until the following
May or June [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Mountain fern moss is abundant and often dominant in coniferous forests
on water-shedding and water-receiving sites [<a href="#18">18</a>].  On such sites, this
moss often develops a mat layer that may be 7.9 to 11.8 inches (20-30
cm) thick [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Mountain fern moss also occurs on ledges, humus and
decaying wood in cool, moist ravines and mountain woods from sea level
to 10,000 feet (0-3,048 m) [<a href="#14">14</a>].  This moss is a common moss on dune
pastures in Scotland [<a href="#25">25</a>].

Mountain fern moss is restricted to areas sheltered by trees and shrubs
[<a href="#7">7</a>].  It requires shade, moderate water levels, and high nutrient
levels.  It is not rooted in the substrate and is nearly independent of
the substrate's nutrient and water supply.  Growth is controlled by
rainfall frequency and degree of protection from evaporation stress [<a href="#7">7</a>].
This moss quickly dries up when the canopy cover is not adequate to
prevent high evaporation [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Growth rates are highest in habitats
protected from evaporation stress, and survival is enhanced in shaded
habitats or in environments with high humidity and consistent cloud
cover [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Mountain fern moss is typically found associated with the following
understory species:  salal (Gaultheria shallon), pachystima (Pachystima
myrsinites), Shreber's moss (Pleurozium schreberi), Rhytidiadelphus
boreus, big huckleberry (Vaccinium membranaceum), and red huckleberry
(V. parvifolium) [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Climax Species 

Mountain fern moss typically occurs in stable late stages of succession.
It is very shade tolerant [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  It will replace the
shade-intolerant lichens and often becomes the dominant ground cover in
late seral to climax stands of white spruce and black spruce [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
The beginning of blooming in mosses is considered to occur when one or
two archegonia (female gametophyte) open.  In Hernoesand, Sweden,
mountain fern moss first bloomed in July.  The gametangicel developed in
May or June of the following year.  In Germany, mountain fern moss first
bloomed in May or June and the gametangicel developed in February or May
of the following year [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Growth of the previous year's layer is
usually resumed in early May to mid-June.  In boreal forests, growth
rates were high in May, June, and August; growth slowed in October.
There appears to be little if any growth activity over the winter months
in high-altitude regions [<a href="#7">7</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Hylocomium splendens 
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Mountain fern moss is not well adapted to fire.  It typically occurs in
wet stands of white or black spruce that have a fire regime of 200 to
400 years [<a href="#31">31</a>].  When they do burn, the moss/lichen layer provides the
major carrier fuels.  These fuels take only minutes to reach equilibrium
moisture content when the relative humidity changes; therefore, they are
very flammable [<a href="#23">23</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Hylocomium splendens 
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Mountain fern moss is generally killed by fire, although small patches
may survive low-severity fire [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Some moss species on burned areas
can survive as fragments in the soil [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Mountain fern moss takes many years to recover following fire.  Although
small patches may survive fire, it is not until a closed or nearly
closed canopy is established that mountain fern moss can spread and
become the dominant ground cover [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Ten to thirty years after fire,
mountain fern moss will replace the early successional mosses and
liverworts.  In mesic, high-nutrient habitats, mountain fern moss
generally appears 30 to 50 years after fire and quickly becomes the most
abundant ground cover [<a href="#17">17</a>].  However, in Finland, mountain fern moss
began appearing 10 years after fire.  Recovery was slow and 50 years
after fire, this moss still had not reached preburn levels [<a href="#1">1</a>].
