<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Prairie sandreed is a climax species indicative of sandy, well-drained
soils, usually on upland sites in mixed-grass or tallgrass prairie.  It
is a dominant in sandhills of the tallgrass prairie where it is commonly
found with needle-and-thread (Stipa comata), prairie junegrass (Koleria
cristata), sand bluestem (Andropogon gerardii var. paucipilus), sand
dropseed (Sporobolus cryptandrus), and sideoats grama (Bouteloua
curtipendula) [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  Prairie sandreed is also listed as a
dominant understory species in cottonwood woodlands of the Little
Missouri National Grassland and in mountain-mohagany (Cercocarpus
montanus) shrublands of the Black Hills in South Dakota [<a href="#25">25</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Prairie sandreed is one of the most important forage grasses of
sandhills, where it produces stable and uniformly high amounts of forage
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  It cures well on the ground, providing an important source of
winter feed for cattle [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  It is sometimes cut for hay, which is
of acceptable quality if not cut too late in the season.  It is grazed
primarily in late summer through winter, as other grasses it is
associated with are more palatable earlier [<a href="#41">41</a>].  On sagebrush rangeland
in southeastern Montana, prairie sandreed comprised up to 40 percent of
the diet of sheep [<a href="#2">2</a>].  On good-condition ranges in the sandhills of
Nebraska, stands composed of 30 percent prairie sandreed and 10 percent
each of sand bluestem, needle-and-thread, blue grama (Bouteloua
gracilis), and hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsuta) can produce 1,600 to
3,000 pounds per acre (1,793-3,363 kg/ha) of air dry herbage [<a href="#38">38</a>].  In
Wyoming, sandy range sites composed of 35 percent prairie sandreed, 25
percent sand bluestem, and 15 percent needle-and-thread and receiving 10
to 14 inches (25-35 cm) mean annual precipitation commonly produce the
same amount of air dry herbage.


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Prairie sandreed is a coarse and stemmy grass.  Its palatability is fair
to good for cattle from late summer through winter [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Cattle, sheep,
and horses eat it readily [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Its forage usability is generally
considered to be fair from early spring through late spring, poor in
summer and fall, and fair in winter [<a href="#25">25</a>].

The palatability of prairie sandreed to livestock and wildlife species
in several western states has been rated as follows [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>]:

.NS

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The nutritional value of prairie sandreed is lower than that of other
grass species it is commonly found with [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  Its highest nutritional
value is in the spring, but it is generally not utilized by cattle then
as other grass species are preferred.  Although analysis shows that
crude protein levels drop significantly with maturity, the dry matter
digestibility remains relatively high, making prairie sandreed a fair to
good winter forage [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Prairie sandreed's protein value is rated
as poor, and its energy value is rated as fair [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Seasonal trends in the nutritive content of prairie sandreed in Nebraska
are listed below [<a href="#9">9</a>]:

Date                    5/31      7/12      8/23      11/1

% crude protein          11        5.3       3.6       1
% dry matter digest      65        53        45.5      38.5
% lignin                 3.6       5.5       6.7       7.0


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Since prairie sandreed is generally not grazed by cattle during the
spring and early summer, it retains its vegetative structure and is used
as cover by smaller wildlife species.  On upland sites, it may be used
heavily for nesting cover by dabbling ducks during the breeding season.
In an Alberta study, 67 percent of all dabbling duck nests found in the
study area were located in prairie sandreed stands [<a href="#28">28</a>].  The degree to
which prairie sandreed provides environmental protection during one or
more seasons for other wildlife species has been rated as follows [<a href="#13">13</a>]:

                      MT        ND

Pronghorn            ----      Fair

Small nongame birds  Fair      Good
Upland game birds    Good      Good
Waterfowl            ----      Fair


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Prairie sandreed has excellent sand-binding properties
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Its vigorous rhizomes and adaptability to
sandblown environments allow it to quickly produce cover on disturbed,
sandy sites.  In Nebraska, prairie sandreed was the most effective of
eight plant species studied at stabilizing windblown sand [<a href="#32">32</a>].  The
application of prairie hay mulch with a large number of prairie sandreed
seeds or any mulch underseeded with prairie sandreed and placed over
windblown sand is recomended for revegetating these disturbances [<a href="#32">32</a>].
For large windblown disturbances, small strategic areas can be hay
mulched and underseeded with prairie sandreed, and the remaining area
planted to a cover crop [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Prairie sandreed may also be sprigged in
sand dunes and blowouts to improve stand establishment, but its
effectiveness may be limited [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Spring is the best time for seeding.

'Goshen' and 'ND-95' are the only commercially available cultivars [<a href="#25">25</a>].
'Goshen' originates from Wyoming and is adapted for portions of Wyoming,
Montana, the western Dakotas, and Nebraska [<a href="#50">50</a>].  'ND-95' originates
from southwestern North Dakota.  On four different sites in Minnesota,
North Dakota, and South Dakota, 'ND-95' consistently averaged higher
yields than 'Goshen' [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Seeding problems may arise, however, due to
an inadequate seed supply of possibly low-quality seed [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Stands
tend to develop slowly and may require 3 years or longer to become fully
developed [<a href="#50">50</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Prairie sandreed generally has good grazing tolerance but may be killed
by prolonged overgrazing.  It is considered an increaser when associated
with bluestems (Andropogon spp) and a decreaser when associated with
bluegrasses (Poa spp.) [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Four years after the cessation of
intensive cattle grazing in Nebraska, prairie sandreed showed no
significant changes in biomass, while sand bluestem, little bluestem
(Schizachyrium scoparium), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) all
increased.  Rangeland or seeded stands should be managed by moderate
continuous or rotation grazing in summer or yearlong.  Poor stands or
range condition may be improved by winter grazing or deferred rotation
grazing [<a href="#50">50</a>].
              
Prairie sandreed is recomended in warm-season grass mixtures for seeding
on sandy-textured soil sites, where it establishes fairly easily.  In
some areas it is seeded in mixtures which approximate the climax
composition, while in others it is seeded alone for management of harsh
sandy sites.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Calamovilfa longifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Prairie sandreed is a drought-resistant, native, long-lived, warm-season
perennial grass that grows 2 to 6 feet (0.6-1.8 m) tall.  It is sod
forming and has stout, scaly, creeping rhizomes [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  Rhizomes
are tough and wiry, 0.08 inch (2-3 mm) in diameter, abundantly branched,
and lie 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm) beneath the soil surface.  Rhizome
lengths vary from 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 1 foot (31 cm) [<a href="#36">36</a>].  They are
covered by long scaley leaves and tipped by sharply pointed bud scales.
The roots descend mostly vertically and arise from the coarse rhizomes.
Where plants have been subjected to shifting sand, roots and rhizomes
may be intermixed in dense mats to a depth of 2 to 3 feet (0.6-.9 m)
[<a href="#52">52</a>].  Roots have been described as "wiry", with diameters ranging from
0.03 inch (0.8 mm) to 0.3 inches (8 mm) [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Root depths vary
greatly, but the species is generally considered to be deep rooted.  In
Saskatchewan, maximum root depth was noted at 4.5 to 6.0 feet (1.4-1.8
m), with the deepest rooted plants occurring in sandy soil [<a href="#12">12</a>]; in
Nebraska, root depths were from 4 to 10 feet (1.2-3.0 m) [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Although prairie sandreed uses both sexual and vegetative means of
repdroduction throughout its range, vegetative reproduction is most
prevalent.  Tolstead [<a href="#46">46</a>] reported that prairie sandreed propagates
almost entirely from rhizomes.  He noted that one to five new rhizomes
developed per culm during May and June.  These remained dormant until
the following spring when a single culm and new roots developed from
each.  Flowering occurred from July to September, but seed formation was
confined to plants growing in disturbed sites where moisture was more
abundant.  For seeds that do develop, germination probably occurs the
following spring.  This delayed germination is due to the need for cold
temperatures for good germination percentages.  Tolstead [<a href="#45">45</a>] noted that
86 percent of prairie sandreed seeds germinated within 4 days after a
4-month cold storage treatment in moist sand, but after 20 days only
17.6 percent of seeds stored indoors at 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 deg C)
germinated.  Cold-sratification, however, can be much shorter;
germination occurring within 28 days after a 2-week prechilling period
has been reported [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Seedling vigor appears to be only fair [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Prairie sandreed most commonly occurs on sandy-textured soils on upland
sites in the plains grasslands and prairies east of the Rocky Mountains
[<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Sandy-textured soil appears to be the most important
factor determining the importance of this species in the plant
commmunity.  Prairie sandreed is very drought-resistant.  It is
intolerant of spring flooding and high water tables, and only slightly
tolerant of acidic or alkaline soils [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Although this grass is
common on sandhills and sand prairies where it is evenly distributed and
often a dominant species, it is also locally common on deep,
medium-textured soils on overflow, silty, and limpy upland sites
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  On these soils, it is often found in nearly pure stands with
distinct boundaries between prairie sandreed colonies and the
surrounding vegetation.  The soil under these pure stands has a higher
water infiltration rate than the soil under the surrounding vegetation
[<a href="#1">1</a>].  Prairie sandreed, with its vigorous growth form and large amounts
of standing dead material and litter, apparently intercepts the rain
more efficiently than the smaller surrounding vegetation.  Prairie
sandreed is only occasionally found on clay soil or loess [<a href="#43">43</a>].  In
Nebraska, prairie sandreed is found primarily on rolling sandhills where
its growth is evenly distributed in the vegetation stand, but on finer
textured soils it tends to grow in large open clumps [<a href="#41">41</a>].  In western
North Dakota, prairie sandreed is found as a dominant species on
uniformly sandy soils with the sand content reaching depths of 5 to 6
feet (1.5-1.8 m) [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Although prairie sandreed occurs over a wide variety of precipitation
zones, its optimal performance is in the 16- to 20-inch (44-54 cm) mean
annual precipitation zone [<a href="#50">50</a>].  In Montana, prairie sandreed occurs
primarily in areas receiving 10 to 14 inches (25-35 cm) mean annual
precipitation [<a href="#35">35</a>].  At the other extreme, in Nebraska prairie sandreed
occurs in areas receiving 24 inches (61 cm) mean annual precipitation
[<a href="#38">38</a>].  It is evident that prairie sandreed occurs in higher mean annual
precipitation zones than 24 inches, especially in the eastern portion of
its range, but it is probably restricted to sites with sandy soil
texture.  The Nebraska site was on choppy sandhills, where the deep,
loose, fine, sandy soil structure allowed for rapid internal drainage.
This loose, "droughty" soil type seems to be more influential in prairie
sandreed's distribution than is precipitation.  This is supported by
Barnes and Harrison [<a href="#5">5</a>], who observed that prairie sandreed experiences
greater water stress on finer textured soils than on dune sands.
Prairie sandreed is a deep-rooted grass and can utilize the water stored
in the deep sands due to percolation.  On finer textured soils,
shallow-rooted species effectively extract the surface-stored moisture,
leaving little for the deeper rooted grasses.  Prairie sandreed cannot
effectively compete with shallow-rooted plants on this soil type.

In the Great Plains, prairie sandreed is common up to 2,000 feet (610 m)
in elevation, and in Rocky Mountain river valleys, it occurs up to about
6,000 feet (1,829 m) [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Prairie sandreed probably becomes less
common above 6,000 feet (1,829 m).  Elevational ranges for some western
states are as follows [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>]:

from 3,500 to 9,800 feet (1,067-2,987 m) in CO
     4,800 to 5,300 feet (1,463-1,615 m) in MT
      750 to 2,900 feet (229-884 m) in ND
     3,800 to 7,800 feet (1,158-2,377 m) in WY


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Climax Species

Prairie sandreed is considered a climax or late seral species when found
on dry upland prairie and plains grassland sites.  It is an indicator of
climax vegetation types on sandy soils, where it often obtains dominance
or codominance.  Although it has effective sand-binding properties, it
is slow in invading sand blowouts, and follows grasses such as sand
bluestem, blowout grass (Redfieldia flexuosa), and muhly (Mulenbergia
spp.) [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Its drought tolerance allows it to replace bluestems in the
Nebraska Sandhills during extended drought periods [<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Prairie sandreed is a warm-season grass that generally begins rapid
growth in the late spring.  A fair amount of growth occurs in the
summer, and only a small amount in the fall.  In South Dakota prairie
sandreed was observed to begin leaf growth in mid-May and attain a
maximum leaf height of 17.5 inches (44.5 cm) by late July [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Plants
remain green until frost occurs [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Flowering occurs from June
to August in Montana; from July to September in Nebraska and North
Dakota; and from August to September in Wyoming [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].

The timing of different phenological stages of two prairie sandreed
cultivars (number of days after June 15 to reach a phenological stage)
follows [<a href="#34">34</a>]:

                           Phenological Stage

      'Goshen'      29   50   54   57   115  121

Phenological stages:
  1.  First emergence of inflorescence, 10 culms or more
  2.  First anthesis, 10 culms or more
  3.  Fifty percent emergence of the inflorescence
  4.  Fifty percent anthesis
  5.  First seed mature
  6.  Fifty percent seed mature

 
Both cultivars reached 50 percent seed maturity by mid-October.

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Calamovilfa longifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Prairie sandreed is considered to be fire tolerant when dormant.  Plants
probably reestablish after fire via the initiation of new growth from
rhizomes.  A limited amount of research has been conducted concerning
the influence of fire on prairie sandreed.  Research results on postburn
frequencies are contradictory at best.  Recovery rates after fire appear
to be influenced by season of the burn, associated plant species, and
mean annual precipitation.  Spring burning in the tallgrass prairie of
eastern North Dakota increased prairie sandreed's frequency by more than
100 percent compared with unburned plots [<a href="#29">29</a>], while in the mixed
prairie of western North Dakota spring burning slightly reduced prairie
sandreed's frequency and fall burning significantly reduced its
frequency [<a href="#31">31</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire kills aboveground parts of prairie sandreed, but the rhizomes
probably survive most fires.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Prairie sandreed starts growth earlier in the spring following a fire.
After an October lightning fire in Nebraska, prairie sandreed's growth
rate increased the following spring, but the rate slowed so that by
August it was equal to that of the unburned area [<a href="#33">33</a>]. 

The effect of fire on frequency of prairie sandreed appears variable.
After spring fires, some researchers have found it to increase in
frequency, while others have found it to decrease in frequency.  In
Alberta, prairie sandreed increased greatly in canopy cover and
frequency following 25 years of annual early spring burning (burning
conducted soon after snowmelt) [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Here percentage seedhead presence
was much higher on burned versus unburned areas.  Whether reproduction
by seeds increased is not known, but fire removed litter buildup and
exposed mineral soil, creating a more faborable seedbed.  Burning also
reduced prairie sandreed's blade length [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Two and one-half months
after a spring burn in western North Dakota, prairie sandreed was
slightly reduced in frequency compared with the unburned plots [<a href="#15">15</a>].
Four years after an August 14 fire in this same area, frequency of
pairie sandreed was stilly reduced significantly.  However, after a
spring fire in eastern North Dakota, frequency of prairie sandreed was
increased by more than 100 percent [<a href="#29">29</a>].  After a spring wildfire in
Nebraska, prairie sandreed increased by 11 percent on south-facing
slopes but decreased by 8 percent on hilltops and north-facing slopes
[<a href="#7">7</a>]; the decrease was attributed to competition from associated species.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Summer or fall burning is harmful to prairie sandreed, causing a
decrease in frequency and phytomass.  The response to spring burning is
less clear.  Spring burning appears to be beneficial or only slightly
detrimental.  Prairie sandreed occurs in both tallgrass and mixed-grass
prairie regions.  In the tallgrass prairie, fire seems to favor the tall
warm-season grasses, and prairie sandreed probably benefits from spring
burning [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  In the mixed-grass prairie, prairie sandreed may or may
not benefit from spring burning [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>]. 

Fire may also affect plant-water relationships of prairie sandreed.
Since prairie sandreed is usually found on sandy soil, virtually all the
water percolates into the soil regardless of litter buildup.  The
removal of litter due to fire may lead to increased evapotranspiration
rates, leading to increased water stress [<a href="#33">33</a>].
