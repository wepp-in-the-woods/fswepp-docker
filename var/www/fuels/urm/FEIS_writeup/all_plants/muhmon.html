<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
In Arizona mountain muhly is an important range species with high
forage value for cattle [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>]; it is most valuable for grazing
during the summer rainy period, when it is growing [<a href="#6">6</a>].

On ponderosa pine/bunchgrass ranges in northern Arizona, mountain muhly
was the third most utilized grass in a study of relative cattle
preference for various forage species.  Mountain muhly was grazed 31
percent; only Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratense) and Arizona fescue
(Festuca arizonica) were more heavily grazed [<a href="#14">14</a>].

In Colorado mountain muhly is an important forage species in ponderosa
pine forests [<a href="#38">38</a>].  In the eastern Intermountain West, mountain muhly
provides considerable forage for cattle [<a href="#16">16</a>].

In central Colorado cattle preference for forage species was measured
on ponderosa pine/bunchgrass range during the spring-summer-fall grazing
season.  Mountain muhly percent of dried rumen samples was [<a href="#17">17</a>]:

            May     June     July     Aug.     Sept.     Nov.

Percent     3.5     2.7      0.0      0.8      3.9       10.5   

In Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, mountain muhly was a
principal winter elk food in xeric grasslands, in ponderosa pine-shrub
habitats, and in big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) areas [<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
In Arizona mountain muhly is a valuable forage plant because of its
abundance rather than because of high palatablility.  It is grazed most
readily when the plants are actively growing [<a href="#44">44</a>].

In Colorado mountain muhly is one of the more palatable bunchgrasses
for cattle.  However, it becomes less palatable as it matures [<a href="#38">38</a>]
unless fully grazed throughout the growing season [<a href="#82">82</a>].

In Colorado, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming, mountain muhly forage
palatablility has been rated good for cattle and horses and fair to good
for sheep [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Mountain muhly energy value is rated good.  Its protein value is rated
poor [<a href="#23">23</a>].  

In Colorado and Utah, mountain muhly food values were listed as good for
elk, fair for mule deer, small mammals, and small nongame birds, and
poor for pronghorn and waterfowl [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Mountain muhly nutrition and digestibility have been described for
Arizona ponderosa pine/bunchgrass range.  Mountain muhly nutritional
components and digestibility when growing in the open and under a timber
overstory were as follows [<a href="#14">14</a>]:

                                 Open     Timbered
 
     Nutritional Components (%)

              Crude Protein       6.8       6.1
              Phosphorus          0.20      0.18
              Ash                 8.4       8.0

     Digestibility (%)           50.9      47.6

Mountain muhly percent digestible dry matter at the beginning of each
month was as follows [<a href="#64">64</a>]:

                                  Digestible Dry Matter (%)

            June                            47
            July                            49
            August                          55
            September (beginning)           52
            September (middle)              55  


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
In Utah the cover value of mountain muhly for wildlife has been rated
as good for small mammals, fair for upland game birds and small nongame
birds, and poor for waterfowl [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Mountain muhly has potential for use in land reclamation [<a href="#82">82</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Response to disturbance - Mountain muhly is a decreaser in response to
trampling and heavy grazing [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  In Rocky Mountain National
Park mountain muhly had significantly less cover at the edge
of hiking trails than in the forest interior, where it was not heavily
disturbed [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Mountain muhly is considered a key indicator of range
condition in Cochise County, Arizona.  Allowable stubble heights and
volume removal to maintain satisfactory range condition are given [<a href="#20">20</a>].
On Arizona [<a href="#14">14</a>] and Colorado [<a href="#45">45</a>] ponderosa pine/bunchgrass ranges,
overgrazing causes mountain muhly to decline and be replaced by
sod-forming grasses.  In Zion National Park, Utah, mountain muhly was
quite rare on a grazed plateau and was restricted to the southern third
of the plateau where grazing pressure had been lightest due to earlier
fencing.  It was a common component of the surface vegetation on nearby
isolated, ungrazed mesas [<a href="#53">53</a>].

In a northern Arizona study of exclosures established in 1912 and
monitored until 1942, mountain muhly showed greatest increase on
unshaded, ungrazed quadrats.  On excessively grazed ranges, openings
between trees completely lacked mountain muhly.  Where scattered trees
provided some protection against grazing, mountain muhly occurred as
isolated "islands" [<a href="#6">6</a>].  In central Colorado ponderosa pine/bunchgrass
ranges, mountain muhly formed an increasingly larger percentage of grass
cover as the intensity of grazing use was reduced.  It varied from an
average of 20 percent of composition on heavily grazed areas to 45
percent on those not grazed.  Ungrazed plants produced 10 to 12 times
more seedstalks than plants that were heavily grazed [<a href="#45">45</a>].

On central Colorado ponderosa pine/bunchgrass range, grazing impacts
were monitored from 1940 until 1957.  Of the perennial grasses on the
experimental sites, mountain muhly was the most important forage
producer.  It remained widely distributed regardless of rates of
grazing, but cover was affected by grazing level.  In grassland cover
types, mountain muhly cover increased more than 50 percent between 1940
and 1957 on lightly utilized areas; it decreased about 35 percent under
moderate use; and 63 percent under heavy use.  Its density was greatest
inside grassland exclosures protected since 1940 [<a href="#76">76</a>].

In a Colorado study morphological differences between long-term grazed
and ungrazed mountain muhly largely disappeared within the first growing
season following cessation of grazing [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  However, on central
Colorado ponderosa pine/bunchgrass ranges, mountain muhly which had been
grazed at 70 percent for at least 7 years took 3 years for leaf lengths
and number and height of flowerstalks to recover after protection from
grazing [<a href="#76">76</a>].

In central Colorado mountain muhly makes its main growth later than
Arizona fescue, little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), and sun sedge
(Carex heliophila), and is grazed later.  On Arizona ponderosa
pine/bunchgrass ranges, mountain muhly receives heavier use than Arizona
fescue later in the growing season [<a href="#76">76</a>].

Mountain muhly on depleted ponderosa pine/bunchgrass ranges in central
Colorado increased significantly (p<.01) when fertilized with 50
pounds (22.7 kg) each of elemental nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium
per acre during May 1968.  Dry weight yields increased under all grazing
levels [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Effects on tree regeneration - In central Arizona mountain muhly
competed with ponderosa pine seedlings for water.  Mountain muhly roots
grew faster than seedling ponderosa pine roots; mountain muhly was more
drought tolerant than ponderosa pine seedlings.  During rain following
spring drought, mountain muhly roots took up water faster and more
completely and depleted soil moisture to lower levels than did ponderosa
pine roots.  Established ponderosa pines were able to tolerate
competition for moisture by mountain muhly [<a href="#50">50</a>].

In the Southwest herbicides have been used to reduce grass competition
with ponderosa pine seedlings.  Ponderosa pine survival 1 year after
planting on a site occupied by mountain muhly and Arizona fescue was
greater than 94 percent when the grasses were killed with dalapon.  The
success was probably enhanced by the dead grasses serving as mulch [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Extracts of mountain muhly green foliage and dead residues reduced
germination and growth of ponderosa pine [<a href="#71">71</a>] and yellow sweetclover
(Melilotus officinalis) [<a href="#72">72</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Muhlenbergia montana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Mountain muhly is a native, perennial, warm-season bunchgrass [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].
Culms are branched at the base [<a href="#82">82</a>] and densely tufted [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>]; they are
usually erect and 4 to 32 inches (10-80 cm) tall [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].  Leaves
are mostly basal and densely clustered; there are also some culm leaves
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].  Leaf blades are 2 to 10 inches (5-25 cm) long [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].
Leaf sheaths become papery and loose from the culm [<a href="#38">38</a>] and are
persistent, often becoming flattened with age [<a href="#82">82</a>].  The inflorescence
is a narrow, oblong, erect or nodding panicle 2 to 6 inches (5-15 cm)
long [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>]; the branches are 0.4 to 3.5 inches (1-9 cm) long, and
erect to moderately spreading [<a href="#82">82</a>].  Spikelets are one flowered [<a href="#16">16</a>].
Lemma awns are 0.24 to 0.79 inch (6-20 mm) long [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  The fruit
is a caryopsis [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Mountain muhly has fibrous roots [<a href="#10">10</a>].  In a variety of soils, 15
percent of mountain muhly roots were in the first 3 feet (.91 m) of
soil, and 58 percent were in the first 6 feet (1.83 m).  The deepest
roots were 9 feet deep (2.74 m) [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Mountain muhly reproduces by seed [<a href="#16">16</a>].  It can also reproduce
vegetatively by tillering, and sometimes spreads slowly by this method
[<a href="#80">80</a>].

On western Colorado ponderosa pine ranges, mountain muhly seedstalk
production is abundant in normal growing seasons [<a href="#15">15</a>].

In central Arizona mountain muhly sometimes retains its seeds into the
winter months [<a href="#80">80</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Mountain muhly is found in dry to moist sites [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>], but it requires
excellent drainage [<a href="#40">40</a>].  It is found in grassy parklands, on slopes and
foothills [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>], on rocky, dry hillsides [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>], and in
canyons and on mesas [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  In Arizona it is the principal grass
on dry forested ranges between meadows [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Mountain muhly usually occurs on coarse to loamy soils, although it
sometimes occurs on clays.  In Arizona mountain muhly grows on stony
clayey loam [<a href="#4">4</a>], sandy loam developed from basaltic parent material
[<a href="#27">27</a>], gravelly loam with a broken surface of volcanic rock, gravelly
sandy loams of both limestone and sandstone origin, and red clay [<a href="#6">6</a>].
In California mountain muhly grows on granitic rock outcrops [<a href="#40">40</a>].  In
Colorado mountain muhly grows on gravelly sandy loam, stony loam
developed from limestone, fine loose sand from disintegrating sandstone,
[<a href="#10">10</a>], and infertile, coarse-textured soil with little profile
development [<a href="#33">33</a>].  In Utah mountain muhly grows on basaltic stony loams
[<a href="#63">63</a>].  Mountain muhly grows poorly on acidic and saline soils [<a href="#23">23</a>].

In central Arizona mountain muhly grows where precipitation occurs
mainly during winter and late summer [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Annual maximum precipitation
occurs from July through September; a secondary period occurs from
December through March.  Fall and late spring months are usually arid
[<a href="#20">20</a>].  Annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 25 inches (430-640 mm).
In Colorado about two-thirds of the annual precipitation, which averages
15.9 inches (404 mm), falls during the April through September growing
season [<a href="#33">33</a>].

Mountain muhly is reported at the following elevations:

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Mountain muhly occurs in seral and climax communities.  On ponderosa
pine/bunchgrass ranges of the central Rocky Mountains, the Arizona
fescue-mountain muhly stage is seral to ponderosa pine-fir forest [<a href="#18">18</a>].
In ponderosa pine/bunchgrass forests of Arizona and New Mexico, mountain
muhly declines in the successional sequence that follows complete fire
suppression [<a href="#58">58</a>].

Mountain muhly grows best in full sun [<a href="#40">40</a>].  In northern Arizona
mountain muhly declines as shade from ponderosa pine increases [<a href="#6">6</a>].  In
central Colorado mountain muhly declines with litter accumulation and
increased shading by young trees [<a href="#33">33</a>].

In parklike stands and openings in ponderosa pine forests of Arizona,
mountain muhly and other bunchgrasses develop into dense, exclusive
communities that resist penetration by other species, including
ponderosa pine [<a href="#71">71</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Mountain muhly grows during the spring and summer months [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Mountain
muhly becomes semidormant if there is midsummer drought [<a href="#64">64</a>].  In
northern Arizona the start of mountain muhly growth is related to the
time of spring thaw, which begins when maximum air temperatures attain
50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 deg C).  This temperature is usually achieved
about the beginning of March [<a href="#65">65</a>].

On northern Arizona ponderosa pine/bunchgrass range, mountain muhly was
measured during the snow-free months from 1963 through 1965.  Overwinter
green height of mountain muhly was less than 1.3 inches (3.3 cm).
Mountain muhly peak growth was during July and August; extent of growth
appeared to be closely related to precipitation during those months.
Mountain muhly ceased growing during September.  Phenological
development of mountain muhly was as follows [<a href="#65">65</a>]:

                        1963          1964          1965

Mountain muhly may sprout after aerial portions are burned.  It is
densely tufted [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>] and old sheath bases are persistent [<a href="#82">82</a>]; they
may protect basal buds from fire damage.  On the other hand, in hot dry
conditions the dead litter of a mountain muhly plant can produce a hot
fire which may damage or kill the plant [<a href="#81">81</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Mountain muhly culms and leaves are probably killed by fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Mountain muhly density generally decreases from prefire values during
the first few years after fire [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>], but it may increase over
original values thereafter [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Mountain muhly usually takes at least 3
years to fully recover from fire [<a href="#31">31</a>].  However, after prescribed fire
in central Arizona, mountain muhly had recovered prefire biomass within
10 months [<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
In central Arizona mountain muhly was sampled in September 1981, on
sites that previously had been prescribed burned in ponderosa pine pole
timber and mature stands.  Thinning treatments and grazing management
varied from site to site.  All burned sites were matched with similar,
unburned controls.  The following mountain muhly production (kg/ha)
means were reported [<a href="#4">4</a>]; standard errors are in parentheses:

                         Ponderosa Pine Pole Stands

                 2 yr burn         5 yr Burn         7 yr burn

* Indicates significant difference (p<.05) between burn and control.

In 2-year-old burns, mountain muhly production was less than on control
sites.  In 5- and 7-year-old burns, mountain muhly production was
greater than on control sites [<a href="#4">4</a>].

In central Arizona mountain muhly occurred on an area that was
prescribed burned October 18 and 19, 1977.  Mountain muhly density was
sampled before the fire, in 1974, and again after the fire, in 1980.
Backfires and short strip headfires were used; estimates of fuel
consumption ranged from 50 to 75 percent.  Most ponderosa pine
regeneration was not killed.  Mountain muhly density was 1.01 stems per
square meter in 1974.  In 1980, after the fire, stem density was zero
[<a href="#62">62</a>].

In central Arizona mountain muhly biomass and nutrient concentrations
were measured during the first growing season after burning on plots in
a ponderosa pine/Arizona fescue habitat type.  The stand had been
unburned since a fire in 1876.  The overstory consisted of uneven-aged
ponderosa pine distributed in even-aged groups of mature trees, poles,
or saplings.  Mountain muhly was dominant in the herbaceous vegetation
within openings.  Controlled burning occurred in November 1976.  The
fire consumed surface needles on 94 percent of the area, and exposed
mineral soil on 16 percent of the area.  Fuels less than 1 inch (2.54
cm) in diameter were reduced 63 percent.  Fuel reduction was greatest
under mature trees, where fuel loads were heaviest; it was intermediate
in pole stands, and least in sapling stands.  Mountain muhly standing
crop was sampled on 11 burned and 7 unburned plots during June and
September of postfire year 1.  Mountain muhly standing crop and measured
nutrient concentrations (% oven-dry weight) were as follows 7 months
after fire [<a href="#35">35</a>]:

By 10 months after fire, no significant differences in standing crop
were found between unburned and burned plots, and few significant
differences in nutrient concentrations persisted [<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Mountain muhly is a principal grass in some ponderosa pine/grass types
where recurring fires have maintained savanna.  In north-central
Arizona mountain muhly will usually carry surface fires in November,
and perhaps during the winter and spring [<a href="#11">11</a>].

In the Santa Catalina Mountains of Arizona, decades of fire protection
have resulted in many ponderosa pine stands with a dense undergrowth of
ponderosa pine saplings.  In the 1960's, an inventory of ponderosa pine
stands burned within the past few decades revealed that those burned by
lightning-caused fires, which occur at a relatively high frequency in
the range, were primarily open and parklike, with an herb layer
dominated by mountain muhly.  However, intensity of a major incendiary
fire was so severe that it killed all ponderosa pines in the stand and
enhanced development of oak (Quercus spp.) scrub, which shaded out
mountain muhly [<a href="#61">61</a>].

In ponderosa pine/bunchgrass forests in Arizona and New Mexico, fires
applied every decade to reduce fuel and thin tree seedlings will
maintain ponderosa pine/bunchgrass savanna [<a href="#58">58</a>].

White, A. S.; Cook, J. E.; Vose, J. M. 1991 [16885]


<b>SEASON/SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION : </b>
fall/moderate in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) sawtimber stands
fall/severe in ponderosa pine pole stands


<b>STUDY LOCATION : </b>
Prescribed fires were conducted at the Fort Valley Experimental Forest
near Flagstaff, Arizona.


<b>PREFIRE VEGETATIVE COMMUNITY : </b>
The ponderosa pine overstory occurred in three kinds of spatially
distinct patches.  Sawtimber patches had average dbh of 25 inches (63
cm) and density of 49 trees per acre (120 trees/ha).  There was a thick
accumulation of litter 12 to 20 inches (30-50 cm) beneath the canopies
of sawtimber trees; between canopies, openings received full sunlight
and had minimal litter accumulation.  Pole patches had average dbh of 6
inches (15 cm) and density of 700 trees per acre (1,730 trees/ha).
Sapling patches had average dbh of 1.8 inches (4.5 cm) and density of
4,075 trees per acre (10,070 trees/ha).  The groundlayer was heavily
shaded in sapling patches because of high tree density.  Understory
grasses were mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia montana), Fendler bluegrass
(Poa fendleriana), and bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides).
Shrubs included Fendler's ceanothus (Ceanothus fendleri) and Wood's rose
(Rosa woodsii var. ultramontana).


<b>TARGET SPECIES PHENOLOGICAL STATE : </b>
Not given.


<b>SITE DESCRIPTION : </b>
The study site is at 6,890 feet (2,100 m) elevation.  Soil is stony clay
loam.  Annual precipitation averages 19.7 inches (500 mm).  There is
pronounced drought in May and June, frequent rain in July and August,
and scattered snowfall and rain in winter.  Prior to prescribed burning,
the site was relatively undisturbed, with no evidence of grazing.  The
study area was fenced in 1982, prior to plot establishment, to prevent
future livestock grazing.


<b>FIRE DESCRIPTION : </b>
Fire history of the study area suggests that fires occurred at
approximately 2-year intervals until the late 1800's, after which fires
were excluded until the time of the study.  Ungrazed ponderosa pine
stands were prescribed burned on 2 consecutive days in late October
1982.  Mean air temperatures were 64 and 57 degrees Fahrenheit (18 and
14 deg C).  Relative humidity was 21 percent on both days.  Backfires
were used on sawtimber patches; both back- and headfires were used on
pole and sapling patches.  Fires were restricted to the understory and
little immediate damage to overstory trees was apparent.  Using
heat-yield data and observations, fire severity in the burned patches
was ranked:  below-canopy sawtimber sites > pole > sapling > open-canopy
sawtimber sites.  On below-canopy sawtimber sites, fires consumed 95
percent of the fuel load and smoldered for several days.  Fire behavior
was as follows:

                         Open-ST    Below-ST     Pole       Sapling

Intensity (kW/m)

<b>FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES : </b>
Mountain muhly was common on the experimental sites before and after the
prescribed fires.  From mid-September through October 1982, prior to
burning, mountain muhly cover was estimated on burn sites and control
sites in below-canopy sawtimber, open sawtimber, pole, and sapling
stands.  Postfire inventory was conducted from mid-October to
mid-November 1983, on all sites.  Mountain muhly cover and biomass on
control sites were similar in 1982 and 1983.  Mountain muhly average
percent cover was lower on burned sites in 1983 due to high mortality,
no increased growth of surviving plants, and almost no seedling
recruitment.  Mountain muhly biomass was significantly (p<.05) lower on
burned plots than on control plots on open sawtimber sites and on pole
sites; biomass analysis in below-canopy sites and sapling patches was
not possible.

Mountain muhly seedling recruitment was monitored under burned and
unburned conditions.  Seed rain was monitored for a full year after
burning.  Mountain muhly total seed rain for 1 year was 81 seeds per
square meter on burned open sawtimber sites and 27 seeds per square
meter on unburned open sawtimber sites.  There was no mountain muhly
seed rain in closed-canopy sawtimber, pole, or sapling stands.  No
mountain muhly seeds germinated in greenhouse tests of buried seed.  A
very few mountain muhly seedlings appeared on burned, open timber sites
(0.1 seedling/sq m), but none appeared at other burned sites.  It
appears that buried seed is not important in contributing new seedlings
after burning.

Mountain muhly flowering response was measured in ponderosa pine
sawtimber (closed-canopy and open-canopy combined) and pole patches.
Sapling patches were not measured.  Only plants that had occurred on the
sites prior to burning were monitored.  Mountain muhly failed to flower
the first year after burning on both the ponderosa pine sawtimber and
pole patches.  During the second year, no significant differences in
mountain muhly flowering existed between burned sawtimber and pole
patches and their controls.  The percentage of mountain muhly plants
producing seeds the second year was approximately the same in burned and
unburned areas.  Percent of mountain muhly plants that reached flowering
stage each year was as follows:

                           Plants Flowering (%)

                   Pole                     Sawtimber
            Burned     Unburned         Burned     Unburned

    1983      0*          38              0*           54
    1984     25           33             42            33

* Indicates significant difference (p<.05) between burned and unburned
    sites.   


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS : </b>
Mountain muhly cover and biomass decrease in response to fire, and
flowering is suppressed for 1 postfire year.

<b>CASE NAME : </b>
Fort Apache Indian Reservation, AZ/Prescr. Fire/Fuel,Timber & Forage Effects



<b>SEASON/SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION : </b>
spring/moderate


<b>STUDY LOCATION : </b>
Prescribed fires were carried out on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation
7 miles (11 km) east of McNary, Arizona.


<b>PREFIRE VEGETATIVE COMMUNITY : </b>
Prefire vegetation was in uneven-aged variable density ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa) stands with open grassy glades which included mountain
muhly (Muhlenbergia montana), with cover of about 70 percent, and
bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides). 


<b>TARGET SPECIES PHENOLOGICAL STATE : </b>
Not given.


<b>SITE DESCRIPTION : </b>
The study site is at an elevation of 7,400 feet (2,256 m).  The ground
is flat, and the soil is "rather heavy."  The area was selectively
logged in 1924. Grass density was low because of the relatively dense
trees.  Forage was similar on all plots.


<b>FIRE DESCRIPTION : </b>
There were six burned plots and six unburned control plots in a
ponderosa pine habitat type.  Three plots were burned September 30,
1950; another three were burned October 10, 1950.

Average fuel weights before burning (in tons per acre) were as follows:

                            Control     September      October
         Size of Fuel        Plots      Burn Plots    Burn Plots

*  Difference between September and October plots significant (p<.05).
** Difference between September and October plots significant (p<.01).

Small fuels included needles, dead grass, cones, and partly rotted wood.

Weather conditions were different on the 2 burning days, and the effects
of the fires were markedly different.  The September fire was conducted
from 10:00 a.m. to 3:40 p.m.  Air temperature was 59 to 67 degrees
Fahrenheit (15-19 deg C).  Relative humidity was 62 to 37 percent.  Fuel
moisture was 14.0 to 11.6 percent.  Wind velocity was 18 to 25 miles per
hour (29-40 km/hr).  A light shower fell during burning of two of the
three plots, and 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) rain fell after 6:00 pm, cooling
the site.

The October fire was conducted from 12:00 m. to 3:30 p.m.  Air
temperature was 73 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (23-24 deg C).  Relative
humidity was 19 to 17 percent.  Fuel moisture was 10.0 to 8.5 percent.
Wind velocity was 3 to 12 mph (5-19 km/hr).  Wind was variable and
gusty, causing spot blowups during burning.

The effect of the fires on surface fuel weight was as follows:

                           Percent Change

                 September Fire        October Fire

        Large        -63*                  -74*
        Medium       -62*                  +83* 
        Small        -48                   -51
        Total        -57                   -40

* Difference between September and October fires significant (p<.05).


Reduction of heavy fuel by the October fire was partially offset by an
increase in medium fuel.  Both fires raised the lower level of tree
crowns in sapling thickets and killed almost all trees less than 3 or 4
feet (0.9-1.2 m).


<b>FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES : </b>
Mountain muhly was reduced on all burned plots the first year after
burning, as were other grasses.  Two years later mountain muhly
comprised about 60 percent of total grass density, 10 percent less than
prefire levels. 


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS : </b>
Mountain muhly usually declines the first growing season after fire.  It
usually does not regain its former cover until at least 3 years after
fire.
