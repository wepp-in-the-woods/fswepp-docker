<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
Thinleaf alder is a member of a huge circumboreal complex distributed
throughout much of North America and Europe.  Subtle differences in
botanical characteristics exhibited across this plant's wide geographic
distribution have caused taxonomic disagreement.  Members of the taxon
are universally accepted as Alnus incana (L.) Moench, but disagreement
exists as to the proper classification below the species level.
Currently two classifications which differentiate members of this taxon
exist:

Alnus incana (L.) Moench - Circumboreal distribution
  ssp. incana - Old World plants
  ssp. rugosa (DuRoi) Clausen - New World plants
    var. rugosa - speckled alder - eastern U.S. and Canada 
    var. occidentalis (Dippel) Hitchcock - thinleaf alder - western U.S.
                                                            and Canada

<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Thinleaf alder is the most widely distributed alder in western North
America and is the most common alder of the Rocky Mountains, the Sierra
Nevada, and the east side of the Cascades [<a href="#53">53</a>].  It is found on a wide
variety of sites, from near sea level to nearly 10,000 feet (3,048 m) in
Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Thinleaf alder is found from
central Alaska and the Yukon Territory, southeast to western
Saskatchewan and British Columbia, and south throughout the Mountain
States to New Mexico and California [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Throughout much of
Saskatchewan, the ranges of thinleaf alder and speckled alder (Alnus
incana ssp. rugosa) overlap, with plants in this region exhibiting
intermediate botanical characteristics [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Thinleaf alder seldom
overlaps with red alder (Alnus rubra) habitat and probably never
overlaps with white alder (A. rhombifolia) [<a href="#25">25</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Thinleaf alder typically forms narrow bands along midelevation streams
and rivers, or around springs of moist mountain slopes [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].
Adjacent upland communities are typically dominated by coniferous
forests or big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].

Published classification schemes listing thinleaf alder as an indicator

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Alnus incana ssp. tenuifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Thinleaf alder is generally not used as a wood source because of its
small size.  It is occasionally used for firewood [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Cattle, sheep, and goats all eat thinleaf alder.  Varying degrees of use
have been reported, ranging from near zero to moderate.  In Montana,
livestock generally do not browse thinleaf alder [<a href="#18">18</a>].  But in the Blue
Mountains of Oregon, cattle use of thinleaf alder is considered to be
moderate [<a href="#47">47</a>].  Utilization by livestock seems to depend on stand
accessibility, stand density, and the palatability of other browse
species present.  In Montana, dense stands hinder access and are of
limited value for livestock [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Cattle tend to avoid thinleaf alder
stands found on the mucky soils associated with mountain springs [<a href="#31">31</a>].

The twigs and leaves of younger thinleaf alder plants are eaten by deer,
elk, and moose [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  Light to moderate use by elk was observed
primarily in summer and fall in portions of the Rocky Mountains [<a href="#60">60</a>].
Moderate use of thinleaf alder by moose occurred during late winter in
Montana [<a href="#29">29</a>].  It is a moderately important browse for Rocky Mountain
mule deer [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Muskrats, beavers, cottontails, and snowshoe hares all
eat alder (Alnus spp.) twigs and leaves [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Beavers eat the bark and
build dams and lodges with the stems [<a href="#53">53</a>].  Alder seeds, buds, and
catkins are eaten by redpolls, siskins, chickadees, and goldfinches and
are considered to be an important winter food source [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Thinleaf alder generally has a poor to fair palatability rating for
livestock [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  Cattle may use thinleaf alder more than sheep or
horses, as they frequent riparian habitats where plants grow [<a href="#53">53</a>].  In
Wyoming, thinleaf alder was found to be relatively unpalatable to big
game animals and was browsed very little, and thus was considered an
increaser [<a href="#3">3</a>].  In the Blue Mountains of Oregon, research showed that
thinleaf alder comprised 57 percent of available shrubs for browse in
the study area but made up only 47 percent of shrub use [<a href="#47">47</a>].

The relish and degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife species for
thinleaf alder in several western states is rated as follows [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>]:


                      CO    ID    MT    UT    WY

Upland game birds    ----  ----  ----  fair  good
Waterfowl            ----  ----  ----  fair  poor


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Thinleaf alder's energy value has been rated fair and its protein value
poor [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Thinleaf alder communities provide hiding and thermal cover for big game
animals such as white-tailed and mule deer [<a href="#17">17</a>] and often serve as travel
corridors for these and other big game animals [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Many bird species
use thinleaf alder communities for nesting and brood rearing [<a href="#28">28</a>].  When
thinleaf alder overhangs a streambank, plants provide cover and shade
for salmonids [<a href="#31">31</a>].

The degree to which thinleaf alder provides environmental protection
during one or more seasons for wildlife species is as follows [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>]:

                       CO    MT    UT    WY

Waterfowl             ----  ----  fair  poor


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Thinleaf alder is recommended for use in revegetating disturbed riparian
areas.  Since thinleaf alder is easy to establish on disturbed sites and
has a rapid growth rate, it can quickly stabilize disturbed streambanks
[<a href="#43">43</a>].  Plants can be established along streambanks from direct seeding,
container-grown seedlings, or bareroot stock [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>], but propagation
from stem cuttings is not recommended.  Once established, plants spread
well vegetatively and by natural seeding [<a href="#44">44</a>].

To obtain seed, proven cone collection and seed extraction procedures
should be followed [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  A closely related alder, Hazel alder (Alnus
incana ssp. rugosa), yielded 1 pound (0.45 kg) of seed per 2.5 gallons
(9.5 l) of cones [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Native Americans reportedly pounded the wood of thinleaf alder into a
powder to produce a red dye [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Streambanks anchored by thinleaf alder are stable and can withstand
relatively severe spring runoff [<a href="#31">31</a>].  However, overgrazing and
excessive trampling by livestock can seriously reduce thinleaf alder's
ability to maintain streambank stability during spring runoff and
flooding [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].

Thinleaf alder improves soil fertility through the addition of nitrogen
to the soil from nitrogen-fixing root nodules and a nitrogen-rich leaf
litter [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>]].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Alnus incana ssp. tenuifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Thinleaf alder is a deciduous multistemmed shrub or small tree which
tends to form thickets and may grow up to 40 feet (12 m) tall [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].
More typically, mature plants are 6 to 15 feet (2-5 m) tall, with 4 to 8
inch (10-20 cm) diameter trunks [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  The bark is thin, smooth,
and green-gray, grayish-brown, or reddish-brown [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  The leaves
are broadly elliptic or ovate-oblong, mostly 1 to 3 inches (3-7 cm)
long, dull green on both sides, with doubly dentate margins [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].
Male and female flowers occur on the same plant in catkins.  The
drooping staminate catkins are clustered at the end of a twig, each
about 1 to 4 inches (3-10 cm) long [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Clusters of three to nine
pistillate catkins (which develop into cones) are on short stout stalks.
Each catkin is about 0.4 to 0.6 inch (9-13 mm) long [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  The cones
remain on plants for about a year after seeds are shed, aiding in
identification during winter.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (microphanerophyte)
   Burned or Clipped State:  Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Thinleaf alder reproduces both sexually and vegetatively.  

Sexual Reproduction:  Male and female flowers of thinleaf alder occur in
catkins on the same plant.  The female catkins are small, 0.4 to 0.6
inch (9-13 mm) long, semiwoody, conelike, and wind pollinated.  The
fruit is a small, single-seeded nutlet, with narrow lateral wings which
aid in dispersal by wind and water [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Thinleaf alder produces
abundant seed which is dispersed during fall and winter [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  There
are about 675,000 cleaned air-dried seeds per pound (1,488,000/kg) [<a href="#50">50</a>].
Annual seedfall observations in Alaska showed that 3,305 seeds/m sq were
found in soil under thinleaf alder stands, but of these, only 745 were
viable [<a href="#59">59</a>].  In fact, seed viability can be quite low; as many as 95
percent of thinleaf alder seeds have been found empty [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  In Oregon
and Washington, female cones are often disfigured with disease, but the
effects on seed viability have not been reported [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Seeds require no
treatment or prechilling to break dormancy and can be expected to
germinate immediately after dispersal when conditions are favorable [<a href="#15">15</a>].
Seed of the closely related speckled alder has remained viable in
storage for up to 10 years when stored in sealed containers at 34 to 38
degrees F (1-3 C) [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Germination and seedling establishment seems
better on exposed mineral soils than on organic substances [<a href="#59">59</a>].

Vegetative Reproduction:  Thinleaf alder often occurs in dense thickets,
which reportedly result from underground rhizomes or suckers [<a href="#6">6</a>].
However thinleaf alder is a prolific seeder, and thickets could be
produced by natural seeding alone [<a href="#11">11</a>].  More recent studies suggest that
plants found in thickets are not clones [<a href="#51">51</a>].  However, sprouting of
exposed thinleaf alder roots in streams has been noted, and submerged
branches sometimes form adventitious roots [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  If plants are
damaged, sprouting can occur from the root collar or stump [<a href="#15">15</a>].  After
top-removal by beavers, plants have been observed to sprout heavily from
the cut [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Plants can also sprout from the root crown following fire
[<a href="#59">59</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Thinleaf alder seldom grows away from water and is typically confined
to rivers, moist stream borders, overflow channels, or moist mountain
springs or seeps and only occasionally occurs in broad floodplains
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  Most sites are seasonally flooded, and water tables normally
remain within 3 feet (1 m) of the ground surface [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Restricted
to high water tables, thinleaf alder communities often form continuous
narrow stringers immediately adjacent to perennial streams [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].
Thinleaf alder has a high flood tolerance and thus stabilizes
streambanks.  Quite shade tolerant, it is frequently found growing in
the understory of coniferous forests on moist sites [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].

Soils:  Thinleaf alder typically grows on poorly developed soils of
cobbles, gravels, or sands [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Soils usually remain moist
yearround due to high water tables.  As stands develop along moving
water, finer fluvial deposits are trapped, which eventually develop into
surface soil textures of loams to sandy loams overlying coarser
substrates [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Mountain springs and seeps in Oregon have
surface soils 6 to 20 inches (15-50 cm) deep, composed of organic mucks
or organic loams over a stony subsoil [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Soils under thinleaf alder are normally higher in available nitrogen
than adjacent communities, since thinleaf alder can fix between 41 and
349 pounds/acre (43-360 kg/ha) of nitrogen annually [<a href="#15">15</a>].  

Associates:  Thinleaf alder is commonly found with shrubs such as
re-dosier dogwood (Cornus serices), Hudson Bay currant (Ribes
hudsonianum), prickly currant (R. lacustre), woods rose (Rosa woodsii),
Douglas spirea (Spiraea douglasii), and common snowberry (Symphoricarpos
albus).  Common associated herbs include bullrush (Scirpus spp.), sedges
(Carex spp.), bluejoint reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis), timothy
(Phloem pratense), fowl bluegrass (Poa palustris), and Kentucky
bluegrass (Poa pratensis) [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  In the Great Basin, thinleaf
alder is most commonly associated with water birch (Betula occidentalis)
and willows (Salix spp.) [<a href="#33">33</a>].

Elevation:  Thinleaf alder is typically a low to middle elevation
species.  Elevational ranges for the following western states are
presented below [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>]: 

from 5,000 to 10,000 feet (1,524-3,048 m) in CO
     2,500 to 8,000 feet (762-2,438 m) in ID
     2,500 to 8,000 feet (762-2,438 m) in MT
     2,200 to 5,700 feet (671-1,737 m) in OR
     4,500 to 8,000 feet (1,372-2,438 m) in the Sierra Nevada Mtns.
     4,100 to 9,000 feet (1,250-2,745 m) in UT
     6,200 to 9,000 feet (1,890-2,745 m) in WY


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Thinleaf alder is an early seral species [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  Seasonal disturbances
from flooding provide suitable seedbeds for establishment of new plants.
Many thinleaf alder communities appear to be seral to cottonwood
(Populus spp.) and willow (Salix spp.) [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Both staminate and pistillate catkins of thinleaf alder are produced
during the gowing season prior to blooming and are exposed during the
winter.  Catkins then expand before the leaves emerge in the spring.
Flowering generally begins during March and April in the northwestern
United States [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Cones ripen in the fall, after which dispersal
occurs.  The empty cones remain on plants for about a year.  Leaves
remain green until they are dropped in the fall.  

The average dates of phenological events in Montana and Idaho are
presented below [<a href="#49">49</a>]:

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Alnus incana ssp. tenuifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Generally thinleaf alder has the ability to sprout from its root crown
following fire [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  Its numerous wind-dispersed seeds are also
important in revegetating areas following fire [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].

Fire tends to occur infrequently on the moist sites colonized by
thinleaf alder communities [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Nonflammable bark and nonresinous
leaves provide alders some protection from low intensity fires [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by wind; postfire years one and two
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by animals or water; postfire yr 1&2

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Alnus incana ssp. tenuifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>

Severe fires can completely remove organic soil layers, leaving alder
roots exposed and charred and thus eliminating basal sprouting.  Low
severity fires kill only aboveground plant parts [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Thinleaf alder often sprouts from its root crown following fire.
Several new sprouts may arise from each burned plant, thus increasing
stand density [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].

Off-site plants are important in revegetating burned areas through the
dispersal of numerous wind- and water-transported seeds.  Since thinleaf
alder disperses its seeds in the fall, favorable seedbeds created by
late summer fires are immediately colonized [<a href="#59">59</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Riparian areas in which thinleaf alder occurs can serve as natural fire
breaks [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].
