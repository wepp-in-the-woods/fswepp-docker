<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Cinquefoils (Potentilla spp.) are, in general, fairly high in tannic
acid and are not considered to be highly palatable to many wildlife
species [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Some cinquefoils are browsed when other more desirable
species are unavailable.  In some southeastern Oregon sagebrush
communities, mule deer prefer Newberry cinquefoil to silver sagebrush
(Artemisia cana) [<a href="#10">10</a>], and browse it in the winter, spring, and fall
[<a href="#9">9</a>].  The early growth of this cinquefoil is reported to be more
nutritious than the older silver sagebrush browse [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
General nutritional values for the genus Potentilla are as follows [<a href="#14">14</a>]:

          Cinquefoil, aerial part, fresh, immature

     Dry matter - %           100.0
     Ash - %                    8.1
     Crude fiber - %           11.3
     Ether extract - %          3.9
     N-free extract - %        54.6
     Protein (Nx6.25) - %      22.1
       Cattle-dig. protein - % 16.7
       Goats-dig. protein - %  17.2
       Horses-dig. protein - % 16.3

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>

<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In southeastern Oregon, Newberry cinquefoil increased in response to
unusually long periods of flooding at certain sites in silver sagebrush
communities.  Silver sagebrush, by contrast, declined at these sites
[<a href="#10">10</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Potentilla newberryi
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Newberry cinquefoil is a relatively short-lived, low and spreading
perennial or biennial herb [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  The plant is usually prostrate,
although occasionally ascending to erect, and has a grayish villous
appearance [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Newberry cinquefoil is simple or branched, and has
slender stems spreading outward from 0.3 to 1.6 feet (1-5 dm) in length
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  It seldom grows more than 1 feet (3 dm) in height [<a href="#6">6</a>].

This cinquefoil is generally quite leafy.  Leaflets are crowded and
often grow in groups of 7 to 15 (or more) [<a href="#6">6</a>].  These leaflets are
divided into a number of oblong, elliptic, linear, or spatulate segments
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].

Flowers of Newberry cinquefoil are usually freely branched and tend to
be numerous [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Petals range in color from a pale yellow or cream
to white [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  The small fragrant flowers (0.20 to 0.23 inch [5-6 mm]
in length) are often hidden by foliage.  Seeds are borne in small
achenes which are reticulate and brown in color at maturity [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Newberry cinquefoil grows from a taproot and has a nonrhizomatous crown
[<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Little documentation exists on the reproductive strategies of Newberry
cinquefoil.  Most species within the Potentilla genus produce an
abundance of small seed with good viability [<a href="#18">18</a>].  A number of
cinquefoils also reproduce vegetatively through rhizomes, adventitious
rooting, or other means.  Newberry cinquefoil, however, is not
rhizomatous [<a href="#6">6</a>], and vegetative reproduction in this species has not
been documented.

Flowers of Newberry cinquefoil are generally produced in abundance p15].
Flowers are reported to be very fragrant and insect pollination is
probably likely.  Seeds are probably dispersed by wind.  Germination
requirements and seedling growth characteristics have not been
determined for this species.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Newberry cinquefoil typically grows near dry lakes, vernal ponds,
lakeshores, and water holes [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Its site preferences suggest an
affinity for at least intermittently moist sites.  Newberry cinquefoil
also grows on sagebrush scrub in juniper woodlands [<a href="#13">13</a>] and on low
alkaline plains east of the Cascades [<a href="#15">15</a>].  In California its
elevational range is from 4,500 to 6,500 feet (1,373-1,983 m) [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
The successional status of Newberry cinquefoil has not been documented.
On some rather specific sites, a number of cinquefoils have been
described as climax dominants [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>], but on many other types of sites,
these plants are more often thought of as early to mid-seral species
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Flowering occurs from April through July throughout its range [<a href="#6">6</a>].  In
northern California, Newberry cinquefoil flowers from May to July [<a href="#13">13</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Potentilla newberryi

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Very little information exists on the potential adaptations of Newberry
cinquefoil to fire.  Response of individual species of cinquefoil
apparently differ, and it is difficult to make general conclusions
concerning the ways in which this highly variable genus responds to
fire.  Fire is probably rare or nonexistent at many of the more mesic
sites occupied by Newberry cinquefoil.  However, at some of the more
xeric sagebrush and juniper woodland sites, fire probably occurs at
least occasionally.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Potentilla newberryi
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Little has been reported on the effects of fire on Newberry cinquefoil,
and it is not known if this species is typically killed by fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Little is known about the way in which Newberry cinquefoil responds to
fire.  Vegetative regeneration has not been reported for this species.
Newberry cinquefoil grows from a nonrhizomatous crown [<a href="#6">6</a>], and
resprouting after fire is probably unlikely.  Cinquefoils typically
produce an abundance of small wind-dispersed seed [<a href="#18">18</a>], and
reestablishment through seed is probable.  Recovery time is unknown.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
