<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
The seeds of American beautyberry are an important food source for birds
and small mammals.  At least 10 species of birds feed on the fruit,
especially northern bobwhite.  The fruit is also eaten by raccoon,
opossum, and gray fox [<a href="#30">30</a>].

American beautyberry is considered one of the most desirable spring and
summer browse of white-tailed deer [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>]. Cattle occasionally browse on
the leaves of American beautyberry [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
American beautyberry is highly palatable to white-tailed deer [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Seasonal percent nutrient values for American beautyberry is as follows

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
American beautyberry provides environmental protection for a variety of
birds and small mammals along the coastal plains of the southeastern
United States [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
American beautyberry is one of the most prevalent woody competitors of
pines in southeastern United States [<a href="#2">2</a>].  A combination of tebuthiuron
application and burning is an effective management practice for
controlling American beautyberry [<a href="#21">21</a>].






</pre>

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Callicarpa americana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
American beautyberry is a large deciduous, bushy shrub.  It is prostrate
to erect and reaches heights of 3 to 12 feet (1.0-3.5 m).  The slender
stems are arched and the large leaves are opposite, with the smaller
leaves at the end of the twigs.  The short tubular flowers are borne
along the twigs at the base of the leaf axils. The fruit is a berrylike
drupe containing four small nutlets [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].



<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
American beautyberry is a prolific seed producer, and the literature
suggests that regeneration from seed is its primary mode of reproduction
[<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  The seed is dispersed by birds [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  It also regenerates
vegetatively by sprouting, although details have not been described.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
American beautyberry grows on a variety of sites in the Atlantic and
Gulf coastal plains of the southeastern United States.  It is mostly
restricted to climates with mild winters and long, hot, humid summers.
It grows best in clay or loamy soil but will also grow on sandy sites
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].




<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
American beautyberry is a moderately shade intolerant, early- to mid-seral 
species [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  In the longleaf pine/bluestem (Pinus palustris/Andropogon spp.) 
range in the Big Thicket region of eastern Texas, American beautyberry was an early 
invader of openings created by disturbance [<a href="#31">31</a>]. It was the only 
understory shrub present 19 years after timber harvest in a southern Arkansas 
pine-oak forest (density=546 plants/ha). Its density declined with succession, 
lowering to 28 plants/ha at postharvest year 75 [<a href="#38">38</a>].

<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
American beautyberry flowers between June and July; the fruit ripens
from August to November [<a href="#30">30</a>].






</pre>

<pre><center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Callicarpa americana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
American beautyberry probably survives fire by sprouting from the root
collar.  However, its primary mode of regeneration after fire is through
a seedbank [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tall shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)






</pre>

<pre><center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Callicarpa americana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Severe fires can kill American beautyberry by completely removing soil
organic layers and charring the roots [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Low-severity fires only
top-kill plants.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
American beautyberry increases the first growing season following fire
[<a href="#14">14</a>].  However, density will decline as the faster growing trees and
shrubs overtop it [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Twelve years of annual burning eliminated American beautyberry on a
Louisiana longleaf pine site [<a href="#11">11</a>].
