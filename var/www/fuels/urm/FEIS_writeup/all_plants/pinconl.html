The currently accepted scientific name of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is 
<i>Pinus contorta</i> Dougl. var. <i>latifolia</i> Engelm. (Pinaceae) [<a href="#126">126</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>,<a href="#163">163</a>,<a href="#169">169</a>,<a href="#188">188</a>,<a href="#205">205</a>,<a href="#297">297</a>,<a href="#308">308</a>].

<p><i>Pinus contorta</i> includes 4 distinctly different varieties that are interfertile. In 
addition to Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine, these are shore pine (<i>P. contorta</i> var. <i>contorta</i>), 
 Sierra lodgepole pine (<i>P. contorta</i> var. <i>murrayana</i>), and Bolander pine (<i>P. contorta </i>
var. <i>bolanderi</i>) [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>]. These varieties differ in 
tree longevity, dimensions, form, and branchiness; needle size and structure; 
cone form, density, orientation, persistence, and serotiny; the timing of 
reproductive events; seed size and germination behavior; resin composition; and 
parasites and predators [<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>]. Bolander pine is found only in limited areas of California [<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#188">188</a>]. 
The above mentioned varieties are referred to in this species summary by their 
full common names; &quot;lodgepole pine&quot; refers to the species as a whole.</p>


<p>Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine and jack pine (<i>P. banksiana</i>) are morphologically 
similar and hybridize where their ranges overlap in western Canada [<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#199">199</a>].</p>

Some plant associations in which Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine occurs as a 
dominant have been described as vulnerable (vulnerable to extinction because it 
is very rare or local throughout its range, found only in a restricted range, or 
because of other factors). Other Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine associations have 
been described as imperiled (vulnerable to extinction due to rarity or other 
factors) [<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#234">234</a>,<a href="#244">244</a>]. Two plant communities in which Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine 
occurs as a dominant have been classified as critically imperiled (due to 
extreme rarity or other factors making it especially vulnerable to extinction) 
in British Columbia. These are the Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine/Kruckeberg's 
sword fern-aspidotis (<i>Polystichum kruckebergii-Aspidotis densa</i>) 
association and the Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine/dwarf huckleberry-sphagnum (<i>Vaccinium 
caespitosum-Sphagnum</i> spp.) association [<a href="#82">82</a>].

<br />


Lodgepole pine is one of the most 
widely distributed tree species in western North America, extending from Alaska 
south to Mexico and east to South Dakota.  Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is 
distributed from interior Alaska 
and the Northwest Territories east to Saskatchewan and the Black Hills of South Dakota, and 
south to Colorado, central Utah, and eastern Oregon [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#188">188</a>,<a href="#258">258</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>]. 
Occurrence of Rocky Mountain Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is somewhat rare in Alaska and South 
Dakota [<a href="#188">188</a>]. The 
<a href="https://hua.huh.harvard.edu/FNA/">Flora of North America</a> 
provides a distributional map for Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine.

Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine occurs in 3 different ecological roles: 1) as a seral species to 
more shade tolerant tree species; 2) as a relatively stable codominant with 1 
or more other species (persistent); and 3) as the only tree layer dominant 
(persistent or climax) [<a href="#299">299</a>]. 
For more information on succession in Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine communities, 
see <a href="all.html#SUCCESSIONAL STATUS">Successional Status</a>. 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine grows with nearly all of the other mountain conifers 
in its range and often forms dense, nearly pure stands [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>]. Pure Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands  frequently 
result after repeated fires and where there is no seed source for other species [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>]. In pure stands of 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine, there 
is seldom an understory of reproduction, though in low-density stands there may 
be younger trees in the understory [<a href="#14">14</a>]. Mixed stands of Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine and other species are also common, 
especially stands of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine, Engelmann spruce (<i>Picea engelmannii</i>), and subalpine fir 
(<i>Abies lasiocarpa</i>) at higher elevations [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>], and stands of Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir 
(<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> var. <i>glauca</i>) at lower elevations. In mixed stands the overstory may be either pure 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine or may 
contain a mix of the above mentioned conifer species, 
with the more shade-tolerant climax species in the understory [<a href="#14">14</a>].<p>Understory in 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine varies with location, time since last disturbance, and site 
characteristics. In dense or climax Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands the understory cover 
is sparse with moderate diversity of species [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>]. On a lakeside Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine-black spruce (<i>Picea mariana</i>)/Schreber's moss (<i>Pleurozium 
schreberi</i>) series near Peace River, central British Columbia, Haeussler and others [<a href="#149">149</a>] found a significant negative 
correlation (p&lt;0.01, r&lt;-0.50) between Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stem volume<br>
((<font face="Times New Roman">&#960;</font><sup> -3</sup>)(basal diameter <sup>-2</sup>)<sup>2</sup>(tree 
height)) and species 
richness and diversity. Understory production also decreases as 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine canopy cover increases [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>].

<b><font face="Bell MT">Tree characteristics:</font></b> Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine grows 45 to 150 feet (13-45 m) 
tall [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#140">140</a>,<a href="#180">180</a>,<a href="#200">200</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#219">219</a>], 
with diameters exceeding 30 inches (76 cm) [<a href="#140">140</a>,<a href="#180">180</a>,<a href="#219">219</a>]. Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine often 
grows tall without reaching large diameters [<a href="#309">309</a>]; in 
Utah, trees only 5 inches (13 cm) in diameter at base are often 50 feet (15 m) tall [<a href="#180">180</a>].
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine grows rapidly where competition is limited, reaching 79 feet (24 m) tall 
and 16 inches (41 cm) in diameter in 50 to 60 years [<a href="#17">17</a>]. The average lifespan of 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine 
is 150 to 200 years [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#170">170</a>], though some Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine 
trees live more than 400 years [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#170">170</a>,<a href="#219">219</a>,<a href="#299">299</a>]. 

<p>Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine trees develop 
thin, narrow crowns 
[<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#180">180</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>] with a moderately low 
and open branch habit [<a href="#4">4</a>]. Lower branches self-prune in dense stands [<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>]; 
however, dead branches 
may persist on trees for several years [<a href="#217">217</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine has 
2 needles per fascicle (or rarely, 3) [<a href="#180">180</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#305">305</a>], 
with 2-inch (5 cm) long, moderately wide needles [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#180">180</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine 
bark is generally described as thin, scaly, and 
approximately 0.25 inch (0.6 cm) thick [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>]. However, recent data 
collected on bark thickness shows a range of approximately 0.5 to 12 inches 
(1-30 cm). Data are means [<a href="#231">231</a>].</p>

<p>The generally deep [<a href="#4">4</a>] root system of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is variable 
in form, depending primarily on soil type. A taproot is common, but so is 
profuse development of vertical sinkers from lateral roots [<a href="#195">195</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>]. The 
taproot is dominant during seedling and sapling development, but gradually 
becomes less important as trees mature and develop lateral root systems. 
Sinker roots develop near the base of the laterals and provide the major support 
thereafter [<a href="#195">195</a>,<a href="#245">245</a>]. Rooting depth of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is 
approximately 11 feet (3.3 m) [<a href="#94">94</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine may develop adventitious roots in response 
partial stem burial from flooding or other disturbance [<a href="#3">3</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine produces relatively few fine roots and 
relies heavily on mycorrhizal association for nutrient uptake [<a href="#309">309</a>]. Ectomycorrhizae enhance survivability of 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seedlings, increasing primary needles and root:shoot ratios [<a href="#223">223</a>].</p>

<p>Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine cones are hard and heavy, and may be reflexed, 
projecting, or semi-erect on branches. Semi-erect cones are most common in 
regions removed from the present zones of natural hybridization with jack pine, 
and may indicate intergrading with jack pine in the past [<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>]. Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine staminate cones are 0.3 to 0.4 inch (8-10 mm) long and 
ovulate cones are 1.2 to 2.4 inch (3-6 cm) long, ovoid, and slightly lopsided 
[<a href="#117">117</a>]. Cone size, shape, and <a href="../../../glossary.html#SEROTINOUS:">serotiny</a> 
are variable  within and among Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine populations [<a href="#309">309</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seeds are 0.15 
to 0.2 inch (4-5 mm) long with wings 0.3 to 0.6 inch (8-16 mm) long [<a href="#117">117</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Stand characteristics and variation:</b></font> Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine occurs as an even-aged, 
single-storied and sometimes overly 
dense forest  where favorable fire, seed, and climatic conditions once 
combined to produce a large number of seedlings at one time. Elsewhere it grows as multiaged, 
multistoried stands [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>]. Spacing of 
multiaged stands ranges from dense to open [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>]. Multistoried stands generally originate from either 
scattered trees that produced seed for subsequent stand development, or the 
gradual deterioration of old-growth stands resulting from wind, insects, and 
diseases [<a href="#14">14</a>]. Fire is also responsible for stand structure; Muir [<a href="#228">228</a>] found that within-stand age variability 
in tree ages was greatest after nonfire disturbances and lowest after stand-replacing fires. In extremely dense 
stands, Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine develops a whiplike form with little stem taper and only 
a sparse tuft of foliage in the upper crown. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine in moderately dense 
stands also has little taper, but relatively longer, narrow crowns. Open-grown 
trees have considerable taper, large branches and fully foliaged, conical crowns 
[<a href="#245">245</a>]. Densely stocked stands exhibit less branch 
development and greater height growth relative to diameter than open stands [<a href="#190">190</a>]. 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stand characteristics by density from 70-year-old stands 
in Alberta are presented below [<a href="#190">190</a>]:</p>

<p>Due to the widespread distribution of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine, developmental 
differences may exist according to geographic areas.  Local variations in Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine 
characteristics include 1) a high frequency of 3-needled fascicles in the Yukon 
Territory, and 2) a variable occurrence of thick bark, repeated stem forking, 
unusually fast juvenile growth, low incidence of serotinous cones, and high 
incidence of semi-erect cones in southern British Columbia [<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>]. On planting sites in Montana, 
Cole [<a href="#105">105</a>] found differences in 
height, diameter, and crown width of 12-year-old trees from British Columbia, 
Idaho, Montana, Utah, and Washington. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine from Idaho 
exhibited greater growth in all 3 parameters, while individuals from Utah had the 
least growth. However, few differences between Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine origins were 
statistically significant [<a href="#105">105</a>].&nbsp;A provenance study conducted in 
British Columbia found increased winter hardiness and tolerance of snow damage 
was associated with decreased growth potential from south to north and east to 
west, and from low to high elevation [<a href="#314">314</a>].</p>
<p>Botanical characteristics of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine may also vary based on different 
successional populations. In a study of seedlings grown under the same field 
conditions from seral, persistent, and climax source populations, seral 
population seedlings had the smallest total leaf area, photosynthetic potential, 
degree of root system subdivision, and total root length. Seedlings from the 
climax population had the greatest total leaf area, photosynthetic potential, 
root density, and root length. Seedlings from the persistent population reached 
the greatest heights but had reduced lateral root densities and total root 
lengths [<a href="#81">81</a>]. For further information on successional roles of Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine, see <a href="#SUCCESSIONAL STATUS">Successional Status</a>.</p>

Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine reproduces from seed [<a href="#12">12</a>], which may be borne in 
serotinous or nonserotinous cones. Individuals will have predominately open or 
closed cones [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#229">229</a>], and both cone types occur in single 
stands [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#230">230</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is 
likely to exhibit a higher degree of cone serotiny than the other varieties of 
lodgepole pine [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>], but nonserotinous or open cones may predominate in 
persistent or climax Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forests [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>]. If serotiny 
is expressed in these stands, cone polymorphism exists and allows Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine regeneration after nonfire disturbance [<a href="#6">6</a>].

<p>The degree of serotiny 
can affect the age distribution in the Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands. Seed from 
open-coned trees produces uneven-aged stands where seedlings establish 
over a period of years. Closed-cone trees generally produce even-aged stands, 
developing from the flush of seedlings that follows fire-induced seed release [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. The success of 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine regeneration 
following disturbance is strongly controlled by the persistence of a seed source 
and the size of the area disturbed [<a href="#299">299</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Breeding system:</font></b> 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is monoecious [<a href="#180">180</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>]. Seed cones are most often borne in the upper 
crown, but may also occur on leaders of secondary branches. Pollen cones occur 
most frequently on older, less dominant branches in the lower crown, although 
they may also be found on the smaller laterals of  branches bearing seed cones 
[<a href="#216">216</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>]. It is not uncommon to find a predominance of male or female cones on individual trees [<a href="#216">216</a>]. 
Separation of male and female cones within the crown 
is one important mechanism for preventing a high degree of self-fertilization in 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine. Also discouraging self-fertilization is a disjunction in the 
time of pollen release and receptivity on the same tree [<a href="#217">217</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Pollination:</b></font> 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is wind pollinated [<a href="#227">227</a>].</p>

Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine begins producing seed within 5 to 15 years of establishment [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#200">200</a>,<a href="#245">245</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>]. 
Trees with the serotinous genotype produce only 
open cones for up to 60 years, followed by a gradual transition to serotinous cones [<a href="#26">26</a>]. Cones bearing viable 
seed are produced by trees 
as young as 5 years  in open stands and by trees 15 to 20 years old in more 
dense stands. This feature not only allows relatively young stands to regenerate 
following fire, but also allows the seed from open cones of recently regenerated 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine to fill voids left by serotinous cones [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. However, when 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is suppressed a 
tree may reach 50 years  before producing seed. Cone production is related to the amount 
of water and light available. Due to their large crowns, trees growing in open 
stands tend to produce larger numbers of cones than those in dense stands. The number of cones 
produced in a single growing season by mature Rocky Mountain lodgepole pines in 
Colorado ranges from none in a suppressed individual 
to 9,000 in a 99-year-old tree in an open stand [<a href="#97">97</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole 
pine is generally described as a prolific seed producer with good crops 
at 1- to 3- year intervals [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#245">245</a>] with 
light crops in intervening years [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. Hellum [<a href="#157">157</a>] argues, however, that Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine is in fact a light cone producer, 
with 30 cones/tree/year being common. Often, trees bear an 
abundance of seeds that remain unopened in serotinous cones [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>]. The average 
serotinous cone remains on the tree for about 15 years, 
with few remaining on a tree for more than 30 years. It is the 
accrual of cones on the tree over time that results in large numbers of seed 
available for regeneration following disturbance, rather than high seed 
production [<a href="#157">157</a>]. Most of the viable seeds are borne on scales nearest 
the tip of the cone (except for the 1st few scales) [<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>]. The number of seeds in a cone depends on the age 
of the tree or branch, 
number of cone scales, and number of seeds per cone scale [<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>]. Nonserotinous trees may have more seeds per cone than 
serotinous trees, perhaps indicating that serotinous trees invest relatively 
heavily in cone materials to protect seeds (which are retained in cones for many 
years), while nonserotinous trees (which shed seed every year) invest relatively 
heavily in seeds [<a href="#227">227</a>,<a href="#230">230</a>]. Annual seed production in 
nonserotinous stands may exceed 600,000 seeds per acre (1.5 million seeds/ha) with high 
levels of viability [<a href="#6">6</a>].</p>

</font> 

Serotinous cones require 
<a href="all.html#temperatures">high temperatures</a>
to open and release seed [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>], and they are well insulated to survive brief periods in flames [<a href="#1">1</a>]. 
Individual trees predominantly bear either open or closed (serotinous) cones 
[<a href="#115">115</a>], and most mature Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands contain trees that 
have both closed and open cones [<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>]. Wind pollination encourages 
heterogeneity of cone habit [<a href="#229">229</a>].</p>

<p>Level of serotiny varies over time and space, and is a legacy of past 
fire [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#156">156</a>] and possibly also  geographic location [<a href="#116">116</a>], 
tree age, and 
elevation [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>]. In Yellowstone National Park, the proportion of serotinous 
trees across the landscape was most variable at intermediate scales (1-10 km) 
and least variable at fine scales (&lt;1 km) and at very broad scales (tens of km) 
[<a href="#289">289</a>].</p>

<p>Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands originating from stand-replacing fire generally have a 
high percentage of trees with serotinous cones, while stands originating after other disturbance are likely to 
have a greater proportion of nonserotinous cones [<a href="#26">26</a>]. Lotan [<a href="#214">214</a>] found that 
an even-aged stand of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine in Montana (generated from 
seed in closed cones made available by stand-replacing fire) was composed of 
58% predominantly serotinous  trees, compared with 38% in an uneven-aged stand 
(established primarily by open-coned trees over time) [<a href="#214">214</a>]. 
Predominant cone type in a stand may shift over time, depending on the nature of 
the last major disturbance. Muir [<a href="#227">227</a>] found that the level of serotiny in 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands was more closely related to the type of 
stand-initiating disturbance than to fire frequency. In a study in western 
Montana, between-stand variation in serotiny indicated a predominance of 
serotinous trees in stands that originated after stand-replacing fire, and of 
nonserotinous trees in stands that originated after nonfire-related disturbance 
[<a href="#227">227</a>,<a href="#229">229</a>].</p>

<p>Nonserotinous trees may be favored at both ends of the fire frequency 
gradient. The absence 
of fire over a long period may result in stands dominated by trees with nonserotinous cones as 
regeneration from open cones replaces the original trees 
[<a href="#275">275</a>]. Long 
intervals between fires often allow large fuel accumulations, resulting in 
intense burns which may destroy many seeds in serotinous cones. With frequent 
fires, fuel accumulation may be low and the resulting fire intensity may be too 
low to open closed cones [<a href="#229">229</a>]. In addition, disturbance may occur before the serotinous cone habit is 
expressed. Though Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine may start 
bearing cones at less than 10 years of age, serotiny is not expressed until 
trees are 30 to 60 years old [<a href="#217">217</a>]. </p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed dispersal:</b></font> 
The seeds of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine are small and disperse easily with 
wind [<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>]. Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine has 2 modes of seed dispersal, based on cone serotiny [<a href="#264">264</a>]. In Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine stands with predominantly serotinous cones, releasing and 
scattering seed on the forest floor after fire opens cones is the most important 
method of dispersal [<a href="#12">12</a>]. Serotinous cones require <a name="temperatures">temperatures</a> of 
113 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit (45-50 <sup>o</sup>C) to melt the resin that binds 
the scales of the cone [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>], temperatures that generally accompany moderate to severe fire [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>]. 
Crown fires in Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine usually cause maximum release of stored seed 
[<a href="#215">215</a>]. In stands with primarily nonserotinous cones, the small, winged seeds are dispersed at maturity 
from standing trees largely by wind. Seedfall drops off rapidly as distance from 
source increases, with most seeds falling within about 200 feet (60 m) of the parent 
tree [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#245">245</a>,<a href="#268">268</a>,<a href="#286">286</a>]. Other dispersal agents include runoff and 
small mammals [<a href="#97">97</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed banking:</b></font> 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seeds are stored in serotinous cones 
on standing trees [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>]. Seeds are protected in these cones until 
exposure to heat (generally from fire) melts the resin seal [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>]. Very severe 
fires, however, may destroy much of the seed supply [<a href="#275">275</a>]. Not all Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine stands exhibit a high degree of cone serotiny, and this 
variability in cone habit affects regeneration patterns [<a href="#12">12</a>]. Seeds in 
canopy-stored, serotinous cones are viable for up to 80 years [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Germination:</font></b> 
When tested under standard laboratory conditions, the germinative capacity of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seeds ranges 
from 65 to 90% [<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#195">195</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>]. Viability is highly variable from year to 
year, but does not seem to decrease as a function of age of the cones attached 
to trees [<a href="#195">195</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>].</p> 

<p>Germination of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine 
seeds requires light but not stratification [<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#209">209</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>]. After dispersal, viable seeds 
of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine that survive over winter normally germinate in the spring or early summer 
following snowmelt. Under favorable moisture conditions, Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine  germinates on exposed 
mineral soil and disturbed duff  [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#245">245</a>]. Fire creates a favorable seedbed by removing loose organic 
matter and exposing mineral soil or decomposed organic matter, which encourage 
germination [<a href="#1">1</a>]. Fire may also reduce competing 
vegetation, improving opportunities for seedling establishment [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>]. The decrease in canopy cover following fire 
provides high light intensity necessary for vigorous Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seedling growth [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>]. Moderate to heavy 
shade reduces germination 20% [<a href="#217">217</a>]. Germination rates are best in full sunlight, though on some sites radiation 
intensities under full exposure can create temperature and moisture conditions 
unfavorable to  germination. High temperatures and rapid drying of the 
seedbed can prevent seeds from imbibing sufficient water to germinate [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>]. Temperatures fluctuating between 
47 and 78 degrees Fahrenheit (8-26 <sup>o</sup>C) favor germination [<a href="#216">216</a>,<a href="#245">245</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine 
seeds do not germinate well on surface soils that are dry and cold in the spring [<a href="#101">101</a>].</p> 

<p>Despain and others [<a href="#124">124</a>] found that exposure for 10 to 60 
seconds in a flame front designed to simulate a crown fire enhanced germination 
of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seeds from serotinous cones, but not seeds from nonserotinous 
cones. Maximum germination rates for serotinous cone seeds ranged from 37 to 64% 
and occurred after 10 to 20 seconds of exposure to flames. Germination after 60 
seconds averaged 0.3 to 14%. Maximum germination of seeds from nonserotinous 
cones was approximately 80%, occurring with no exposure to flame and after 10 seconds 
exposure to flame [<a href="#124">124</a>]. Knapp and Anderson [<a href="#194">194</a>] 
found that Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seeds from serotinous cones heated to 149 degrees 
Fahrenheit (65 <sup>o</sup>C) showed no difference in germination than those 
from a serotinous control group maintained at 68 to 77 
degrees Fahrenheit (20-25<sup> o</sup>C). Seeds heated 
to 169 degrees Fahrenheit (76 <sup>o</sup>C) and higher, however, exhibited a significant decrease (p&lt;0.01) in 
germination. These results suggest the existence of a threshold temperature 
(149-167 <sup>o</sup>F or 65-75 <sup>o</sup>C) above which germination is reduced, coinciding with the upper 
temperatures required to open serotinous cones (140-156<sup> o</sup>F or 60-69 <sup>o</sup>C). 
The maximum germination rate for the control group was 38% [<a href="#194">194</a>]. In another study evaluating the effects of drying 
and scorching on Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seeds (from serotinous cones), seeds subjected to drying in a 
rotating kiln for 23 hours were more &quot;vigorous&quot; than seeds dried in a conventional 
kiln for 16 hours, perhaps because seeds could drop free of the kiln environment 
once released from the cones. Seeds with the greatest vigor, however, were those 
extracted from cones subjected to up to 1.5 minutes of scorching at 428 degrees 
Fahrenheit (220 <sup>o</sup>C) followed by 23 hours drying in the rotating kiln. Seeds subjected to 2.0 minutes 
scorching exhibited a substantial reduction in germinability and vigor, as well 
as loss of membrane integrity [<a href="#302">302</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seedling establishment/growth:</b></font> 
Soil temperature, air temperature, water availability, and light level are the 
primary factors controlling seedling performance of Rocky Mountain lodgepole 
pine [<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is noted for its ability to establish on burned surfaces, 
though early seedling success may be greater on exposed, unburned mineral soil with more 
stable moisture conditions [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. 
Thick organic seedbeds may dry quickly and expose seedlings to drought, the 
primary cause of mortality the 1st year [<a href="#26">26</a>]. In an Alberta 
study of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine reforestation efforts, better growth and survival of 
planted seedlings were observed on burned areas than on unburned, unscarified sites [<a href="#132">132</a>]. The highest seedling densities 
following harvest in Wyoming were found on naturally seeded sites (vs. planted 
sites) where residue had been either piled and burned or chipped and removed [<a href="#213">213</a>]. However, 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine does not 
require bare mineral soil or sites free from potential competitors for 
establishment. Anderson and Romme [<a href="#27">27</a>] found large numbers of Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine 
seedlings on sites where the effects of a surface fire had been minimal and the duff and 
understory plants were relatively disturbed. A central Idaho study was  inconclusive, with a higher percentage of 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seedlings establishing 
on bare soil than on litter-covered soil on some sites, while the reverse was 
observed on other sites [<a href="#144">144</a>]. Snags and logs may provide buffering 
of both high and low temperatures and higher soil moisture, resulting in high 
concentrations of regeneration on these microsites [<a href="#6">6</a>].</p>

<p>Growth of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is characterized as rapid in young trees and slow in 
old trees [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#264">264</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>], 
and may be impacted by elevation. In a Colorado study, the average annual height growth  at 
higher altitudes (approx. 10,000 feet/3,000 m) was 0.8 inch (2 cm); at slightly lower altitudes (9,000 feet/2,700 
m) it was 3 inches (8 cm) [<a href="#97">97</a>]. Early seedling development is generally considered best in full 
sunlight [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>,<a href="#245">245</a>], though full exposure may result in 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seedling mortality due to heat injury [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>]. On sites in Colorado at an elevation 
of 10,000 feet, full exposure resulted in 100% seedling mortality by the end of 
the 1st growing season [<a href="#78">78</a>]. In a central Idaho study, moderate 
shrub canopy cover (33-66%) resulted in greater Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seedling 
establishment than light or heavy cover [<a href="#144">144</a>]. Unfavorable temperature and moisture conditions in full 
exposure may  kill seedlings by stem girdle or drought [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>]. Water stress can decrease 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seedling establishment and survival [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#281">281</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>]. 
Shading reduces losses to moisture 
stress, with large seedlings faring better due to well-developed root systems [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#281">281</a>]. Growth of seedlings 
may also be limited by low fertility and compacted subsoil [<a href="#62">62</a>]. Following a 
wildfire in Colorado, Rocky Mountain lodgepole 
pine seedlings were more abundant on lower slope positions due to greater soil moisture 
and slightly deeper soils than on higher slope positions [<a href="#57">57</a>]. Though mature 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine prefers well-drained soil [<a href="#97">97</a>], seedlings are tolerant 
of high soil water levels, even with extended soil saturation [<a href="#99">99</a>]. Seedlings 
are  susceptible to frost-heaving [<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>]. 
Frost heaving can kill new germinants and partially destroy roots of older 
seedlings, slowing their growth [<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>]. Newly germinated seedlings are 
susceptible to early fall frosts when they are still actively growing, but older 
seedlings are seldom damaged by frosts during the growing season [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>]. 
Shade may reduce mortality from frost damage by reducing loss of radiant energy 
from soil and seedlings [<a href="#12">12</a>]. Cold hardiness and drought tolerance of seedlings 
vary between populations  [<a href="#60">60</a>]. Newly germinated seedlings may 
also be killed by damping-off fungi early in the growing season when seedbeds 
are damp [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>]. Seedlings are vulnerable to trampling, predation by 
small mammals, and competition from understory vegetation, particularly grasses [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#215">215</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>]. 
One study in British Columbia found that Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine 
seedling diameter was 84% greater with the removal of competing vegetation than 
on undisturbed vegetation. Survival of seedlings may also be reduced by up to 
20% due to competing vegetation [<a href="#98">98</a>]. Another British Columbia 
study found that seeding of clearcuts with grass and forb species reduced 
planted, 1-year-old Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine diameter by up to 38% 
(p&lt;0.004) and heights by up to 30% (p&lt;0.005) over 3 years; diameter, height, and 
survival decreased linearly with increased seeding rates [<a href="#248">248</a>]. A 3rd study found 
mean diameters of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seedlings growing free of competing vegetation 
were 21% greater than diameters of seedlings grown with competition. Removal of 
competing vegetation favors increased seedling growth by increasing soil 
temperature, air temperature, and light availability [<a href="#272">272</a>]. Removal of intraspecific competitors generally 
results in greater improved growth of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine 
than removal of interspecific competitors [<a href="#26">26</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Fire and regeneration:</font></b> The effects of fire, fuel accumulation, stand 
development, insects, and disease in Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine forests interact to control the establishment and maintenance of stands [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>].&nbsp; 
Because they are often initiated by stand-replacing fire, Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands are frequently even-aged [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>]. 
However, stands of similar age frequently differ in density, ranging from open stands 
of large trees to very dense, stunted &quot;doghair&quot; stands [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>]. Patterns of 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine regeneration following the 1988 Yellowstone fires included 1) a 
dense, uniformly distributed cohort  developing as a single-storied stand; 
2) Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine islands or clusters that form, over several 
decades, around isolated seedlings that mature and produce seed; 
3) a moderate- to low-density cohort that will gradually fill with multiple age 
classes over time; and 4) a cohort of only widely scattered single seedlings 
that initially form as small nearby tree islands, and will eventually converge into a 
more continuous stand [<a href="#235">235</a>]. Low-density stands resulting from severe fires 
are generally more robust with more aboveground biomass, reflecting lower 
levels of competition and possibly more favorable abiotic factors (e.g. light availability, earlier 
snowmelt, and favorable growth temperatures earlier in the season) [<a href="#26">26</a>]. Dense stands of 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine are susceptible to stagnation, snow 
breakage, and windthrow as they mature [<a href="#275">275</a>]. A study of fire-initiated Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine stands in Colorado found 
2 distinct structures in stands originating from crown fires at approximately 
the same time. Several stands had high tree densities (cover &gt;70%) with few 
saplings or large seedlings, numerous standing dead trees, and even-aged 
diameter distributions. Other stands had more open canopies (cover &lt;65%) with 
lower tree densities, more saplings and seedlings, and a range of diameter 
classes. The open stands suggest low stocking density following stand-replacing 
fire and/or repetitive surface fires that have allowed somewhat continuous 
recruitment over time [<a href="#236">236</a>]. Similar relationships between 
density and diameter distribution were found in an Alberta study, with higher 
density stands containing a smaller range of diameters [<a href="#190">190</a>].</p>

<p>If seed sources are close and abundant, Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine often 
reproduces abundantly following fire or harvest, developing dense stands of 
seedlings in which diameter and height growth are substantially reduced [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#168">168</a>,<a href="#190">190</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>,<a href="#218">218</a>,<a href="#245">245</a>]. 
Following the stand-replacing Sleeping Child fire in western Montana, Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine densities were as high as 159,000 seedlings per 
acre (393,000/ha), though the average over 11 transects was 34,000 per acre 
(84,000/ha). Survival of these seedlings was 52% in the 1st 12 years [<a href="#218">218</a>]. In 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine-dominated successional 
forest of the central Rockies, 80-year-old trees may be 0.8 to 1.2 inches (2-3 cm) in diameter, 
less than 10 feet (3 m) tall, and spaced at 2 trees/ft<sup>2</sup> (20 trees/m<sup>2</sup>) [<a href="#72">72</a>]. Following a 
severe fire in Colorado, Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seedling density ranged from 0 to 4,800 
seedlings per acre (0-12,000/ha) by the 3rd postfire growing season, with most seedlings 
establishing in the 1st year [<a href="#57">57</a>]. However, seeding often occurs over 
several years with wider seedling spacing; after 80 years  Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pines 
in this regeneration pattern range from 4 to 12 inches (10-30 cm) in diameter, 
49 to 66 feet (15-20 m) in height, and have 6.6- to 10-foot (2-3 m) spacing 
[<a href="#72">72</a>]. Variations in seedling density following fire reflect severity of fire, 
soil type, elevation, patch size, and levels of serotiny [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#215">215</a>]. Levels of 
serotiny combined with fire severity determine seed availability 
after fire [<a href="#59">59</a>]. Seed from open-coned trees establishes less dense stands that 
are somewhat uneven-aged [<a href="#275">275</a>]. Seedling densities increase exponentially with the 
proportion of serotinous trees in prefire stands [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>]. The range of seedling 
density at different sites subject to similar fire severity are likely due to 
the availability of seeds at the time of fire, a function of the proportion of serotinous trees in the stand 
[<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>,<a href="#215">215</a>].
Seventeen years after 
a severe mixed surface and crown fire in Wyoming, Engelmann spruce density was greater than that of 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine due to a low percentage of serotiny in the burned stand and low 
density of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine in the unburned forest near the burned 
area [<a href="#128">128</a>].</p>

<p>The effect of fire on the structure and composition of a Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine 
stand depends greatly on its severity. Fires in Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine vary from surface 
fires of low severity to crown fires of high severity. Stand-replacing fires 
generally result in heavy seeding from serotinous cones, producing a dense, 
even-aged young stand [<a href="#14">14</a>]. In a northern Cascades study of regeneration after 
low-severity fire, Finney [<a href="#137">137</a>] found that Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine 
regeneration increased as fire intensity increased and postfire residual density 
decreased. Occasionally, fires may be intense enough to destroy cones, resulting 
in a thinly stocked stand. Low-severity surface fires may leave some residual 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine, resulting in an uneven-aged stand [<a href="#14">14</a>]. With 
low-severity fires, moisture content of duff is an important factor in 
determining stand density. When duff is dry a low-intensity fire exposes mineral 
soil, resulting in dense stocking. When duff is moist, fire exposes less mineral 
soil. This often results in poor seedbed conditions and low seedling density. 
Widely spaced stands may result; in time, multi-aged stands can 
develop. In surface fires with considerable patches of crowning, mineral soil is 
exposed, serotinous cones open, and if seed is abundant, a dense stand results 
[<a href="#215">215</a>]. Mixed-severity 
burns are sufficiently intense to kill some trees and allow for establishment of 
a new age class of the shade intolerant Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine [<a href="#38">38</a>].</p>

<p>High-severity fires often result in fewer postfire seedlings than less severe 
burns, potentially reducing seedling density by 75-96% relative to moderately 
burned areas [<a href="#26">26</a>]. In a study of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands 1 year after the 1988 Yellowstone fires, 
nearly 1/3rd of vascular plants were Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seedlings. In comparing paired 
plots, moderate fire resulted in higher seedling density (0.14-2 
seedlings/ft<sup>2</sup> or 1.6-21.9 
seedlings/m<sup>2</sup>) than severe canopy fire (0-0.28 seedlings/ft<sup>2</sup> 
or 0.4-3.1 seedlings/m<sup>2</sup>) [<a href="#27">27</a>] due to the loss of viable seed in 
severe fires [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>]. A severe crown fire may kill up to 80% of seeds stored 
in the Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine canopy relative to seed survival after a &quot;hot&quot; surface fire [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#215">215</a>]. 
Following the Yellowstone fires of 1988, severe surface-burned areas and large burned patches 
had higher cover and density of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seedlings than small patches or 
areas experiencing crown fire. Fire intensities and spreads in severe 
surface-burned areas may have been optimal for the opening of serotinous cones 
and release of seed, but fire conditions in severe crown fires may have resulted 
in cone ignition and substantially reduced seed viability. Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine density was positively related to the number of prefire serotinous trees surrounding the 
sampling point [<a href="#290">290</a>]. At other sites evaluated after the Yellowstone fires, seedling densities were also 
consistently higher on moderately burned areas and lower on areas subject to 
severe canopy fire. Seedling densities on severely burned sites &gt;328 feet (100 m) from the 
nearest moderately burned or unburned sites were 2- to 7-fold less than on 
severely burned areas adjacent to or within 197 feet (60 m) of a moderately 
burned or unburned area. Seedling densities were also higher on sites with a 
greater number of cones on the ground and with closer proximity to stands having a high proportion of 
serotinous cones. Greater stand serotiny and high postfire seedling densities were positively 
correlated (r=0.71, p=0.0031 for moderately burned transects, r=0.75, p=0.0023 
for severely burned transects). Regardless of fire severity, 
seedling density far exceeded the density of the prefire forest [<a href="#131">131</a>].</p>

<b><font face="Bell MT">Elevation and topography:</font></b>
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine grows in a wide range of ecological conditions; 
from low to high elevations, dry to wet conditions, warm to cold temperatures, 
and on nearly every soil condition found in western North America [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#264">264</a>]. 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine grows from 1,500 to 11,500 feet (450-3,500 m) in elevation. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine 
stands are found throughout most of the northern Rockies at middle elevations 
(4,400-7,800 feet or 1,350-2,399 m) and are especially well developed on the 
broad ridges and high valleys near and east of the Continental Divide [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>]. 
The elevational occurrence of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine in the Rocky 
Mountains increases from north to south [<a href="#285">285</a>,<a href="#288">288</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is limited by a lack of water at lower 
elevations and short growing seasons at higher elevations [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#285">285</a>]. The following table presents elevation ranges for 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine in different parts of its geographic distribution:<br><br>

<p>Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine grows well on gentle slopes and in 
basins [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>], but good stands are also found on rough and rocky terrain 
and on steep slopes and ridges, including bare gravel [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>]. 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is found on all aspects [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>,<a href="#304">304</a>], 
though it may be more abundant and robust on south and west aspects 
in the northern Rockies [<a href="#12">12</a>]. In a 
British Columbia field experiment evaluating planting position in a berm/trench 
system, Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seedlings had the greatest increase in stem volume when 
planted on the east, south, or west berm position. However, seedlings in these 
positions also suffered the highest mortality, while seedlings planted on 
cool, north-facing microsites experienced reduced growth rates [<a href="#92">92</a>]. In 
Washington and Oregon, Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is found primarily on dry eastern slopes 
[<a href="#309">309</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Climate:</font></b> 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is found on dry to 
intermediate sites with a wide seasonal range of temperatures 
and occasionally long precipitation-free periods in  summer [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>]. 
Snowfall is heavy and supplies the major portion of soil water used for growth 
in early summer; winter temperatures are cold; summer has relatively low 
rainfall; and in many areas there is no true frost-free season, with summer 
temperatures falling below freezing at regular intervals [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>]. 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine can withstand temperatures as 
low as 15 degrees Fahrenheit (-9 <sup>o</sup>C) when shoots are actively growing 
[<a href="#37">37</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine can survive in areas receiving only 10 
inches (250 mm) of precipitation, but generally grows where precipitation is 18+ 
inches (460 mm) [<a href="#216">216</a>,<a href="#219">219</a>]. Vigorous stands occur where the precipitation 
exceeds 21 inches (530 mm) [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#219">219</a>]. The following table gives approximate total and growing season precipitation 
and July mean temperatures for some areas in the range of Rocky Mountain

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Soils:</font></b> 
Soils where Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine grows are often young with a poorly developed or shallow 
profile [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>], though Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine grows best on deep, 
well developed soils [<a href="#180">180</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is found on  coarse alluvial 
soils [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>] derived 
from rhyolite, sandstone, shale, or granite [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#285">285</a>,<a href="#304">304</a>].&nbsp;A 
central Montana study found Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine occurrence much greater on granitic 
soils than on limestone soils [<a href="#145">145</a>].&nbsp;Soils ranging from moist to well drained 
will support Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#168">168</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#285">285</a>], 
as well as sites where other 
conifers may be inhibited by water or nutrient stress [<a href="#79">79</a>]. The development of 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine root systems varies 
with soil and stand conditions. On deep, well-drained soils, trees have a better 
root system and are more stable than on shallow, fine-textured or poorly-drained 
soils [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>]. Shallow, poorly-drained soils result 
in the development of a shallow rooting system [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>]. 
Where trees develop a shallow root system, Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is susceptible to windfall. 
Windfirmness varies with stand density, soil conditions, and topography [<a href="#216">216</a>].&nbsp;Soil conditions being equal, 
individual stems in dense stands are less windfirm, 
because trees that have developed together in dense stands over long periods of 
time mutually protect and support each other and do not have the roots, boles, 
and crowns to withstand exposure to the wind when opened up 
drastically [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is tolerant of flooding and shallow water tables 
[<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#199">199</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#299">299</a>]; 
however, productivity is restricted in some soils by 
barriers to root proliferation, such as restrictive layers or high water tables 
[<a href="#101">101</a>].  Flood tolerance is likely due to the production of large, gas-filled cavities in 
inundated roots and the ability to actively transport oxygen to submerged root 
tips in these cavities [<a href="#60">60</a>].</p>

<p>Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine grows well on nutrient-poor soils [<a href="#307">307</a>], though 
increased nutrient availability can increase productivity [<a href="#101">101</a>]. 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is often found on sites low in available nitrogen [<a href="#159">159</a>,<a href="#249">249</a>], and nitrogen 
deficiencies arise in Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine ecosystems due to slow litter decay rates 
coupled with high nitrogen immobilization [<a href="#159">159</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine may not grow well on 
soils high in calcium or magnesium [<a href="#199">199</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>], though extensive stands are found on calcareous soils 
in Canada [<a href="#216">216</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine tolerates a wide range of pH 
in soils, though pH exceeding 8.0 may exclude Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine [<a href="#195">195</a>]. Some physical and chemical 
characteristics of soils in 6 Wyoming Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands are presented below [<a href="#135">135</a>]:</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Tolerances:</font></b> 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine grows best on noncalcareous soil [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>] and is intolerant of saline soils [<a href="#303">303</a>]. 
It is also adversely affected by high concentrations of zinc, copper, 
cadmium, and mercury [<a href="#177">177</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is shade intolerant [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#140">140</a>,<a href="#199">199</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#264">264</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>], 
and though some seedlings may establish under a forest canopy, they 
seldom grow to maturity unless released [<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#264">264</a>]. 
 In a study of Washington sites following fire, Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine regeneration was 
greater than Douglas-fir regeneration where residual density of the stand was 
lowest and where high proportions of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine existed in the prefire 
stand. In high residual-density stands, the proportion of 
Douglas-fir regeneration increased. Occurrence and growth of 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine regeneration increased with fire intensity (decreased residual 
density) and distance from residual tree cover, while Douglas-fir regeneration 
on the same sites was more tolerant of residual tree cover [<a href="#137">137</a>].</p>

<p>Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine has moderate drought 
tolerance [<a href="#93">93</a>] and moderate to high frost tolerance [<a href="#199">199</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>]. Low air temperatures and cold air 
ponding also influence distribution of 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine; its relative tolerance of lower night temperatures during 
seedling emergence allows establishment in frost pocket areas where other species 
(e.g. ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir) may be eliminated [<a href="#216">216</a>,<a href="#299">299</a>]. Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine is, however, susceptible to winter drying damage with foliage 
damage ranging from light to severe, potentially resulting in tree mortality. 
Reductions in height growth and terminal bud length are proportional to the 
amount of damage, which may reach 80% of foliage in young trees [<a href="#64">64</a>]. Winter burn, or &quot;red belt&quot;, 
is caused by the alternate chilling and 
warming of needles in air of low moisture content when warm air results in 
transpiration before trees are able to translocate water from the roots to the 
needles, resulting in needle desiccation [<a href="#263">263</a>].</p>

Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine invades dry meadows and sites previously dominated by 
big sagebrush [<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#238">238</a>,<a href="#262">262</a>]. However, Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is primarily an aggressive pioneer on disturbed 
sites, with its occurrence due 
largely to fire [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#238">238</a>].    Postfire tree regeneration 
depends on the severity and uniformity of fire behavior, the relative 
availability of open and closed cones, and postfire moisture conditions. 
Regeneration from open cones is slower than when most seed is from closed cones, 
but it may be more dependable because seed is available most years. Regeneration 
patterns reflect burning patterns; regeneration is widely distributed if fire 
behavior was relatively uniform, but is sparse in severely burned patches and 
clumped in even-age patches where fire was of mixed severity. Following stand-replacing fire, 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine can establish in nearly 
pure stands or with other tree species that are suppressed under the 
fast-growing Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine. In either case, Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine generally dominates regeneration [<a href="#275">275</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine may also co-dominate on these 
sites with other early successional, shade-intolerant species. For example, 
whitebark pine may also establish immediately following fire or other 
stand-replacing disturbance [<a href="#176">176</a>,<a href="#211">211</a>].  The success of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine 
at dominating a site following fire is due to the high rate of seedling 
survival, rapid growth of young trees, early seed production, prolific seed 
production, and high seed viability [<a href="#113">113</a>].</p>

<p>The successional status 
of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine depends on 
environmental conditions, disturbance history and pattern, and competition from associated species [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#299">299</a>,<a href="#310">310</a>].
Succession proceeds at different rates, moving relatively fast on low-elevation 
mesic sites and particularly slow in high-elevation forests such as those along 
the Continental Divide in Montana [<a href="#264">264</a>].&nbsp;Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine matures 
and gives way to shade-tolerant conifers at ages from 50 to 100 years in mesic 
habitats, 100 to 200 years in warmer, drier forests, and 150 to 400 years in 
subalpine forests [<a href="#245">245</a>]. Fire perpetuates or renews Rocky Mountain lodgepole 
pine stands. Where Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is  seral,  shade-tolerant 
trees will replace Rocky Mountain lodgepole without fire or other disturbance because of its shade 
intolerance and mineral seedbed preference [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>]. 
Absence of stand disturbance favors regeneration and eventual dominance of 
shade-tolerant species [<a href="#137">137</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#240">240</a>,<a href="#299">299</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is seral in stands 
that have either a mixed overstory or contain appreciable amounts of advance 
reproduction of other species [<a href="#12">12</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is especially important in postfire succession of subalpine 
forests, particularly on moderately to severely burned sites [<a href="#49">49</a>]. Successional development where 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is 
either seral or persistent usually follows multiple pathways depending upon 
associated species and stand history [<a href="#299">299</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine also 
occurs in climax stands, exhibiting size-class distribution and growth habits 
typical of climax species not dependent on fire for maintenance [<a href="#123">123</a>].</p>

<p><b>Seral Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine:</b> Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is a minor seral species 
in some mixed stands [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#138">138</a>,<a href="#245">245</a>,<a href="#264">264</a>]. 
In mixed stands, Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine may establish with late-successional, shade-tolerant species [<a href="#296">296</a>]. Rapid growth rates enable 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine to maintain a competitive position in 
the canopy for several years. However, it does not regenerate under the 
mixed-species canopy and is eliminated from the stand as mortality occurs [<a href="#245">245</a>,<a href="#296">296</a>]. It is generally 
replaced in 50 to 100 years by more 
shade-tolerant associates [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#138">138</a>,<a href="#264">264</a>].</p>

<p>Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is a dominant seral where it is an overstory 
species with a vigorous understory of shade tolerant associates (Douglas-fir, 
subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce) [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#245">245</a>]. For example, the largest, most 
continuous Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forests occur on subalpine fir habitat 
types. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine typically regenerates following 
stand-replacing or mixed-severity fire. It grows rapidly and dominates the site, 
but subalpine fir regenerates well under the canopy of lodgepole [<a href="#95">95</a>]. In a Utah 
study, Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir began to establish beneath Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine approximately 20 years after a stand-replacing fire 
[<a href="#179">179</a>]. Succession proceeds at variable rates and is particularly slow in some 
high elevation forests [<a href="#217">217</a>]. An Alberta study found that an even-aged stand of 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine was succeeded by an Engelmann spruce-subalpine fir 
forest within 150 to 200 years. As even-aged Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine ages, 
death of old trees permits an irregular to all-aged spruce-fir forest to emerge 
and dominate [<a href="#119">119</a>]. In a fire-initiated Engelmann spruce-subalpine fir forest of 
British Columbia, Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine accounted for only 3.4% of the 
canopy after 330 years, with no Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine in the subcanopy 
or sapling age class [<a href="#29">29</a>]. Stand conditions determine the fire potential, and 
the kind of fire that occurs determines postfire stand density and early 
composition (open stand may lead to earlier establishment of climax species) 
[<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. On sites where Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is the sole or dominant 
seral species, an initial herb-shrub community develops after a stand-replacing 
fire. Fires of any severity maintain this state. Where Rocky Mountain lodgepole 
pine is serotinous (or nonserotinous with an adequate seed source), dense stands 
of even-aged seedlings and saplings establish quickly. Low- to moderate-severity 
fires provide seed release and openings for regeneration of Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine and shade-tolerant species. Due to heavy fuel loads, stands with 
a dying Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine overstory and Engelmann spruce-subalpine 
fir understory are susceptible to severe fire, which recycles the stand. Without 
recurrence of fire, a dense mature stand of lodgepole results, which will eventually be dominated by 
climax species as the lodgepole pine senesces [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#138">138</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>].  If an open stand develops 
(e.g. where cones are nonserotinous or on exposed south slopes) following 
severe fire, seedling establishment will usually continue, leading to an 
uneven-aged stand with varying proportions of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine. In these stands, a 
low-severity surface fire removes young trees and creates a seedbed for subsequent 
regeneration, with relatively frequent low-severity fires maintaining the open stand  and 
mixed forest. In the absence of fire, seral 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine eventually dies out due to insects, disease, and old age, 
releasing shade-tolerant climax species [<a href="#113">113</a>].</p>

<p>Replacement of seral Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine in these types of 
communities usually requires 100 to 200 years [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#245">245</a>]. In the event of mountain pine beetle removal of larger 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine, the time required for climax species to occupy the site is shortened [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>]. In stands where 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is seral, mountain pine 
beetles periodically remove the large, dominant pines, providing growing space 
for climax species and hastening succession [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#179">179</a>,<a href="#299">299</a>]. A fire may interrupt 
the sere at any time, returning the stand to pure Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine 
or a combination of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine and other early seral tree 
species (e.g. whitebark pine) [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>,<a href="#211">211</a>].</p>

<p>The effect of fire in seral Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine varies by habitat 
type. Low-severity surface fires are not necessarily adequate to kill 
Douglas-fir and return Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine to a dominant position in 
the stand [<a href="#17">17</a>]. In drier habitat types (e.g. Douglas-fir/pinegrass), recurrent 
low- to medium-severity surface fires reduce accumulated woody biomass resulting 
from beetle attack. In contrast, cooler, more mesic habitat types (e.g. 
subalpine fir/queencup beadlily) may experience stand-replacing fires rather 
than cyclic surface fires, allowing the continuous accumulation of woody 
residues until a severe fire consumes the surface fuels [<a href="#30">30</a>]. However, once 
succession is complete, Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seed will no longer be 
available to seed the burned areas except along edges where the site joins 
persistent or climax Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>]. Succession occurs 
most rapidly where Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine and shade-tolerant associates 
establish simultaneously [<a href="#17">17</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine gains dominance 
through rapid early growth, but shade-tolerant species persist and assume 
dominance as individual Rocky Mountain lodgepole pines die [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#168">168</a>]. In a 
Colorado study reconstructing Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine and Engelmann spruce 
stands, the Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine cohort established in the 1st decade 
following fire, with initially high but decreasing mortality in the 1st 10 
years. Mortality was low and constant until &quot;self-thinning&quot; began at year 25; 
mortality then increased for the next 200 years. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine 
understory recruitment began around postfire year 15, with understory trees 
experiencing high mortality with a &lt;0.5% chance of reaching the canopy. 
Engelmann spruce also experienced high mortality, though not as high as Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine, with sporadic recruitment over time [<a href="#182">182</a>].</p>

<p>Habitat types in which Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine occurs as a dominant seral species include 
ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>), subalpine fir, whitebark 
pine (<i>Pinus albicaulis</i>), Engelmann spruce, grand fir (<i>Abies grandis</i>), mountain hemlock 
(<i>Tsuga mertensiana</i>),<font color="#0000FF"> </font>western redcedar (<i>Thuja 
plicata</i>), western larch (<i>Larix occidentalis</i>),<font color="#0000FF"> </font>
white fir (<i>Abies concolor</i>), and Douglas-fir [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#138">138</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>,<a href="#299">299</a>].</p>
<p><b>Persistent Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine:</b> Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is a persistent seral or 
subclimax species where stands are 
the result of periodic, stand-replacing fires; some areas have burned so often 
and so extensively that large acreages are nearly all Rocky Mountain lodgepole 
pine [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>]. On these sites, fire may be infrequent but 
recurs before the more shade tolerant climax species can replace lodgepole [<a href="#245">245</a>,<a href="#299">299</a>]. 
The proportion of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine will increase with each successive fire, 
provided the interval between fires is neither too short nor too long 
[<a href="#168">168</a>,<a href="#292">292</a>]. Because Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine begins producing seed at 3 to 15 years of age, the amount 
of time that a new stand is seedless and subject to destruction by subsequent 
fire is relatively short [<a href="#1">1</a>]. In grand 
fir forests, Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine dies out 120 to 160 years following fire if not 
subsequently burned; repeated fires at &lt;100 year intervals favor Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine 
while intervals &gt;200 years eliminate Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine [<a href="#28">28</a>]. These 
seral stages persist indefinitely if subject to fire at intervals favoring the 
regeneration of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (fire-free intervals less than the life span of 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine) and preempting the establishment of climax 
forests [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>]. Fires tend to eliminate competitive tree species such 
as Douglas-fir, the true firs (<i>Abies</i> spp.), and spruce (<i>Picea </i>spp.), while 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seeds in 
abundantly following fire [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>]. In these situations, Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine is 
maintained on the site, preventing succession to climax species [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#245">245</a>]. 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine maintains its 
dominance because of inadequate seed sources for potential competitors, stand 
densities too great to allow regeneration of any other species, and low-severity surface fires that remove seedlings 
without killing overstory Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>].</p>

<p><b>Climax Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine:</b> 
Climax Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forests are primarily topoedaphic climaxes, occurring 
where other tree species have no seed source, competitive advantage, or capability of growing 
on particular sites, and where Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is self-perpetuating [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>,<a href="#225">225</a>,<a href="#245">245</a>,<a href="#299">299</a>]. 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine climax communities occur on 
marginal sites including frost pockets; sites subject to temperature extremes; 
well-drained or droughty, infertile soils; poorly-drained, highly organic soils; 
cold, dry sites; and many sites with soils that are saturated in the spring but 
very dry in late summer [<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>,<a href="#299">299</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>]. For example, extensive climax Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine forests are found on 
pumice sites in south-central Oregon [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>] and on 
associated flats where extended frost pockets occur [<a href="#4">4</a>]. Climax Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine stands are found throughout its range [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>], though they occur predominantly in south-central 
Oregon, Wyoming, and northern 
Colorado [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#225">225</a>]. Though Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is shade intolerant, the mature 
overstory in climax stands is often sparse enough that sufficient light reaches 
the forest floor to allow young Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine to persist and eventually replace 
overstory trees [<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>]. In other climax stands, 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine regeneration occurs by gap phase replacement [<a href="#299">299</a>]. 
Climax Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands produce primarily open cones, so seed is available 
to regenerate in openings created by lightning, fire, mountain pine beetle 
attack, snow breakage, and windthrow [<a href="#275">275</a>,<a href="#299">299</a>].</p>

<p><b>Mountain pine beetle and Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine:</b> 
In fire-generated stands of similar age (seral stands), trees become susceptible 
to mountain pine beetle attack at approximately the same time, resulting in large-scale infestations [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>]. 
Where Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is persistent or climax, mountain pine beetle infests and kills most large 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine. The openings created by beetle kills are seeded by Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine, and the cycle is repeated as other trees reach the size and phloem thickness 
conducive to beetle populations [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>]. Mountain pine beetle 
and other nonfire disturbances effectively thin the larger size classes. 
Combined with patchy fire spread [<a href="#6">6</a>], this complex disturbance regime results in 
multi-storied, mosaic stands consisting of different age and size classes 
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>]. The overall effect is chronic infestations of mountain pine beetle 
due to the constant food source [<a href="#17">17</a>]. </p>

<br />

Ninety percent of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seed germinates by early July 
[<a href="#57">57</a>]. Bud burst occurs in late May and shoot growth generally ends by August, when winter buds 
are formed [<a href="#267">267</a>].

<p>Pollen of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is shed in spring and early summer, with specific dates 
varying both geographically and seasonally [<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#267">267</a>]. Pollen shedding may occur from mid-May to late June 
in the northern part of the range (central Montana north to British Columbia) and as late as mid July 
further south (northern Utah) [<a href="#216">216</a>,<a href="#245">245</a>]. The time at which pollen matures 
appears related to elevation and climate [<a href="#216">216</a>]. </p>

Fertilization occurs approximately 13 months after pollination [<a href="#216">216</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>]. Once fertilized, cones and seeds mature rapidly. 
By late summer or early fall of the 2nd growing season following pollination, they 
are fully mature [<a href="#195">195</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#245">245</a>,<a href="#267">267</a>]. 
Nonserotinous cones open shortly after they 
ripen, usually the latter part of September. Though most seedfall 
occurs in September and October, seed release may extend over several months 
[<a href="#200">200</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#285">285</a>].

<br />

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font> 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine thrives 
under the influence of fire [<a href="#1">1</a>], and on many sites fire is 
essential to Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine dominance [<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>]. In a Colorado study comparing 
subalpine forest stands of similar age 
(250 to 320 years), 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine 
regeneration was significantly greater (p&lt;0.05) in areas that experienced 
surface fire than in areas where fire had not occurred. 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine comprised 41% of total species composition where surface fire was 
a factor, compared to 15% without fire [<a href="#142">142</a>]. 
<p>Serotinous cones are an 
adaptation to stand-replacing fire [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>], and the seed supply is nearly always available 
on the tree. No matter what season the fire occurs the seeds will reach the 
ground soon after, unless the cones burn [<a href="#1">1</a>]. Most Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands are composed of 
trees containing both serotinous and nonserotinous 
cones. The ratio of serotinous to nonserotinous cones seems to be related to 
the fire history of the site; for a full discussion of this topic, 
see <a href="all.html#Cone serotiny">Cone serotiny</a>. 
Other characteristics that contribute to Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine success and 
site dominance following fire are early seed production, prolific seed 
production, high seed viability,  high seedling survival, and rapid growth [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>].</p>

<p><b>Fuels:</b> 
The fuel accumulation in Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands 
varies, resulting in variable fire severity. Rocky Mountain lodgepole 
pine has short needles and does not produce a highly combustible litter layer 
[<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>], and changes in fuel loading over time are affected by decomposition of 
material killed but not consumed by the previous fire, the fall and decay of 
snags, stand development, and the effects of insects and diseases [<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>,<a href="#301">301</a>]. 
Insect infestations and disease, particularly lodgepole pine dwarf-mistletoe (<i>Arceuthobium 
americanum</i>), alter the quantity and spatial distribution of fuels in 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#179">179</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>], setting the stage for mixed-severity 
[<a href="#95">95</a>] or stand-replacing fires [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#179">179</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>]. Fuel loads and fire 
hazard changes also vary according to the function of Rocky Mountain lodgepole 
pine in the stand: whether seral, persistent, or climax.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Seral and persistent:</font> 
The propensity of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine to exhibit high 
seedling density, initial rapid growth that slows with age, and high 
susceptibility to snow breakage, windthrow, lodgepole pine dwarf-mistletoe, and mountain pine 
beetles result in large fuel buildups [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. Stand development, 
vegetation mortality, and fuel accumulation interact dynamically with fire in 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forests. The type and degree of vegetation mortality affect the 
fuel buildup, which in turn determines the severity of later fires and 
subsequent stand regeneration. Historically, much of the 
surface fuel in Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands was probably generated 
following fire. Fuels increase when dense stands of seedlings occur and 
fire-killed trees eventually fall [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>,<a href="#301">301</a>]. Dense stands of Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine result in competition for nutrients, water, and light, 
potentially killing weaker trees, naturally thinning the stand and reducing the 
presence of forbs and shrubs. This competition can result in further fuel 
buildup [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. Density is also related to the 
distribution of fuel; in more open stands a higher proportion of fuel in larger 
size classes can be expected [<a href="#190">190</a>]. Dead stems fall within 20 years resulting in a dense 
network of woody fuels, while associated shade-tolerant trees often develop into 
significant ladder fuels [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>]. Heavy loading of woody fuels increases the 
potential for severe fire behavior, although it may not directly affect ignition 
probability or fire spread [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>]. In dense (5,600-10,400 stems/acre 
(14,000-26,000 stems/ha)) 47-year-old Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands of British Columbia, 
surface fuels were measured at 5-7 pounds/feet<sup>2</sup> (24-34 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) 
of biomass, with 42 to 58% fallen dead woody material and 18 to 26% living 
lodgepole [<a href="#73">73</a>]. Moderately dense immature and mature stands of Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine have the lowest fire 
hazard [<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>], often due to the lack of understory vegetation and the 
self-pruning habit of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine [<a href="#275">275</a>,<a href="#292">292</a>]. In an assessment of fires 
occurring in Yellowstone National Park from 1972 to 1988, Renkin and Despain 
[<a href="#255">255</a>] found that once a fuel moisture threshold is reached (13% fuel moisture in 
dead and down woody fuels &gt;3 inches (7.6 cm) diameter), stand-replacing fire occurs more readily in 
later successional stages of mixed Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine, Engelmann 
spruce, and subalpine fir than in pure successional Rocky Mountain lodgepole 
pine and multiaged Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine types. Strong winds, however, 
are able to buffer or supersede the fuel moisture/forest type influence for 
short durations.</p>

<p>Postfire succession in Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forests is accompanied by important 
changes in the flammability of the forest. The initial successional stages 
generally do not carry  crown fire as readily as  older stages [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. In 
later stages, flammability increases due to the accumulation of surface fuels 
and fuel ladders resulting from downfall and the growth of small trees into the 
forest canopy [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>,<a href="#301">301</a>]. In the early stages of Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine 
succession (1st 40 years), fuels consist mainly of forbs, grasses, and rotten 
logs. As time goes on, the number of rotten logs, tree seedlings, and saplings 
increases. Fires are moderately common at this stage [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. On sites in 
northern Utah, Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir established under Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine within 20 years of stand-replacing fire; during this 
period the fuels configuration and arrangement were conducive to low-severity surface fire that 
would kill the young shade-tolerant tree species while causing little damage to 
the Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine overstory. A study in British Columbia found that though 
surface fire in Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine-dominated stands reduces surface fuels, new 
surface fuel complexes begin developing within the 1st year due to needle shed 
and understory development [<a href="#208">208</a>]. In the absence of surface fires, Engelmann 
spruce and subalpine fir provide vertical continuity into the Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine 
canopy after 40 years. Newly germinated seedlings provide the vertical fuel 
needed for crown fire in about 125 years [<a href="#179">179</a>]. Fuels at middle stages of stand 
development (40-150 years) are nearly all in the crowns of the dense Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine stand because the compact needle litter is difficult to burn, and fires are relatively 
rare. Mature Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands (150-300 years) retain 
the closed canopy but are usually less dense than the previous stage. Most of 
the dead trees have decomposed, understory species are more abundant, and shade 
tolerant tree saplings become more prominent. Fuels in this stage largely 
consist of herbaceous vegetation and low shrubs, though trees killed by bark 
beetles commonly&nbsp; fall and contribute to understory and ladder fuels. Old-growth 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands (300+ years) reflect the 
development of the climax forest as the pioneer Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine die. Fuels at 
this stage are conducive to burning, with young trees contributing to understory 
and ladder 
fuels. Lichen accumulations on older trees may contribute to fuel loading and 
flammability of the trees. The bulk of extreme fire behavior takes place at this 
stage of succession; these stands burn under normal moisture conditions, with 
torching common. If winds are present, crowning and spotting are nearly 
inevitable. Under dry conditions, local crowning and spotting is possible 
without wind; under wet conditions, fires smolder and persist for up to several 
weeks. Most fires occur during this 
stage [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. </p>

<p>Seral Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine occurs in a variety of forest types, and 
may indicate a recent history of severe or repeated burning [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. 
In mixed conifer forests, Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine may be the only successful conifer 
regeneration in the early years following severe fire [<a href="#112">112</a>]. Generally, a fire return interval between 
20 and 125 years yields a closed-successional sequence dominated by 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine. If the fire return interval 
exceeds 125 years, Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is eventually replaced by climax species [<a href="#31">31</a>]. In 
grand fir forests, Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is favored by severe fire at 
intervals less than 200 years, though if a 2nd fire occurs within 20 years of a 
stand-replacement fire, the Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seed source may be eliminated [<a href="#5">5</a>]. Climax species in 
subalpine forests are not fire-tolerant, so 
stand-replacing fires are typical [<a href="#7">7</a>]. In subalpine forests, 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine may be the exclusive dominant 50 years after stand-replacing fire 
and replacement of this seral forest with climax species (subalpine fir, 
Engelmann spruce, mountain hemlock) may take up to 200 years [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>]. Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine is likely to be the postfire dominant if it dominates 
prefire vegetation [<a href="#57">57</a>] and/or a seed source is present, indicating a previous 
fire in the last 2 centuries. If more than 200 years have passed since previous fire, short-lived 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is likely to be gone from the site and not a constituent of seral 
vegetation [<a href="#7">7</a>].  </p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Climax:</font> In old stands there can be large 
fuel buildup due to overstory mortality and slow decay rates. Litter and 
duff are shallow; downed woody fuel loadings depend on the quantity of small 
branches from self-pruning, level of dwarf-mistletoe infestation, and extent of 
overstory mortality [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>]. Grass and shrub fuels are too scattered to be 
effective fire carriers, and crown fuels may also be limited [<a href="#4">4</a>]. The most 
continuous fire vector is logs. Partially decayed logs from earlier disturbances 
carry most fires, and fire behavior is more a function of coarse woody debris 
than of fine-fuel dynamics [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>]. Where fuels are light or discontinuous, rapid 
fire spread and uniform burning only occur during severe climatic conditions 
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>]. Fire hazard may be high, however, when areas of dense Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine have intermingled crowns and low branches reaching surface fuels. Lodgepole pine dwarf-mistletoe infestation increases the potential for 
torching and crowning, and heavy fuel loading associated with mountain pine 
beetle attack increases potential for severe fire. Moderate rates of 
lodgepole pine dwarf-mistletoe infection occur in climax Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine stands, locally increasing surface fuels and vertical fuel 
continuity [<a href="#275">275</a>]. For more information on the successional status of Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine and the effects of disturbance, 
see <a href="all.html#SUCCESSIONAL STATUS">Successional Status</a>.</p>

<p>Older Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands (100+ years) are best represented by model G in 
the National Fire-Danger Rating System, which addresses a dense conifer stand 
that has a heavy accumulation of litter and downed woody material. These stands 
are typically comprised of mature trees influenced by insect, disease, 
wind, or ice damage that create a heavy buildup of dead material on the forest 
floor. Young Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands (&lt;100 years) are best represented by model H 
in the rating system, characterized by healthy stands with sparse undergrowth 
and a thin layer of ground fuels [<a href="#292">292</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Fire behavior:</font> 
Fires in Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine 
stands tend toward 1 of 2 extremes, with intensities ranging in excess of 5,000 kW/m to so low they 
cannot be measured with usual flame-length criteria [<a href="#6">6</a>]. Fires may be 
low-severity surface fire, consuming litter and duff, or high-severity, 
stand-replacing crown fires [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>]. Low- to moderate-severity surface fire thins the understory and prepares a mineral 
seedbed [<a href="#118">118</a>]. Low-intensity fires occur due to  
sparse undergrowth and stand growth habit; cool, moist conditions prevail under 
a dense closed canopy, and fires usually remain on the surface [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. If fuel and weather conditions are right, 
surface fires may torch some trees [<a href="#208">208</a>]. These frequent, low-severity fires may thin 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands without doing serious damage, though they 
may induce fungi or beetle activity [<a href="#215">215</a>]. Frequent fire may prevent successional establishment of more 
shade-tolerant species [<a href="#118">118</a>]. </p>

<p>Severe fires are most likely 
to occur where dead fuels have accumulated. With concentrations of dead fuels, 
individual trees or groups of trees may torch, and fire can continue through the 
crowns aided by high winds [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#215">215</a>]. The open, self-pruning crowns of Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine are less prone to 
crowning than species such as Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir [<a href="#215">215</a>]. The 
chance of crown fire occurring in Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands is governed by the 
amount of heat released from surface fuel, the height of tree crowns above the 
ground, and fire weather conditions [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#215">215</a>]. Severe fires in Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine 
may burn extensive areas, and severity in part determines the 
potential fire behavior of future fires by influencing stand density and fuels 
potential [<a href="#215">215</a>]. In Yellowstone National Park, &quot;intense&quot; fire behavior in 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine 
occurs during extended periods of little or no rainfall. Fuel moistures drop and 
fires are ignited by lightning. Fire spread is mainly through the understory and 
from log to log, occasionally torching out individual trees with some 
short-range spotting. Fires ignited under these conditions may burn for months, 
but most acreage burned is during short-duration crown fire runs. 
&quot;Extreme&quot; fire behavior in the Park occurs when 1) a significant 
understory of ladder fuels is present; 2) 1,000 hour fuel moisture values drop below 10% 
(drought conditions); and 3) there are sustained high winds. Resultant fire behavior is an 
independent crown fire driven by high winds, 
with short-duration sustained runs of 10 miles per hour and long-range spotting. 
Extreme behavior is sustained until significant precipitation occurs, winds 
decline, and/or the fire reaches an area with lower fuel levels [<a href="#292">292</a>]. In a study of 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine/subalpine fir/Engelmann spruce forests of 
Alberta, weather was found to be a stronger influence on fire behavior than 
variations in fuels associated with stand age. Based on fire models, the relative 
importance of fuels diminishes during extreme weather conditions because all 
stands achieve the threshold required to permit crown fire development [<a href="#70">70</a>].</p>

<p>Two biotic factors that have great impact on the fire dynamics of Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine are lodgepole pine dwarf-mistletoe and mountain pine beetle. 
Lodgepole pine dwarf-mistletoe reduces tree 
vigor and may increase mortality, while the type of fire affects the potential 
for lodgepole pine dwarf-mistletoe infection [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#215">215</a>]. A stand thinned by fire may become more susceptible to 
lodgepole pine dwarf-mistletoe [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. Large accumulations of dead material caused by 
periodic beetle infestations result in &quot;very hot&quot; fires when they do occur [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>]. Mountain pine beetle 
preference for large diameter trees dramatically increases fuel loading, and 
within 5 to 20 years the biomass arrangement shifts from a vertical to a 
horizontal distribution, creating a fuel bed conducive to fire spread [<a href="#31">31</a>]. These 
&quot;hot&quot; fires eliminate even tree species generally more resistant to 
fire damage than Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (Douglas-fir); the shade-tolerant species are 
eliminated, returning the stand to pure Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>]. When beetles attack 
a stand they generally remove large trees with sufficiently thick phloem to 
support a brood of larvae. The following few years have a greater probability of 
high-severity fire because of increased fine fuels in the crown or on the forest 
floor. Then fire potential declines until the beetle-killed trees fall. These logs 
may then sustain slow-moving, smoldering fires which can scar trees or kill 
roots, creating stress on adjacent live trees and encouraging further insect or 
disease attack [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>]. Fires in persistent or climax Rocky Mountain lodgepole 
pine forests are not likely to be as 
severe as those in seral forest where large beetle epidemics have occurred. 
Smaller, more continuous fuel deposits are available on the forest floor, though 
lighter fuel accumulations predominate due to lighter infestation levels. 
Mountain pine beetle kills only the larger trees in these multi-storied  stands, resulting 
in a smaller proportion of trees killed than in even-aged seral stands. Lighter fuel accumulations result in fires that eliminate some 
trees but are not likely to cause total regeneration of the stand [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>]. 
Low- to moderate-severity fires that open the stand and expose mineral soil 
seedbeds are more likely [<a href="#113">113</a>]. In the absence of fire, cyclical infestations of 
mountain pine beetle may remove Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine from the stand [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>]. For 
additional information on the effects of dwarf mistletoe and mountain 
pine beetle in Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forests, 
see <a href="all.html#OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">Other Management Considerations</a>.</p>

<p>Fire behavior fuel models developed by the Northern Forest Fire Laboratory (NFFL) can be used to 
predict surface fire behavior in Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forests. The most representative NFFL fire behavior 
fuel model for predicting fire behavior in 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is model 
8, closed timber litter. Model 10, timber litter and understory, best represents 
stands where there is significant down and dead Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine logs. Fire 
behavior fuel model 12, medium logging slash, has been used successfully to predict 
surface fire behavior in stands of lodgepole with 30 tons or more per acre down 
and dead material [<a href="#292">292</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font> 
Natural fire frequency in 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands ranges from a few years to 
200 years [<a href="#118">118</a>]. Fire intervals of 100 to 250 years are characteristic of Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine in the 
northern Rockies [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>]; however, mean fire intervals may be as short as 20 to 
50 years in small stands [<a href="#33">33</a>]. The mean fire interval in subalpine forests (Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine/subalpine fir/Engelmann spruce) of Alberta has been estimated at 90 years [<a href="#70">70</a>]. In a study of fire 
history in the northern Rockies, Arno [<a href="#33">33</a>] found fire in Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine was more frequent and less intense in areas having dry summers. 
Surface fires of low to medium intensity were common, especially on gentle slopes. 
Minimum fire-free intervals in Jasper National Park, Alberta were 1 to 16 years; maximum 
fire-free intervals ranged from 31 to 88 years. Less frequent, large 
stand-replacing fires were prevalent in areas having moist summers [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>]. Fire intervals in 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine have changed over 
time; in a northern Utah study of the Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine cover type, mean fire 
interval during the presettlement period (1700-1855) was 39 years, with a range 
of 12 to 122 years. During the settlement period (1856-1909), the mean fire 
interval was 6 years (range 1-12 years) while no evidence was found for fires 
occurring in the post-settlement suppression period (1910-1988) [<a href="#301">301</a>]. A study in Jasper National Park examined 5 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forests and found mean fire return intervals of 12, 23, 25, 29, and 45 
years, respectively [<a href="#287">287</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine in a mixed-severity fire regime  generally experiences fire 
every 25 to 75 years, while fires at longer intervals (100 to 300 years) and 
patchy burn pattern are 
typical of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine in a stand-replacement fire regime [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Seral and persistent:</font> 
Many Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine communities are subject to a mixed-severity fire regime, 
where a combination of low, moderate, and high severity fires occurs over space 
and time [<a href="#4">4</a>]. Fire scars in some Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine communities attest to a 
sequence of low severity surface fires [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  In areas where Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine functions in both early and late seral roles 
(Colorado, Yellowstone National Park, south-central Oregon), Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine 
forests exhibit a moderate severity fire regime, tied closely with disturbance 
by insects and disease. In large patches, the average fire return 
interval is 60 to 80 years, though individual trees may reach 300+ years. In 
small patches, fire return intervals mimic those of surrounding forest types [<a href="#6">6</a>]. 
Mixed-severity fire regimes consist of a combination of understory and 
stand-replacement fires, and any given location within a mixed-fire regime could 
experience some stand-replacement fires, some nonlethal fires, and a 
number of mixed-severity fires. Fuels are variable and complex 
in this regime, with patches of postfire regeneration and uneven accumulations 
of woody fuels due to irregular occurrence of mortality factors (fire, insects, 
disease). Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is subject to a mixed severity fire regime where fine 
surface fuels and dry climate facilitate lower intensity fires. Where an 
accumulation of down woody, ladder, and crown fuels occur, Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine stands 
with sufficient fuel are more likely to support stand-replacing surface or crown 
fire. Fuel loading is indirectly related to stand age in stand replacement 
regimes. Young dense stands containing ladder fuels of associated spruce and 
fir, and accumulated downfall from a former beetle-killed or fire-killed 
overstory have high potential to support a stand-replacement fire. Pole-size stands of 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine 
(with sparse lower limbs) arising after 
a burn that removed most large fuels, have low potential to support fire. As 
trees age, susceptibility to bark beetle attack and lodgepole pine 
dwarf-mistletoe damage 
increases, resulting in an accumulation of woody fuel that adds to the potential 
of stand-replacement fire [<a href="#35">35</a>]. High elevation sites (8,000 feet in Wyoming) support slow-growing subalpine 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forests with sparse understories and less mountain pine 
beetle-created fuels; these stands may require up to 300 years to accumulate 
enough fuel to sustain a spreading fire, though the fires will likely be 
stand-replacing when they do occur [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>]. In cool,&nbsp;high-elevation 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forests, dead material decays slowly, 
encouraging accumulation [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].</p>

<p>Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine/subalpine fir sites in 
north-central Idaho average mixed severity underburns every 39 years. As these 
stands age, fire hazard decreases over time followed by an increase in stand 
flammability at later successional stages (150-300 years old) [<a href="#51">51</a>]. On 
sites in northern Idaho, Barrett and Arno [<a href="#54">54</a>] found 
stands of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine and subalpine fir in a mixed-severity fire 
regime showed a mean return interval of 117 years for stand-replacing fire and a 
43-year mean return interval for surface fire. In a broader 
study of sites in the northern Rockies, Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine/subalpine fir forests 
experienced stand replacing fires every 112 years (mean interval) and 
understory/mixed severity burns every 47 years (mean interval) [<a href="#86">86</a>]. A study in western larch-Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine forests of Glacier National Park showed sites with a relatively dry climate 
and gentle topography experienced a mixed-severity fire regime ranging from nonlethal underburns to stand-replacing fires at 
mean intervals ranging from 25 to 75 
years, depending on the site. Steeper, wetter sites experienced a regime of 
infrequent stand-replacing fires at mean intervals ranging from 140 to 340 years, 
depending on the site [<a href="#55">55</a>]. 
Less frequent (100+ years) but more severe fires result in dense, even-aged 
stands of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine, often in higher elevation forests. Where more frequent 
(25-50+ years), creeping surface fires predominate (lower elevations of the 
subalpine zone) Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands are often 2- or 3-aged [<a href="#156">156</a>]. Barrett [<a href="#52">52</a>] found 
that low elevation Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine sites (&lt;5,900 feet (1,800 m)) in Yellowstone National Park 
experienced short to moderate fire-return intervals (25-150 years) with fires burning 
in a mixed severity pattern. Higher elevation (&gt;6,900 feet (2,100 m)) sites were subject to 
stand-replacing fires at long fire intervals (300-400 years) [<a href="#52">52</a>]. On 
relatively moist north slopes of the Yellowstone Plateau (6,500-10,800 feet (2,000-3,300 m)), 
stand-replacing fires occur at mean intervals of 200 years [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>]. Drier south slopes experience a shorter interval between 
stand-replacing fires (178-year mean interval), with evidence of some partial 
replacement fires that triggered new seral age classes 20 to 80 years after 
stand initiation [<a href="#53">53</a>].</p>

<p><font size="4" face="Bell MT">Climax:</font> 
Climax Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forests also have a mixed-severity fire regime, which in combination with insects 
and disease create multi-aged stands [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].  Fire return intervals in this fire regime 
range from 40-60 years in south-central Oregon (the most concentrated area of 
climax Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forest) [<a href="#5">5</a>]. Young stands of Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine in these 
communities are open with occasional dense patches [<a href="#113">113</a>]. Mature forest 
structure develops in relation to disturbance history and site conditions [<a href="#275">275</a>]. 
Low-severity fires maintain a mosaic of open canopy lodgepole in different size 
and age classes, though stand-replacement fires are possible during droughts 
with high winds. Patchy or low-severity fire thins the stand and exposes a 
seedbed for regeneration, favoring Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine regeneration from open cones 
[<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>]. Severe fires in climax stands reinitiate the Rocky Mountain lodgepole 
pine forest 
[<a href="#113">113</a>]. Climax Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands are generally small and isolated, and may be 
strongly affected by changes in the fire regime of neighboring stands [<a href="#275">275</a>].</p>

lodgepole pine occurs are summarized below. For further information regarding fire regimes and fire

<br />

Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is susceptible to fire; thin bark renders it 
vulnerable to fire-kill due to cambium heating [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>]. 
However, mature Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine can survive low-severity fire 
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>]. In a British Columbia study of Rocky Mountain lodgepole 
pine-dominated stands, low-intensity surface fire resulted in little mortality 
of mature Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine, though trees may be scorched to a 
height of several feet. Advance regeneration, however, was almost completely 
killed because of thin bark near the root collar and low crowns exposed to flame 
[<a href="#208">208</a>]. Crown scorch followed by basal scorch&nbsp;is the best predictor of mortality following fire [<a href="#243">243</a>,<a href="#313">313</a>].

Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is moderately fire resistant in open stands due to 
light fuel characteristics and&nbsp;an open canopy [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>]. 

<p>Non-drought stressed Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine can transport substantial amounts of water 
to heated, foliated branches. This mechanism slows the rate of drying for 
branches subject to intense heat, therefore influencing crown ignition 
susceptibility and fire behavior [<a href="#102">102</a>].</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE">
PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Growth response:
Individual Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine may exhibit accelerated ring growth after fire due to 
improved site conditions (nutrient release and increased sunlight) and attempts 
to &quot;heal over&quot; fire wounds [<a href="#10">10</a>]. Peterson and others [<a href="#244">244</a>] found, however, that 70% of surviving 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine on sites in eastern 
Idaho experienced a decline in radial growth following fire. Percent of basal 
scorch and crown scorch had the greatest negative correlation with postfire growth.

<p>Regeneration: 
Though it has thin bark, serotinous Rocky Mountain lodgepole 
pine is a fire evader due to 
the production of serotinous cones [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>]. This adaptation ensures 
reestablishment following fire [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>]. Serotinous cones are retained 
on trees for many years, which results in the release of large numbers of seeds 
when heat from a fire causes the cones to open [<a href="#27">27</a>]. While most Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pines are killed by fire, they still provide an abundant seed supply [<a href="#1">1</a>]. 
However, severe crown fire may consume or kill most of the seed stored in the 
canopy, regardless of serotinous cones [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#215">215</a>]. For more information on the 
relationship between Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine regeneration and fire, see 
<a href="all.html#REGENERATION PROCESSES">Regeneration Processes</a>.</p>

<p>Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine also exhibits an invader response to fire, pioneering plant 
succession following disturbance [<a href="#4">4</a>].
In one study, recovery of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine in grand fir habitat types of 
northeastern Oregon ranged from 15 to 20% cover by postfire year 5 and 50% cover 
by postfire year 10, with higher rates of cover corresponding to increased fire 
severity. In subalpine fir habitat types, postfire year 5 Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine cover 
ranged from 10 to 80% [<a href="#181">181</a>].</p>

<br />

Individual fire killed or injured Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine are susceptible 
to insect attack [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>]. Two years after the Yellowstone fires of 1988, 44% of 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine in 1 study was 
infested by pine engraver beetles; 95% of the infested trees had been scorched by fire. The rate 
of infestation increased with the percent of basal circumference girdled by fire 
[<a href="#23">23</a>]. Antiaggregative pheromones may help protect these 
heat injured trees by reducing attack and gallery densities, rendering attacks 
&quot;unsuccessful&quot; [<a href="#24">24</a>]. Though mountain pine beetles are not especially 
attracted to fire-injured trees until the trees are weakened by decay [<a href="#275">275</a>], fire exclusion renders old-growth 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands 
more susceptible to attack due to the 
predominance of older, larger trees [<a href="#14">14</a>].

<p>Fire exclusion also encourages dwarf-mistletoe infestation, which in turn 
decreases stand vigor and increases fuel generation rates, increasing stand 
vulnerability to severe fire damage [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#191">191</a>]. Prescribed fire may eliminate 
infected residual trees in harvested areas and remove heavily infected stands on 
unproductive sites so they can be replaced by young, healthy stands [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#232">232</a>,<a href="#316">316</a>]. However, if 
infected trees do remain on the site they can quickly spread the parasite to 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pines in the 
developing understory [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. If prescribed 
fire is used to reduce dwarf-mistletoe in Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forests, stand-replacing 
fires are required in order to remove the infected trees [<a href="#191">191</a>,<a href="#316">316</a>]. Survival of infected 
trees results in increased dwarf mistletoe infection rates in the postfire 
stands [<a href="#191">191</a>]. Fire Case Study 3 provides an example of using prescribed fire to 
treat lodgepole pine dwarf-mistletoe infestation.</p>

<p>Fire exclusion encourages the establishment of shade-tolerant species in 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forests, which may increase the risk of severe fires due 
to the low branches and thin bark [<a href="#301">301</a>]. Prescribed burning may be used to 
regenerate Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine in stagnating stands, opening the stand and 
encouraging seedlings [<a href="#275">275</a>].  Opportunities to use understory burning in climax 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands are 
limited because Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is susceptible to fire-kill; when fuels are moist 
enough to protect mature trees, surface fires burn patchily or are difficult to 
sustain unless conducted in late fall after a killing 
frost has dried fine fuels [<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>]. Keane and Arno [<a href="#189">189</a>] provide details 
for using late-season prescribed fire favoring Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine and 
whitebark pine. In addition, climax Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forests often contain little surface fuel, 
so fires move slowly and consume little but logs [<a href="#4">4</a>].</p>

<p>The primary use of prescribed fire in Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine has been hazard reduction and 
site preparation in conjunction with tree harvesting and subsequent 
regeneration. Broadcast burning and pile and windrow burning have been the most 
often used methods of accomplishing these tasks [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>]. Where broadcast burning has been 
used in slash treatment, postfire regeneration of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine depends on seed 
remaining on site or on the proximity of seed sources [<a href="#156">156</a>]. On sites in central Montana, broadcast burning 
slash following clearcutting 
resulted in the destruction of seed present on site (in cones and litter) and a 
reduction in seedling establishment relative to mechanical treatment of logging 
slash [<a href="#76">76</a>]. Burning of the seedbed following harvest resulted in uniformly 
low Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stocking [<a href="#77">77</a>]. On sites in central Idaho where 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is largely nonserotinous, more seedlings established on sites 
subject to light scarification than on sites that were broadcast burned [<a href="#144">144</a>]. However, broadcast burning or piling and 
burning logging residue following clearcut harvest in Rocky Mountain lodgepole 
pine stands reduces fuel loads and fire potential [<a href="#85">85</a>], and releases nutrients more 
rapidly for use by tree seedlings [<a href="#121">121</a>]. On sites in British Columbia, Haeussler and others [<a href="#149">149</a>] found  
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine growth was 
enhanced by site preparation treatment severity. Even low-severity 
mechanical treatment resulted in greater stem volume than no treatment, and 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine on sites where slash was windrowed and burned experienced the 
highest growth rates [<a href="#149">149</a>]. Two years after harvest in Wyoming, growth and 
survival of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seedlings was greater on sites where 
harvest residue was piled and burned or broadcast burned than on sites where 
residue was spread or removed [<a href="#213">213</a>]. Another study in Wyoming found Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine 
planted after clearcutting exhibited greater 
height growth and survival (90% compared to 50-60%) on scarified and broadcast 
burned sites than on sites where residue was chipped and spread or removed [<a href="#266">266</a>]. An evaluation of harvest 
residue treatments in Washington found that 5 years after treatment, height 
growth of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine on sites broadcast burned in the spring substantially 
exceeded height growth for other treatments. Treatments also included piling and 
burning, pulling unmerchantable material, chopping residue, fall broadcast burning, 
clearing, and no treatment. No treatment of residue resulted in higher survival 
and growth of seedlings than mechanical treatments [<a href="#315">315</a>]. Lopushinsky and others [<a href="#212">212</a>] found that height 
growth of  Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seedlings 2 
years after planting was greater on sites where harvest residue was piled and burned or 
broadcast burned than on sites where residue was left in place or removed. In 
contrast, a study conducted in northwest Montana found that Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine 
regeneration density was 89% less on sites where slash was piled and burned than 
on unburned sites. Growth of trees on burned sites was approximately 20% of 
growth on unburned sites [<a href="#298">298</a>].</p>

<p>Muir [<a href="#228">228</a>] found that relative density of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine was higher 
following fire than following clearcutting, reflecting the abundant release of 
seeds from serotinous cones. Some seed is released from serotinous cones when 
harvest slash is piled and burned; however, many seeds are destroyed in the 
intense heat and are not well scattered across the area [<a href="#228">228</a>]. Habitat type may be important in 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine establishment after 
prescribed fire or mechanical treatment, based on competition and the relative 
presence of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine in the pretreatment stand [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. The 
following table offers estimates of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seed:seedling ratios for different site 
conditions in southwestern Montana

Thinning of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands can reduce fire spread and a stand's 
resistance to fire control when accompanied by slash treatments, including whole 
tree removal as well as stem removal with either lopping and scattering or 
piling and burning of remaining slash. Piling and burning 
of slash results in the greatest fuel reduction. Without slash treatment, more 
fuel becomes available for combustion and contributes to extreme fire behavior [<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>]. 
Fuel reduction treatments in Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (removal of downed logs and 
reduction of stand density) result in increased chipmunk (<i>Tamius</i> spp.) populations and 
decreased populations of red squirrels, snowshoe hares, and southern red-backed voles [<a href="#89">89</a>]. 
Successful broadcast burning usually yields increased 
forage production for big game [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>], and elk may also consume burned 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine 
bark [<a href="#178">178</a>].

Big Prairie: 55% of the burn area is shortgrass prairie. Dominant grasses are 
rough fescue (<i>Festuca altaica</i>), Idaho fescue (<i>Festuca idahoensis</i>), and 
Richardson's needlegrass (<i>Achnatherum richardsonii</i>). Thirty-five percent of the burn area is open 
ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>) savanna with an understory of grasses and 
forbs. The remaining 10% of the site is characterized by dense Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus 
contorta</i> var. <i>latifolia</i>) stands.

<p>Round Prairie: 35% of the burn area is shortgrass prairie similar in 
composition to Big Prairie. Another 35% is sagebrush steppe dominated by big sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i>). 
Grasses and forbs are sparse. The remaining 30% of the site 
includes a mixture of Engelmann spruce (<i>Picea engelmannii</i>), Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga 
menziesii</i>), and Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forest.</p>

Prescribed fire objectives related to Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine included: 1) a reduction of 
tree encroachment (primarily Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine) into prairies by decreasing the 
number of&nbsp; trees &lt;2.5 cm dbh by 70-100% and trees 2.5-7.5 cm by 30-70%; and 
2) a reduction of fuel loadings in the forest inclusions by 30-70%.

<p>Burning conditions were less favorable in Round Prairie and fire behavior was 
less severe. High fuel moisture in the forest inclusions and lack of wind led to 
little burning in the forests and virtually no fire in the sagebrush area of 
Round Prairie. Fire weather and fuel conditions were as follows:</p>

Initial analysis of the tree encroachment transects shows that the burns were 
successful in killing some of the encroaching trees. In Big Prairie 9% of Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine trees were  dead following the fire. Three 
percent of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine was  dead in Round Prairie. Using a model developed by Ryan and 
Reinhardt [<a href="#260">260</a>], 100% and 80% Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine mortality (for Big 
Prairie and Round Prairie, respectively) is predicted as a result of the 
prescribed fire. Mortality is modeled based on crown scorch and tree size. 
According to authors of the model, the model may over-predict mortality for 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine that burns in very low-intensity fire (Kevin Ryan, 
personal communication given in [<a href="#203">203</a>].<p>Number of preburn alive Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine, postburn dead Rocky

Prescribed fire goals were partially met. If actual tree mortality approaches 
the predictions, then the goal to reduce tree encroachment will have been 
exceeded. High predicted mortality in Round Prairie indicates that burning in 
marginal conditions may be beneficial if the goal is to reduce Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine 
encroachment. An analysis of postburn mortality and fuel loads is necessary to further 
determine the success of the burns.

The study was conducted in the subalpine fir (<i>Abies lasiocarpa</i>) zone. Two 
adjacent but different-aged stands were burned. One area was a Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus 
contorta </i>var.<i> latifolia</i>) thicket about 100 years old. The 2nd area was an older, 
decadent stand of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine with subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce (<i>Picea

<br />


The burned area is a southwest-facing gentle slope (0 to 20%) at an elevation of&nbsp; 
5,596 to 5,776 feet (1,706-1,761 m). A total of 27 acres (10.9 ha) were burned.</p>
<p>Climate: The climate is typical of most areas within the subalpine zone. The 
winters are cold and wet and the summers cool and dry. Frost and freezing 
temperatures can occur during any month of the year. Over 70% of precipitation 
falls as snow between October and March.

<p>Soil and duff: The 2 stands have similar soils, but the soil in the snag 
area is more fertile and better developed. In both areas surface soils are 
derived from basalt residuum, have a clay-loam texture, and average 6 inches 
(15.2 cm) deep. The effective rooting depth is less than 20 inches (51 cm) in 
the thicket area, and 20 to 40 inches (51-102 cm) in the snag area. On both 
sites, duff was generally from 1 to 4 inches (2.5-10.2 cm) thick. The mean depth 
of duff was 2.3 inches (5.9 cm) on the thicket area, and 1.9 inches (4.9 cm) on 
the snag area.</p>

<p>Fuel loading: Prior to burning, mean fuel loads were as follows:</p>

FIRE DESCRIPTION:</a>
</span>
<br />


The fire was ignited by drip torches on September 30, 1975, taking approximately 
1 hour and 20 minutes to ignite the entire 27 acres (10.9 ha). Conditions 
at the time of ignition were as follows: </p>
<p>ambient air temperature: 60 to 63 degrees Fahrenheit (16-17 <sup>o</sup>C)<br>relative humidity: 19 to 21%<br>
wind: calm; gusts to 15.6 mph (26 km/hr) from the south-southwest<br>days since last rain: 15<br>
fine fuel moisture content: 13%

<p>Within about 10 minutes after ignition, trees began to crown out. Fire 
behavior for each area is summarized below.</p>

<p>Snag area - Crowning occurred throughout most of the snag area. Flame heights 
were estimated to be 125 feet (38 m) by 1 observer, and 50 feet (15 m) above the 
tops of 90-foot (27 m) crowns by 2 other observers. The fire consumed all small 
down and dead wood from <u>&lt;</u>1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter, as well as needles 
and small twigs on living standing trees. Ninety-six percent of down and dead fuels &lt;3 inches 
(7.6 cm) in diameter were consumed. In general, 90 to 100% of the duff layer was 
removed. Many trees &lt;3 inches in diameter at the base were completely consumed, 
and nearly all standing snags were blown down or burned down. Where crowning 
occurred, the only thing that remained immediately following the fire was 
reddened soil, ash-covered soil, large-diameter logs, and dead trees.</p>

<p>Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine thicket - Fire within the lodgepole thicket was 
much less severe. The crown fire that occurred within the snag area stopped when 
it met the boundary of the Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine thicket. Dead and down fuels &lt;3 inches in 
diameter were reduced by 70%. Dead and down fuels &gt;3 inches in diameter were 
reduced 34%. Duff was reduced about 25%.</p>



<span class="subframeContent">
<a name="FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES(2nd CASE STUDY)">
FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES:</a>
</span>
<br />


On portions of the burn where crowning occurred, all Rocky Mountain lodgepole 
pines were 
killed. In the lodgepole thicket area the fire did not crown, and some trees 
survived. In this area of Washington, Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is 
predominantly nonserotinous. Within 1 year of the fire, Rocky Mountain lodgepole 
pine seedlings 
established 
on the burned area, but were restricted to areas along the burn edge and near 
survivors within the Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine thicket area.


<br><br>



<span class="subframeContent">
<a name="FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS(2nd CASE STUDY)">
FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />


Fire hazard and the potential for a high-severity crown fire are high in 
decadent Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands succeeding to shade-tolerant associates. 
The large accumulation of dead and down woody fuels burned intensely, and the 
young conifers provided a fuel ladder to ignite the crowns of overstory trees. In 
this study, there was about twice as much dead and down woody fuels in the snag 
area (area subject to crown fire) as in the thicket area (crown fire 
unsupported).

<p>Fuel loadings increased within 1 year after burning. The magnitude and rate 
of increase was dependent on the amount of standing fuels that fell to the 
ground.</p>

<p>Tree seedling re-establishment patterns suggested tree regeneration was 
restricted to areas adjacent to viable seed sources. In areas where Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine is largely nonserotinous (as in the study area), seed 
for regeneration must come from survivors. The occasional mature tree that survives fire, those 
escaping fire in small, unburned pockets, and trees adjacent to burned areas 
provide seed to colonize burned areas. Because Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine's seed dispersal 
distance is relatively short, seedling establishment is restricted to areas 
around these seed trees. Tree regeneration in areas experiencing crown fires is 
principally a function of seed migration during good seed years from outside the 
burned area.</p>

Vegetation of this area can be grouped into 2 broad categories: shrub-grass 
openings and coniferous forests. Coniferous forests in the area are dominated by 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus contorta </i>var.<i> latifolia</i>), although Engelmann spruce 
(<i>Picea engelmannii</i>), subalpine 
fir (<i>Abies lasiocarpa</i>), quaking aspen (<i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and 
Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii </i>var. <i>glauca</i>) also occur. Limber pine (<i>Pinus 
flexilis</i>) and Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine (<i>P. aristata</i>) are present as 
scattered individuals. 

<p>The 5 Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands selected for treatment by prescribed burning varied 
in structure. Density of mature stems ranged from 1,783 to 6,243 stems/acre (713-2,497/ha), and seedling 
density ranged from 545 to 16,500 stems/acre (218-6,600/ha). Trees greater than 
4.5 feet (1.37) m in height had 
average diameters of 1.8 to 6.5 inches (4.5-16.6 cm) and total heights of 10.8 
to 41.3 feet (3.3-12.6 m). Tree crowns 
ranged from 8.8 to 27.9 feet (2.7-8.5 m) in length, from 3 to 7 feet (0.93-2.18 m) wide, and were from 
2 to 19.4 feet (0.64-5.92 m) above the ground. Depth of duff layers prior to burning ranged from 
1.2 to 2.8 inches (3-7 cm). Stand selection was based on the following criteria: absence of 
timber harvesting activity; presence of lodgepole pine dwarf-mistletoe (<i>Arceuthobium 
americanum)</i> infection; no plans for 
intensive management; accessibility for fire control equipment; and presence of 
natural barriers or fuel breaks that facilitated prescribed burn control and 
safety. Stands ranged in size from 6 to 16 ha and contained a variety of age 
classes, size classes, densities, and downed-fuel accumulations.</p>

<sup>c</sup>Dashed line indicates missing or incomplete observations. Observed fire behavior 
characteristics are given for surface fires and are not representative of crown fires.</font>

<p>Stand 1 burned with a combination of heading and backing surface fires and 
passive and active crown fires. Portions of this stand were consumed by passive 
crown fires having flames extending to 20 m above the aerial fuel stratum. Other 
portions of the stand were completely engulfed by active crown fires.</p>

<p>Stand 2 burned with heading and backing surface fires and occasional passive 
crown fires. The surface fires ranged in intensity from low (with some areas of 
the stand unburned) to moderate. Where severely dwarf-mistletoe infected trees had 
witches' brooms close to the ground, fires spread vertically into 
the tree crown.</p>

<p>Stand 3 possessed substantial quantities of dead fuel and tree regeneration 
in addition to the overstory. Types of fires included heading and backing 
surface fires and high intensity passive crown fires. Nearly  the entire upslope 
portion of the stand was consumed by the high intensity passive crown fire. The 
lower slope portion burned with more variability in fire behavior. Some areas 
did not burn  or were burned by slow-moving, low-intensity backing fires, 
heading surface fires, and passive crown fires. Flames ranged from 5 to 10 m 
above the tops of tree crowns.</p>

<p>No observations were made during the burning of stand 4. A combination of 
active crown fire and surface fire resulted in an erratic burn pattern. In areas 
that were unburned, some trees and herbaceous vegetation suffered mortality due 
to heat generated by crown fire in other parts of the stand.</p>

<p>Stand 5 burned with variable fire intensities and fire types including 
heading and backing surface fires and passive, active, and independent crown 
fires. The upslope portion of the unit was consumed by moderate- to high-intensity surface fires 
that frequently turned into passive crown fires. These 
fires then torched individual or groups of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine trees. The lower 
portion of the stand burned with a moderate- to high-intensity surface headfire. 
Prior to reaching previously burned areas further up the slope, the surface fire 
spread into the aerial fuel stratum. Then, in the absence of excessive winds and 
a surface fire, an independent crown fire spread through the tree crowns and 
reached the top of the slope.</p>

FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES:</a>

Prescribed burning in this study resulted in a substantial reduction in mature 
live stem density. This reduction was the direct result of tree mortality from 
crown scorch, crown consumption, and bole damage. Mortality on 6 of 11 plots 
exceeded 75%, and 2 plots had 100% tree mortality. These plots did not 
experience the highest levels of fire intensity; however, the levels of 
intensity attained by fires in these stands were maintained over larger areas, 
resulting in greater mortality. The highest fire intensities were confined to 
relatively small areas, resulting in less mortality. Plots where the lowest fire 
intensities occurred and burns were the most incomplete had the lowest tree 
mortality.

<p>Postburn measurements showed slight increases in average tree diameters and 
total height of trees in most plots,  reductions in length of live crowns, and 
increases in distance from the ground to crown bases. These trends may be 
attributed to the relatively greater susceptibility of smaller trees to fire 
damage.</p>

<p>Prior to prescribed burning, the accumulation of downed woody fuels ranged 
from 60 to 85 tons/ha. The majority of this fuel was in larger size classes 
(7.62+ cm), presumably due to dwarf-mistletoe-caused mortality. The prescribed 
burns substantially lowered total fuel loadings in all stands except stand 4, 
where fire resulted in a reduction of fuels in the 0- to 0.6-cm size class and no 
change or a slight increase in the remaining fuel classes. Increases were 
attributed to the addition of previously standing stems to the surface fuel bed. 
In all other stands, prescribed burning reduced fuels in all size classes. Fuel 
consumption was greatest in those stands having the least amount of incomplete 
or patchy burning. Duff consumption ranged from 45 to 70%.</p>

FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS:</a>

<br />


Lodgepole pine dwarf-mistletoe infection was present in all stands at relatively high levels 
prior to prescribed burning. In this study, prescribed burning had the net 
effect of causing an overall reduction in the level of lodgepole pine 
dwarf-mistletoe infection. Some stands were sanitized by 100% mortality. Fire is 
an important natural factor in controlling lodgepole pine dwarf-mistletoe. Most effective 
control of lodgepole pine dwarf-mistletoe occurs when host trees are killed by high-intensity fires. Prescribed 
burning to reduce lodgepole pine dwarf-mistletoe infection is most effective 
when most of or the entire stand is burned. Increased surface fuel loads, 
fuel ladder situations, and fuel moisture conditions common to summer and fall 
seasons make control of these types of prescribed fires difficult. Since the 
objectives include 75-100% mortality, burning under conditions more conducive to 
crown fire development is necessary.

Prescribed fire may be&nbsp; undesirable in stands lacking good access, 
possessing commercial wood product values, adjoining areas of higher value 
timber, or having low surface fuel accumulations. Where nonuniform stand 
structure and heavy lodgepole pine dwarf mistletoe infection are present, variation in fire 
behavior, incomplete fuel consumption, and patchy tree mortality can be 
expected, making accomplishment of objectives difficult. Follow-up treatments by 
mechanical, chemical, or physical methods may be necessary if prescribed burning 
results in incomplete mortality.

Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is frequently used in reforestation efforts, particularly in 
northern Europe [<a href="#309">309</a>]. It is successfully used to revegetate mine sites [<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#146">146</a>,<a href="#303">303</a>]. There are 
approximately 1,000 Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seeds per pound [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>], though seed amounts may vary geographically 
[<a href="#115">115</a>].

<p>Though it grows well on nutrient poor soils, nitrogen fertilizer may 
enhance growth of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine [<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#249">249</a>,<a href="#250">250</a>,<a href="#307">307</a>]. 
A field study in British Columbia found that nitrogen-fertilized Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine 
experienced 34% greater stem volume increase than unfertilized trees after 8 
growing seasons [<a href="#250">250</a>]. However, 
low nitrogen may  enhance cold-hardiness in containerized Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine 
seedlings [<a href="#130">130</a>], and added nitrogen may  cause phosphorus deficiencies 
[<a href="#307">307</a>] and nitrogen-sulphur 
imbalances [<a href="#83">83</a>]. Thinning of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine may increase nitrogen 
fixation by understory vegetation (e.g. russet buffaloberry), improving growth of remaining trees [<a href="#159">159</a>]. 
Height and diameter growth of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seedlings are higher following 
inoculation with ectomycorrhizae [<a href="#146">146</a>].</p>

<p>Fresh Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seeds need no stratification; however, when seeds have 
been stored, stratification for 30 to 56 days may hasten germination and/or 
improve overall germination rates [<a href="#158">158</a>,<a href="#200">200</a>,<a href="#209">209</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>]. Soaking 
the seeds in cold water for 1 to 2 days then storing while damp in plastic bags 
at 33 to 41 degrees Fahrenheit (0.5-5.0 <sup>o</sup>C) is the most effective 
stratification procedure [<a href="#209">209</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>]. If seeds have not yet matured, they 
may be damaged by cold stratification [<a href="#158">158</a>]. Seed 
lot germinability of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine may be improved using the IDS 
(incubation-desiccation-separation) technique [<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#271">271</a>], which can increase germinability 
as much as 38% [<a href="#127">127</a>]. Approximately 4 weeks of acclimation 
increases frost hardiness and root growth capacity of Rocky Mountain lodgepole 
pine seedlings, improving 
the success of containerized planting [<a href="#273">273</a>].</p>

<p>Based on laboratory and field experiments, growth potential, morphology, cold 
hardiness, and periodicity of shoot elongation may vary between populations of 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine, with a large 
proportion (up to 77% in Utah, 83% in Idaho and Wyoming) of the variation 
attributed to the elevation and geographic location of the seed source [<a href="#253">253</a>,<a href="#254">254</a>]. Lester and others [<a href="#210">210</a>]

fence rails [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#195">195</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>]. It is also important in 
plywood, fiberboard, and composite/laminate products [<a href="#195">195</a>]. Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine 
contributed greatly to the early economic development of the northern and 
central Rocky Mountain regions. Between 1975 and 1985, annual lumber production 
from lodgepole averaged between 500 and 700 million board feet. In Montana, 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine provided 25% of the timber processed in 1981 [<a href="#294">294</a>]. Utilization potential of 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands in Montana is addressed by Benson and Strong [<a href="#68">68</a>], and Koch [<a href="#195">195</a>] 
provides discussion regarding 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine 
growth characteristics relative to merchantable material. An example of 
relationships between stand age, stocking level, tree development and typical 
yield in natural stands of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (in Montana and Idaho) is presented 
below [<a href="#216">216</a>]:</p>

OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Feeding damage by snowshoe hares, red squirrels, porcupines, pocket gophers, and 
voles may damage small-diameter Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine, substantially 
reducing growth in the 
seedling and sapling stages [<a href="#136">136</a>,<a href="#283">283</a>,<a href="#284">284</a>]. 
Pocket gophers damage seedlings by root pruning and a combination of stem 
girdling and clipping [<a href="#195">195</a>]. In a study of planted Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine, seedlings suffered 
49.2% mortality due to pocket gophers [<a href="#136">136</a>]. Winter feeding on seedlings by pocket 
gophers can also substantially reduce Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine regeneration (up to 44% of 
planted seedlings in the 1st year) [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#195">195</a>].

<p>Dense stands of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine are particularly susceptible to stagnation, snow 
breakage, windthrow, dwarf-mistletoe, and mountain pine beetle attack, as well 
as a range of other insects and diseases [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#136">136</a>,<a href="#174">174</a>,<a href="#195">195</a>]. Damage caused by these various factors may vary with site 
conditions and stand characteristics [<a href="#174">174</a>,<a href="#195">195</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Insects and Disease:</b></font> 
The mountain pine beetle is the most serious insect 
pest in mature Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands, periodically killing most of the 
large-diameter trees in a stand [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#175">175</a>]. The beetle primarily 
attacks trees that are large enough to have sufficient phloem thickness to 
support the insect larvae [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>]. Generally trees 14 inches (35.6 cm) and greater in diameter attract the mountain 
pine beetle, with smaller trees being attacked after these larger trees are 
killed [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>]. Infestations continue until the phloem 
thickness of live trees is no longer sufficient as a food source. Trees smaller than 6 inches (15.2 cm) in diameter are rarely killed [<a href="#14">14</a>]. Periodicity of infestations is related to rapidity with which a stand of 
trees grows into diameter-phloem distributions conducive to beetle population buildup [<a href="#18">18</a>]. With each 
outbreak, mountain pine beetle kills most of the large, 
dominant Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine. After the outbreak, Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine and the 
shade-tolerant associates increase their growth. When the Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pines are of 
adequate size and phloem thickness, another beetle infestation occurs [<a href="#17">17</a>]. This cycle repeats at 20- to 40-year 
intervals unless and until Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is 
eliminated from the stand [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>]. A fire may interrupt the sere at any 
time and return the stand to pure Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine [<a href="#17">17</a>]. In even-aged 
stands, mountain pine beetle infestations kill large numbers of trees at once 
[<a href="#113">113</a>]. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine snags produced by beetle attacks may remain 
standing for more than 10 years; in 1 Oregon study, 38% of snags remained 
standing after 8 years [<a href="#88">88</a>]. Though Rocky Mountain lodgepole 
pine stands at low elevations are described as more susceptible to mountain pine 
beetle attacks due to detrimental climatic effects on the beetle at higher 
elevations [<a href="#20">20</a>], recent studies indicate that higher elevation whitebark pine 
forests may be more susceptible. Six [<a href="#274">274</a>] found that in Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine and whitebark pine stands in western Montana, mountain pine 
beetles preferred trees with relatively thin phloem thickness, thin bark, and 
low sapwood moisture, requirements that may be met better by whitebark pine. 
Larvae survival and adult beetle emergence were also greater in whitebark pine 
compared to Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine of similar dbh [<a href="#274">274</a>]. In some cases, 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine phloem is so thin that beetle attack may result in 
only strip kills of cambium that can be mistaken for fire scars [<a href="#6">6</a>]. Practical silvicultural 
control of mountain pine beetle infestation is 
the harvest of stands containing a large proportion of suitable trees 
accompanied by burning of unmerchantable material, and the regeneration of a new 
stand. In stands with a high stocking of smaller diameter trees, harvest of only 
the older, larger trees effectively regulates the mountain pine beetle [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>]. 
However, Mitchell and others [<a href="#224">224</a>] suggest that heavy thinning of 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands from below may 
improve the vigor of the remaining trees, and obtaining large-diameter, 
fast-growing trees may improve resistance to mountain pine beetle. Chemical insecticides can also be used to 
protect individual trees [<a href="#18">18</a>]. In the absence of fire or presence of active 
management to regulate mountain pine beetle populations and maintain Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine stands, Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine will be succeeded by climax species (subalpine fir 
and Engelmann spruce at high elevations, Douglas-fir at low elevations) [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>]. Amman and others [<a href="#22">22</a>] 
and Cole and others [<a href="#106">106</a>] provide detailed 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine management guidelines for dealing with mountain pine beetle based on 
specific management objectives, and Cole [<a href="#104">104</a>] provides information on the 
feasibility of silvicultural practices for dealing with mountain pine beetle in 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forests. Klein [<a href="#192">192</a>] reviews both mechanical and chemical 
strategies for reducing losses to mountain pine beetle.</p>

<p>Another potentially destructive insect pest is the pine engraver beetle [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#175">175</a>]. Pine 
engraver populations commonly develop in logging slash; removal, burning, or 
rapid drying of slash provide effective pine engraver control [<a href="#14">14</a>]. 
Other insect pests include the Pandora moth, Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine beetle, pitch twig 
moth, lodgepole needle miner, jack pine budworm, and  Rocky Mountain lodgepole 
pine terminal 
weevil [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#175">175</a>,<a href="#279">279</a>].</p>

<p>Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is susceptible to stem rust fungi, including mycelium [<a href="#187">187</a>], sweetfern blister 
rust [<a href="#9">9</a>], stalactiform blister rust [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#187">187</a>], western gall rust [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>], and comandra blister rust [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#187">187</a>], which 
may cause cankers and some degree of mortality in all age classes of Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine. Sanitation salvage cutting is effective 
in controlling comandra blister rust and western gall rust [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>]. Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine is also susceptible to a variety of root 
diseases [<a href="#187">187</a>,<a href="#193">193</a>]. Van der Kamp and Hawksworth [<a href="#187">187</a>], 
and Koch [<a href="#195">195</a>] summarize the 
diseases of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine and their effects. Koch [<a href="#195">195</a>] offers 
suggestions for control and remediation of various insects and diseases.</p>

<p>Lodgepole pine dwarf-mistletoe is very common in Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine stands, causing dense, bushy 
branch growth, increasing mortality, and reducing growth and seed production [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#154">154</a>]. The 
mortality rate depends largely on the age of the host tree when attacked [<a href="#14">14</a>]. Young trees die quickly, 
while older trees with well-developed and 
vigorous crowns may not show appreciable effects for years [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>]. In a study of dwarf-mistletoe infection in Montana, 
Wyoming, and Colorado, 84% of trees studied were infected before they were 11 
years old. The average maximum distance of infection 
into regeneration in this study was 26 feet (8 m) from the infected residual stand [<a href="#153">153</a>]. The rate of 
spread for dwarf-mistletoe is approximately 1.5 
feet/year (0.5 m/yr) in open stands and 0.9 foot/year (0.3 m/yr) in dense, 
immature stands [<a href="#14">14</a>]. Rates of spread are fastest from overstory trees to 
adjacent reproduction; spread through even-aged stands is considerably slower 
[<a href="#154">154</a>]. Recently infected trees show no abnormalities except for the 
inconspicuous shoots on branches and main stems. Where the parasite has been 
present for a long time, stands have 1 or more heavily damaged centers 
characterized by many trees with witches' brooms, spike-tops, and an 
above-average number of snags [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>]. Dwarf-mistletoe is most damaging in stands thinned by harvest, mountain pine beetles, 
or windfall [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>]. Rates of infection are lower 
in regenerated stands following fire [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#154">154</a>] and also vary relative to site conditions, 
occurring more frequently on poor, dry sites [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>]. Thinning infected 
stands may reduce the incidence of infection [<a href="#295">295</a>] and result in increased 
growth and vigor of remaining trees [<a href="#21">21</a>]. Clearcutting infected Rocky Mountain 
lodgepole pine stands may result in a vigorous new stand as well as a reduction 
in dwarf-mistletoe infection [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>]. Prescribed fire may also be used to treat 
infected stands; Fire Case Study 3 provides an example of using prescribed fire 
to treat lodgepole pine dwarf-mistletoe infestation. A summary of the 
interaction between dwarf-mistletoe and Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine can be found in Hawksworth and Johnson [<a href="#154">154</a>], 
and silvicultural strategies 
for dealing with dwarf-mistletoe are described by Van Sickle and Wegwitz [<a href="#295">295</a>], and Muir and Geils [<a href="#226">226</a>].</p>

<p>Amman and others [<a href="#21">21</a>] report that increases in dwarf-mistletoe 
infection may reduce losses to mountain pine beetle due to reduced tree vigor 
and thinner phloem; however, a study of over 1,000 trees in Colorado did not 
find a relationship between dwarf-mistletoe intensity and phloem thickness [<a href="#155">155</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Silviculture:</b></font> 
Harvest methods applicable to Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands include clearcutting, shelterwood, 
and group selection harvest [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#195">195</a>,<a href="#265">265</a>]. Harvest method is determined by 
management goals, stand conditions, windfall potential, disease and insect 
susceptibility, and potential fire occurrence [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#195">195</a>]. Where heavy thinning 
occurs, remaining trees may be subject to windfall [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#152">152</a>]; in 1 Colorado study, windfall was the 
single greatest cause of 
mortality on partially cut stands during the 1st 7 years post-harvest [<a href="#11">11</a>]. In a Montana study, wind was 
responsible for over 50% of 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine 
mortality during the 1st 11 years following thinning [<a href="#152">152</a>]. Windthrow susceptibility is related to the kind 
and intensity of cutting, soil 
depth and drainage, defect, stand density, and topographic exposure [<a href="#12">12</a>].</p>

<p>In serotinous Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands, slash remaining after clearcutting 
provides a seed source for natural regeneration [<a href="#12">12</a>]. Following 
harvest in Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands, substantially more new seedlings establish if 
logging residue is burned than if it is scattered over the site [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>]. In nonserotinous stands, harvest openings designed to 
maximize seedfall from surrounding forest allow for natural regeneration [<a href="#12">12</a>]. Regeneration of 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine from open-coned sources may be enhanced by 
mechanical scarification, but results vary; a Montana study of regeneration on strip clearcuts 
found that seed:seedling ratios were as low as 625:1 on scarified sites 
(residue bulldozer piled and burned), and as high as 6,480:1 on unscarified 
sites (residue burned in place) [<a href="#242">242</a>].</p>

<p>Thinning of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands improves growth and survival of remaining 
trees [<a href="#183">183</a>,<a href="#184">184</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>,<a href="#233">233</a>,<a href="#242">242</a>,<a href="#281">281</a>]. Thinning in Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine stands results in increased basal-area growth 
of remaining trees; relative response is greatest where trees are small, 
especially sites with initially high densities [<a href="#63">63</a>]. The release of suppressed, advanced 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine regeneration using thinning is impacted by residual overstory 
basal area, soil water-holding capacity, height of released regeneration at time 
of thinning, height growth prior to release, and stem damage from harvest. Retention of overstory basal area may impede height growth of released 
trees. Shorter trees expressing good pre-release growth possess the greatest 
release potential, while trees damaged by thinning show reduced growth [<a href="#233">233</a>].  However, 
soil displacement and compaction from harvesting, brush disposal, and site 
preparation work can all adversely affect the growth of regenerating Rocky 
Mountain lodgepole pine, resulting in reduced diameters, radial growth, and tree height [<a href="#96">96</a>]. Following thinning, regenerating 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forests provide enhanced 
summer range for mule deer and elk due to increases in forage production [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#293">293</a>]. Silvicultural systems for 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine are detailed by Alexander [<a href="#14">14</a>], Alexander and Edminster [<a href="#15">15</a>], Koch [<a href="#195">195</a>], and Schmidt and 
Alexander [<a href="#265">265</a>]. Residue treatment practices are addressed by Benson [<a href="#66">66</a>].</p>

Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine may also respond to chemical thinning [<a href="#184">184</a>]. Hexazinone, glyphosate, and triclopyr reduce 
Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine seedling growth and mycorrhizal development [<a href="#270">270</a>].
