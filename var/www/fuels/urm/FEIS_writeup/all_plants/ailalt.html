As of  2004, tree-of-heaven is listed as noxious in 6 states and 
2 Forest Service Regions. It is classified as a severe threat (could spread easily into native 
plant communities and displace native vegetation) in Virginia [<a href="#166">166</a>], Kentucky 
[<a href="#88">88</a>], Tennessee [<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#161">161</a>], and California [<a href="#161">161</a>]. 
The state of Vermont ranks tree-of-heaven as a Category 2 species: having 
potential to displace native plants on a localized or widespread scale [<a href="#164">164</a>]. 
Tree-of-heaven is also state-listed as an invasive weed in Wisconsin [<a href="#161">161</a>].

<p>The Eastern and 
Southern regions of the U.S. Forest Service rank tree-of-heaven in Weed 
Category 1: an exotic species known to be invasive and persistent throughout all 
or most of the Regions. Weed Category 1 species can spread 
into and persist in native plant communities, displacing native species and 
posing a demonstrable threat to plant communities. Use of 
tree-of-heaven is prohibited on National Forest System Lands [<a href="#159">159</a>,<a href="#160">160</a>].</p>

GENERAL DISTRIBUTION:</a>

<br />


Tree-of-heaven is native to Taiwan and central China, where it occurs from 22 to 34<sup>o</sup> 
North in latitude [<a href="#163">163</a>]. In North America it occurs from 
British Columbia, southern Ontario, and Massachusetts south to Florida, Texas, and southern 
California [<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>].&nbsp; Tree-of-heaven spread in North America 
apparently followed 3 
distinct introductions from China. It was  
1st imported to Pennsylvania 
in 1784 as an ornamental [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#154">154</a>,<a href="#155">155</a>,<a href="#169">169</a>]. Another 
introduction occurred in New York in 1820, where tree-of-heaven was again 
planted as an ornamental [<a href="#31">31</a>]. Both eastern introductions were from English 
stock imported from China. Tree-of-heaven was commercially 
available in eastern nurseries by 1840, and is now widespread in the Northeast. 
The 3rd introduction was in California during the mid-1800s gold rush. Chinese immigrating to 
work in the gold fields and in construction of the transcontinental railroad brought tree-of-heaven to 
California, probably 
because of the tree's medicinal and cultural importance in their homeland (see
<a href="all.html#OTHER USES">Other Uses</a>) [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#155">155</a>]. 

<p>A century after the North American introductions, tree-of-heaven is most common in its initial 
centers of distribution: the Northeast and California. In the East, it is 
invasive from New England south to the mid-Atlantic states [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>]. 
Tree-of-heaven is  frequently found in the Midwest, becoming uncommon in the 
Great Plains and the South. It is  weakly invasive in the 
Great Plains [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#138">138</a>] 
and is rare south of North Carolina in the Southeast and South [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>,<a href="#174">174</a>]. In 
the West, tree-of-heaven is common in California and locally frequent in Oregon 
and Washington [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>]. In California tree-of-heaven 
occurs in the Bay Area, the Central 
Valley, and in foothill counties with a history of gold mining [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>]. In the Pacific Northwest it grows along 
waterways, including banks of the Snake and Columbia rivers [<a href="#70">70</a>]. In the Southwest it occurs in riparian zones and 
mesic canyons [<a href="#154">154</a>].
<a href="https://plants.usda.gov/">Plants database</a> 
provides a map of 
tree-of-heaven distribution in the United States.</p>

<p>Tree-of-heaven has established in temperate climates throughout the world. 
Its earliest introductions may have been in Japan and Korea, where it is 
probably not native [<a href="#101">101</a>]. It was introduced in Europe 
in the 1700s. and became widespread there [<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#155">155</a>]. Introductions in Argentina, Australia, and Africa followed, using seed from European trees [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].</p>

<p>Because of its scattered and disjunct distribution in North America, 
tree-of-heaven occurrence is not well documented for all plant communities where 
it may occur [<a href="#112">112</a>]. The following lists are not 
restrictive, but include plant communities where tree-of-heaven is a known 
invader.</p>

Tree-of-heaven is most common in urban areas [<a href="#75">75</a>]. It may be an important, 
occasional, to minor component of 
wildland vegetation anywhere 
within its North American range [<a href="#112">112</a>]. In wildlands of the <b>East</b> and <b>
Midwest</b>, tree-of-heaven is a common component in    oak-hickory (<i>Quercus-Carya</i> spp.) and maple-birch-beech (<i>Acer-Betula-Fagus</i> 
spp.) forest canopies [<a href="#153">153</a>]. For example, 
 tree-of-heaven has infested hundreds of 
acres of oak-hickory forest in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia [<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>]. 
Tree-of-heaven is frequently associated 
with black locust (<i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i>), a native early successional species, 
and nonnative Norway maple (<i>Acer platanoides</i>),  in eastern oak-hickory forests [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>]. Other 
early seral associates are black cherry (<i>Prunus serotina</i>), gray birch (<i>Betula 
populifolia</i>), sweetgum (<i>Liquidambar styraciflua</i>), and eastern 
redcedar (<i>Juniperus virginiana</i>) [<a href="#60">60</a>].  In oak-hickory woodlands of Gettysburg National Military Park, Pennsylvania, 
tree-of-heaven associates in the overstory with black oak (<i>Q. velutina</i>), red oak 
(<i>Q. rubra</i>), scarlet oak (<i>Q. coccinea</i>), mockernut hickory (<i>C. 
tomentosa</i>), and bitternut hickory (<i>C. cordiformis</i>). Weedy 
invaders other than tree-of-heaven include Japanese barberry (<i>Berberis thunbergii</i>) and multiflora 
rose (<i>Rosa multiflora</i>). Late-successional understory species include 
white ash (<i>Fraxinus americana</i>), black cherry, 
sassafras (<i>Sassafras albidum</i>), and boxelder (<i>Acer negundo</i>) [<a href="#43">43</a>]. In white oak-red oak-sugar 
maple (<i>Acer saccharinum</i>) forests of Ohio, tree-of-heaven occurs 
with American elm (<i>Ulmus americana</i>), hickories (<i>Carya</i> spp.), black 
locust, black walnut (<i>Juglans nigra</i>), and black cherry [<a href="#33">33</a>].

<p>On the <b>Georgia Piedmont</b>, tree-of-heaven is an important species in 
early successional loblolly pine (<i>Pinus taeda</i>)-black oak-white oak forests. Flowering 
dogwood (<i>Cornus florida</i>), yellow-poplar (<i>Liriodendron tulipifera</i>), 
Chinese privet (<i>Ligustrum sinense</i>), and winged elm (<i>U. alata</i>) 
are common associates [<a href="#27">27</a>].</p>
<p>Tree-of-heaven is invasive in riparian zones of the <b>Southwest</b> and 
elsewhere [<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>]. In the middle Rio Grande Basin of New Mexico, 
tree-of-heaven occurs in Fremont cottonwood-Rio Grande cottonwood-sandbar willow (<i>Populus 
fremontii-P. deltoides</i> var. <i>wislizenii-Salix&nbsp; exigua</i>) bosques 
along with nonnative, invasive Siberian elm (<i>U. pumila</i>) and white mulberry (<i>Morus 
alba</i>) [<a href="#48">48</a>]. Tree-of-heaven has invaded arroyos of the Sandia National 
Laboratory, New Mexico, associating with Siberian elm, saltcedar (<i>Tamarix 
ramossima</i>), Apache plume (<i>Fallugia paradoxa</i>), and fourwing saltbush (<i>Atriplex 
canescens</i>). Upland, it associates in Colorado pinyon-oneseed juniper (<i>Pinus 
edulis-Juniperus monosperma</i>) stands with Gambel oak (<i>Quercus gambelii</i>) 
and Siberian elm [<a href="#108">108</a>].</p>

In southern <b>California</b>, tree-of-heaven frequently associates with Fremont cottonwood, 
California sycamore (<i>Platanus racemosa</i>), mule fat (<i>Baccharis 
salicifolia</i>), and poison-oak (<i>Toxicodendron diversilobum</i>). A 1990-1992 survey in&nbsp;Chino Hills State Park showed 15% frequency for 
tree-of-heaven, with its geographic range and &quot;vigor&quot; increasing over the study period [<a href="#87">87</a>].

identification. Keys for identification are available (e.g. [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#172">172</a>,<a href="#174">174</a>]).

<p>Tree-of-heaven is a nonnative, 
deciduous tree. It may reach 60 to 70 feet (18-21 
m) in height, 80 feet (24 m) in crown width, and 3 feet (0.9 m) in trunk diameter at 
maturity [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>]. The champion tree 
is in Tennessee, and reaches 67 feet (20 m) in height, 64 feet (19 m) in spread, and 20.6 
feet 
(6.3 m) in diameter [<a href="#73">73</a>]. Trees may be shrubby when suppressed or regularly 
pruned [<a href="#52">52</a>]. Tree-of-heaven has smooth, thin bark and a straight bole. Branches are brittle and self-pruning. The large, malodorous leaves are 
pinnately compound, with prominent glands on the back of each leaflet. Surface-to-volume ratio 
of leaves is high: leaflets range from 15 to 41 in number, and total leaf length 
may reach 3 feet (1 m) [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>]. Leaf stipules have <a name="nectaries">nectaries</a> that excrete sugars [<a href="#14">14</a>].</p>


<p>Most flowers are unisexual, but some trees may have perfect 
flowers [<a href="#176">176</a>]. The inflorescence is a 0.3- to 0.6-foot (10-20 cm) 
panicle with 6- to 8-mm-long flowers. Staminate flowers have a strong, 
objectionable odor. Fruits grow in clusters of 1-seeded, dry 
<a href="../../../glossary.html#SCHIZOCARP:">schizocarps</a>
with wings. They are 2.5 to 5 cm in length and propeller-shaped, 
resembling maple (<i>Acer </i>spp.) fruits [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>,<a href="#172">172</a>]. A fruit 
cluster contains hundreds of seeds [<a href="#88">88</a>] that average 0.6 
<font face="Times New Roman">� 0.25 cm in size [<a href="#5">5</a>] and 27 
mg in mass [<a href="#107">107</a>].</font> </p>


<p><a name="Roots">Roots</a> are shallow, widely spreading, and capable of
<a href="all.html#Asexual regeneration:">sprouting</a>
[<a href="#112">112</a>]. Young trees have a taproot and several large laterals 
[<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>], although the taproot may diminish with tree age [<a href="#112">112</a>]. Ramets do 
not have taproots. In dry, rocky soil or beneath pavement, trees grow long 
horizontal roots that do not branch until more favorable soil is found 
[<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>]. Roots near the 
trunk thicken with age, serving as storage organs. Most roots occur in the upper 
18 inches (46 cm) of soil. Deep roots send out smaller roots that grow&nbsp;near 
the soil surface; adventitious shoots generally arise from these shallow 
roots [<a href="#112">112</a>].</p>

    <td width="600"><b><font size="4">Stand structure:</font></b> 
Tree-of-heaven typically occurs in clumps, although it may 
form rows along streams, roads, and fences and occasionally grows as widely 
spaced, single stems. Clumping can result from an 
even-aged seedling establishment or from colonial expansion through root 
sprouting [<a href="#130">130</a>]. Open-grown colonies may eventually become 
dense by sprouting. Davis [<a href="#30">30</a>] observed a half-acre (0.2 ha) stand in 
Kentucky consisting 
of 32 stems. Stands subject to infrequent control measures may develop 
into even-aged thickets. Untreated stands self-thin, eventually forming 
uneven-aged sprouts. Two years after tree harvest in Pennsylvania, 
tree-of-heaven sprout density was 17,860 2-year-old sprouts/acre (mean height=9 
feet) and 10,019 1-year-old sprouts/acre (mean height=2 feet). After 3 years many of the sprouts had died, 
    so dead stems were more common than live stems 
[<a href="#80">80</a>]. Sprouts volunteering in closed-canopy understories remain suppressed and few in 
number. For example, Hunter [<a href="#78">78</a>] reports single-stem tree-of-heaven growth, rather than 
thickets, in the understory of an undisturbed mixed-evergreen forest in northern California.</td>

<p>Investigations of tree-of-heaven in  China give little clue as 
to the species' natural growth habit. Tree-of-heaven grows in a densely 
populated area of China where no wildlands are left. As valued ornamentals, 
mature trees-of-heaven in China are pruned to aesthetically pleasing, single-stemmed forms. 
Sprouts are  harvested for firewood and medicinal uses [<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>].</p>


<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Life span:</font></b> 
Tree-of-heaven is typically short lived, with an average life span of  30 to 50 years [<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>]. Cloning from root sprouts can 
extend ramet life hundreds of years [<a href="#78">78</a>]. Sprouts from the 1st tree-of-heaven in 
North America, planted in Philadelphia's Bartram Botanical Garden 1784, still 
exist today [<a href="#23">23</a>].</p>

Chemical extracts from the leaves, barks, 
roots, and seeds have inhibited germination and growth of other species in the 
laboratory [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>]. Allelopathic chemicals (ailanthone and 
other compounds identified in [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>]) are most concentrated in roots, with young ramets 
producing more toxins than older trees [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>]. Reciprocal 
transplant experiments [<a href="#25">25</a>] may help determine the degree of 
tree-of-heaven allelopathy under natural conditions.</p>

<p>Open-grown trees-of-heaven are highly efficient at photosynthesis, and store 
large quantities of photosynthate in stems and roots [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>]. Foliar nectaries
appear to maintain carbohydrate balance during growth and 
flower initiation by excreting photosynthates [<a href="#15">15</a>]. </p>

<p>Tree-of-heaven is sensitive to ozone pollution [<a href="#55">55</a>]; however, it is 
highly tolerant of most industrial pollutants [<a href="#110">110</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>]. In a highly polluted area 
of Armenia, tree-of-heaven showed the least damage and best growth of 8 urban tree 
species (Derojan, as cited in [<a href="#45">45</a>]).

Tree-of-heaven reproduces from seed and root sprouts [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#169">169</a>]. 
Both methods are important to tree-of-heaven's invasiveness and reproductive 
success [<a href="#130">130</a>].<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Breeding system:</font></b> 
Tree-of-heaven is mostly 
<a href="../../../glossary.html#DIOECIOUS:">dioecious</a>.
Rarely, either bisexual trees or  trees with both 
bisexual and unisexual&nbsp;flowers are found [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>].

<p>As with most species with wind-dispersed seed, tree-of-heaven appears to have 
a relatively uniform genetic system, with most diversity occurring among rather 
than within populations [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>]. Because North American tree-of-heaven 
populations originated from only 3 introductions [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#155">155</a>,<a href="#169">169</a>], 
they may be even less genetically diverse than native Asian populations. A comparison of seedlings germinated from seed collections from 5 
locations across the United States and 5 locations across China showed 
significant differences in height growth (p=0.01), root:shoot ratios (p=0.05), 
and leaf area (p=0.05) among United States and Chinese seedlings. Populations 
from the United States were taller, allocated relatively less biomass to roots 
than stems, and had greater leaf areas, compared to Chinese populations [<a href="#46">46</a>]. 
In a common garden study comparing seedling populations within the United States, Feret and 
others [<a href="#47">47</a>] found California populations were significantly (p=0.01) taller than 
eastern populations. Seed width and biomass were correlated with latitude 
(t=0.96), with northern populations having the widest, heaviest seeds. Feret 
[<a href="#45">45</a>] found some tree-of-heaven seed and seedling growth characteristics of 
provenances from the East and California appeared random, and were not 
correlated (nor appeared best adapted) to site or geographic location. He 
reported significant differences between North American and Chinese 
tree-of-heaven provenances for seed and seedling characteristics. Contrary to 
expectations, allozyme analysis showed no evidence of inbreeding depression in&nbsp;North American provenances compared to native Chinese 
provenances.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Pollination:</b></font> Tree-of-heaven is 
pollinated by a variety of nectar- and pollen-feeding insects [<a href="#120">120</a>]. Although disagreeable 
to humans, the strong odor of male flowers attracts  honey bees, beetles, and 
other insects [<a href="#112">112</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Seed production:</font> </b> 
Tree-of-heaven produces many small, light seeds. Flower, fruit, and seed production begin early. 
Six-week-old seedlings have  flowered in the greenhouse [<a href="#44">44</a>], and 
1-year-old saplings and 2-year-old root sprouts have been observed with fruit 
[<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>]. Trees  in California produce viable seed by 10 years of age [<a href="#78">78</a>]. Best seed production is from 12 to 20 
years of age [<a href="#112">112</a>]. In France, which has a climate similar to California, 1.6- 
to 3.3-foot-long (0.5-1 m) root sprouts produced seeds [<a href="#14">14</a>]. Mature female trees may produce several hundred 
inflorescences in 
a year. Hunter [<a href="#78">78</a>] 
reports&nbsp;5-year production of a female tree in Martinez, California, as 150, 183, 
219, 439, and 56 inflorescences. An individual flower contains hundreds of seeds, so individual trees can produce 325,000 or more seeds 
per year [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>]. Illick and Brouse [<a href="#80">80</a>] 
estimated that a small, 12-inch-diameter (30-cm) tree in Pennsylvania produced over a million seeds. Most seed are viable, even those that overwinter on the 
tree and disperse in spring [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>]. Repeated top-kill lowers seed production 
[<a href="#112">112</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b><a name="Seed dispersal:">Seed dispersal:</a></b></font>
The winged fruits 
are easily and widely dispersed by wind [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>]. 
Water and machinery also disperse seeds [<a href="#124">124</a>]. In the laboratory, Matlack [<a href="#107">107</a>] reported the following dispersal characteristics for 
tree-of-heaven seed collected in Delaware 
(data are means and 1 standard deviation):</p>

<p>Distance traveled was significantly greater (p&lt;0.05) compared to seed of 37 
other wind-dispersed species [<a href="#107">107</a>]. On Staten Island, New York, 
tree-of-heaven seedlings volunteered on a restored landfill site planted to native 
woody species. A year after restoration plantings, tree-of-heaven count on fifty 
10 <font face="Times New Roman">� 30 meter </font>plots totaled 65 seedlings, 
the 6th highest among 32 naturally regenerating taxa. Distance to the nearest 
seed-bearing tree-of-heaven was 299 feet (70 m) [<a href="#137">137</a>].</p> 

<p>In Ithaca, New York, new tree-of-heaven seed clusters often fell and 
dispersed in clumps, resulting in patches of closely related seedlings. Seeds 
dispersed individually as the fruit clusters disintegrated over the winter [<a href="#123">123</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seed banking:</b></font>
Seeds retain 
dormancy for less than a year, so seeds do not build up long-term seed banks [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>]. 
Tree-of-heaven does establish temporary soil seed banks from on- and off-site sources 
of seed [<a href="#176">176</a>]. In Tennessee, for example, Dobberpuhl [<a href="#37">37</a>] 
found viable tree-of-heaven seed in the soil seed bank. There were no 
trees-of-heaven in the overstory.</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Germination:</font></b> 
Hand-collected, freshly dried tree-of-heaven seed yields 60% to 85% germination in the laboratory [<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>]. Hunter [<a href="#78">78</a>] reports 30% 
germination of seeds that overwintered on the tree and dispersed in spring. 
Tree-of-heaven embryos are dormant, and stratification improves 
germination rates [<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>]. Seed can germinate in highly compacted soil [<a href="#130">130</a>], 
and is salt tolerant. Studies of eastern 
hardwood species found roadside salt does not appreciably affect tree-of-heaven 
germination; native oak and birch seed is far more adversely affected by salt [<a href="#13">13</a>]. The 
tree-of-heaven embryo is well equipped for rapid growth. 
Although it lacks an endosperm, it has 2 large cotyledons with stored oils [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>]. 
Litter has both negative and positive effects on germination. In eastern deciduous forests, oak (<i>Quercus</i> spp.) leaf litter has been shown to 
delay tree-of-heaven germination and increase mortality, but not affect subsequent biomass 
of surviving seedlings [<a href="#41">41</a>]. Litter 
may have positive effects on tree-of-heaven germination and establishment by 
reducing competition from herbaceous species [<a href="#42">42</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b><a name="Seedling establishment/growth:">Seedling establishment/growth:</a></b></font> 
Although seed production is prolific, tree-of-heaven seedling establishment is infrequent on 
many sites [<a href="#124">124</a>]. Dry climate may limit tree-of-heaven recruitment  in the 
Great Plains and the arid West [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>]. Even so, 
tree-of-heaven has successfully expanded its range through seed spread [<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>], 
and seedling establishment appears to be more common than indicated in general 
literature [<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>]. For example, in a root excavation study, Knapp and Canham [<a href="#89">89</a>] found initial 
tree-of-heaven recruitment in  New York eastern hemlock forest gaps was from 
off-site seed, not root sprouts.  </p>

<p>Whether initial regeneration is accomplished from seed or by cloning, once 
 
established, tree-of-heaven growth is extremely rapid. It may be the 
fastest-growing tree in North America [<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>]. Both the species' common and scientific 
(<i>Ailanthus</i>, sky-tree) names refer 
to its ability to attain height quickly  [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>]. Seedlings attain 3.3 
to 6.6 feet (1-2 m) in their 1st year [<a href="#112">112</a>]. Growth of tree-of-heaven 
seedlings relative to native sweetgum (<i>Liquidambar styraciflua</i>) and 
nonnative Norway maple seedlings 2 years after planting in a New York City common 
garden was [<a href="#123">123</a>]:</p>

<p>Saplings average an additional meter of height growth per year for at least 4 years&nbsp;[<a href="#1">1</a>]. 
Relatively rapid growth continues for pole-sized 
trees: in 
New York, pole-size trees-of-heaven growing in canopy gaps gained  2 to 4 mm of 
radial growth annually, the highest rate recorded for the 6 tree species 
measured (the other 5 species were native) [<a href="#89">89</a>]. In a New England survey, 
tree-of-heaven reached 33 to 49 feet (10-15 m) in height and 3.7 
to 4.3 inches (9-11 cm) dbh in 30 years [<a href="#1">1</a>]. Growth is  fastest in California 
trees, which are typically 35 to 63 feet (10-20 m) high by 
12 to 20 years of age [<a href="#79">79</a>]. Growth slows greatly after age 20 to 
25, with height increases of 3 inches (7.6 cm) or less per year [<a href="#80">80</a>]. Once established, tree-of-heaven density 
increases by root sprouting. One ramet may occupy over an acre (0.4 ha). Sprout 
growth slows to several 
centimeters per year if sprout stems become shaded [<a href="#79">79</a>]. In West Virginia, Kowarik [<a href="#91">91</a>] reported an average growth rate of 
0.36 foot/year (0.11 m) for 
tree-of-heaven sprouts suppressed in the understory of an oak (<i>Quercus</i> 
spp.)-sugar maple forest.</p>

<p>Cattle, deer, and small rodent  browsing may retard 
tree-of-heaven establishment and growth [<a href="#122">122</a>]. Browsing effects 
probably vary by site and animal density. In a New York oak-hickory woodland, Forgione 
[<a href="#49">49</a>] found no significant differences in tree-of-heaven seedling establishment on open 
plots and plots exclosed to white-tailed deer.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b><a name="Asexual regeneration:">Asexual regeneration:</a></b></font> 
Tree-of-heaven sprouts from the roots, root crown, and bole [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>]. Although 
tree-of-heaven reproduces well from seed, sprouting is the more common method of 
regeneration [<a href="#88">88</a>]. In Ithaca, New York, 42% of 1-year-old, excavated 
tree-of-heaven stems were seedlings, and 58% were root sprouts [<a href="#123">123</a>]. 
Young trees, cut to the root crown before bark becomes thick and corky, often sprout from both the 
root crown and roots [<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>]. Bole damage promotes root, root 
crown, and bole sprouting [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>]. Complete top-kill 
of the root crown by fire, frost, or other means usually results in prolific root sprouting 
[<a href="#112">112</a>]. Top-growth damage is not necessary  for root sprouting to occur, 
however. Even as seedlings, trees-of-heaven produce horizontal roots capable of 
sprouting [<a href="#23">23</a>]. Root sprouting is an uncommon regeneration strategy for 
woody species (e.g., see FEIS reviews on 
<a href="../../tree/poptre/all.html">quaking aspen</a> and
<a href="../../shrub/chafol/all.html">Sierra mountain misery</a> (<i>Chamaebatia foliolosa</i>)), 
but it is a powerful strategy for species employing it. Roots have 
more nutrient- and photosynthate-storing capacity than rhizomes, conferring 
better protection from aboveground disturbances such as fire, and a more 
vigorous sprouting response after top-kill has promoted sprouting by removing 
apical dominance [<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].</p>


<p>With tree-of-heaven's spreading root system, root sprouts may appear as far 
as 50 to 90 feet (15-27 m) from the parent stem [<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>]. 
Sprouts of all types (root, root crown, or bole) generally grow faster than seedlings. In the East, average rate of growth is reported as 6 feet (1.8 m) 
per year for bole sprouts, 2.7 
feet (0.8 m) for root sprouts, and 1.3 feet (6.5 m) for seedlings [<a href="#80">80</a>]. Root 
sprouts in California may exceed 3.5 feet (1 m) in their 1st year [<a href="#78">78</a>]. 
During drought, tree-of-heaven pulls stem water into roots and begins stem 
die-back. Stem die-back may be extensive during extended droughts, but 
tree-of-heaven typically survives drought by sprouting from the roots when there 
is sufficient water to support new growth. Frost die-back and regrowth is  common 
in tree-of-heaven's northern limits [<a href="#45">45</a>].</p>


<p>On the  Himalayan foothills of India, trees-of-heaven with root crown girths 
between 12 and  16 inches (30 and 40 cm) showed greatest root sprout production following 
road construction. Trees in the largest-diameter class did not produce sprouts. 
Mean sprout 
production  was [<a href="#96">96</a>]:</p>

Little information is available on tree-of-heaven's natural habitat in China 
[<a href="#72">72</a>], but tree-of-heaven has a wide ecological amplitude in North America. Kowarik [<a href="#90">90</a>] views human 
settlements as centers of distribution for tree-of-heaven, with roads providing 
the migration routes. Tree-of-heaven occupies a wide range of conditions,  from 
very poor to very productive sites. In Ithaca, New York, tree-of-heaven was 
significantly correlated (p=0.05) with urban areas where rooting space was limited and 
other species could not establish [<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. In Central Valley of 
California, tree-of-heaven has an 8-month growing season and grows in 
soils that are among the most nutrient-rich and productive in the world.<p>Tree-of-heaven has been termed &quot;the most adaptable and pollution 
tolerant tree available&quot; [<a href="#36">36</a>]. Highly tolerant of industrial gases, dust, 
and smoke, tree-of-heaven is common on disturbed sites, especially 
alleyways, roadsides, and fence rows 
[<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#174">174</a>]. In wildlands, tree-of-heaven occurs on 
disturbed sites, open woodlands, and riparian zones [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>,<a href="#169">169</a>]. 
In the Southwest, tree-of-heaven invades 
canyons, arroyos, and riparian zones including the banks of the Rio Grande [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>]. 
After Hurricane Camille, it was associated with debris avalanche chutes in 
Virginia [<a href="#76">76</a>]. Tree-of-heaven occurrence in an oak-hickory forest of West Virginia was 
also associated with disturbance [<a href="#75">75</a>]:</p>

Tree-of-heaven tolerates a wide range of soil conditions [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>]. For example, in 
oak-hickory woodland of Sussex County, New Jersey, tree-of-heaven occurs in permanently 
swampy, ridgebottom soils of an abandoned Boy Scout camp [<a href="#10">10</a>]. 
At the other moisture extreme, large, water-storing roots enable tree-of-heaven to tolerate dry, rocky soils 
and extended drought. Even 
seedlings show drought tolerance, often volunteering in  pavement cracks 
and other dry sites [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#156">156</a>]. In Kansas,&nbsp;mature eastern redcedar and tree-of-heaven showed best 
survivorship to the drought of 1934 compared to associated tree species [<a href="#149">149</a>].  </p>

<p>Tree-of-heaven also tolerates a range of nutrient conditions. Best growth occurs on nutrient-rich, 
loamy soils such as those in the Central Valley of California, but 
tree-of-heaven tolerates nutrient-poor  soils 
[<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>]. In reclamation studies, 
tree-of-heaven tolerated acid mine spoils better than calcareous spoils, and 
grew on low-phosphorus soils [<a href="#112">112</a>]. Tree-of-heaven can grow on soils as low as 4.1 pH, in 
soluble salt concentrations of 0.25 mmhos/cm, and in soils with phosphorus levels as low as 
1.8 ppm [<a href="#128">128</a>]. It  tolerates compacted soils [<a href="#123">123</a>].</p>
<p>Tree-of-heaven's spreading root system permits establishment and growth on 
cliff faces and other steep inclines [<a href="#4">4</a>].</p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Bell MT">Climate:</font></b> Tree-of-heaven is the only species in its genus that  tolerates 
cold climates [<a href="#74">74</a>]. Climate within tree-of-heaven's North American distribution varies widely, from subtropical 
and wet in Florida, arid in the Great Plains and Great Basin, to cold and wet in 
the Northeast. Tree-of-heaven tolerates as little as 
14 inches (360 mm) of annual precipitation under 8 months of drought in the arid 
West, and as much as 90 inches (2,290 mm) annual precipitation in the 
Appalachian Mountains. Annual mean maximum and minimum temperatures are 15 
and 97<sup> o</sup>F (-9 and 36 <sup>o</sup>C). Large, water-storing roots 
confer drought tolerance. Extreme cold and prolonged snow cover restrict its 
occurrence to lower slopes in mountainous regions, as seedlings are not 
cold resistant. Tree-of-heaven may be able 
to colonize cold regions that experience several successive years of mild 
climate [<a href="#112">112</a>].</p>

<br />

Tree-of-heaven is an early successional species [<a href="#137">137</a>].
Starting with a few stems along roadside or woodland edges, tree-of-heaven 
may encroach into meadows, woodlands, and open forests [<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>]. It 
commonly invades open  eastern hardwood forests, eventually sharing the canopy with 
native hardwoods [<a href="#151">151</a>]. As of this writing (2004), tree-of-heaven 
and empress tree (<i>Paulownia tomentosa</i>) are the 2 most successful 
nonnative trees invading hardwood forests in the East [<a href="#120">120</a>], where it often 
invades after tree harvest or other disturbance [<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>]. Huebner [<a href="#75">75</a>] found 
tree-of-heaven was significantly (p&lt;0.05) associated with either highly 
disturbed or urbanized counties in West Virginia. On logged sites on the 
Jefferson National Forest, Virginia, tree-of-heaven was most common on clearcut 
plots, less common on low-leave shelterwood plots, and least common on 
high-leave shelterwood plots, respectively [<a href="#24">24</a>]. It is widely reported from Natural Areas 
nationwide [<a href="#132">132</a>].  </p>

<p>Tree-of-heaven rarely 
invades closed-canopy, late-successional hardwood forests, but can invade 
old-growth canopy gaps created by 
windstorms, gypsy moth or woolly adelgid defoliation, or fire [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>]. 
Its growth rate is such that tree-of-heaven reaches the surrounding canopy 
rapidly, without further need of disturbance [<a href="#89">89</a>]. Besides its genetic capacity 
for growth, its relative unpalatability compared to associated hardwood 
species may confer further growth and successional advantage to tree-of-heaven in eastern 
hardwood forests with dense white-tailed deer populations 
[<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>].</p>
<p>Tree-of-heaven  also occurs in middle old-field succession.  It is not reported in very early old field 
succession, but was found in Pennsylvania old fields that were abandoned 
approximately 20 years before the old field survey. At 20 years, hardwoods were 
forming a 23-&nbsp; to 39-foot (7-12 m) canopy over the old fields. Tree-of-heaven was common in these 
early hardwood stands [<a href="#86">86</a>]. Once established, tree-of-heaven can invade the 
surrounding understory by root sprouts, which grow slowly but persist under low 
light conditions. A stand-replacement disturbance such as fire, insect attack, 
or hurricane releases tree-of-heaven. Tree-of-heaven chute colonization rate 10 
years after Hurricane Camille was [<a href="#76">76</a>]:</p>

<p>Tree-of-heaven is intolerant of deep shade [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>]. Seed plantings 
in New Jersey plant communities showed best tree-of-heaven establishment was in 
an open-grown herbaceous 
community, with intermediate establishment in an eastern redcedar/little bluestem 
woodland (<i>Juniperus virginiana/Schizachyrium scoparium</i>) and least 
establishment in a closed-canopy oak-hickory forest. Mortality rate was over 90% 
for experimentally planted tree-of-heaven seed planted under a closed-canopy oak-hickory 
forest [<a href="#49">49</a>]. Similarly, mortality of naturally established tree-of-heaven seedlings under an 
oak (<i>Quercus</i> spp.)-maple sugar canopy in West Virginia was 100%. Although 
tree-of-heaven cannot successfully regenerate from seed under its own canopy 
[<a href="#91">91</a>], it does produce under-canopy sprouts [<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>]. 
Without canopy-opening disturbance, under-canopy sprouts remain suppressed and 
grow slowly [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>]. For example, in a mid-successional mixed oak-hickory forest in southern Illinois, 
tree-of-heaven was scarce, with 2.5 stems/ha, relative dominance of 0.1%, and 
relative importance of 0.4% [<a href="#99">99</a>]. Tree-of-heaven does not photosynthesize efficiently in shade [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>]. Bourdeau and Laverick [<a href="#18">18</a>] found high light compensation points for 
tree-of-heaven in the laboratory. Shaded sprouts respond to release [<a href="#91">91</a>].</p>

<p>Tree-of-heaven's reputed 
<a href="all.html#Physiology:">allelopathy</a>
may slow succession in plant communities where it is invasive 
[<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>]. Concentration of allelopathic chemicals is highest in 
young tree-of-heaven stands [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>]. 
Seasonally, toxins are greatest in  spring and decline as the growing season 
progresses. Allelopathic chemicals are present in all portions of the tree, but 
are most concentrated in roots. The litter is also allelopathic. For example, 
slash (<i>Pinus elliottii</i>) and Monterey pine (<i>P. radiata</i>) seed germination is 
inhibited by fresh tree-of-heaven litter. The allelopathic effect dwindles 
through the growing season. By fall (when pine seeds would not normally germinate), pine seed germination 
is no longer inhibited 
by tree-of-heaven litter [<a href="#168">168</a>].</p>

Leaf expansion begins in early spring, and flowering and pollination follow in late 
spring [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>]. Seed ripening begins in late summer and 
continues through fall. Fruits usually persist on  female trees through winter, but may disperse 
anytime from October through the next spring [<a href="#112">112</a>]. Entire seed clusters may 
break off and disperse as a unit. In New York, seed clusters were more likely to 
break off in fall, while individual seeds were more likely to persist until 
spring, when their peduncles had deteriorated [<a href="#123">123</a>].

Tree-of-heaven 
sprouts from the roots, root crown, and bole after top-kill by fire [<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>]. To date (2004), 
studies on postfire growth rates and competitive ability are lacking for 
tree-of-heaven. It is likely, however, that given tree-of-heaven's large, 
extended root system [<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>] and its ability 
to root sprout and show increased growth rates under fertilization [<a href="#63">63</a>], 
tree-of-heaven would flourish in postfire environments. Apparently the 
fastest-growing tree in North America [<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>], tree-of-heaven 
would probably outcompete native woody species for light and the flush of 
nutrients that occurs after fire. Studies on the fire ecology of tree-of-heaven 
are needed.

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Flammability</font></b> 
of tree-of-heaven 
is not reported in the literature as of this writing. Its growth habit and stand 
structure suggest that once ignited, tree-of-heaven stands probably burn easily. 
The trees have large, finely divided leaves [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>] 
that provide a surface-to-volume ratio favorable for ignition and burning. The 
trees produce prodigious litter, not only from the large leaves, but also from 
broken branches in all size classes. Downed woody fuels are common in 
tree-of-heaven stands. The brittle branches break easily even when green, and branch 
die-back from drought or frost is common [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font> 
Tree-of-heaven is 
native to a long-settled, densely populated region of China. Although its 
pharmacological use is mentioned in early Chinese writings, early references 
about its ecology have not been found [<a href="#74">74</a>]. Its native fire regime is lost to 
prehistory. Its ability to sprout from photosynthate-storing roots and establish 
from off-site, wind-dispersed seed; its extraordinarily rapid growth rate; early 
age of seed production; and 
its appearance in early successional plant communities in North America (see
<a href="all.html#BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS">Botanical and Ecological Characteristics</a>) 

suggest tree-of-heaven has been subject to 
evolutionary pressures of frequent, stand-replacement disturbances. 
Tree-of-heaven shows flooding tolerance [<a href="#10">10</a>], but its consistent association in 
upland habitats may indicate a past association in both flood-prone and 
fire-prone ecosystems.</p>

<p>In North America, tree-of-heaven has invaded ecosystems where, for the most 
part, historic fire regimes are no longer functional (e.g., see [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>,<a href="#170">170</a>,<a href="#173">173</a>]). 
It is difficult to assess how tree-of-heaven may further alter historic fire 
regimes in ecosystems and plant communities where it is present. It may 
encourage fire spread in eastern hardwood forests, since its propensity to 
self-prune and grow in thickets can alter historic stand structure. Its impact 
in the arid West, where tree-of-heaven growth is more restricted to mesic sites 
and riparian zones [<a href="#78">78</a>], is even more difficult to judge. Further information, 
especially on postfire response of tree-of-heaven, is needed on how 
tree-of-heaven affects fire regimes in North America.</p>

The following table provides historic fire return intervals for plant 
communities and ecosystems where tree-of-heaven may be important. For further 
information on fire regimes in these communities or ecosystems, see the 
corresponding FEIS summary for the dominant taxa listed below. If you are

Possessing large, pinnate leaves with a high surface-to-volume ratio and often, 
many dead branches, [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>], tree-of-heaven has good potential for crowning 
fire behavior. 
As a thin-barked species [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>], tree-of-heaven stems are probably easily 
killed by fire; however, burned trees are only 
top-killed. Insulated from heat damage by soil, most

survive fire damage [<a href="#112">112</a>].

After partial to complete top-kill, tree-of-heaven sprouts from the bole, root 
crown, and/or roots, depending upon 
the extent of the fire damage. Tree-of-heaven produces an abundance of rapidly 
growing root sprouts after complete top-kill [<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>]. Postfire growth rates of 
tree-of-heaven have not been quantified in the literature as of this writing 
(2004), but&nbsp;root sprouts typically show growth rates of 10 to 13 feet (3-4 
m) in their 1st year [<a href="#112">112</a>]. 

<p>Tree-of-heaven probably establishes from seed after fire. Its
<a href="all.html#Seed dispersal:">seed disperses</a>
easily by wind [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>], and

disturbed environments other than burns [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>] 
(see <a href="all.html#SUCCESSIONAL STATUS">Successional Status</a>). 
Further information is needed on 
tree-of-heaven's ability to establish from seed in postfire environments.</p>

Fire is not recommended as a control measure for tree-of-heaven [<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>]. 
Limited information suggests that it sprouts vigorously after fire damage 
[<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>]; certainly, its regeneration strategies suggest that it is a 
disturbance-adapted species. Capable of rapid growth even under adverse 
conditions, tree-of-heaven shows best growth with the increased nutrient and 
open canopy conditions [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>] that fire creates.

<br><br>

Whenever there is a nearby tree-of-heaven seed source, disturbed sites 
require monitoring and follow-up treatments to prevent tree-of-heaven invasion 
and spread. Roadways, skid trails, and other disturbed grounds are corridors for 
tree-of-heaven invasion [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>]. By disturbing soil, fire suppression efforts 
may lead to postfire establishment if there are nearby trees-of-heaven. Fire-fighting machinery can also disperse 
tree-of-heaven seed. Washing equipment before it enters fire suppression 
zones can help prevent tree-of-heaven invasion on burned sites. Postfire
<a href="all.html#Posttreatment monitoring">monitoring and treatment</a> 
of skid trails is also advised [<a href="#124">124</a>].

There are few reports of either wildlife or domestic animal use of 
tree-of-heaven. A few birds such as pine grosbeak and crossbills eat the seeds 
[<a href="#77">77</a>]. White-tailed deer and domestic goats browse the foliage 
[<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>]. Since free-choice trials or other palatability studies have not been conducted for 
white-tailed deer and domestic goats, it is difficult to assess relative 
preference for tree-of-heaven for either browser.

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Palatability/nutritional value:</b></font> 
Although browsed, tree-of-heaven is not reported as preferred browse 
for ungulate species [<a href="#49">49</a>]. The 
bark and leaves contain saponins, quassinoids, and other bitter compounds that 
may discourage consumption [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>]. Small animal use of 
tree-of-heaven is largely unknown. One old-field study in New York showed 
white-footed mice preferred browsing eastern white pine, sugar maple, and white 
ash over tree-of-heaven. The same study noted meadow voles preferred 
tree-of-heaven seedlings over eastern white pine seedlings [<a href="#122">122</a>]. Further research is

OTHER USES:</a>
</span>
<br />

Tree-of-heaven  provides shade, medicine, wood, clothing, and food [<a href="#74">74</a>]. It has been widely planted as 
an ornamental because it grows quickly, can be trained into an attractive shape, 
and has attractive foliage and fruits. Once widely cultivated in North 
America, it is rarely planted anymore [<a href="#169">169</a>,<a href="#174">174</a>]. It is occasionally used for shelterbelts and urban planting, 
but its disagreeable odor and strong tendency to spread into  areas where it is 
not wanted discourages its use [<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>]. 

<p>Tree-of-heaven is a bioindicator of ozone pollution. When subjected to heavy 
ozone concentrations, the leaves show spotting damage and drop off&nbsp; [<a href="#55">55</a>]. 
Conversely, tree-of-heaven 
tolerates high levels of sulfur and mercury pollution, concentrating mercury in 
its leaves ([<a href="#92">92</a>] and references therein). It has been used to rehabilitate mine spoils in the East. 
Tolerant of saline soils and low pH, tree-of-heaven shows better 
growth on&nbsp;mine spoils compared to native species [<a href="#128">128</a>]. Due to its tendency 
to spread on disturbed sites, however, it is not recommended for 
rehabilitation [<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].</p>

<p>Possibly 
<a href="all.html#Physiology">allelopathic</a>, 
tree-of-heaven extracts have reduced germination and 
growth of other weed species. Tree-of-heaven extracts have potential use as 
herbicides [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].</p>

<p>The species has a long history of folk medicine and cultural use in Asia 
[<a href="#74">74</a>]. It 
is used as an astringent, antispasmotic, anthelmintic, and parasitide. In 
powdered form it is a narcotic, with depressant effects similar to tobacco (<i>Nicotiana</i> 
spp.). Fresh stem bark is used to treat diarrhea and dysentery; root bark is 
used for heat ailments, epilepsy, and asthma.&nbsp; The fruits are used as an 
emmenagogue and to treat ophthalmic diseases. Leaves are an astringent and used 
in lotions for seborrhea and scabies [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>]. Laboratory studies show 
tree-of-heaven has a potential role in modern medicine. 
Pharmacological research is focusing on possible use of tree-of-heaven extracts 
for treating cancer, malaria, and HIV-1 infection [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>]. </p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Wood Products:</b></font> 
Tree-of-heaven 
wood resembles ash (<i>Fraxinus</i> spp.) wood in appearance and quality. It is easily 
worked with tools and glue, and takes a finish well. Tree-of-heaven wood 
properties are summarized in Alden [<a href="#2">2</a>] and Moslemi and Bhagwat [<a href="#117">117</a>]. Berchem and others [<a href="#11">11</a>] and Adamik 
and Brauns [<a href="#1">1</a>] provide  information on properties and potential uses of tree-of-heaven wood fiber. 
Zasada and Little [<a href="#176">176</a>] provide information on tree-of-heaven cultivation.</p>

<p>Tree-of-heaven is an 
important timber and fuelwood tree in China, and is planted for timber and afforestation in New 
Zealand, the Middle East, eastern Europe, and South America [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>,<a href="#163">163</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>]. </p>

In China, tree-of-heaven  
is grown commercially as a host for <i>Attacus cynthia</i>, a  silkworm 
that produces coarse, durable silk [<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>]. Tree-of-heaven is a  food for 
honey bees worldwide. Initially

IMPACTS AND CONTROL:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Impacts:</b></font><br> 
<b>Ecological - </b> 
An early seral species favoring 
disturbed sites (see
<a href="all.html#SUCCESSIONAL STATUS">Successional Status</a>),
tree-of-heaven grows extremely rapidly and interferes with 
growth of native species. It often grows in large thickets, displacing 
native vegetation [<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>]. It affects natural successional trajectories, in part from 
competition for light and nutrients in early successional environments, and 
possibly from allelopathy [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>]. Tree-of-heaven takes advantage of 
disturbance gaps in eastern deciduous forests, outcompeting and overtopping 
native trees [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>]. Frankel [<a href="#50">50</a>] lists it among the 
10 most invasive weeds in the Bronx River Parkway Reservation of New York. Tellman [<a href="#154">154</a>] 
states it is &quot;rapidly becoming a problem species&quot; in the Southwest, where it 
invades riparian zones and other areas with favorable moisture regimes. 
Tree-of-heaven's large, interconnected storage roots effectively occupy and 
compete for a site. Vegetative regeneration ensures continued exclusion of other 
species [<a href="#123">123</a>]. </p>

<p>There is controversy about tree-of-heaven's invasiveness. Some authors note 
that although tree-of-heaven established in North America over 100 years ago, it 
has not spread to many sites that appear to be good habitat&nbsp;for the 
species [<a href="#117">117</a>]. Tree-of-heaven 
seems most invasive in disturbed eastern hardwood ecosystems 
[<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>]. Tree-of-heaven 
was 1st collected in North Carolina in 1911; it has now established in at least 
48 counties in that state [<a href="#125">125</a>]. Tree-of-heaven appears less invasive in the 
arid West. It is an important pest species in California [<a href="#72">72</a>], invading 
disturbed mesic areas and riparian zones where water relations allow
<a href="all.html#Seedling establishment/growth:">seedling establishment</a>.
It has not invaded closed-canopy forests 
[<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>]. Outside mesic areas, Hunter [<a href="#78">78</a>] considers it &quot;only 
potentially invasive, and also potentially eradicable&quot; in California.</p>

<p><b>Socio-economic - </b>
In developed areas, tree-of-heaven roots can damage buildings and foundations 
[<a href="#74">74</a>]. The rapidly growing, extensive root system also allows the tree to establish on steep to vertical inclines including roofs and cracked 
walls, which are damaged if seedlings are not promptly killed [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>]. 
Tree-of-heaven roots 
damaged the walls and roof of the 800-year-old S<font face="Times New Roman">� Velha of 
Coimbra Cathedral in Portugal</font> after establishing 
in the wall mortar and clay roof tiles [<a href="#4">4</a>]. The water-seeking roots 
can stop up sewer lines and invade wells and cisterns, damaging infrastructures and giving 
 potable water an 
unpleasant taste [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].</p>

<p>Tree-of-heaven sap causes a dermatitis reaction in some people. The pollen 
can cause an allergic reaction [<a href="#34">34</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Control:</b></font> Effective tree-of-heaven 
control requires vigilance due to its strong sprouting ability and prolific seed 
production. Roadways and trails are the usual corridor for tree-of-heaven 
infestations [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>]. 
For example, in a West Virginia study tree-of-heaven occurrence was heaviest 
along interstate freeways (I-79 and I-68) [<a href="#75">75</a>]. Fortunately, roadside and 
trail invasion makes accessibility, early detection, and treatment relatively 
easy [<a href="#21">21</a>]. </p>

<p><b><a name="Posttreatment monitoring">Posttreatment monitoring</a> </b>and 
retreatment is essential for this root-sprouting, 
rapidly growing species (see
<a href="all.html#REGENERATION PROCESSES">Regeneration Processes</a>). 
Treated areas should be checked once or twice a year, with any new sprouts or seedlings 
retreated (cut, sprayed, or pulled) as soon as possible so that roots do not 
have time to  build up carbohydrate reserves and grow larger. Plan on several 
treatments a year. Initially, summer 
treatment is desired to impact trees when their root reserves are low. 
Establishing a thick cover of native trees or grass helps shade out 
tree-of-heaven and 
discourages regrowth. Targeting female trees-of-heaven for control helps 
slow seed dissemination [<a href="#72">72</a>]. Monitoring should continue for at least a year 
after tree-of-heaven sprouting appears controlled [<a href="#79">79</a>]. Hoshovsky 
[<a href="#72">72</a>] reviews best application methods for many of the tree-of-heaven control methods discussed below. </p>

<p>As an early seral, potential invasive with
<a href="all.html#Seed dispersal:">wind-dispersed seed</a>, 
tree-of-heaven may show up on sites 
where treatments for other invasive weeds have created open, disturbed 
conditions. Whenever there is a nearby tree-of-heaven seed source, disturbed sites require 
monitoring and follow-up treatments to prevent tree-of-heaven invasion and spread. For example, tree-of-heaven 
and Norway maple seedlings invaded a New Jersey site after Norway 
maple removal treatments (cutting mature trees and hand-pulling Norway maple seedlings). 
Tree-of-heaven was not present on study plots prior to Norway maple removal [<a href="#171">171</a>]. 
Further information and research are needed to recognize undisturbed sites at 
risk for tree-of-heaven invasion [<a href="#72">72</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Prevention:</font>
The most efficient and effective method 
of managing invasive species is to prevent their invasion and spread [<a href="#145">145</a>]. Preventing the establishment of 
nonnative invasive plants in Natural Areas is achieved by 
maintaining healthy natural communities and by conducting aggressive surveying 
and monitoring 
several times each year. Monitoring efforts are best concentrated on the most 
disturbed areas in a site, particularly along potential pathways for 
tree-of-heaven invasion: roadsides, parking lots, fencelines, 
trails, and waterways. The
<a href="https://www.weedcenter.org">Center for Invasive Plant Management</a>&nbsp; 
provides an online guide to noxious weed prevention practices.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Integrated management:</font> 
A combination of complementary control methods may 
be helpful for  rapid and effective control of tree-of-heaven. Integrated management 
includes  not only killing the target plant, but  establishing desirable species and discouraging nonnative, 
invasive species over 
the long term.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Physical/mechanical:</font>
Mechanical treatments 
including cutting or girdling are a good 1st step in controlling tree-of-heaven. 
Cutting encourages both stump and root sprouts, so 
follow-up treatments are required. Cut stems before flowering to prevent seed 
spread, cutting at the ground level to prevent bole sprouts. Depending on bole 
size, mechanical tools including loppers, machetes, brush cutters, and power 
saws can be used on tree-of-heaven [<a href="#79">79</a>]. Sprouts can be 
controlled by further cutting treatments or herbicides [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>]. Unless the treatment area is heavily shaded, it usually takes 5 or more years of 
follow-up treatment to control sprouts [<a href="#72">72</a>].</p>

<p>In small areas,  seedlings can be controlled by hand pulling. 
Seedlings quickly develop extensive root systems, so the entire root needs to be 
removed to prevent sprouting. It is easiest to remove the entire seedling root when soils 
are softened by rain [<a href="#95">95</a>]. Top-growth of seedlings and root 
sprouts is similar, but root sprouts are connected by large, pre-existing 
lateral roots. Tree-of-heaven seedlings can sometimes be distinguished without digging by their 
cotyledons (if still present), trifoliate 1st leaflets, and thinner stems 
compared to the thicker stems and variable number of leaflets found on sprouts [<a href="#79">79</a>]. 
Grubbing roots may be effective for saplings [<a href="#157">157</a>]. Except for small infestations, grubbing roots is seldom practical 
for mature trees or well established 
tree-of-heaven colonies. The root systems are extensive and nearly impossible to 
entirely remove, and even a small root fragment can produce root sprouts [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><font size="4">Fire:</font> </font>
Fire has limited use 
in controlling tree-of-heaven, but may be useful for spot treatment. Instead of using 
mechanical or chemical methods to kill stems, a flame thrower or weed burner can 
heat-girdle tree-of-heaven boles. As with all top-kill methods, 
tree-of-heaven sprouts after heat-girdling [<a href="#28">28</a>].</p>

<p>Hunter [<a href="#79">79</a>] recommends against using fire to control tree-of-heaven 
colonies, speculating that burning is likely to promote vigorous sprouting. To 
date (2004), broadcast burning has not been attempted on tree-of-heaven, 
probably in large part for fear that a top-killing fire compounded by&nbsp;the 
nutrient flush that follows will result in dense postfire sprouting. Small-scale research is needed 
to compare long-term efficacy of fire vs. other methods in controlling tree-of-heaven.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Biological:</font> 
As of this writing (2004), there are no biological control 
agents approved for tree-of-heaven [<a href="#157">157</a>]. As a disease-resistant, unpalatable species, tree-of-heaven 
may be a 
poor candidate for biological control. Containing quassinoid compounds that 
inhibit development of most insect larvae and retard rotting [<a href="#66">66</a>], it is 
resistant to insect predation, root-feeding nematodes, and fungi 
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#140">140</a>]. Leaf-browsing lepidoptera (<i>Atteva 
punctella</i> and <i>Samia synthia</i>) damage tree-of-heaven [<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>], 
but usually inflict more damage to more palatable associated species such as 
wild cherries and plums (<i>Prunus</i> spp.). Asiatic garden beetles (<i>Maladera castenea</i>) feed on 
tree-of-heaven, but also damage numerous desirable plant species. Although cattle and deer 
browsing may reduce 
tree-of-heaven [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#152">152</a>], large mammalian browsers may prefer associated species to tree-of-heaven. Tree-of-heaven is less susceptible to root 
rots (<i>Phymatotrichum</i> spp.) than many native hardwoods. Two 
crop-infesting fungi,<i> Verticillium dahliae</i> and <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i>, 
have been isolated from dead and dying tree-of-heaven in the Northeast. These 
fungi may be candidates for fungal control of tree-of-heaven if strains 
affecting only <i>Ailanthus</i> species can be isolated [<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#135">135</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Plant competition</font></b> is not a reliable method of 
control. With 1 of&nbsp; the fastest growth rates of any tree in North America [<a href="#89">89</a>], 
tree-of-heaven will probably grow faster and outcompete whatever native 
species co-occur or are planted with it [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>]. Maintaining a healthy 
overstory can help minimize invasive potential for tree-of-heaven [<a href="#145">145</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Chemical:</font>  
Herbicides may provide initial control of a new
invasion or a severe infestation, but are rarely a complete
or long-term solution to invasive species management [<a href="#22">22</a>]. Herbicides are more effective on 
large infestations when incorporated into long-term management plans that include
replacement of weeds with desirable species, careful land use management, and
prevention of new infestations.
Control with herbicides is temporary, as it does not change conditions that
allow infestations to occur in the 1st place (e.g. [<a href="#175">175</a>]).
See The Nature Conservancy's <a href="https://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/handbook.html">Weed Control Methods
Handbook</a> for considerations on the use of herbicides in Natural Areas and
detailed information on specific chemicals.</p>

<p>Systemic herbicides (e.g., triclopyr and glyphosate), which kill roots, 
currently provide the best chemical control for tree-of-heaven. Dicamba, imazapyr, and methsulfuron methyl 
have also provided tree-of-heaven control [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>]. 
Applying herbicides late in the growing season, when 
tree-of-heaven is fully leafed out and translocating nutrients to the roots,&nbsp;is the only 
effective way to kill the roots [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>]. Aerial spraying may be indicated when there are large thickets 
without nontarget species, or as a follow-up treatment to other control methods. In mixed stands, 
aerial application of herbicides will 
probably have a 
greater impact on nontarget species that lack tree-of-heaven's ability to root 
sprout. When trees-of-heaven are interspersed with 
nontarget trees, the foliage, stumps, or basal bark of individual trees can be 
treated with herbicides. The stems can be cut, with immediate application of&nbsp; triclopyr 
or glyphosate to the stump. Coating the lower bole with herbicide, or girdling the 
stem and injecting the bole cuts with herbicide spray (hack-and-squirt), is also effective [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>]. 
Basal bark herbicide treatment (imazapyr or triclopyr) is most effective in late 
winter or early spring before trees begin to leaf out, although summer 
application also works [<a href="#"></a>].&nbsp;Swearingen and Pannill [<a href="#152">152</a>] provide information on applying foliar and basal 
bark chemicals 
to trees-of-heaven in 
wildlands.</p>

<p>In Shenandoah National Park, low-volume basal application of herbicides 
(triclopyr, picloram, imazapyr, and combinations) gave better tree-of-heaven 
control than cutting. At posttreatment year 2,&nbsp; a shift toward native herbs 
had occurred on plots where tree-of-heaven was controlled, while nonnative herbs 
including garlic mustard (<i>Alliaria petiolata</i>) and burdock (<i>Arctium 
minus</i>) were more prevalent on plots where tree-of-heaven density remained 
high. Mean tree-of-heaven density at posttreatment year 2 was [<a href="#21">21</a>]:</p>

<font size="2">*Several herbicide combinations and application rates were used. See Burch and Zedaker [<a href="#21">21</a>] for further details.</font>

<p>Chemical control programs targeting herbaceous species may unintentionally 
increase tree-of-heaven, depending upon the herbicides used. In West Virginia, 
diuron, simazine, and terbacil treatments for rough pigweed (<i>Amaranthus 
retroflexus</i>), barnyard grass (<i>Echinochloa crus-galli</i>), and other 
herbaceous weeds&nbsp; in an apple (<i>Malus sylvestris</i>) orchard 
successfully reduced most herbaceous weeds; however, tree-of-heaven and tall 
fescue (<i>Festuca arundinacea</i>) dominated plots treated with diuron and 
simazine. Terbacil alone gave best control of tree-of-heaven [<a href="#158">158</a>].<p>
