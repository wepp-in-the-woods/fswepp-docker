Desert ceanothus is an important constituent of many chaparral and desert shrub communities and also occurs in drier ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus
ponderosa</i>), pinyon-juniper (<i>Pinus-Juniperus</i>) and oak (<i>Quercus</i> spp.) woodlands
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>].


</p>
<p class="subframeText">

Desert ceanothus is listed as a dominant or indicator species in the following
publications:

</p>
<p class="subframeText"> California chaparral: Desert ceanothus occurs in several types of
California chaparral communities. Some plants that are common to many types of
California chaparral include chamise (<i>Adenostoma fasciculatum</i>),
manzanita (<i>Arctostaphylos</i>  spp.),
ceanothus (<i>Ceanothus</i>
 spp.), silktassel (<i>Garrya</i>  spp.), oak (<i>Quercus </i>spp.), mountain mahogany (<i>Cercocarpus
</i>spp.), sumac (<i>Rhus </i>spp.), California buckwheat (<i>Eriogonum fasciculatum)</i>,
sumac (<i>Rhus</i> spp.), and chaparral yucca (<i>Yucca whipplei)</i>&nbsp;[<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>]. Herbaceous vegetation is rare, but some annuals that may occur in early seral
communities are species of
the genera <i>Phacelia</i>, <i> Emmenanthe</i> and <i> Antirrhinum</i> as well as several opportunistic
annuals of the genera <i>Cryptantha</i>, <i>Camissonia</i>, <i>Lotus</i> and <i> Filago</i>
 [<a href="#82">82</a>]. Desert ceanothus shares dominance in desert chaparral communities with
mountain mahogany, flannelbush (<i>Fremontodendron californicum</i>),
bigberry manzanita (<i>A. glauca</i>), and interior live oak (<i>Q. wislizenii</i>)
[<a href="#74">74</a>]. Chamise or mixed chaparral is dominated by chamise, with desert ceanothus
a common secondary species. Additionally, desert ceanothus may be found in communities
dominated by Nuttall's scrub oak (<i>Q. dumosa</i>), redshank (<i>Adenostoma sparsifolium</i>),
Joshua tree (<i>Yucca brevifolia</i>), antelope bitterbrush (<i>Purshia
tridentata</i>), Stansbury cliffrose (<i>Purshia mexicana </i>var.<i> stansburiana</i>),
or toyon (<i>Heteromeles arbutifolia</i>). Early seral communities (10-60 years old) are
sometimes characterized by a relatively high cover
of ceanothus species, including desert ceanothus [<a href="#117">117</a>].&nbsp;Descriptions
of several types of chaparral communities of which desert ceanothus is a part (northern
mixed chaparral, semi-desert chaparral, desert chaparral) are available [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>].

</p>
<p class="subframeText">Arizona chaparral: Desert ceanothus is found in all Arizona chaparral communities described by Carmichael and others
[<a href="#12">12</a>], and is always in association with other species [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Arizona chaparral has sparser cover than its California counterpart, and it intergrades with desert scrub or grassland below and
ponderosa pine forest or pinyon-juniper woodland above [<a href="#54">54</a>].
Shrub live oak (<i>Q. turbinella</i>) is the most common component of
Arizona chaparral [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>]. Other common constituents of Arizona chaparral
are manzanita, mountain mahogany, silktassel, sumac, hollyleaf buckthorn (<i>Rhamnus crocea</i>), and cliffrose
[<a href="#57">57</a>].
Grasses and forbs are usually sparse, but more common than in California
chaparral communities.

</p>
<p class="subframeText">Mexico chaparral: In Mexico chaparral communities (which may also occur in southern New Mexico and
Texas), desert ceanothus is
associated mostly with evergreen shrubs of the same genera as those in Arizona
and California, including shrub oaks, silktassel, mountain mahogany, sumac,
ceanothus, and manzanita and some endemics such as&nbsp;madrone (<i>Arbutus</i> 
 spp.), and sage (<i>Salvia</i>
 spp.) [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>].
In the mountain ranges and desert scrub regions of Trans-Pecos, Texas, desert
ceanothus is found with sandpaper oak (<i>Q.
pungens</i>) mountain mahogany, Spanish bayonet (<i>Yucca faxoniana</i>),&nbsp;smooth-leaf
sotol (<i>Dasylirion
leiophyllum</i>), ocotillo (<i>Fouquieria splendens</i>), catclaw mimosa (<i>Mimosa
aculeaticarpa </i>var.<i> biuncifera</i>),
lechuguilla (<i>Agave lechuguilla</i>) and sacahuista (<i>Nolina microcarpa</i>)
[<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>].

</p>
<p class="subframeText">Pinyon-Juniper:&nbsp;In California pinyon-juniper woodlands, desert
ceanothus can be found with singleleaf pinyon (<i>Pinus
monophylla</i>), California and western juniper (<i>J. californica</i> and <i>J.

Desert ceanothus is considered fair to good, staple browse for livestock,
especially domestic goats, in winter and early spring [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>]. Because of their smaller mouths and more flexible
lips, domestic sheep and goats are better able to utilize the intricately
branched foliage than are cattle [<a href="#129">129</a>]. Angora goats relished desert ceanothus
seedlings in Arizona, while use of the mature plants was negligible [<a href="#57">57</a>].&nbsp;Similarly, desert ceanothus was used moderately by domestic
goats (Angora and Spanish) in southern California, with 1-year growth preferred to 5-years
growth [<a href="#29">29</a>]. Spanish goats in chamise chaparral in southern California&nbsp; preferred sandpaper oak and chamise over desert ceanothus for
summer browse [<a href="#118">118</a>].</p>

<p>Desert ceanothus is a highly preferred browse of wild ungulates and is used
throughout the year in many areas [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. It is particularly valuable as an
emergency browse during winter and early spring because of evergreen leaves
[<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>].
Desert ceanothus has been described as one of the most important deer browse
plants in chaparral ranges of California and the Southwest [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>]. Reports of use by white-tailed and mule deer range from only trace
amounts [<a href="#65">65</a>], to more moderate use [<a href="#38">38</a>], to heavy use in late
fall and winter. Smaller amounts are used in summer and early fall
and moderate
amounts in spring [<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>]. Elk and desert bighorn sheep
also consume desert ceanothus&nbsp;[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>].
Small mammals such as brush rabbits are known to feed on the
twigs, stems, and leaves of desert ceanothus [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].
Seeds are eaten by mule deer, many small mammals, chukar and other
birds, and insects [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>].&nbsp;

Desert ceanothus is highly palatable to most wild ungulates and to many classes
of domestic livestock. It is somewhat less palatable to cattle than
to deer or domestic sheep and goats [<a href="#129">129</a>].
Overall palatability to livestock and wildlife species is as follows [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]:

Desert ceanothus is thought to improve
soil fertility by fixing atmospheric nitrogen and is well-adapted for use in
stabilizing both neutral and acidic soils.
Establishment by seed is often poor, although seedlings may be readily
transplanted.
This shrub has been successfully planted onto many types of disturbed sites
throughout the Southwest and is particularly well-suited for use in southern and
northern desert shrub communities and chaparral [<a href="#96">96</a>].

Desert ceanothus is a potentially good hedge plant in the Southwest [<a href="#102">102</a>].
It is also commonly used in low-maintenance landscaping [<a href="#126">126</a>]. <i> Ceanothus

are esteemed honey plants [<a href="#46">46</a>]. The blossoms form a sweet
smelling lather when rubbed in water [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>]. <i> Ceanothus</i> spp. are known for
their medicinal value in stimulating lymph and intertissue fluid circulation [<a href="#79">79</a>]. The roots of ceanothus species can

OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Heavy cattle or sheep use of desert ceanothus on summer ranges may
be symptomatic of overstocking, and closely hedged plants are often indicative of range deterioration
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. Although deer damage is not as severe in desert ceanothus as in
other species of ceanothus [<a href="#38">38</a>], it is one of the first species to be
reduced on heavily populated deer ranges of the Southwest [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>]. Because of its low stature, the whole
plant is subjected to use so it cannot withstand, and may be totally eliminated
by,
continuous heavy browsing [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>].&nbsp;<p>
To minimize potential adverse impacts on wildlife, managers recommend treating no more than 50%
of an area
to reduce shrubs, with treated swaths averaging no more than 300 to 400 yards (275-366 m)
in width [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Desert ceanothus is an erect or low, rounded,
sclerophyllous
shrub
with intricate, short, rigid branches. It grows 1 to 7 feet (0.2-2 m) tall,
seldom more than 5 feet (1.5 m) [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>]. Although commonly thought to be short-lived (30-40 years) [<a href="#97">97</a>], Keeley [<a href="#47">47</a>] indicates that <i>Ceanothus
greggii</i> var. <i>perplexans</i> can live longer than 90 years. Longevity may
be increased in desert ceanothus through longitudinal fissioning of the stems. Age can be accurately
determined in <i>Ceanothus</i> spp. using growth rings [<a href="#52">52</a>]. Aboveground stems are locally even aged and date to the last fire [<a href="#54">54</a>].
Nonsprouting species of <i>Ceanothus</i>,
such as desert ceanothus, tend to be spatially
clumped especially in older stands [<a href="#50">50</a>], and can form dense,
impenetrable stands [<a href="#129">129</a>], or grow as lone shrubs [<a href="#136">136</a>]. The leaves are evergreen,
0.2 to 0.65 inches (5-16 mm) long, opposite, thick and firm [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>]. Three ovoid seeds are borne in each rounded
capsule [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>], and are propelled explosively as the capsules mature and dry. Roots tend to be shallow and laterally spreading, with
lateral growth far exceeding the depth of penetration (9.8 feet (3 m) of radial spread in a 2.5
foot (0.75 m) diameter plant). More than 90% of the roots occur within the top 12 to
16 inches (30-40 cm) of soil [<a href="#35">35</a>]. &nbsp;&nbsp;

</p>
<p class="subframeText">

Desert ceanothus contains nitrogen-fixing bacteria within its root nodules,
which may increase its abundance on nitrogen poor sites. Based on
fairly limited observations of root nodules in desert ceanothus in southern
California chaparral, Kummerow and others [<a href="#61">61</a>] estimated N fixation at the
rate of 0.09 pounds N per acre (0.1 kg per ha) per
year in a stand with 32% cover.&nbsp;Desert ceanothus has a relatively low
photosynthetic rate 90.85nM/cm<sup>2</sup>/sec<sup>-1</sup> in full sunlight
[<a href="#88">88</a>].&nbsp;

<a name="REGENERATION PROCESSES">
REGENERATION PROCESSES:</a>
</span>
<br />

Desert ceanothus relies on
production of numerous seedlings to maintain dominance or subdominance in
chaparral communities [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>]. It regenerates almost exclusively from
long-lived
seeds that accumulate in the soil [<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#146">146</a>]
and germinate prolifically following fire [<a href="#12">12</a>]. It is,
therefore, fire dependent, with sharp population increases after fire and an intervening period
during which there is mortality but little establishment [<a href="#146">146</a>]. Minnich
and Howard <i>  </i> [<a href="#73">73</a>] report the establishment of <i>Ceanothus greggii </i>var. <i>vestitus,</i>
en masse, after
pinyon fires, despite the absence of adults previous to the burn. There are
some reports of desert ceanothus sprouting from the stem or root crown after fire or
mechanical removal, although sprout survival is poor [<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>].

</p>
<p class="subframeText">Seed production: Desert ceanothus plants reach sexual maturity and begin producing seed
between 3 and 15 years of age [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>].&nbsp; Obligate seeding species of ceanothus produce several times the number of seeds as sprouting
ceanothus plants. Quantity of seed produced varies significantly (p&lt;0.01), sometimes
by orders of magnitude, from year to year [<a href="#48">48</a>], and may be influenced by plant size and density, stand
location and fluctuations in climate [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>]. One-year annual seed&nbsp; production at
a California site was estimated at 33.8 million seeds per acre (83 million per hectare)
[<a href="#70">70</a>]. Seed production
is thought to be related to the amount
of precipitation received in the previous year, with high precipitation leading
to greater seed production [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>]. Zammit and Zedler [<a href="#145">145</a>]
found that the rate of seed production increases with shrub height and was maximized within two decades
after fire. They observed no evidence of decline in seed
production with age of shrub up to 86 years. Average annual seed production ranged
from 0 seeds up to 21,092 seeds per plant. Seed
production requires flower pollination and is therefore dependent on insect
populations.&nbsp;

</p>
<p class="subframeText">Seed dispersal: Seeds are propelled explosively as the
capsules mature and dry. This mechanism aids dispersal as seeds are sent
outward from the parent plants, and may represent an antipredator strategy [<a href="#144">144</a>]. Rodents, birds, and ants may also play a role in seed dispersal [<a href="#13">13</a>].

</p>
<p class="subframeText">Seed banking:&nbsp; As many
as 1.0 to 1.4 million seeds per acre (2.6 to 3.7 million seeds per hectare) have
been observed in the soil at a given time [<a href="#48">48</a>]. Seed reserves are influenced primarily by site-specific patterns of seed production and by
the intensity of postdispersal seed predation and are not correlated with
time since fire [<a href="#143">143</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>]. Zammit and Zedler [<a href="#143">143</a>]
observed a significant (p&lt;0.05) increase in density of germinable seeds with increasing live crown cover, and
found highest density (180/ft<sup>2</sup> (2000/m<sup>2</sup>)) in stands of
intermediate age. Density of the soil seed bank is almost always lower than the
density of annual seed rain [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>]. Failure of seeds to accumulate over time may be due to losses by
erosion, predation or infestation, and severe fire [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. Seed of desert ceanothus stored in
the soil may remain viable for decades [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>]. Keeley [<a href="#48">48</a>] observed about 50% viability of&nbsp; desert ceanothus seeds stored in the soil.&nbsp;

</p>
<p class="subframeText">Seed predation: Most seeds produced in a year are consumed or
removed within a few
months of dispersal. Desert ceanothus seeds may be used by harvester ants that rapidly and
selectively remove seeds from the soil surface [<a href="#144">144</a>],&nbsp;
or they may be infested by the phytophagous chalcid wasps [<a href="#48">48</a>]. In some areas rodents may consume up to 99 %
of annual ceanothus seed production [<a href="#13">13</a>]. An estimate of seed loss is
34% of annual production [<a href="#145">145</a>].

</p>
<p class="subframeText">Germination: &nbsp;Germination between fires is
negligible, but after fire, seedlings are produced in abundance [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>], assuming a quantity of
viable seed is present in the soil. Heat stimulation or scarification
(5 min at 158 degrees Fahrenheit (70 <sup>o</sup>C)) is required for germination of desert ceanothus [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>]. Severe
fires can kill more shallowly buried seed, while stimulating those buried
more deeply [<a href="#144">144</a>]. Increasing fire severity resulted in
better and earlier germination of desert ceanothus seeds compared with chamise
seeds and sprouts. Fewer seeds
germinated in the field when compared with greenhouse germination studies,
suggesting that the number of seedlings emerging in the field is a fraction of
the postfire readily germinable seeds, and that suitable microsites for
germination are an important factor [<a href="#81">81</a>].&nbsp;

</p>
<p class="subframeText">Seedling establishment:&nbsp; Establishment of desert
ceanothus seedlings occurs during the 1st year postfire, although a few seedlings
may continue to
emerge during the 2nd season or later [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>]. Competition for light and
water is often intense [<a href="#47">47</a>]. Seedlings are vulnerable to the effects of drought
and damage by insects, rabbits or rodents [<a href="#72">72</a>]. Early mortality is
often high.
Keeley and Zedler [<a href="#55">55</a>] report 95% seedling survival during the 1st&nbsp;
year of regrowth at a southern California chaparral site, while Kummerow and others
[<a href="#62">62</a>] report only 7.8% survival of desert ceanothus seedlings the 1st&nbsp;year.

<p class="subframeText">

<a name="SITE CHARACTERISTICS">
SITE CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Desert ceanothus grows on dry, rocky slopes, foothills, canyons,
gullies, and in erosion channels [<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>]. It flourishes on a variety of soil
types, is tolerant of both basic and acidic soils, and most often grows on dry,
poorly developed soils [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>].&nbsp;It is most commonly found in areas with
20 to 30 inches (500-750 mm) precipitation [<a href="#140">140</a>]. Desert ceanothus is a chaparral species
that grows in several different community types in several geographic locations,
each with specific site characteristics. Attempts to ascribe site preferences for most
chaparral
species have generally produced weak correlations and indicate that preferences
may change with the region [<a href="#54">54</a>].&nbsp;

</p>
<p class="subframeText"> Chaparral
occurs on rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is best developed on steep slopes [<a href="#54">54</a>]. California chaparral is characterized by a Mediterranean
climate with cool, moist winters, and hot, dry summers. Water availability is
likely the primary determinant of community structure in areas where desert
ceanothus grows [<a href="#10">10</a>]. In general, obligate-seeding species
such as desert ceanothus increase in abundance,
diversity and longevity with increasing aridity. Seedlings of
these species are also more tolerant to drought than those of associated sprouting species
[<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>]. Poole and Miller [<a href="#100">100</a>] found desert ceanothus to maintain leaf
conductance at very low water potentials compared with associated chaparral shrub species.
However, Zammit and Zedler [<a href="#145">145</a>] found that shrubs on north aspects tend to grow
larger and produce more seed than those on south aspects, likely due to better
moisture availability on these aspects. Also, nonsprouting ceanothus may experience mass mortality within a stand in
severe drought years [<a href="#50">50</a>]. Desert ceanothus seems to capture and use more water by
using it lavishly while it is readily available, and still maintaining conductance at very low
water potentials [<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>]. Data suggest that water stress may inhibit nodulation in ceanothus, which
may help explain the low densities of N-fixing nodules found in desert ceanothus
compared with densities found under other ceanothus species in northern
California [<a href="#103">103</a>]. Availability of phosphorus may also limit growth of ceanothus
[<a href="#42">42</a>]. Desert ceanothus is a poor competitor under shaded conditions
[<a href="#50">50</a>].

</p>
<p class="subframeText">In Arizona, chaparral sites are most common on coarse
textured, poorly developed soils with granitic parent material [<a href="#6">6</a>].
Desert ceanothus is usually found on the upper portions of slopes and /or relatively level sites where other shrubs are
scarce [<a href="#12">12</a>].&nbsp;It is commonly found on north slopes at lower
elevations in the desert zone and south slopes at upper elevations, increasing
in abundance with increasing elevation up to 5,000 feet (1515 m) in Arizona [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>]. In the desert plains grassland in southern New
Mexico, Arizona and southwestern Texas, desert
ceanothus can be found along ravines and similarly favorable sites [<a href="#141">141</a>].

SUCCESSIONAL STATUS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Desert ceanothus is
considered to be part of a fire-induced climax in chaparral communities of
southern California and the Southwest [<a href="#12">12</a>]. Hanes [<a href="#31">31</a>] aptly described succession
in a <i>Ceanothus greggii </i>var. <i>vestitus</i> stand as &quot;more of a gradual elimination of individuals present
from the
outset than a replacement of initial shrubs by new species&quot;.&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p>Desert ceanothus produces a large number of seeds and, with fire, a small
number of mature plants are replaced by an abundance of seedlings which require
3 to 15 years
to reach sexual maturity [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>]. Parker [<a href="#90">90</a>] found that maximum
transpiration rates are consistently higher for shallow-rooted obligate-seeding <i>Ceanothus</i>
species than for deeper-rooted sprouting shrub species and that this results in
more rapid seedling growth for these species [<a href="#54">54</a>]. As seedlings grow
and shrub cover increases, there is intense intra- and
interspecific competition for light and moisture resulting in heavy mortality
[<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>]. Ceanothus dominated chaparral accumulates
aboveground biomass at an exponential rate through at least 2 decades after stand establishment [<a href="#108">108</a>].
<i>Ceanothus greggii</i> var. <i>vestitus</i> was found to have greatest canopy coverage in chaparral stands
22 to 40 years after disturbance [<a href="#47">47</a>], and desert ceanothus</span> was most abundant in 10-22 year old burns
[<a href="#76">76</a>]. Mortality of
ceanothus was observed to consistently decrease over
time up to 120 years [<a href="#50">50</a>]. Hanes [<a href="#31">31</a>]
observed that over one-half of the population of <i> C. crassifolius </i> and <i> C. greggii
</i>
var. <i> vestitus </i> was dead in stands older than 40 years. Desert ceanothus
plants are well adapted to competing in mature chaparral and are seldom entirely
eliminated from a stand [<a href="#108">108</a>]. If these &quot;short-lived&quot; species escape close competition
they can be quite long-lived [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>]. Keeley [<a href="#47">47</a>] observed that the <i>C. greggii</i>
var. <i>
perplexans</i> was still an important constituent of southern California
chaparral which had remained undisturbed for 90 years. Similarly, </span>Zammit and
Zedler [<a href="#145">145</a>] showed no decline in seed&nbsp;production in desert ceanothus 6-82 years after fire.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>It has been suggested that senescence occurs in older chaparral
due to the formation of allelochemicals and/or sequestering of nutrients in
biomass and recalcitrant soil compounds. Larigauderie and others [<a href="#63">63</a>] observed
little change in growth rate or vigor of desert ceanothus with
stand age, suggesting that desert ceanothus is not a short-lived species and its
elimination from older stands is likely due to reasons such as decline in
nutrient availability, rather than a physiological decline of the shrub.
Fenn and others [<a href="#23">23</a>] found no evidence that N stored in the
microbial biomass in soils under desert ceanothus is involved in nutrient
deficiencies in older California chaparral stands. Marion and Black [<a href="#68">68</a>]
observed an accumulation of available N over time up to 60 years, after which it
declined; and a steady decline in soil P over time.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="subframeText">In pinyon-juniper woodlands of southern California,
desert ceanothus is part of the understory shrub component that will dominate a
site for about 50 years following fire, followed by a slow recolonization of
singleleaf pinyon [<a href="#135">135</a>]. Wangler and Minnich [<a href="#135">135</a>] observed skeletons of desert
ceanothus but no living stems on burns greater than 47 years old in these
communities. Cover of desert ceanothus peaked at about 18-33 years after fire at
10-13% cover and 3,232-4,094 stems per ha. It is considered a perennial nurse shrub for single leaf
pinyon. Desert ceanothus was present only
in the earliest successional stage (grass-forb) as described by Koniak and
Everett [<a href="#58">58</a>] in another southern California pinyon-juniper woodland.

Seasonal development of desert ceanothus varies with geographic location.
In the Mediterranean scrub communities, growth rhythms are related to moisture
availability, with the majority of annual growth and flowering occurring in the spring
[<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>], growth all but ceasing at the onset of hot summer temperatures in late May,
and the fruiting period typically completed by June [<a href="#111">111</a>]. Desert
ceanothus plants flower on old growth from floral buds initiated
in the previous growing season [<a href="#54">54</a>]. Plants
may flower a second time during August through October if sufficient
summer precipitation is received [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. Shoot growth
lasts only a fraction of the time of seasonal root
growth [<a href="#60">60</a>].

</p>
<p class="subframeText">Desert ceanothus has the
capacity to fix carbon year-round [<a href="#54">54</a>], and data indicate that it will
grow whenever conditions are favorable [<a href="#122">122</a>].&nbsp;Stomatal conductances
are high (0.5 cm sec<sup>-1</sup>) in desert ceanothus in the winter when compared with other chaparral
evergreen shrubs. It is also likely to maintain more active photosynthesis into the drought
than many deep-rooted shrubs, but later in the season may have complete stomatal
shut-down for a month or more [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>]. Sparks and others [<a href="#119">119</a>]
measured seasonal photosynthate allocation in desert ceanothus and chamise and
observed relatively low structural allocation in spring and higher in summer;
and increased proportional allocation to storage in the fall.&nbsp;

<br />

Desert ceanothus is a component of chaparral communities
in which fire is a dominant part of the environment. These communities are
adapted to particular fire regimes defined by intensity, season and frequency of fire. In California chaparral
communities of which desert ceanothus is a common component, the context is
high-intensity canopy fires that usually come in the late summer or fall every
20-30 years on average [<a href="#89">89</a>]. Chaparral appears to be
resilient to fire-recurrence intervals of 100+ years [<a href="#54">54</a>].
Although Zammit
and Zedler [<a href="#145">145</a>] estimate that desert ceanothus shrubs will die out locally in
chaparral unburned for 85-155 years. Wildfires are less frequent in Arizona chaparral communities supporting desert
ceanothus, occurring every
50-100 years [<a href="#54">54</a>].<p class="subframeText">It is suggested that occasional long fire-free periods
(100 years or more) are an important evolutionary stimulus for the obligate
seeding strategy. The region of California with the
lowest lightning-fire frequency is the coastal range which is also the area
which supports the greatest abundance and diversity of nonsprouting species such
as desert ceanothus. With shorter fire frequency (20-30 years) both seeding and
sprouting species regenerate, but sprouting species may gain advantage after
several cycles [<a href="#55">55</a>]. Desert ceanothus may require 5-15 years
to reach sexual maturity, and fires at intervals this frequent may cause local
extinctions [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>]. Seedlings are rare
except after fire and populations are locally even aged and regionally a
mosaic of different aged populations dating to past fires [<a href="#146">146</a>].

Desert ceanothus plants are usually killed by fire [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>], and ceanothus regeneration may be reduced following prescribed burns
[<a href="#89">89</a>].

<p class="subframeText"> Heat stimulation or scarification
(5 min at 158 degrees Fahrenheit (70 <sup>o</sup>C)) is required for germination of desert ceanothus seed

Timing of fire, soil moisture, plant size, and physiological condition
may all play a role in whether plants and seeds are killed by fire. Plants are
usually killed, although there are reports of damaged plants surviving and
sprouting [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>].
Sprouts tend to be weak and easily succumb to stress
form drought, competition, herbivory, or further burning [<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>]. Severe
fires can kill the more shallowly buried seed, while stimulating those buried
more deeply [<a href="#144">144</a>]. Seed predation may occur following fire
as rodents and birds may dine on roasted
seed [<a href="#104">104</a>].

<p class="subframeContent">
<span class="subframeName">
<a name="PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE">

<br />

Mature plants (3-15 years) of desert ceanothus produce seed
annually and disperse it in the vicinity of the plant. Numbers produced can vary by orders of magnitude from year-to-year
[<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>]. Seed that is not lost to predation or
erosion accumulates in the soil around parent&nbsp;plants during fire-free intervals.
The soil seed pool is thought to be greatest in stands of intermediate age [<a href="#81">81</a>]. Seed can remain viable for decades and is stimulated by
heat to germinate following fire [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#146">146</a>]. Scarified, viable seed in suitable sites will
germinate if not lost to granivorous rodents or birds. Keeley [<a href="#48">48</a>] found about 50% of desert ceanothus seed in the soil was viable at a
southern California chaparral site.&nbsp; 

</p>
<p class="subframeText">Most seeds germinate the 1st spring after fire [<a href="#50">50</a>], although some
seedling establishment has been observed in subsequent springs [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>].&nbsp;Fire must be severe enough to scarify seed,
although a case was reported in which seed was not scarified by fire, but
by temperatures reached by sun on the blackened soil the 2nd postfire season [<a href="#53">53</a>].&nbsp; 

</p>
<p class="subframeText">The 1st 1 to 3 years after fire are critical in determining
composition of&nbsp; mature chaparral communities [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>]. Seedling mortality affects the species balance of shrub
seedlings and stump sprouts, is generally greatest during the 1st postfire year, and varies as a result of herbivory, competition
and climate [<a href="#72">72</a>]. Mortality of desert ceanothus may be high in
early postfire years when compared with other shrubs [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>].&nbsp;Although Keeley and Zedler
[<a href="#55">55</a>] report only 2% mortality of desert ceanothus
seedlings in the 1st postfire year at a California chaparral site, while
chamise and manzanita species experienced 39 to 71% mortality. Abundant seedlings
usually provide more than enough plants to insure
perpetuation even after high initial mortality [<a href="#62">62</a>].

<p class="subframeContent">
<span class="subframeName">
<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE">

</span>
<br />

Postfire seed germination and seedling establishment are
a
function of severity, size and season of fire, as well as climatic conditions, competition and
herbivory following fire. The number of desert ceanothus seeds that
germinate is a function of&nbsp; seed production during the
preceding fire-free interval, consumption or removal of seeds by animals and
insects, degree of heat scarification and postfire survival of seeds [<a href="#104">104</a>].&nbsp;The year and season in which a fire occurs may have important consequences for
the reproduction of desert ceanothus due to the fluctuations of seeds stored in
the soil [<a href="#48">48</a>].&nbsp; 


<p class="subframeText">Fires of greatest intensity would occur at some intermediate fire-free interval,
as fuel loads increase up to a point and
then decrease as more and
larger plants die and decompose. This is also the time when the soil seed pool
would be the greatest [<a href="#81">81</a>].</p>

<p>Pase [<a href="#91">91</a>] observed greater seedling establishment in Arizona chaparral following a severe burn (2,618 seedlings/acre (6466/ha)) than following a
less severe burn (636 seedlings/acre (1571/ha)). Moreno and Oechel [<a href="#81">81</a>] found that seedling abundance of desert
ceanothus was positively correlated with fire severity.&nbsp;Variability in
distribution of
desert ceanothus may be due to local fluctuations in fire severity [<a href="#76">76</a>].
Prescribed burns conducted when soils are moist may
reduce the response of&nbsp; desert ceanothus because the intensity and duration of
heat
may be too low to stimulate germination [<a href="#89">89</a>].&nbsp; 

</p>

<p class="subframeText">Large fires may harm population levels of nonsprouting
shrubs
that have suffered heavy soil seed predation [<a href="#48">48</a>]. However, a larger
burn may help protect seedlings from herbivory by small mammals that cannot reach
them due to lack of cover [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>]. 

</p>

<p class="subframeText">

Season of burn may affect establishment of desert ceanothus. Following early
spring (low severity) fires, establishment of ceanothus was poor compared
with more severe summer season fires [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>]. A chaparral stand dominated by
desert ceanothus and chamise was burned in the early winter, and desert
ceanothus seedlings failed to germinate the 1st postfire spring. Seedlings
were unable to compete with established vegetation the following spring,
resulting in a stand dominated by chamise [<a href="#89">89</a>]. 

</p>

<p class="subframeText">Drought following seedling establishment may favor
ceanothus over chamise [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. However, Moreno and Oechel [<a href="#80">80</a>] found&nbsp; mortality of desert ceanothus
seedlings was strongly related to depletion of soil moisture the
first few months after germination. While desert ceanothus demonstrates a greater
adaptability to the physical environment, it is also subject to a greater degree of
interspecific interference by plant and animal interaction than chamise.&nbsp; 

</p>

<p class="subframeText">

After a December prescribed burn in 54-year-old California chaparral desert ceanothus
seedlings numbered 4
seedlings per foot<sup>2</sup> (44 per m<sup>2</sup>) in May. Most of these seedlings died in May and
June, leaving 7.8% alive in December. Mortality was not affected by stump
sprouters, but was likely due to drought and/or herbivory by rabbits [<a href="#62">62</a>]. &nbsp; 

</p>
<p class="subframeText">Seedlings of desert ceanothus are lacking physical and chemical defenses against herbivores that
may develop later and are especially vulnerable
to herbivory [<a href="#104">104</a>]. Mills [<a href="#71">71</a>] observed that preferential consumption of
desert ceanothus by&nbsp; brush rabbits could eliminate its competitive advantage
over chamise. In&nbsp; the absence of herbivory, chamise experienced higher
mortality. Desert ceanothus plants that were located among the dense branches of chamise
were taller than
plants in uncovered microsites on open plots. This suggests that chamise may act as a nurse plant,
protecting desert ceanothus from herbivory by rabbits.&nbsp;Ceanothus seedlings were
also heavily infected by
psyllids during the 2nd and 3rd postfire years. This infection
significantly (p&lt;0.01) reduced growth and survivorship of ceanothus seedlings, killing around 13% of
seedlings [<a href="#72">72</a>].

<br />


It is important for managers to consider the natural fire
regime of desert ceanothus plant communities when planning prescribed burns
since deviations from the natural regime will change community composition and
structure [<a href="#89">89</a>]. Desert ceanothus may be an important
component in postfire communities because of its ability to fix nitrogen [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>]. Opportunities for population expansion
of desert ceanothus increase after fire [<a href="#50">50</a>]. Prefire plant community and soil seed bank
composition, along with timing, season, severity, and size of
burn, as well as postfire competition and herbivory will affect composition
of the postfire plant community.</p>
<p class="subframeText">Desert ceanothus requires 5 to 15 years
after fire before
substantial seed crops are produced, so fires at more frequent intervals can
produce localized extinctions [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>]. A diversity of fire-free intervals at one
site is suggested for maintenance of community diversity. Season of burn is
also an important consideration. The observation that fewer species germinate in chaparral communities
after winter and
spring burns may be explained by the fact that these communities evolved in a fire regime with late
summer and fall fires [<a href="#89">89</a>].&nbsp; Since soil seed bank density is
rarely as high as a single years seed rain, a fire that occurs closer to the time of
seed dispersal (usually late spring or early summer), operates on a larger seed
bank&nbsp;and will likely result in a
greater number of seedlings than would a fire later in the season [<a href="#104">104</a>].
It is important
to consider the relationship between prefire shrub age, vigor and seed
production, and postfire seedling establishment [<a href="#119">119</a>]. 

<p class="subframeText">Fire must be severe enough to scarify seed [<a href="#81">81</a>]. Similarly,
prescribed burns conducted when soils are
moist may reduce the response of the seed bank, if the intensity and duration of
the heat is too low to stimulate germination [<a href="#89">89</a>].&nbsp; High severity
fires favor desert ceanothus over chamise. A high severity spot occupied by a burned out chamise plant will likely
succeed to desert ceanothus due to its greater resistance to fire severity [<a href="#81">81</a>].&nbsp; 

</p>
<p class="subframeText">Size of fire may also affect survival of desert
ceanothus. The interior of large burns may be relatively free of
small mammals, thereby favoring desert ceanothus. On smaller burns access may be immediate and frequent,
resulting in reduced&nbsp; cover of desert ceanothus [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].&nbsp;&nbsp; 

</p>
<p class="subframeText">Seeding with
grasses after fire may impede establishment of ceanothus seedlings [<a href="#2">2</a>]. In the absence of herbivory, desert ceanothus exhibits a competitive
advantage over chamise [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>]. Crown cover of desert ceanothus was unchanged in
an Arizona
chaparral community that was seeded to weeping lovegrass (<i>Eragrostis curvula</i>)
and grazed by cattle after a severe wildfire [<a href="#99">99</a>]. 

</p>

<p class="subframeText">There is
increasing dead biomass in a stand as shrubs age and die, resulting in increased
flammability [<a href="#119">119</a>]. Brush management burning guidelines are available [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>]. Some flammability characteristics of
desert ceanothus are given in Rundel [<a href="#110">110</a>]. Chaparral types dominated by ceanothus will burn only under conditions of very low fuel moisture or high winds and it
is not unusual to find stands over 100 years old in this type [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Plants are killed by fire. Heat stimulates germination
of large numbers of stored seed. Prescribed fire can enhance the browse quality
of decadent ceanothus stands, as numerous seedlings emerge after fire.
