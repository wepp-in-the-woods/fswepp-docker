<pre><center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus contorta var. contorta
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Shore pine occurs along the Pacific Coast from Yakutat Bay, Alaska,
south through the Coast Ranges to Mendocino County, California
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  In the eastern part of its range, shore pine occurs
intermittently with Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine in the Cascade Range
of northwestern Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Shore
pine is also found in the Klamath Mountains of Oregon and California
[<a href="#49">49</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Shore pine is a dominant species in the northern part of its range.
Farther south, shore pine is a codominant or subdominant species.  In
mixed stands, shore pine may form scrubby thickets or sparse to dense
groves.  Other vegetation is usually sparse [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].

Shore pine is listed as an indicator in the following published
classifications:

  Provisional plant community types of southeastern Alaska [<a href="#1">1</a>]
  A classification system for California's hardwood rangelands [<a href="#2">2</a>]
  Preliminary forest plant association management guide [<a href="#11">11</a>]

<pre><center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus contorta var. contorta
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
The wood of shore pine is light, brittle, coarse grained, and has a high
specific gravity [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Shore pine is occasionally used as fuel and
produces 8,730 British thermal units per pound [<a href="#18">18</a>].



<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Rodents eat the seeds of shore pine [<a href="#27">27</a>], and porcupines consume the
cambium [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Shore pine is of slight importance to big game but
provides important edge habitat for other animals [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Alaskan
brown bears travel through corridors of shore pine en route to feeding
areas.  Shore pine provides nesting habitat for yellowlegs in Alaska
[<a href="#11">11</a>].



<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Shore pine survives strong, salty winds on dry crests and wet
depressions.  Shore pine has helped stabilize recent sand dune expansion
in California [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Native Americans boiled the inner bark of shore pine for food [<a href="#16">16</a>].
Coastal Native Americans used the pitch of shore pine to treat open
sores and chewed the buds to relieve sore throats [<a href="#3">3</a>].



<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Shore pine is a useful species for watershed stabilization [<a href="#22">22</a>].  It has
shown potential in shelterbelt plantings because of its branching habit
and winter hardiness [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Road construction should be avoided on
shore pine sites where possible because of the exceptionally deep, wet
woils [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Shore pine sites are important because they absorb
excessive rainfall and regulate waterflows [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Shore pine is valued
for the rapid early growth of seedlings [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Shore pine is a primary host to lodgepole pine dwarf mistletoe
(Arceuthobium americanum); however, infection by this parasite has been
observed only in a few coastal areas of British Columbia [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Shore
pine is a host to hemlock dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium tsugense), which
can cause localized infections [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus contorta var. contorta
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Shore pine is a short-lived, native conifer [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  At maturity,
depending on the site, shore pine reaches heights of 20 to 50 feet (6-15
m) and d.b.h.'s of 6 to 20 inches (15-50 cm) [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  The trunk
is often twisted, and crown shape varies from dense and round to
irregular [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  The bark of shore pine is furrowed and up to 1
inch (2.54 cm) thick [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Shore pine has many branches [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].
The short, narrow leaves occur in fascicles of two [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  The
cones are persistent [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  They are about 1.5 to 2 inches
(3.8-5.1 cm) long [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  Cones of shore pine are typically
nonserotinous [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Serotiny tends to increase farther inland but
is erratic and unpredictable [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Shore pine does not reproduce by sprouting [<a href="#40">40</a>].

Shore pine begins producing cones between 5 and 10 years of age [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].
Good seed crops usually occur every other year [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Owen and Molden
[<a href="#50">50</a>] discuss development of lateral shoot terminal buds.  Shore pine
produces large amounts of flowers and pollen [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].

Percentage of sound seed ranges from 75 to 79 percent [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Fresh seed
requires no stratification, but stored seed requires 20 to 30 days
stratification.  Seeds are viable for up to 17 years in cold storage
[<a href="#22">22</a>].  Seed falls approximately 200 feet (60 m) from the source under
normal conditions [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Shore pine requires absorbent soils, light, and
warm temperatures for germination [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Shore pine grows in a maritime climate throughout most of its range.
Annual precipitation, which falls year-round and mostly in the form of
rain, is 60 to 200 inches (1,500-5,000 mm) [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Shore pine occurs
from sea level to the subalpine zone (5,030 feet [1,525 m]) in Alaska
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Shore pine occurs in peat bogs and muskegs on gentle slopes and
lowlands [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  It is most common on poorly drained, deep
Histosols [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].

Conditions are xeric in the southern-most part of shore pine's
distribution, where it occurs in closed-cone pine and cypress
communities of California [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Shore pine habitat here includes
coastal dunes, seaside bluffs, and exposed rocky headlands; winds may be
strong and salty [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Soils are Inceptisols, Alfisols, and Ultisols;
best growth is on well-drained loams with a pH of 5 [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Here shore
pine occurs at elevations between sea level and 1,690 feet (0-507 m)
[<a href="#33">33</a>].

Overstory and understory tree species not mentioned in Distribution and
Occurrence include yelow cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis), Mendocino
White Plains lodgepole pine, bishop pine (Pinus muricata), and common
juniper (Juniperus communis) [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Associated shrubs are
huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.), bog Labrador-tea (Ledum groenlandicum),
bog kalmia (Kalmia polifolia), northern twinflower (Linnaea borealis),
bunchberry dogwood (Cornus canadensis), and crowberry (Empetrum nigrum)
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Commonly associated herbs are sedges (Carex spp.),
naked sedge (Calamagrostis nutkatensis), rusty menziesia (Menziesia
ferruginea), and narrowleaf cottonsedge (Eriophorum angustifolium)
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Sphagnum moss (Sphagnum spp.) is a common associate in
Alaska [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Shore pine occurs in extreme habitats that are unfavorable to other,
potentially competitive species [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  Windthrow and landslides are
common [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Shore pine is a climatic climax in bog woodlands, reproducing under its
own canopy [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Shore pine is considered a climax species in many
areas [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].

Shore pine is shade intolerant [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].



<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Male and female strobili are initiated late in the growing season.
Development continues in the spring [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Pollen shedding begins in mid-
to late May [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Cones mature between September and October, with
seed dispersal following shortly afterward [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].

<pre><center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus contorta var. contorta
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fire is not an important factor in forest succession where shore pine
occurs in southeastern Alaska [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Fire is infrequent in maritime
forest types and usually is of little ecological significance [<a href="#25">25</a>].  The
fire interval is 150 to 350 years but may not be cyclic [<a href="#35">35</a>].  The
coastal cedar-pine-hemlock biogeoclimatic zone of British Columbia has
little or no fire history.  The presence of shade-tolerant firs and
hemlocks and fire0sensitive species, such as shore pine, indicate that
fire is rare in this area [<a href="#34">34</a>].

The coastal dunes where shore pine occurs in California are considered
fire-free [<a href="#48">48</a>].

The foliage of shore pine is moderately flammable.  Shore pine has a
moderate to low degree of fire resistance [<a href="#25">25</a>].
