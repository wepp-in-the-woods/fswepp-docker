<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pickeringia montana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Chaparral pea is important browse for black-tailed deer.  They carefully
pick out leaves and flowers from among the thorny stems; flower
consumption is particularly heavy.  Livestock rarely browse the
species [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Chaparral pea browse is rated as excellent to good for black-tailed
deer, depending on the season and the number of sprouts available.  It
is fair to poor browse for sheep and goats, poor for cattle, and useless
for horses [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Protein levels in chaparral pea are notably higher than levels in most
chaparral shrubs during the early growth stages, and higher than average
during winter [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Analysis of chaparral pea leaves and stems yielded
the following results [<a href="#2">2</a>]:

      Month      Crude Protein (%)        
     February           8.1          
     April             19.2          
     May               18.1          
     June              14.3           
     July              11.5
     August            11.4
     September          6.1
     October            7.5             


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Fire depletes nitrogen from chaparral soils.  Nitrogen-fixing bacteria
within chaparral pea root nodules increase soil fertility [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].

Chaparral pea provides watershed protection [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Black-tailed deer rarely browse chaparral pea in dense older stands.
Heaviest use occurs on recent burns or mechanically treated brush
fields, where deer readily crop young sprouts [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Light disking of
mature chaparral pea increases available forage because plants sprout
wherever roots are exposed [<a href="#23">23</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pickeringia montana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Chaparral pea is a native evergreen shrub from 1.6 to 6.6 feet (0.5-2 m)
in height.  Branches are stiff and dense, with spine-tipped branchlets
[<a href="#16">16</a>].  The sclerophyllous leaves are 2 to 6 inches (5-15 cm) long.  The
fruit is a legume containing 6 to 10 seeds.  Root nodules are dense and
arranged in large clusters [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte
   Cryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
The primary method of reproduction is vegetative.  Most sources state
that chaparral pea spreads by sprouting from the roots [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].
Munz [<a href="#16">16</a>], however, stated that it spreads from rhizomes.  Damaged
plants sprout from the roots and root crown [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

Fruiting is rare [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  Zedler [<a href="#27">27</a>] suggests that the few seeds that
do mature have high rates of sterility or low viability.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
The climate in which chaparral pea grows is Mediterranean, characterized
by wet, mild winters and hot, dry summers [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Soils are usually low
in fertility [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Soil pH varies from moderately to slightly acid
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Soil parent materials include siliceous sandstone, siliceous
shale, serpentine, and diabase [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Chaparral pea occurs at elevations
from 2,000 to 5,000 feet (610-1,524 m).  It is most commonly found on
ridgetops [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>]

Plant associations:  Overstory associates not listed under Distribution
and Occurrence include Tecate cypress (Cupressus forbesii), Sargent's
cypress (C. sargentii), bishop pine (Pinus muricata), Coulter pine (P.
coulteri), tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflora), and California bay
(Umbellularia californica) [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].

Common shrub associates include Eastwood manzanita (Arctostaphylos
glandulosa), chamise, wedgeleaf ceanothus (Ceanothus cuneatus),
chaparral whitethorn (C. leucodermis), birchleaf mountain-mahogany
(Cercocarpos betuloides), sawtooth goldenbush (Haplopappus squarrosus),
poison-oak (Toxicodendron diversilobium), hollyleaf cherry (Prunus
ilicifolia), California scrub oak (Quercus dumosa), and chaparral yucca
(Yucca whipplei) [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

Herbaceous associates are rare in mature chaparral stands but are common
following disturbance in the plant community [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Common herbaceous
associates include California goldenrod (Solidago californica), chaparral
pentstemon (Pentstemon heterophyllus), common soap-plant (Chlorogalum
pomeridianum), dove lupine (Lupinus bicolor), wild oat (Avena fatua),
ripgut brome (Bromus rigidus), soft chess (B. mollis), foothill stipa
(Stipa lepida), and smallflower milicgrass (Melica imperfecta) [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Ecologists disgree as to the successional status of mixed chaparral.  It
has been variously described as climax [<a href="#7">7</a>], fire-climax [<a href="#4">4</a>], or fire
subclimax [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Chaparral pea is a component of mature, mixed chaparral
communities [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Following fire or other disturbance, it is a
survivor, repopulating the initial community from sprouts [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Seedling
colonization following disturbance is largely unstudied.  Chaparral pea
has tentatively been classified as having a low to intermediate rate of
seedling establishment in secondary succession [<a href="#28">28</a>].  In the absence of
fire or other disturbance, chaparral pea and associated chaparral shrubs
are replaced by oak woodland or coniferous forest [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Since chaparral pea grows in mixed evergreen forest, it is probably
moderately shade tolerant.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Chaparral pea begins growth in February [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Plants flower from May
through June [<a href="#16">16</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pickeringia montana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Chaparral pea has adapted to fire by sprouting from the roots and
root crown following damage to aboveground portions of the plant
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>]. 

Prior to fire suppression, mixed chaparral burned at fairly frequent
intervals.  Most chaparral shrubs, presumably including chaparral pea,
recover quickly from fire.  Litter accumulation in mixed chaparral is
often heavy [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Consequently, these mixed stands are able to carry
fire after only a few years of postfire growth [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Frequent fire kept
chaparral pea and associated shrubs at a young stage of development.
Because of this periodic fuel consumption, chaparral fires usually did
not burn with the intensity of the fires of today [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pickeringia montana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Moderate-severity fire usually top-kills chaparral pea [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Plant
mortality due to such fire is low to intermediate [<a href="#28">28</a>].  The percentage
of complete kill varies by season.  Spring or early summer fire, when
carbohydrate reserves are depleted by rapid topgrowth, causes higher
mortality than does late summer or fall fire [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Data pertaining to postfire density, frequency, or growth rate of
chaparral pea sprouts were not found in the literature.  Sclerophyllous
shrubs, including chaparral pea, typically sprout within a few weeks
following fire [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Sprouts grow most rapidly after late summer or fall
fires.  Shrub canopy generally closes within 10 years postfire [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Postfire chaparral pea seedling recruitment appears to be scant.  Zedler
[<a href="#27">27</a>] initially stated that the species did not colonize burn areas.
Later, he found that postfire colonization occurred but was rare [<a href="#28">28</a>].
One study of postfire recovery of mixed chaparral, conducted in
southwest San Diego County, showed a density of 4.6 chaparral pea
seedlings per square yard (3.8 plants/sq m) at the first postfire
growing season.  Seedling mortality was 64 percent in the first year
[<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Deer management:  Prescribed spring fire was used successfully in Lake
County to improve deer habitat.  Openings and "edge" were created in
formerly dense chaparral brush.  Browse quality was improved by the
sprouting of top-killed shrubs, including chaparral pea.  A year
following the fire, the ratio of fawns to does increased greatly, and
weight gain in bucks was improved, especially in young animals [<a href="#3">3</a>].
