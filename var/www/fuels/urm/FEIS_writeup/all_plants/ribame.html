<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
On a burned site in northwestern Minnesota, moose consumed American
black currant forage during April and May of postfire year 2.  American
black currant comprised 7 percent of browsed twigs or stems.  It was not
selected in preference to other shrub species [<a href="#19">19</a>].

The fruit of Ribes spp. is a valuable food source for songbirds,
chipmunks, ground squirrels, and other animals [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability of American black currant to wildlife in some western
states is rated as follows [<a href="#7">7</a>]:

Pronghorn              fair
Elk                    fair
Mule deer              fair
Small mammals          good
Small nongame birds    good      
Upland game birds      fair
Waterfowl              poor


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The fruit of American black currant is low in lipids and high in sugars
[<a href="#38">38</a>].

Cover values for American black currant are rated as follows [<a href="#7">7</a>]:

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The fruit of American black currant is used for making jam, jelly and
pie.  American black currant is cultivated as an ornamental [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
American black currant is an alternate host for white pine blister rust
(Cronartium ribicola) which infests five-needled pines.  Because of
their association with the rust, Ribes spp. have been the targets of
various eradication efforts; however, these efforts have had some
success only in the Great Lake States [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ribes americanum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
American black currant is a native, deciduous shrub growing from 3.3 to
5 feet (1-1.5 m) tall [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Its many erect branches lack spines
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  The three- to five-lobed, suborbicular leaves are 1.2 to 3.2
inches (3-8 cm) wide and gland-dotted beneath [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Drooping
racemes are five- to ten-flowered [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  The globose berries are
smooth and contain many seeds [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
American black currant reproduces mainly by seed.  The ability of
American black currant to sprout from the root crown has not been
described in the literature.

Shrubs of Ribes spp. begin fruiting after 3 years [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Many seeds fall
beneath the parent plant; they are also dispersed by birds and mammals
[<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].
  
Mineral soil and scarification generally enhance germination in Ribes
spp.  [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Results of germination experiments on American black
currant are variable.  In Montana, no germination was obtained when
American black currant fruit was fermented, aerated for 2 weeks, flailed
mechanically in water, and washed on screens [<a href="#9">9</a>].  In Dun County,
Wisconsin, seeds were obtained from green berries, almost-mature
berries, and mature berries.  They were refrigerated for 6 months,
soaked in water for 10 days, and placed on moist blotting paper at 59
degrees Fahrenheit (15 deg C).  After 13 months, only one seed, from a
"mature" berry, had germinated [<a href="#11">11</a>].  A germination rate of 76 percent
was obtained by stratifying American black currant seeds at 28 and 36
degrees Fahrenheit (-2.2-2.2 deg C) for 90 to 120 days.  Seeds were
stratified and germinated in sand moistened with nutrient solution [<a href="#26">26</a>].
Hoyle [<a href="#18">18</a>] reported that chilling American black currant seeds at 38.3
degrees Fahrenheit (3.5 deg C) for 15 weeks promoted germination.

Fallen seeds of Ribes spp. may remain viable in the soil and duff for
many years [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  The viability of American black currant seeds from
herbarium specimens 3 to 9 years old was tested.  Fourteen seeds were
extracted and planted in peat at 40 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit (10-25 deg
C) daily alternation.  No seeds had germinated by the fourteenth week.
Drying Ribes seeds may induce dormancy [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
American black currant has wide ecological amplitude.  It occurs in
swamps [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>], in moist woods and canyons [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>], along roadsides,
and on plains, foothills, and mountains [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  It grows on
clayey, sandy, and rocky soils [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  In Colorado, the elevational
range of American black currant is 3,500 to 8,000 feet (1,050-2,400 m)
[<a href="#16">16</a>].  On the Pine Ridge escarpments in Nebraska, American black currant
occurs from 2,500 to 4,500 feet (750-1,350 m) [<a href="#39">39</a>].

The Pine Ridge escarpments receive an average annual rainfall of
approximately 18 inches (45.72 cm), and summer drought is frequent.  The
average frost-free period is 145 to 150 days [<a href="#39">39</a>].  On the eastern edge
of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, where American black currant occurs in
alder swamps, climate is continental with modification by Lake Superior.
The average annual rainfall is 31 inches (780 mm).  The average annual
snowfall is 96 inches (2,500 mm).  The average summer temperature is 63
degrees Fahrenheit (17 deg C), and the mean frost-free period is 116
days [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
American black currant is somewhat shade tolerant.  It often grows in
moist forests [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  In Long Grove, Illinois, American black
currant grows in closed canopied woodlands [<a href="#2">2</a>].  In Minnesota, very
dense balsam fir (Abies balsamea) or northern white-cedar (Thuja
occidentalis) overstories suppress Ribes spp. [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
American black currant flowers May through June [<a href="#23">23</a>], and seed ripens
from mid-August through early September [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Near Woodworth Stutsman
County, North Dakota, Callow and others [<a href="#6">6</a>] recorded the following
phenological dates for American black currant from 1979 to 1984:

earliest first bloom				        5/12/80
latest first bloom					6/06/79
median date of first 10 plants with flowers		5/18
median date of full flowering				5/21
median date when flowering was 95% complete	        6/9
mean length of flowering period			        22 days

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ribes americanum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fire ecology of American black currant is not described in the
literature.  Although many authors discuss the effect of fire on Ribes
spp., most refer to studies conducted by Quick [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Quick described
postfire seedling establishment by Sierra Nevada gooseberry (R. roezli).

In northeastern Minnesota, skunk currant (R. glandulosa), like American
black currant, grows on moist to wet sites [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Skunk currant
seedlings established during postfire years 1 and 2 on sites where
low-severity wildfire or prescribed fire had occurred.  By postfire year
5, skunk currant had begun to decline [<a href="#1">1</a>].

American black currant regeneration is probably favored by fire because
scarification of soil-stored seed generally enhances germination in
Ribes spp.  [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  The ability of American black currant to sprout
after fire is not described in the literature.

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ribes americanum

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire probably severely damages or kills American black currant.

On Reed Turner Nature Preserve in Long Grove, Illinois, fall prescribed
fires were conducted in closed canopy woodlands.  Fuel loads before the
fire were 550 grams per square meter.  In postfire year 1, American
black currant decreased in importance by more than 50 percent [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
In northwestern Minnesota, American black currant was observed growing
on a burned site in postfire year 2.  It is not clear whether American
black currant had sprouted or established from seed [<a href="#19">19</a>].
