<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carex rossii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Pocket gophers are most common in communities with productive herbaceous
understories, which include Ross' sedge, for grazing and cover [<a href="#42">42</a>].
Ross' sedge provides forage for livestock and wildlife [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Ross' sedge palatability varies depending on site and animal.  Cattle
graze it sparsely on pinyon-juniper sites; sheep graze it rather heavily
in aspen parks [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Generally, palatability to elk, mule deer, and
moose is moderate to high, and it is highly preferred by bighorn sheep
[<a href="#15">15</a>].

In the spring, Ross' sedge is highly palatable to black bears.  In the
summer, palatibility for black bears, elk, and sheep is moderate; and
low for deer and cattle.  In the fall Ross' sedge palatability is low
for black bears; in the winter palatability is low for deer and elk
[<a href="#34">34</a>].



<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The food value of Ross' sedge is poor for mule deer, white-tailed deer,
and pronghorn, but fair for elk and small mammals [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Ross' sedge has
a good to fair forage value for sheep in the Rocky Mountains and
Colorado Basin [<a href="#15">15</a>].

In early spring, grasses such as Thurber needlegrass (Stipa
thurberiana), squirreltail (Elymus elymoides), Sandberg bluegrass (Poa
secunda Presl.), Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis), and junegrass
(Koeleria cristata) exceed Ross' sedge in protein, phosphorus, calcium,
crude fat, and apparent digestibility.  Crude fiber is high in March for
Ross' sedge.  As the growing season progresses through summer and into
the fall, Ross' sedge increases to surpass the grasses in protein,
calcium, crude fat, and apparent digestibility.  Ross' sedge was highest
in moisture from late July to October.  The calcium-phosphorous ratio is
good during this time (0.5:1) and dry matter disapperance (DMD) was 40
percent in the summer and fall [<a href="#18">18</a>].

One year after logging, Ross' sedge increased in crude protein and
continued to increase for 3 more years [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
In Wyoming, cover value of Ross' sedge is poor for pronghorn, elk, mule
deer, white-tailed deer, upland game birds, and waterfowl.  For small
mammals and small nongame birds the cover value is fair [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Ross' sedge sprouts readily on disturbed sites.  It survived fuel oil
spills in southeastern British Columbia [<a href="#15">15</a>], and despite heavy density
losses, Ross' sedge recovered well from log skidding disturbances.  On
disturbed sites that are seeded with grass, Ross' sedge is outcompeted
and less prevalent than on sites that are not seeded [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

Ross' sedge's extensive root system and ability to grow on unstable or
loose material give it good soil-building and erosion-control
capabilities [<a href="#15">15</a>].

At campsites, Ross' sedge is not significantly affected by trampling
[<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Ross' sedge is a persistent, winter-hardy plant that is drought and
browse tolerant [<a href="#15">15</a>].  It is one of the most difficult understories to
remove.  One year after removal with a grub hoe, it had reestablished an
extensive root system [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Logging practices that disturb soils beyond
a depth of 2 inches (5 cm) destroy the rhizomes of sedges.  On steep
slopes, logging with horses or cable minimize disturbance [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Ross' sedge seed is not commercially available.  Splitting and
transplanting the clumps may be effective for establishment.  More
research is needed in this area [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Cutting in lodgepole pine and ponderosa pine habitats of which Ross'
sedge is the understory dominant should be restricted to light or
moderate shelterwood.  Partial cutting and minimizing disturbance will
prevent Ross' sedge from increasing, preserve the site, and maintain
diversity [<a href="#17">17</a>].

There are no significant pests or diseases of Ross' sedge [<a href="#15">15</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carex rossii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Ross' sedge is a native, long-lived perennial graminoid [<a href="#15">15</a>].  The stems
are reddish at the base and occur in bunches, forming medium-sized
clumps [<a href="#24">24</a>].  The stems are 2 to 12 inches (5-30 cm) tall, often
equaling or exceeding the leaves.  The leaves are thin, flat, and
narrow.  Its fruit is an achene [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Ross' sedge reproduces by rhizome growth and by seed production [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].
It is wind pollinated.  Seeds buried less than 1.5 inches (4 cm) deep
are capable of germination, but germination was best following heat
treatment.  Seed may remain dormant for long periods of time prior to
germination [<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Ross' sedge occurs at dry, well-drained sites.  Typical climates are
boreal, temperate, cool, semiarid, mesothermal, and xerophytic [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].
Ross' sedge is most commonly associated with xeric grasslands, aspen
parkland, open woods, and disturbed or exposed sites of montane and
subalpine regions [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].

Soil types are shallow, dry to moderately dry, coarse or fine textured,
ranging from sandy loam to clay loam [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  They may be
unstable or compact, mildly saline, nitrogen moderate, with a pH range
of 6.0 to 6.7 [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Ross' sedge occurs sporadically on stony or
rocky soils [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Slopes generally range from 0 to 35 percent [<a href="#17">17</a>].
Precipitation is variable.  Ross' sedge prefers a southern aspect, but
it will grow on other aspects [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Ross' sedge grows at a variety of elevations but is a strong competitor
at lower elevations [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Below are some elevations at which Ross'
sedge occurs [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>]:

                          feet              meters
California                 0-12,400              0-3,760
Colorado               5,500-12,000          1,670-3,640
Montana                4,300- 9,500          1,300-2,880
Oregon                 4,225- 4,620          1,280-1,400
Utah                   6,000-12,000          1,820-3,640
Washington             3,000- 5,800            910-1,760
Wyoming                4,800- 9,800          1,455-2,960

In forest habitats, Ross' sedge is sparse but dominant [<a href="#17">17</a>].  These
habitats are usually low in timber productivity, potential for
improvement, and water productivity [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].

In addition to those previously listed under Distribution and
Occurrence, Ross' sedge associates include:  mountain maple (Acer
spicatum), blue huckleberry (Vaccinium globulare), snowbrush (Ceanothus
velutinus), brittlebrush (Purshia tridenta), sagebrush (Artemisia spp.),
gland cinquefoil (Potentilla glandulosa), elk sedge (Carex geyeri),
bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum), pinegrass (Calmagrostis rubescens),
Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis), and squirreltail (Elymus elymoides)
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

Ross' sedge is most common in early seral communities and unstable
situations [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  It is an aggressive pioneer of hostile sites and is
partially shade tolerant [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Ross' sedge is often replaced by larger
shrubs and trees as succession progresses [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

In a study by Zamora [<a href="#44">44</a>], Ross' sedge was dominant for 3 years
following clearcut and broadcast burning.  By year 8, it was codominate
with shrubs but was still dominant at lower elevations and less-shaded
sites; by year 12 it was subdominant; and by year 23 it was rare.

Ross' sedge occurs but is not very common in climax habitats [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Growth begins in spring.  Flowering occurs between May and June [<a href="#9">9</a>].
Seeds are possibly produced in early July.  Seedlings emerge in late
fall or early winter [<a href="#18">18</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carex rossii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Ross' sedge survives fire through buried seed with long-term viability
[<a href="#33">33</a>].  These seeds germinate after heat treatment [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Ross' sedge's rhizomes survive low- to moderate-severity fires [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil
   Ground residual colonizer (onsite, initial community)
   Secondary colonizer - onsite seed
   Secondary colonizer - offsite seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carex rossii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire top-kills Ross' sedge.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Ross' sedge is resistant to fire.  It regenerates through rhizomes and
seed germination [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  Recovery is rapid to moderate, taking 2 to 10
years to return to preburn frequency [<a href="#43">43</a>].

Ross' sedge increases after fires that heat the soil but do not
completely consume duff [<a href="#5">5</a>].  After the Sundance Fire of northern Idaho,
Ross' sedge was one of the most widely distributed plants [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Ross'
sedge occurred on burned and grass-seeded plots but was more prevalent
on unseeded burn plots [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Ross' sedge increased for 4 years
following the fire [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Season of fire does not appear to have a major
effect on plant recovery [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].

At some sites, Ross' sedge may be part of the prefire vegetation but may
exist as "residual seed in the ground awaiting fire to create the proper
germination conditions" [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Development of Ross' sedge cover is best at lower elevations (below
3,800 feet [1,150 m]) [<a href="#43">43</a>].

Vigor of first-year plants after early spring or summer burns may be
reduced by grazing [<a href="#41">41</a>].
