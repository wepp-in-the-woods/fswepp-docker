<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Deciduous holly is not a dominant or indicator species in habitat
typings.  It occurs in a variety of cover types and has a number of
associated species.  The most common overstory and midstory associates
not previously mentioned include red maple (Acer rubrum), winged elm
(Ulmus alata), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), southern red oak (Quercus
falcata), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), tree huckleberry

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ilex decidua
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Deciduous holly fruits are consumed by small mammals, songbirds and game
birds, including eastern bluebirds, wild turkeys, and quail.  They are
also eaten by white-tailed deer [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  White-tailed deer and cattle
browse both leaves and twigs [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>



<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Deciduous holly is planted as an ornamental [<a href="#42">42</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Deciduous holly is moderately tolerant to periodic flooding.  Mature
trees can withstand flooding of up to 35 percent of the growing season.
Saplings have survived 105 days of flooding from March to July [<a href="#11">11</a>].
Near Alton, Illinois, deciduous holly maintained vigorous growth through
4 years of continuous flooding, but declined in the fifth year [<a href="#9">9</a>].  It
is more likely to survive in frequently flooded plots than is common
persimmon (Diospyros virginiana) or elms (Ulmus spp.)  [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Deciduous holly can supress regeneration of timber species [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Control:  Deciduous holly is susceptible to stem injection of 2,4-D and
glyphosate [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Deciduous holly seedling counts were highest on
bottomland hardwood sites that had been harvested and site-prepared by
herbicide stem injection of all stems larger than 2 inches (5 cm) d.b.h.
The lowest numbers of deciduous holly seedlings occurred on sites that
had been harvested and site-prepared by shearing [<a href="#14">14</a>].  When managing
for white-tailed deer, burning or slashing deciduous holly stems is
preferable to herbicide application; the sprouts resulting from those
treatments provide deer browse [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Deciduous holly is a good choice in plantings for wildlife; individual
plant fruit production is consistent from year to year, and a high
percentage (greater than 70 percent) of individuals bear fruit [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Increase:  Production of deciduous holly browse was highest under medium-
thinning intensity in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantations [<a href="#2">2</a>].
Deciduous holly can be propagated by cuttings [<a href="#42">42</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ilex decidua
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Deciduous holly is a native, large shrub or small tree.  The average
maximum height at maturity is 33 feet (10 m) [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  The bark is
smooth or slightly roughened [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  The fruit is a four- to
seven-seeded berry [<a href="#3">3</a>].

The national champion (1981), located in South Carolina, is 3 feet
(9 m) in circumference and 42 feet (12.8 m) in height [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Deciduous holly produces abundant, light seeds that are dispersed by
frugivores.  In bottomland hardwood forests in Texas, first-year
seedling survivorship was good.  Seedling survival increases with
distance from a conspecific or sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) adult.
Deciduous holly seedlings grow slowly, about 0.4 to 0.8 inch (1-2 cm)
per year [<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Deciduous holly is usually found on moist soils of floodplains, low
woodlands, wet thickets, and along streams.  It occurs infrequently on
well-drained wooded slopes or sandy pineland ridges [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  It is
occasional in hydric hammocks in Florida [<a href="#41">41</a>].  It occurs in elevations
of up to 1,180 feet (360 m) throughout its distribution [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Deciduous holly is found in all successional stages.  It colonizes areas
that have been disturbed by fire, and it is found in old-growth
bottomland hardwood forests [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].

Deciduous holly was abundant in the third and fourth years after removal
of a young green ash (Fraxinus pensylvanica)-American elm (Ulmus
americana) stand [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Deciduous holly flowers from March to May [<a href="#4">4</a>].  The fruits ripen in
September and persist until the following spring [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Seedling
emergence occurs before spring canopy development in early February, and
continues through May [<a href="#37">37</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ilex decidua
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Deciduous holly grows in a number of habitats, some of which may be
subject to fire.  Some resistance to fire is conferred by the ability to
sprout after top-kill.  Its main fire adaptation is the ability to
colonize disturbed soils through animal-dispersed seed [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tall shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ilex decidua
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Deciduous holly is damaged, top-killed, or killed by light- or
moderate-severity fires [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  After two prescribed fires in
loblolly-shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) stands, deciduous holly
exhibited moderate mortality (up to 50 percent) after fires in cut-over
sawtimber-sized stands, and low mortality after fires in pulpwood-sized
timber [<a href="#33">33</a>].  High mortality (up to 100 percent) of stems less than 1
inch (2.54 cm) in diameter occurred after winter prescribed fire in a
slash pine plantation [<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
The number of deciduous holly stems increased following prescribed
spring fires in loblolly-shortleaf pine stands.  Fruit production
increased following fire, but since there was also a large increase in
fruit production on control plots, it was difficult to separate the
effects of fire from other effects [<a href="#36">36</a>].

Numerous deciduous holly seedlings occured on loblolly-shortleaf pine
plots that received two prescribed fire treatments [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Nine years
after wildfire in a loblolly pine community, deciduous holly did not
occur on plots that had undergone surface fire only.  Plots where fire
crowning occurred were colonized by seedlings resulting from
animal-dispersed seed [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
The mean, ash-free caloric value for deciduous holly leaves is 5,311
calories per gram.  This value can be used in calculations to predict
heat release during fire on sites with deciduous holly litter [<a href="#12">12</a>].
