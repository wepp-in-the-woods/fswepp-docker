<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Saltgrass occurs in varying densities in many plant communities, but it
is only a dominant or codominant under certain conditions.  Nearly pure
stands of saltgrass are indicative of sites where soils are saline and
fine textured and where the surface soils are wet at least part of the
growing season [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].

Great Plains communities dominated by saltgrass occupy low, moist,
saline areas [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].  The boundary between saltgrass meadows and
upland communities is often sharp, as soil textures change along an
elevational gradient [<a href="#51">51</a>].

In the sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) steppe and bluebunch wheatgrass
(Pseudoroegneria spicata)-Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis) vegetation
types of eastern Washington, saltgrass habitat types either consist of
pure stands of saltgrass or support a two-layered association consisting
of a continuous stand of saltgrass with well-spaced bunches of basin
wildrye (Leymus cinereus) or black greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus)
[<a href="#14">14</a>].

Saltgrass is a dominant grass in the low-elevation desert shrub
vegetation of the Great Basin where it often forms a sod under black
greasewood, rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus spp.), or shadescale (Atriplex
confertifolia) [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].  Cooccurrence of black greasewood and
saltgrass is usually an indication of soils with high moisture content.
If soil salinity becomes greater than about 1 percent, black greasewood
gives way to pure stands of saltgrass [<a href="#18">18</a>].

species or as a dominant part of the vegatation are listed below:

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Llivestock generally avoid the harsh foliage of saltgrass.  It usually
remains green all summer long, even after other upland grasses become
dry.  If it is the only green vegetation in the area, livestock will eat
it during the summer [<a href="#63">63</a>].  The seeds are eaten by numerous species of
waterfowl and small mammals [<a href="#54">54</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Saltgrass is harsh, wiry, and tough.  It and is of low to fair
palatability for livestock and wildlife [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].

The degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife species for
saltgrass in several western states is rated as follows [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>]:

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Saltgrass is low in nutritive value.  For cattle, diets of straight
saltgrass should be avoided.  Livestock that graze on this species only
can develop severe rumen compaction [<a href="#76">76</a>].

Nutritional values of North Dakota plants, analyzed during full bloom in
August, are given below [<a href="#39">39</a>]:

% moisture   % ash   % crude protein   % crude fiber   % N fee extract

   15         8.91        8.11             26.53           39.95

In Utah, the protein content of aerial plant parts dropped from 15 to 5
percent from April 1 to July 30, and remained at 5 percent through
September [<a href="#32">32</a>].



<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Saltgrass provides cover for small wildlife species.  It often forms a
dense sod, which provides good concealment.  Pure stands of saltgrass
provide nesting sites for numerous species of ducks and shorebirds
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>].  Nests can be subjected to flooding on some sites.


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Saltgrass is an outstanding plant for wind or water erosion control on
saline or alkaline sites.  Sites that have been stabilized with
saltgrass include oil drilling sites contaminated from saltwater spills
[<a href="#31">31</a>], red mud (bauxite residue) impoundments from mining activities
[<a href="#23">23</a>], dry, saline lakebeds [<a href="#19">19</a>], the crowns and banks of irrigation
ditches and levees [<a href="#48">48</a>], disturbed riparian sites [<a href="#56">56</a>], and roadside
ditches [<a href="#75">75</a>].

Commercial seed is not available, but rhizomes collected in the field
and planted onto problem areas quickly sprout and spread.  Rhizomes can
tolerate a wide range of osmotic potentials but are sensitive to
desiccation [<a href="#55">55</a>].  Attempts to establish saltgrass from rhizome sections
should be limited to wet, saline areas, unless irrigation is used during
establishment.  Planting rhizomes at depths of 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm)
has proven to be most successful [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Examination of rhizomes
collected in the field showed that roughly 67 percent are capable of
sprouting and forming shoots in any season.  Rhizomes may be stored for
up to 28 days at temperatures ranging from 35 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit
(2-10 deg C) and at a relative humidity of 60 to 75 percent.  Growth of
rhizomes has been found to be best at temperatures between 77 and 86
degrees Fahrenheit (25-30 deg C) [<a href="#55">55</a>].  Although seed sources are
limited, proper methods for seeding saltgrass have been discussed
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Saltgrass is highly resistant to grazing and is classified as an
increaser.  Because it normally occurs on moist sites, it is used to its
best advantage during periods of drought.  Cattle should not be allowed
to graze it continually in late fall and winter when other more
palatable grasses are scarce.  If this cannot be avoided, cattle should
be fed 5 pounds of alfalfa hay per head per day [<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].

Saltgrass is highly resistant to trampling.  It is therefore desirable
in areas where livestock concentrate, such as watering sites, corrals,
and trails [<a href="#76">76</a>].  It was found to be the most wear-resistant of several
grasses subjected to various rates of compaction and wear from pick-up
trucks [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Because saltgrass is a poor forage, attempts have been made to
rehabilitate saltgrass meadows by killing the saltgrass and planting
more palatable salt-tolerant grasses [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  Plowing, discing, and
other mechanical methods have proven ineffective in controlling it
because it regrows profusely from rhizomes [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  The herbicide
ghyphosate has killed up to 98 percent of this grass in field and
greenhouse experiments [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].

Soils of saltgrass-dominated sites are often high in clay content and
are susceptible to compaction.  Trails and roads should be located on
adjacent uplands [<a href="#34">34</a>].  A sod formation of saltgrass around lakes often
indicates alkaline conditions which are unfavorable for fish [<a href="#33">33</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Distichlis spicata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Saltgrass is a native, perennial, rhizomatous, warm-season grass 4 to 16
inches (10-40 cm) tall [<a href="#83">83</a>].  Under conditions of extreme salinity,
plants are often dwarfed [<a href="#80">80</a>].  Plants are dioecious.  The male panicle
often extends above the leaves, but the female panicle is normally
enclosed within the leaves [<a href="#83">83</a>].  Panicles of both sexes are 1.5 to 3
inches (4-8 cm) long with only a few spikelets [<a href="#13">13</a>].  The blue-green to
gray-green leaves are stiff, sharp pointed, coarse, spread along the
entire stem, and cure to a golden brown at the end of the growing
season.  Rhizomes are vigorous, scaly and up to 71 inches (180 cm) long
[<a href="#32">32</a>].  In a Colorado study, saltgrass rhizomes were found growing 4.2
inches (10.7 cm) below the soil surface in a layer between the B2 and C
soil horizons [<a href="#51">51</a>].  Saltgrass typically has a shallow root system.  In
a Nevada study, roots were never found deeper than 16 inches (40 cm)
below the soil surface [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Saltgrass has many physiological adaptations which allow it to occupy
saline environments.  Plants contain salt glands that are active in the
extrusion of salt.  This helps retain sufficient ion concentrations in
the leaf tissue to maintain adequate osmotic potentials [<a href="#32">32</a>].  The
lacunae tissue of the roots is apparently continuous with the rhizome
and leaf sheath which allows for gas exchange under partial inundation
by water and in heavy soils [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Vesicular-abuscular mycorrhizal fungi
have been observed on inland saltgrass roots and are thought to further
enhance salt tolerance [<a href="#38">38</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Saltgrass is a poor seed producer.  Seed production is often restricted
to favorable sites which support dense, healthy stands [<a href="#10">10</a>].
Reproduction is mainly vegetative; plants spread through a
well-developed system of deep underground rhizomes.  Rhizomes sprout
even when buried under 12 inches (30 cm) of sediment [<a href="#50">50</a>].

Germination:  Better than 80 percent germination of saltgrass seed from
New Mexico was achieved with alternating temperatures above 81.5 degrees
Fahrenheit (27.5 deg C) for 8 hours and 62 to 73 degrees Fahrenheit
(16.5-23 deg C) for 16 hours [<a href="#61">61</a>].  For Nevada seed, alternating
temperatures of 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 deg C) for 8 hours and 50
degrees Fahrenheit (10 deg C) for 16 hours gave 58 percent germination
[<a href="#10">10</a>].  In this study, temperature fluctuations of at least 36 degrees
Fahrenheit (20 deg C) and an osmotic potential of -0.1 MPa were required
for greater than 10 percent germination.  Germination is inhibited by
high levels of salinity.  One study attained up to 72 percent
germination of scarified seed placed in distilled water but only 21
percent germination of scarified seed in a 1.0 percent solution of
sodium chloride [<a href="#53">53</a>].

These germination studies show that saltgrass seeds require relatively
high temperatures, low salinities, and moist soils to germinate.  In
natural seedbeds, these conditions rarely occur [<a href="#60">60</a>].  Under natural
conditions probably only a few seeds will germinate, unless
precipitation or soil moisture is unusually high in the summer, a time
when soil temperatures would be warm enough for large numbers of seeds
to germinate [<a href="#60">60</a>].  Although plants can grow in soils with very low
osmotic potentials and very high salt concentrations, seeds cannot
germinate in such soils [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Germination only takes place in less
saline soils.

Seedbanking:  Soil samples taken from a Utah marsh show that numerous
marsh plants have viable seeds stored in the soil.  When soil samples
taken from an saltgrass-dominated community at this marsh were placed in
a greenhouse under conditions favorable for germination, 340 saltgrass
seedlings per square meter of surface soil were produced [<a href="#68">68</a>].
Saltgrass seeds were also present in soil samples from other vegetation
types within the same marsh.  Seeds can remain dormant for at least 4
years [<a href="#63">63</a>].  Seedbanking may allow plants to become established in large
numbers when favorable conditions for germination are met.

Seed dispersal:  Seeds are dispersed by wind and water [<a href="#71">71</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Saltgrass attains best development in depressed areas that receive
seasonal runoff or have water tables near the soil surface.  Typical
sites supporting lush saltgrass growth include prairie and grassland
swales, salt flats, desert playas and valley bottoms, intermittent
ponds, saline meadows, and along the borders of springs, streams and
lakes.  Soil characteristics are the most important factors influencing
distribution.  Saltgrass tends to form a dense sod only on soils
that have a high salt content, a fine texture, and a good supply of soil
moisture throughout the year.  Soil attributes are summarized below:

  Salinity - Saltgrass tolerates a wide range of soil salinity.
  It occurs on highly saline and nonsaline soils.  It has been found
  growing on soils ranging from .03 to 5.6 percent total salts [<a href="#80">80</a>].
  Because many other grasses cannot survive in soils with high
  salinities, saltgrass is often a dominant, forming a sod with
  2,000 to 3,000 stems per square meter, when the salt content of the
  soil becomes greater than about 0.33 to 0.5 percent [8,78,,80].  It
  can survive on sites where the soil surface is encrusted with a layer
  of salt.

  pH - Saltgrass is usually found on alkaline soils, with a pH
  between 7.5 and 8.5 [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].  Extremes in pH may range from 6.8
  to 10.5 [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>].

  Texture - Soil textures vary from sand and gravel to clay, but
  saltgrass seems best adapted to medium- and fine-textured soils [<a href="#63">63</a>].
  In the Great Plains, depressions and meadows dominated by saltgrass
  generally have soil textures ranging from fine clays to silt
  loams [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].  

  Moisture - Water tables are often near the surface.  Some sites are
  periodically flooded and remain inundated in the spring.  In Nebraska,
  saltgrass grew best in meadows where the water level was 16 to
  36 inches (41-91 cm) below the soil surface [<a href="#77">77</a>].  Along the Rio Grande
  River in New Mexico, it was restricted to areas where
  the water table was within 4 feet (1.2 m) of the soil surface [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Soil-moisture gradient and associated communities:  On an ancient lake
bed in Ruby Valley, Nevada, plant distributions along a soil-moisture
gradient were studied.  In order of increasing depth to ground water,
dominant species were baltic bulrush (Juncus balticus), saltgrass,
shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruiticosa), basin wildrye, black
greasewood, and rubber rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus nauseosus) [<a href="#52">52</a>].  In
Montana, adjacent wetter communities tend to be dominated by hardstem
bulrush (Scirpus acutus) and Nevada bulrush (S. nevadensis), while drier
communities are often dominated by black greasewood or upland grasses
[<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  In marshes along the Great Salt Lake in Utah, saltgrass
is common in areas that periodically dry out.  Adjacent wetter, less
saline areas are dominated by cattails (Typha spp.), saltmarsh bulrush
(Scirpus maritimus), hardstem bulrush, and reed (Phragmites australis)
[<a href="#73">73</a>].

Associates:  Associated grasses include alkaligrass (Puccinellia
nuttalliana), foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum), western wheatgrass
(Pascopyrum smithii), alkali sacaton (Sporobolus airoides), plains
bluegrass (Poa arida), Rocky Mountain glasswort (Salicornia rubra), and
Pursh seepweed (Suada depressa) [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].

Flood tolerance:  Saltgrass is very flood tolerant [<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>].  Plants
grown in metal containers survived partial (plant crown covered) and
total (entire plant underwater) inundation for 24 days.  Although plants
exhibited loss of vigor, they essentially recovered within 30 days after
the water was drained [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Drought tolerance:  Saltgrass has moderate to high drought tolerance
[<a href="#63">63</a>].  It can remain dormant for long periods until rain or floodwaters
replenish soil moisture [<a href="#64">64</a>].

Elevation:  Elevational ranges for several western states are given
below:

        below 6,000 feet (1,829 m) in AZ [<a href="#40">40</a>]
        from 3,500 to 9,000 feet (1,067-2,743 m) in CO [<a href="#16">16</a>]
        from 2,740 to 4,300 feet (835-1,311 m) in MT [<a href="#16">16</a>]
        below 6,500 feet (1,981 m) in NM [<a href="#25">25</a>]
        from 3,640 to 7,515 feet (1,010-2,290 m) in UT [<a href="#85">85</a>]
        from 4,000 to 7,500 feet ( 1,219-2,286 m) in WY [<a href="#16">16</a>]


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Saltgrass is a pioneer species.  It invades barren, saline soils that
other grasses cannot tolerate.  Its sharp-pointed rhizomes are well
adapted to piercing heavy clays and shales [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Spreading by rhizomes
allows saltgrass to colonize salt flats, inundated playas, lakeshores,
shale cliffs, and other saline barren sites by extending from areas that
are favorable for growth to areas that are less favorable [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>].
Once established, it may aid in forming soils for the subsequent
establishment of other plants.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Saltgrass is a warm-season grass.  It begins growth in the spring about
1 month later than cool-season grasses occurring in the same area.  In
eastern Washington, growth of new tillers begins in late April, and the
shoots remain green all summer when upland grasses go into aestivation
[<a href="#14">14</a>].  North Dakota plants were observed in full bloom in August [<a href="#39">39</a>].
Flowering in Montana occurs in June and July [<a href="#16">16</a>].

At Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge in Utah, saltgrass phenology
was observed on two areas of a saltmarsh.  On portions of the marsh
influenced by 80 degree Fahrenheit (27 deg C) spring water, saltgrass
showed earlier phenological development [<a href="#4">4</a>]:

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Distichlis spicata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Saltgrass rhizomes occur deep in the soil where they are insulated from
the heat of most fires.  Temperatures ranging from 118 to 156 degrees
Fahrenheit (48-69 deg C) never penetrated deeper than 1.5 inches (3.8
cm) into the soil during a prescribed fire on September 2, 1981 at a
drained marsh at Ogden Bay, Utah [<a href="#70">70</a>].  Following the fire, there was no
decrease in living saltgrass roots or rhizomes.

Viable seeds of saltgrass may be stored in meadow soils.  Soil samples
taken before and after the aforementioned fire contained comparable
numbers of viable saltgrass seeds [<a href="#71">71</a>].  Fire did not kill the saltgrass
seeds stored in the soil, and many germinated after the fire.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Most fires consume the aboveground foliage of saltgrass.  


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Saltgrass survives fire by sending up new growth from rhizomes.
Increases in biomass following fire are common.  The aboveground
standing crop of saltgrass increased following a prescribed burn on
April 15, 1981, in a black greasewood/inland saltgrass habitat type in
eastern Oregon.  One year following this prescribed burn, the
aboveground standing crop of saltgrass averaged 550 grams per square
meter on burned plots, but only 398 grams per square meter on unburned
plots [<a href="#88">88</a>].  In the true prairie of eastern North Dakota, saltgrass
responded favorably to a prescribed burn on May 8.  Before the fire,
saltgrass frequency was 100 percent, and it remained at 100 percent
during the growing season following the fire [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Three months after
the fire on August 4, saltgrass aboveground biomass was greater on
burned plots (115.2 grams oven dry weight/m2) than unburned plots (76.8
grams oven dry weight/m2) [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Daubenmire [<a href="#14">14</a>] reported that a basin
wildrye-saltgrass stand in eastern Washington was burned annually for
many years by "clean-up crews" and that the plants remained healthy and
in high vigor.

On a Utah marsh where a dense stand of saltgrass was killed by a
combination of fire and flooding, some seedlings emerged from seed
stored in the soil [<a href="#81">81</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In many wildlife refuges, marsh vegetation is controlled by regulating
water levels of the marsh.  Although saltgrass rhizomes survive burning,
they will be killed if saltgrass sites are flooded following burning
[<a href="#70">70</a>].  Flooding after burning apparently kills saltgrass rhizomes by
preventing gas exchange.  Saltgrass is an important cover plant for
nesting waterfowl, and control is seldom warranted in waterfowl
production areas.

New growth following fire is higher in nutritive quality than unburned
plants.  Nutritional information concerning saltgrass plants sampled
before and after a September prescribed fire in a Utah marsh is
presented below [<a href="#74">74</a>]:

                      protein   ash   cellulose   hemicelulose  lignin

before burning, 4/81   11.68    9.19    30.13        32.99      11.14
after burning, 4/82    17.83   10.79    26.59        34.98      10.83
