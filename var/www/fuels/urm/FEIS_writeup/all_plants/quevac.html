<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Mule deer browse huckleberry oak heavily.  Foliage is sparsely used by
livestock, but they readily eat huckleberry oak acorns.  Acorns are also
consumed by a variety of wildlife, including black bear, mule deer,
various rodents, blue grouse, mountain quail, and various small nongame
birds [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability of huckleberry oak for livestock and deer is rated as
follows [<a href="#21">21</a>]:

     mule deer: fair to poor
     cattle:    poor to useless
     sheep:     poor to useless
     goats:     poor to useless
     horses:    useless


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Huckleberry oak affords excellent erosion control on steep slopes of
watersheds [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Nursery seedlings have been planted in the Lake Tahoe
Basin as a part of a project to control erosion and reduce sediment
entering Lake Tahoe [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Plants are also established by fall planting
of acorns.  Cultivation methods have been detailed [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Unwanted huckleberry oak can be controlled by applying 2,4-D or triclopr
ester to freshly cut stumps, or by grubbing out root crowns [<a href="#24">24</a>].






</pre>

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus vaccinifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Huckleberry oak is a native, drought-resistant, evergreen, erect to
prostrate, spreading shrub.  It grows from 2 to 4 feet (0.6-1.2 m) high.
Branches are slender and flexible, with smooth bark [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Leaves are
sclerophyllous and brittle.  Acorns are from 0.4 to 0.6 inch (1.0-1.5
cm) long [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Huckleberry oak is wind pollinated.  The age at which acorns
are first produced is unknown.  Acorns mature in 1 year [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Limited
research places their germination capacity at 43 percent.  Germination
is hypogeal and occurs rapidly under warm, moist conditions [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Vegetative:  Huckleberry oak sprouts from the root crown following
damage to aboveground portions of the plant [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  It also reproduces
by layering [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Huckleberry oak is found on xeric sites such as dry, windy ridges from
3,000 to 10,000 feet (305-3,049 m) in elevation [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Slope varies
from gentle to steep.  The soil is often rocky, and varies in depth from
shallow to moderately deep (4.7 to 37.4 inches [12-95 cm]) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].
Huckleberry oak will grow in serpentine soils [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Overstory associates not listed as SAF cover types include sugar pine
(Pinus lambertiana), beach pine (P. contorta ssp. contorta),
incense-cedar (Libocedrus decurrens), Brewer spruce (Picea breweriana),
Baker cypress (Cupressus bakeri), and giant chinkapin (Chrysolepis
chrysophylla) [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>] .

Shrub associates include pinemat manzanita (Arctostaphylos nevadensis),
California buckthorn (Rhamnus californica), poison-oak (Toxicodendron
diversilobum), Wood's rose (Rosa woodsii), deer oak (Quercus
sadleriana), Fremont silktassel (Garrya fremontii), squawcarpet
ceanothus (Ceanothus prostratus), chaparral whitethorn (C. leucodermis),
and shrub forms of California bay (Umbellularia californica), common
juniper (Juniperus communis), and tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflora),
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].

Groundcover associates include obscure bedstraw (Galium ambiguum),
heart-leafed arnica (Arnica cordifolia), cliff-brake fern (Aspidotis
densa), bear-grass (Xerophyllum tenax), red fescue (Festuca rubra),
California fescue (F. californica), nodding microseris (Microseris
nutans), false-flax (Carex serratodens), scarlet paintbrush (Castilleja
miniata), and western rattlesnake plantain (Goodyera oblongifolia)
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>]. 


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Huckleberry oak is an edaphic or fire-climax species on some sites
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  In the absence of fire and under favorable soil conditions,
huckleberry oak is seral to coniferous species [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Huckleberry oak initiates growth in April or after snowmelt at high
elevation.  Flowering occurs from May to June.  Information on time of
acorn drop is lacking.  Seasonal growth ends around November with the
onset of freezing temperatures [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].

<pre><center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus vaccinifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Huckleberry oak has adapted to fire by sprouting from the root crown
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  

This shrub has resinous, flammable leaves [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Its low, spreading
growth form encourages surface fire, especially in dense, even-aged
stands with considerable horizontal continuity [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Huckleberry oak
in the subcanopy layer of coniferous forests often acts as a ladder
fuel, resulting in crown fire [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Small shrub, adventitious-bud rootcrown

<pre><center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus vaccinifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Huckleberry oak is top-killed by fire [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  The percentage of
individuals suffering complete kill following moderate and severe fires
is undocumented.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
The postfire recovery rate of huckleberry oak is undocumented.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Huckleberry oak aids in the spread of surface and crown fires.  Reducing
the density of shrub fields is recommended, especially in inhabited
areas or locations nearby.  This can be accomplished by removing every
other oak in a field, or by creating islands of shrubs with cleared
areas between them.  Stumps require herbicide treatment or grubbing out
to prevent sprouting.  Thinning huckleberry oak in the subcanopy layer,
and pruning "leave" shrubs to less than 18 inches (46 cm) in height
reduces fire hazard in forested areas [<a href="#24">24</a>].
