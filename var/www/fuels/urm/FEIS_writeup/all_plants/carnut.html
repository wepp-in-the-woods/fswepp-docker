<br />

In North American literature, the scientific name <i>Carduus nutans</i> L., commonly known as musk thistle,
has been applied to an aggregate of large-flowered plumeless thistles in the
aster (Asteraceae) family [<a href="#92">92</a>]. This report uses <i>Carduus nutans</i> L. as the scientific name
for the musk thistle complex as it occurs in North America
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>].</p>
<p>The <i>C. nutans</i> group has almost continuous variation in several
morphological characteristics, and intermediates between
taxa can be found [<a href="#118">118</a>]. Kartesz and Meachum [<a href="#59">59</a>] identify 4
subspecies in North America (see &quot;Synonyms&quot; above), while <a href="http://193.62.154.38/FE/fe.html">Flora Europaea</a> identifies
only <i>Carduus nutans</i> L. ssp. <i> nutans</i> 
 as a subspecies that occurs in North America [<a href="#115">115</a>]. Detailed treatments of the
taxonomy of <i>Carduus</i> species are available [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>].</p>
<p>Hybridization and introgression between musk thistle and spiny plumeless
thistle (<i>Carduus
acanthoides</i>) have been reported. The hybrid is referred to as <i>C.</i>
× <i>orthocephalus </i>Wallr. and has been studied extensively in Ontario ([<a href="#22">22</a>] and sources therein).

GENERAL DISTRIBUTION:</a>

<br />


Beck [<a href="#11">11</a>] provides a discussion of the origin, history, and distribution of musk
thistle; the following is a discussion based on that review, except where
otherwise cited.


Musk thistle is native to western and central Europe, northwards to Scotland and
extending to Sicilia, central Yugoslavia, and Ukraine [<a href="#118">118</a>], western
Siberia, Asia Minor, and North Africa [<a href="#22">22</a>]. It has since been introduced to North and
South America, Australia, and New Zealand [<a href="#92">92</a>]. Worldwide
distribution of musk thistle is limited to the temperate zones of the northern and
southern hemispheres, although occasional sightings in the tropics
at high elevation have been reported. The earliest records of musk thistle in
North America are from central
Pennsylvania in 1852, followed by several records of its
occurrence along the east coast in the late 1800s, apparently associated with
ship ballast. Musk thistle began to appear in the Midwest around the turn of the
20th century. By the early 1940s, musk thistle was
regarded as a potential problem in North America. In 1976, Dunn [<a href="#29">29</a>] reported
the presence of musk thistle in at least 1 out of every 10 counties in the U.S.
As of 1999, musk thistle was reported to occur in 45 states in the U.S. and
all of the southern Canadian provinces [<a href="#59">59</a>].

<p>Subspecies of musk thistle described in North America each have a specific
area of distribution as described by Kartesz and Meachum [<a href="#59">59</a>]. See the <a href="http://plants.usda.gov/">Plants</a>
database for distribution maps of musk thistle and described subspecies in the
United States.</p>

<p>The following biogeographic classification systems
are presented as a guide to demonstrate where musk thistle might be found or is likely to be invasive, based on reported occurrence and biological tolerance to factors that are
likely to limit its distribution. Precise distribution information is lacking.
Therefore, these lists are speculative and not exhaustive.</p>

Rees and others [<a href="#97">97</a>] suggest that musk thistle can be found on all types of land except deserts, dense forests,
high mountains, coastal areas, and newly cultivated fields. Musk thistle is most
often described as occurring on disturbed sites and waste areas, and along
roads. Associated plant communities are not often mentioned in the
literature.<p>In the western United States, musk thistle may be found spreading into sagebrush
(<i>Artemisia</i> spp.) and pinyon-juniper (<i>Pinus</i>-<i>Juniperus</i>) communities
[<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>], and has been observed in the fir-spruce (<i>Abies</i>-<i>Picea</i>)
zone in
Wyoming [<a href="#55">55</a>]. Desrochers and others [<a href="#22">22</a>] list grasses and forbs that are
commonly found with musk thistle in Canada.

Musk thistle in an invasive biennial, and sometimes summer or winter annual forb. Musk
thistle populations in North America exhibit almost continuous variation in
characteristics such as hairiness, leaf
size, spine length, flower stalk diameter, width and shape of bracts, and
corolla length [<a href="#118">118</a>]. Correct identification of musk thistle is
important if control strategies are planned since it can be easily confused with native
thistles: some of which may be threatened or endangered, and the vast majority of
which fill specific ecological niches and have traits useful to humans [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>]. The following description provides characteristics
of musk thistle that may be relevant to fire ecology,
and is not meant to be used for identification. Keys for identifying musk
thistle
are available (e.g. [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>]). An online publication provided by Oklahoma
Cooperative Extension Service (<a href="http://agweb.okstate.edu/pearl/plantsoil/weeds/">OSU-Extension</a>)
provides photos
and detailed descriptions of both invasive and native thistles in Oklahoma.
Check with the Native Plant Society in your state for more information.<p>As a biennial,
musk thistle initially forms a prostrate rosette. Rosette leaves can grow up to 10
inches (25 cm) long and 4 inches (10 cm) wide, and rosettes can be
2 feet (0.6 m) or more in diameter.
Musk thistle rosettes have numerous small roots in the
fall, and develop a large, fleshy taproot in the spring [<a href="#97">97</a>] that is hollow near the soil surface.
The root crown and upper
root tissues contain buds, normally suppressed by apical dominance, which may sprout following damage to
plants [<a href="#92">92</a>]. Harris and Clapperton [<a href="#48">48</a>] report infection of musk thistle
roots by vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae.</p>
<p> Musk thistle
may have 1 to 7 branched stems that grow 2 to 6 feet (0.6-1.8 m) tall. Stem leaves are 3 to 6 inches (7.6-15.2 cm)
long and spiny. Stems have spiny wings their full lengths except
for a few inches below flowerheads. Flowerheads are
large (1.5 to 3 inches (3.8-7.6 cm) in diameter), solitary, and terminal on
shoots. Flowers are
subtended by numerous large, lance-shaped, spine-tipped bracts that resemble a
pinecone. The fruit is an achene bearing 0.13- to 0.19-inch (0.3-0.5 cm) seeds with a
hair-like pappus [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>].</p>
<p>Musk thistle is capable of forming dense stands, especially on highly
disturbed sites where competition is low, or in overgrazed or disturbed
pastureland. Population size may fluctuate in response to climatic conditions
[<a href="#22">22</a>]. Musk thistle patches are usually denser than patches of other biennial thistles, but less
dense than those of perennial thistles [<a href="#72">72</a>].</p>
<p>Researchers have found some evidence of allelopathy in musk thistle (e.g.
[<a href="#125">125</a>]). Aqueous extracts, leachates, and ground plant material from musk thistle
all showed some inhibition of germination and radicle growth rate of several
pasture species. Additionally, growth of musk thistle seedlings appears to be stimulated
by adding musk thistle tissue to the soil. Musk thistle may thus stimulate recruitment of its own
kind as it invades [<a href="#125">125</a>].</p>

Musk thistle is typically a biennial, but it may complete its life cycle as an annual [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>].
Populations may have plants of mixed ages and of differing life cycles [<a href="#92">92</a>].</p>

<p>

<font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Breeding system:</b></font>   Musk thistle florets mature
progressively from the periphery of the capitula inward. Each floret bears male and female organs and fertilization is
primarily by outcrossing [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>]. Reports of outcrossing
rates vary [<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>]. Musk thistle can also produce a large number of seeds
through self-pollination. Therefore, an isolated plant has the
potential to expand into a large infestation [<a href="#11">11</a>].

</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Pollination:</b></font>  The sticky nature of musk thistle pollen prevents wind dispersal.
Nectar secreted in the corolla tube is harvested by a wide range of short- and
long-tongued insects that effect pollination, but these relationships have not been studied
in great detail [<a href="#92">92</a>]. Due to asynchronous
development of florets, autogamous, geitonogamous, and xenogamous pollination
(see the FEIS <a href="../../../glossary.html">Glossary</a>) is
effected mostly by insects [<a href="#92">92</a>] including bees, bumblebees, and various Lepidoptera [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Seed production:</b></font> Seed production is quite variable. It is determined by habitat
conditions, size of plant at
flowering, and duration of flowering. Hull and Evans [<a href="#92">92</a>] observed musk thistle
plants growing in a stand of native vegetation in southeastern Idaho. They varied from 8
to 40 inches (20-100 cm) tall with 1 to 40 or more seedheads. A single musk thistle growing
nearby with little plant competition was 6 feet (1.8 m) tall with 643 seedheads [<a href="#55">55</a>]. The life cycle exhibited by a particular musk thistle plant also influences
seed production, with biennials producing more than winter annuals, and winter
annuals producing more than summer annuals [<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>]. It is best to assume that even
individual and sparsely separated plants can potentially add thousands of seeds to
the soil seed bank [<a href="#106">106</a>].</p>

<p>The first flowerheads to emerge (terminal and topmost branch) are usually
solitary, and are the
largest and produce the most seeds [<a href="#78">78</a>]. The number of seeds per inflorescence decreases
over time along with
inflorescence size [<a href="#57">57</a>]. Musk thistle can continue to produce
flowers and seeds throughout the growing season if soil moisture levels are adequate. The amount of
seed produced is therefore markedly affected by spring and summer rainfall
patterns [<a href="#106">106</a>]. Lower branches
often develop secondary and sometimes tertiary flowerheads. Terminal flowers
average about 1,000 seeds per head, while the last ones to bloom produce about 125 seeds or fewer per head [<a href="#78">78</a>]. A review by Desrochers
and others [<a href="#22">22</a>] reports an average of 165 to 256 seeds per flowerhead and 10,000 to 11,000 achenes per
individual musk thistle plant. Hull and Evans [<a href="#55">55</a>] report that 10 large, terminal
seedheads from musk thistle plants in southern Idaho, northern Utah, and western Wyoming had an average
of 535 seeds, and 10 smaller flowerheads, midway up the stem, averaged 298
seeds. Seeds
collected from these plants in September averaged 81% germination when
placed in moist sand in the greenhouse [<a href="#55">55</a>]. Stuckey and Forsythe [<a href="#113">113</a>]
report that many seedheads do not have fully developed achenes at the time of
dispersal.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Seed dispersal:</b></font>  Wind, water, wildlife, livestock, and human activities
disperse musk thistle seed. Musk thistle seeds are attached to a pappus, but less than 5% of seed remains attached to
the pappus when it breaks
off the flowerhead and floats away on wind currents [<a href="#9">9</a>]. Under controlled, windy conditions
(up to 18.5 feet per second (5.6 m/s)),
fewer than 1% of musk thistle seeds moved more than 330 feet (100 m), and most
seeds were deposited within 160 feet (50 m) of the point of release [<a href="#107">107</a>].
Many musk thistle seeds
fail to separate from the receptacle, so fruiting heads with seeds
often fall to the ground. Thus, the majority of seeds are
deposited in a dense pattern near the parent plant [<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>]. This may help to explain musk thistle's slow
rate of spread into favorable habitats close to existing populations [<a href="#92">92</a>]. Similarly, in seedheads that
are attacked by the thistlehead weevil, <i>Rhinocyllus conicus</i>, <i> </i>many seeds become tightly fixed in the seedhead.
These
may still germinate, although competition among germinating seeds will cause
high rates of intraspecific mortality [<a href="#107">107</a>].</p> 

<p>Musk thistle seed dispersal over long distances is most
common along travel and water corridors, and as a contaminant in crop seed and
hay. Musk thistle seeds may also be distributed by birds and mammals [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>]. Upon contact with moisture, the seedcoat of mature musk
thistle seeds thickens and releases sticky mucilage, thus allowing adhesion to moving
objects [<a href="#57">57</a>]. Reviews by Desrochers and others [<a href="#22">22</a>] and by Popay and Medd [<a href="#92">92</a>] suggest that
cattle
and domestic sheep and goats may facilitate seed dispersal by eating seedheads,
though more information is needed regarding the proportion of viable seed voided in
livestock excreta. Musk thistle seeds also have
elaiosomes (fleshy appendages) that promote seed dispersal by ants [<a href="#91">91</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed banking:</b></font>  Scientific information on
seed banking in musk thistle under field conditions is lacking, although it is
suggested that musk thistle seeds may remain viable in the soil for 10 to 15
years or more [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>]. Popay and Medd [<a href="#92">92</a>] indicate that depth of burial influences musk
thistle seed longevity, with seeds buried
in the top 2 cm of soil surviving 3 years, and seed buried at greater depths
maintaining viability for longer periods. Examples of musk thistle invasion
following disturbances such as fire [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>], insect kill [<a href="#75">75</a>], or other
vegetation removal [<a href="#19">19</a>] suggest that musk thistle seeds may be present and
viable in soil if there is a history of musk thistle plants on site, or if a musk thistle
population is nearby.</p> 

<p> Popay and Medd [<a href="#92">92</a>] report densities of up to 477 musk thistle seeds per square foot
(5,300/m<sup>2</sup>)
in the top 2 inches (4-5 cm) of soil. Observations suggest that substantial
losses may occur prior to recruitment. However, factors influencing the fate of seeds and the
conditions of these high losses are incompletely understood [<a href="#92">92</a>].
Greenfield and others [<a href="#43">43</a>] suggested that losses of seeds (including musk thistle
seeds)
due to soil microbial action may be comparable to those caused by predation and environmental extremes.</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Germination:</b></font>    McCarty [<a href="#78">78</a>] measured the
weight and germinability of musk thistle seeds at 4 stages of seedhead maturity.
At full
maturity (just prior to seed dispersal), seeds were divided by weight into
&quot;quality&quot; classes. About 32% of musk thistle seeds rated
&quot;good&quot; quality (95% viability), 11% were rated
&quot;fair&quot; quality (37% viability), and the remaining 57% were considered
&quot;poor&quot;
quality seeds (2% viability). Terminal heads produced the most viable seeds, with successive
flowering producing progressively fewer good quality seeds. McCarty [<a href="#78">78</a>]
estimated that a musk thistle plant producing about 11,000 seeds could
potentially produce about 3,870 seedlings. Jessep [<a href="#57">57</a>] made a similar observation
in a New Zealand musk thistle population.</p> 

<p>Germination of musk thistle seeds in the field occurs over several months in the fall and
spring [<a href="#69">69</a>]. A review
by Desrochers and others [<a href="#22">22</a>] indicates that some researchers report no
dormancy period for musk thistle seeds, and that germination of musk thistle seeds in the
field usually occurs within 14 to 21 days of shedding. Several other studies indicate that musk thistle seeds may have a period of innate
dormancy [<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>]. A dormancy period could
prevent seeds from germinating all at once in response to
transient summer rainfall, and allow time for some seed to become buried [<a href="#92">92</a>]. In a greenhouse
study optimum levels of
germination, survival, and growth occurred in treatments that provided
microhabitats with reduced evaporation (a light covering of litter and/or
cracked and irregular surface topography) [<a href="#46">46</a>]. Inadequate soil moisture
can hinder musk thistle germination and stand establishment [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>], although some musk thistle
seeds
may germinate and establish under dry soil conditions [<a href="#11">11</a>].</p> 

<p>In the laboratory, germination of musk thistle seed is initiated under moist conditions, between temperatures of
59 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (15-30 °C),
and is strongly enhanced by white or red light [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>]. This suggests that more seeds germinate
and establish on bare soils in open pastures and other
poorly vegetated sites [<a href="#9">9</a>], where there is abundant red light. Exposure to
darkness or far-red light inhibited germination of musk thistle seeds, suggesting an induced
dormancy. This dormancy may be
broken when the light regime changes or possibly by other factors such as
increased soil nitrate levels or seedcoat damage [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seedling establishment/growth:</b></font>

 Most musk thistle seedlings emerge in the fall, although
seedlings can also emerge in large numbers in the spring [<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>]. Development from seedling
to rosette occurs rapidly [<a href="#22">22</a>]. Most plants die before
flowering, and the percentage of seedlings that survive to flowering can
range from 0 to 46% [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>]. Because most seed is disseminated within the immediate vicinity of
the parent plant, seedling density tends to be high, resulting in
intraspecific competition and mortality [<a href="#9">9</a>]. The greatest mortality
occurs in late spring and
summer [<a href="#69">69</a>], and whole cohorts of biennial thistles could conceivably die during very hot, dry
summers [<a href="#106">106</a>]. Survivorship, flowering, and seed
production in musk thistle are associated with site conditions, competition,
time of emergence, and rosette size.

</p>

<p> Successful establishment of musk thistle may be rare in dense pastures due to thick
litter and low light levels at the surface [<a href="#46">46</a>]. Established stands
of musk thistle are thought to be self-perpetuating for several reasons. At high stand densities, the seedbed is
devoid of competing vegetation. Additionally, dead flowering stalks of musk
thistle can trap
winter snow and thus provide additional moisture for spring seed germination
[<a href="#22">22</a>]. One study also suggests that musk thistle litter may encourage
germination of musk thistle seeds [<a href="#125">125</a>]. Early autumn germination
favors high survivorship and early flowering of musk thistle, with larger, more productive individuals than those
germinating late in the fall or spring [<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>]. McCarty and Scifres [<a href="#77">77</a>] observed that musk thistle plants growing
with competition suffered more mortality than those with no competition and
that seedlings emerging in spring had higher survival rates than those emerging in late summer and fall.
Musk thistle plants with larger
rosettes are also more
likely to survive and flower and produce more seed [<a href="#69">69</a>].

Musk thistle may germinate and
grow under a wide range of environmental conditions, infesting
arid areas in Nevada and relatively high moisture areas of Virginia and the east
coast. In the Intermountain region of western North America, musk thistle occupies habitats ranging from
saline soils in low altitude valleys to acidic soils at 8,000 feet (2,400 m) [<a href="#11">11</a>]. In Canada, musk thistle infestations can be found in soils
with pH ranging from 6 to 9, which represents most of the soils in the southern
part of that country (Holm and others 1997, as cited by [<a href="#11">11</a>]). Distribution of musk thistle
is restricted mainly by extremes in soil water content, nutrient deficient or acid soils,
and competition from other plant species (Doing and others 1969, as cited by [<a href="#22">22</a>]).<p>Musk thistle is frequently found on grasslands in
many parts of North America [<a href="#22">22</a>] and is more common in the northern portion of the temperate
grassland region than the southern portion [<a href="#41">41</a>]. Musk thistle may produce viable seeds with as little as
10 inches (250 mm) of annual
rainfall, but seems to prefer moist, alluvial soils [<a href="#55">55</a>] and
abundant spring moisture. In Canadian prairies, musk thistle is common in
areas covered by snowdrifts in winter such as gullies, fence lines, brush patches, and the lee side of stone
piles (Holm and others 1997, as cited by [<a href="#11">11</a>]). In Ohio, musk
thistle is commonly found on high, dry ridges and hillsides where the
limestone or dolomite bedrock is less than 6 feet (1.8 m) below the surface [<a href="#113">113</a>]. Similarly, serious infestations of musk thistle in the
northeastern U.S. are associated with fertile soils formed over
limestone (Batra 1978, as cited by [<a href="#22">22</a>]). Abundant soil nitrogen may favor musk thistle
[<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>]. A review of the habitat requirements of musk thistle in Australia and New
Zealand is provided by Popay and Medd [<a href="#92">92</a>].</p>

Musk thistle is an early successional species that establishes well on open,
disturbed sites. Musk
thistle was part of the earliest postfire successional stage in
pinyon-juniper communities in Colorado [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>]. On a
pinyon-juniper site in central Utah that was chained to remove
trees and seeded with a grass/forb/shrub mix, musk thistle density increased
dramatically over the 3 years following treatment [<a href="#19">19</a>].
Similarly, musk thistle
production increased on a site in north-central Colorado following death of the
ponderosa pine overstory due to mountain pine beetle attack [<a href="#75">75</a>]. Another example can be
seen at Mesa Verde National Park, where
fungal and insect pathogens have killed
thousands of Colorado pinyons (<i>Pinus edulis</i>), leaving patches in the
woodland that have been invaded
by nonnative plants. The largest invasion of musk thistle coincides with patches
where black stain root disease has killed the Colorado pinyon overstory [<a href="#35">35</a>].

</p>
<p> Established stands
of musk thistle may be self-perpetuating [<a href="#22">22</a>]. However, increases in
interspecific competition can cause musk thistle populations to decline. In Nebraska pastures,
competition with Kentucky bluegrass (<i>Poa pratensis</i>) reduced musk thistle plant size and flower number and increased mortality [<a href="#77">77</a>]. In Australia, musk thistle is more
productive in communities where levels of inter- and intraspecific competition
are low [<a href="#6">6</a>]. Musk thistle
seedlings may be sensitive to competition with neighboring plants for light. When musk thistle seedlings received 2, 8, or 14% of full sunlight, growth was reduced by
97, 68, and 35%, respectively [<a href="#81">81</a>].

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT">
SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:</a>
</span>
<br />

The phenology of musk thistle is complicated by the variability of its life
history; usually behaving as a biennial, and sometimes as a summer or winter
annual.

</p>
<p> 


Germination of musk thistle seed
occurs in the spring and fall beginning approximately 14 to 21 days after
dispersal [<a href="#69">69</a>]. Musk thistle overwinters as either seeds or rosettes. Musk thistle plants spend
approximately 90% of their life cycle as rosettes, then bolt, flower, produce
seed, and die [<a href="#11">11</a>]. The major environmental factors controlling
development of musk thistle are temperature and day length, which may be modified by the duration of vernalizing
(low) temperatures and/or musk thistle rosette size [<a href="#106">106</a>]. The variability in flowering behavior may
also be due to
genetic variability [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>].

</p>
<p>While
Jessep [<a href="#57">57</a>] observed no vernalization requirement in musk thistle in New Zealand,
it is generally believed that musk thistle requires vernalization for floral
initiation. Desrochers and others [<a href="#22">22</a>] cite Haderlie and McCarty (1980) in
reporting a
minimum vernalization requirement for musk thistle of at least 40 days below 50
degrees Fahrenheit (10 °C). The length of the
required vernalization period varies with the size of musk thistle plant, with smaller
plants requiring a longer vernalization period [<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. Rosette size at the onset of vernalization influences whether the
plants flower during their 1st or 2nd summer [<a href="#30">30</a>]. Musk thistle plants that grow rapidly in
winter and spring are more likely to behave as annuals and flower during the 1st
summer. By contrast, under competition, drought, or low fertility during the seedling
stage, growth is
reduced and the time necessary to initiate flowering increases, leading to more
biennials [<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>]. The usual growth cycle of a biennial is to remain
as a rosette through 2 winters, after which stem elongation and flowering begin in the spring of the 2nd year [<a href="#106">106</a>].

</p>
<p>Flowering in musk thistle begins with the terminal bud and proceeds downward toward the base of
the plant [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>]. Time of flowering is variable, beginning in
spring and continuing for several weeks, with the number of inflorescences per plant
increasing each week [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>].

<p>Musk thistle flowers and seeds
are produced over a long period, with seed maturation and dispersal occurring from 7 days to 2 months after
1st bloom

frost [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>]. It is common to observe musk thistle with heads in
several stages of floral development and senescence [<a href="#9">9</a>]. The number of
viable seeds in a flowerhead increases as flowers mature as reported by McCarty
[<a href="#78">78</a>]:</p>

Plants that bloom late in the season (just prior to frost), tend to have higher
rates of survival, as most seed-feeding insects complete their life cycle before the last
flowers set seed [<a href="#72">72</a>]. Musk thistle plants die soon after setting seed [<a href="#9">9</a>].

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font>  Musk thistle can produce
abundant seed and establish well in high light environments. Fire creates conditions that are
favorable to the establishment of musk thistle (i.e. open canopy, reduced competition, areas of bare soil), so if
musk thistle seeds are present and competition minimal, musk thistle may be favored in
the postfire community.<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font>  Musk thistle
commonly occurs
in tallgrass prairie ecosystems where fire can stimulate flowering of warm-season
grasses and increase stem density. In Kansas,
frequent burning of tallgrass prairie is said to be effective in keeping out exotic
plants such as musk thistle, especially on sites where prairie grasses are vigorous [<a href="#54">54</a>]. Effects of musk thistle on native fire regimes in temperate grasslands are unknown and research is needed in this area
[<a href="#41">41</a>].  Musk
thistle also occurs in pinyon-juniper communities where fire return intervals may range from 10
to 70 years or more [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>]. These ecosystems tend to be heavily influenced by
introduced species. Following fire, cheatgrass (<i>Bromus tectorum</i>)
and other invasives
such as musk thistle tend to establish and dominate in place of native
grasses and forbs [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].
Musk thistle has established since fire exclusion began, and it is
unclear how the presence of musk thistle might affect fire regimes in these
communities.

<p>The following table provides fire regime intervals for some of the
communities in which musk thistle may be found.</p>

Musk thistle may or may not be killed by fire. A review by Heidel [<a href="#50">50</a>] (<a href="http://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/esadocs.html">musk thistle ESA</a>)
suggests that high-severity fire may kill musk thistle plants by destroying the
root crown, although there is no direct evidence of this. He does, however, cite
evidence of musk thistle plants bolting and blooming after the rosettes were
scarred by a late spring fire in Nebraska, which concurs with a review by Smith
[<a href="#108">108</a>]. Popay and Medd [<a href="#92">92</a>] suggest that combustion would only readily take
place on mature musk thistle plants from which most seed would have already dispersed.
<p> It is unclear what effects fire has on musk thistle seeds
in the soil, although incidents of rapid colonization after fire suggest that
musk thistle seeds may have been present in the soil at the time of the fire and
survived to germinate after the overstory was removed [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].

Musk thistle colonization may be either enhanced [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>] or depressed [<a href="#54">54</a>] by
fire. The response of musk thistle likely depends
on fire severity, ecosystem type, prefire abundance and location of musk
thistle plants and seeds, and plant competition [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE">DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE:</a>

<br />

Response of musk thistle to fire appears to be primarily related to the
abundance of competitors and their response to fire. Hulbert's
summary [<a href="#54">54</a>] of fire effects on tallgrass prairie indicates that musk thistle can be
eliminated with or without fire on ungrazed prairie, although spring burning
was recommended to promote the vigor of native warm-season grasses [<a href="#41">41</a>]. Similarly, observations in tallgrass prairie sites in South Dakota indicate
that late spring prescribed burning (when native species are still dormant) on a
4- to 5-year rotation (as per the historic fire regime) encourages the growth of
native plants and discourages the growth of Canada, bull, and musk thistles [<a href="#18">18</a>].
Additionally, Hulbert [<a href="#54">54</a>] suggests that late spring burning in these ecosystems results in fewer forbs
but greater grass production than fall or early spring burning.

<p>Following the Long Mesa fire in Mesa Verde National Park,
response of musk thistle differed between the 2 plant communities that burned.
In pinyon-juniper woodlands where the overstory was killed and mineral soils were exposed,
invasive species including musk thistle dominated the postfire community.
Where shrubs dominated the prefire community (in the northern section of the
fire), sprouts from native perennials
repopulated the area within the 1st postfire year [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>]. A pinyon-juniper site in Utah was burned in 1976, after which cheatgrass and other weeds (including musk thistle) established [<a href="#38">38</a>]. The area was then prescribe burned and
aerially seeded with crested wheatgrass (<i>Agropyron cristatum</i>) and other introduced perennial
species
in 1990. Parts of the burn were missed in the seeding treatment, allowing for
comparison of seeded and non-seeded areas. Frequency of musk thistle occurrence was lower in areas that were seeded following fire (756
plants per acre (1,871/ha)) than in areas that were not
seeded (7,849 plants/acre (19,424/ha)) [<a href="#39">39</a>].</p>

<p>More
research is needed on long-term secondary effects of fire on musk thistle. See &quot;Postfire
colonization potential&quot; below for more details.</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

<b><font face="Bell MT">Fire as a control agent:</font></b>  
Although
several reviews suggest that fire cannot control musk thistle [<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>], using prescribed fire to
control musk thistle may have some indirect positive effects. Examples from tallgrass
prairie sites in Kansas and South Dakota suggest that fire can encourage the
growth of native plants and discourage the growth of musk and other thistles [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].
Livestock use must be carefully timed following burning, since grazing early in
the growing season can potentially negate beneficial effects of prescribed fire
[<a href="#18">18</a>].

<p> Fick and Peterson [<a href="#121">121</a>] suggest that prescribed burning can also make
chemical control methods more effective. More information is needed regarding the role of fire in musk thistle management.
</p>



<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Postfire colonization potential: </font></b>
There is evidence that musk thistle can colonize recently burned prairie sites where grasses are
not vigorous [<a href="#54">54</a>], and pinyon-juniper sites where there is essentially no native
seed bank and a musk thistle seed source is on-site or nearby [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>]. Plant competition and dry conditions may limit musk
thistle establishment after fire on some sites. On the Konza Prairie in Kansas, burning favored establishment of musk thistle
in areas where grazing had reduced the vigor of prairie grasses. However, on
sites where grasses were vigorous, musk thistle was crowded out whether the site
was burned or unburned [<a href="#54">54</a>]. Similarly, plant competition limited or
prevented musk thistle invasion on sites in Colorado and Utah where native perennials
resprouted [<a href="#34">34</a>], and where the burn was seeded with a mixture of grasses and
forbs. The seed mix included several aggressive, introduced grasses such as
crested wheatgrass (<i>Agropyron cristatum</i>), intermediate wheatgrass (<i>Thinopyrum</i>
<i>intermedium</i>), orchardgrass (<i>Dactylis glomerata</i>), and smooth brome
(<i>Bromus inermis</i>) [<a href="#39">39</a>].
</p>

<p>General precautions should be followed
to prevent musk thistle establishment after fire. The USDA Forest Service's &quot;Guide to
noxious weed prevention practices&quot; [<a href="#119">119</a>]
provides several fire management considerations for weed prevention
that can be applied to musk thistle. Wildfire managers might consider the
following: include
weed prevention education and providing weed identification aids during fire
training; avoiding known weed infestations when locating firelines, monitoring
camps, staging areas, and helibases, to be sure they are kept weed free; take care that equipment is weed free; incorporating cost of weed prevention
and management into fire
rehabilitation plans; and acquire restoration funding [<a href="#119">119</a>]. Careful postfire vigilance
to identify and record the establishment of invasive plant populations is critical. About 1 month after
fire, survey for signs of new or resprouting weeds. Repeated surveys will be
needed, with the frequency and intensity guided by local conditions [<a href="#5">5</a>].</p>

<p>Potential weed
problems must be addressed during prefire planning of prescribed burns, and following both
wildland and prescribed fires. When planning a prescribed burn, preinventory the project area and evaluate
cover and phenology of any musk thistle present on or adjacent to the site
and evaluate the
potential for increased musk thistle populations in the area [<a href="#5">5</a>]. Avoid ignition and burning in areas at high risk for
musk thistle establishment or spread, and/or plan for follow-up treatments in succeeding
years. Avoid creating soil conditions that promote weed
germination and establishment. Discuss weed status and risks in burn
rehabilitation plans [<a href="#119">119</a>].</p>

To prevent infestations, re-establish vegetation on bare ground as soon after
fire as possible, using either natural recovery or artificial techniques as
appropriate to site conditions and objectives. When reseeding after wildfires
and prescribed burns, use only certified weed-free seed [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>]. In some
cases, it may not be practical to reseed with native species [<a href="#39">39</a>]. Monitor the burn site
and associated disturbed areas after the fire and the following spring for
emergence of musk thistle, and treat to eradicate any emergent musk thistle plants. Regulate human, pack animal, and
other livestock entry into burned
areas at risk for weed invasion until desirable vegetation has recovered
sufficiently to resist weed invasion. Additional guidelines and specific
recommendations and requirements are available [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>].

Livestock rarely eat musk thistle foliage; however, cattle and domestic
sheep and
goats have been observed consuming flowers and seedheads. It is unclear whether
this results in musk thistle seed dispersal. A number of
species of birds also graze on mature musk thistle seed in Australia [<a href="#92">92</a>].
Dense infestations of the plant discourage animals from occupying that portion
of the field in which it grows [<a href="#97">97</a>].

The thistles have long been associated with humans, and have been used as both
food and medicine [<a href="#86">86</a>]. &quot;However, they are also
notoriously associated with unkempt agricultural land. While this may be true of
invasive thistles that are not native to North America, the vast majority of
native thistles fill specific ecological niches and have traits useful to humans&quot;
[<a href="#11">11</a>]. Bare [<a href="#8">8</a>] states that dried
musk thistle flowers have been used as rennet to curdle milk, and that the pith
of the stem is edible when boiled.

<br><br>

<span class="subframeName"><a name="IMPACTS AND CONTROL">IMPACTS AND CONTROL:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Impacts:</b></font>   
Musk thistle is a problem on range
and pastures because it competes with desirable forage, and its sharp spines can
limit recreation, hinder movement, and deter livestock, and presumably wildlife, from grazing
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>]. Even at low densities of musk thistle,
losses in production of native and/or forage species can occur because rosettes
of musk thistle can grow greater than 3 feet (1 m) in diameter [<a href="#106">106</a>]. A review by Rees and others
[<a href="#97">97</a>] suggests that 1 musk thistle plant per 16 square
feet (1.5 m<sup>2</sup>) can reduce forage production by 23%. Musk thistle
may also threaten rare or sensitive species, such as the
Mescalero thistle (<i>Cirsium vinaceum</i>) in New Mexico, by crowding into populations
[<a href="#110">110</a>].
Musk thistle spreads most rapidly along roadsides, fence lines, and sparsely
vegetated areas. Though plants are hardier where there is little competition,
musk thistle can also grow in native and seeded ranges, irrigated pastures,
and wet meadows with dense stands of graminoids [<a href="#55">55</a>].

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Control:</b></font>   Musk thistle should be
accurately identified before attempting any control measures, since several
native species of thistles have a similar appearance. See the &quot;General
Botanical Characteristics&quot; section of this review for information on proper
identification.
</p>

<p>The key to successful management
of musk thistle is to prevent seed production. Control data suggest that the threshold for viable seed production by
biennial thistles is zero to achieve long-term population decreases, although
zero seed production may not be a realistic goal. The transition from seedling to rosette
may be the most precarious stage in the life cycle of musk
thistle. Seedling and
rosette growth stages are the most logical to target for control efforts in biennial thistles [<a href="#11">11</a>].
</p>

<p> Combining control methods into an
integrated management system will result in the best long-term population
decreases. Desirable plant competition is important in any biennial thistle management strategy to deter
establishment of thistle seedlings and the transition to the rosette growth
stage. Recovery of infested areas should not be considered complete
until a diverse population of desirable plants has replaced invasive
biennial thistles and the thistles are a minor to nonexistent component to the plant
community [<a href="#11">11</a>]. The requirement of light for
musk thistle seed germination highlights the importance of maintaining dense
pasture canopies in order to suppress thistle germination [<a href="#106">106</a>]. Beck [<a href="#11">11</a>]
suggests that land managers control musk thistle diligently for 15 years or more to
eradicate it, because of the long-lived seed bank. He also encourages monitoring and
evaluating weed management programs to determine
whether and when to repeat and/or modify control treatments.
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Prevention: </font> 
Prevention is the most
effective method for managing invasive species, including musk thistle [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>]. The best way to prevent or reduce
musk thistle invasion is to deny it a suitable habitat. Maintaining a healthy stand of desirable vegetation will prevent or slow
musk thistle
invasion, since seedlings are intolerant of intense
competition, especially for light [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>]. Pastures
that are growing rapidly, especially at the time of peak musk thistle recruitment in the
fall, can suppress musk thistle germination [<a href="#93">93</a>], enhance competition upon
seedings, prolong the rosette stage of thistle development [<a href="#30">30</a>], and ultimately reduce
musk thistle population density and seed
production [<a href="#92">92</a>]. Careful grazing management will help keep pastures and
rangeland healthy by enhancing grass competition and deterring thistle survival from seedlings to rosettes
[<a href="#11">11</a>]. Overgrazing by livestock and
wildlife should be avoided, because survival of musk thistle rosettes is said to increase as grazing intensity increases [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>], and bare spots 
caused by over-grazing are
prime sites for musk thistle germination and establishment [<a href="#11">11</a>]. 
</p>

<p>Preventing or dramatically reducing seed production and dispersal
decreases the spread of musk thistle. It is important to clean mowers, vehicles,
and other equipment after
operating in an infested area. When seeding is necessary, use clean, certified
weed-free seed and mulch to ensure that thistles and/or other weeds are not being
sown [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Remove single plants and control
small infestations so they do not expand, as
they will furnish
adjacent areas with abundant seed for infestation [<a href="#55">55</a>]. Control
measures must be followed-up to prevent reinfestation, and
monitoring programs developed to locate any new infestations [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
Integrated management:</font>   
The goal of any management plan should be to
not only control
invasive plants, but to also improve the affected community, maximizing forage quality and quantity
and/or preserving ecosystem integrity, and preventing
reinvasion or invasion by other invasive species, in a way that is
complementary to the ecology and economics of the site [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>]. Effective long-term control requires
that invasive plants be removed and replaced
by more desirable and weed-resistant plant communities [<a href="#56">56</a>]. Once the desired plant
community has been determined, an integrated weed management strategy can be
developed to direct succession toward that plant community by identifying key
mechanisms and processes directing plant community dynamics (site availability,
species availability, and species performance) and predicting plant community
response to control measures [<a href="#103">103</a>]. This requires a long-term
integrated management plan [<a href="#11">11</a>].
</p>

<p>
Most often, a single control method is not enough to sufficiently control an invasive
plant, but there are
many possible combinations of methods that can achieve the desired objectives. Methods selected for removal or control of
musk thistle on a specific site will be
determined by land use objectives, desired plant community, extent
and nature of the infestation(s), environmental factors (nontarget vegetation,
soil types, climatic conditions, important water resources), economics, and
effectiveness and limitations of available control techniques [<a href="#98">98</a>].
</p>

<p>Herbicide applications in spring followed by dormant
seeding of competitive perennial grasses in the fall is an example of an
effective management system for biennial thistles in the western United States. Similarly, integrating herbicides and biological control agents is likely to be more
effective than using biological control insects alone [<a href="#11">11</a>] (see &quot;Biological control&quot; below, for
more information). For information
on integrated weed management without herbicides, see the <a href="http://www.keyed.com/birc/index.html">BIRC</a>
 website.
</p>

<p>Some examples of combined approaches and considerations are presented within
the following sections. Managers are encouraged to use combinations of
control techniques in a manner that is appropriate to the site objectives,
desired plant community, available resources, and timing of application.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
Physical/mechanical: </font>Any mechanical or physical method that severs
the root below the soil surface will kill musk thistle. However, it is essential to
revegetate the site with desirable plants, particularly competitive grasses, to
compete with biennial thistles that may reinvade from seeds left in
the soil. Mechanical methods are not always practical on rangeland and
natural areas, but can be effective in improved pastures and roadsides. Tillage,
hoeing, and hand pulling may provide effective control of musk thistle, providing these
operations are done before the reproductive growth stage to prevent seed
production [<a href="#11">11</a>].
</p>

<p> Hand pulling is a common and effective practice for musk thistle infestations of low
density or as a follow-up operation after broad-scale treatment of dense or
large infestations. Plants must be severed 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm)
below the surface to prevent resprouting [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>]. This may be done with a sharpened shovel or other implement. Plants
may be less likely to regrow if allowed to bolt
before severing the root crown [<a href="#108">108</a>]. Any musk thistle flowerheads
must be removed and burned or otherwise destroyed to eliminate seeding [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>], since florets
are sometimes capable of maturing and producing viable seed on severed plants [<a href="#92">92</a>].
Hand chopping at ground level just
before flowering eliminated musk thistle from a 350-acre pasture on the Konza
Prairie [<a href="#108">108</a>]. Hand pulling of musk thistle
reduced the density of infestations following fires in Mesa Verde
National Park [<a href="#34">34</a>].
</p>

<p> Mowing or slashing can improve the appearance
of thistle-infested pastures [<a href="#92">92</a>] and affectively reduce the population size,
but proper timing
is critical. Plants cut before the appearance of the terminal flower bud are likely to
regrow and produce viable seed. Viable seeds can be also be produced from heads severed later than 4 days
after anthesis [<a href="#76">76</a>]. The greatest reduction in seed
production is when musk thistle plants are mowed just before
flowering [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>]. Mowing within 2 days of
the 1st terminal flowerheads in a plant population showing anthesis eliminated the
production of germinable seed from all mowed stalks [<a href="#76">76</a>]. If cut after plants have
flowerheads, they should be burned or otherwise destroyed so the seeds will not
mature [<a href="#55">55</a>]. A single mowing will not control a musk thistle
infestation, because infestations often consist of plants of variable age, and
stands therefore have nonuniform development and flowering [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>]. For this reason it is necessary to mow several times each year to effectively minimize seed
production [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>]. Combining mowing with chemical
control may improve results [<a href="#72">72</a>].
</p>

<p>Musk thistle rarely occurs in croplands suggesting that it is intolerant of repeated cultivation procedures. Evidence suggests that musk thistle seed longevity is
prolonged by burial;
however, shallow tillage may help control musk thistle by promoting more rapid depletion of seed
stocks and killing seedlings [<a href="#92">92</a>]. Tillage is not appropriate in wildlands and
rangelands since it can damage important desirable species, increase erosion,
alter soil structure, and expose the soil for rapid reinfestation by musk thistle
and other invasive species [<a href="#70">70</a>].</p>

<p> <i>Rhinocyllus conicus</i> was introduced from Europe to Montana and Virginia in 1969.
It does not destroy 100% of musk thistle seeds, and decreases in seed
production are highly variable, ranging from 10 to 78%. It can be extremely
effective by itself in those areas where the plant and insect life cycles are
synchronized. A review by DeLoach [<a href="#20">20</a>] indicates 90 to 99% reduction of in musk
thistle stands in Montana and Virginia and 80 to 90% reduction in Missouri. <i>Rhinocyllus conicus</i>
will use <i>Carduus</i>, <i>Cirsium</i>, <i>Silybum</i>, and <i>Onopordum</i>
genera as hosts but prefer the <i>Carduus nutans</i> group [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>]. Several strains of <i> R. conicus</i> have been identified and they vary in their
utilization of various thistle species. At least 1 of these strains does
attack some native <i> Cirsium</i> species [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>], and
reviews by Beck [<a href="#11">11</a>] and Wilson and McCaffrey [<a href="#129">129</a>] indicate that it is known to
attack native and rare thistles. Therefore, before releasing insects in a new
area containing native <i> Cirsium</i> species, investigate whether any of the local
species may be attacked [<a href="#97">97</a>]. A detailed discussion of the biology of
<i> R. conicus</i>
is given by Harris and Shorthouse [<a href="#49">49</a>].
</p>

<p> <i>Trichosirocalus horridus</i>  was introduced to the U.S. in
1974. This weevil uses thistles of the subtribe Carduinae, including musk thistle, plumeless
thistle (<i>Carduus acanthoides</i>), Italian thistle (<i>C. pycnocephalus</i>),
Canada thistle (<i>Cirsium arvense</i>), bull thistle (<i>C. vulgare</i>), and
Scotch thistle (<i>O. acanthium</i>). Reports of
suppression vary from slight to great. <i>Trichosirocalus horridus</i> is more
effective when used in conjunction with <i> R. conicus</i>  [<a href="#97">97</a>]. In areas of Missouri
where <i>R. conicus </i> and <i>T. horridus </i> have been
present for over 15 years, an 80 to 90% reduction in thistle population has
occurred [<a href="#108">108</a>].
</p>

<p>Integrated management systems may be developed utilizing knowledge of thistle
and weevil life cycles, to encourage survival of the weevils over the long-term,
while reducing the size or limiting the spread of bull thistle infestations in
the short term. There is evidence that
both <i>Rhinocyllus conicus</i> [<a href="#116">116</a>] and <i>Trichosirocalus horridus</i>
[<a href="#62">62</a>] are somewhat
tolerant of certain phenoxy herbicides, although more research is suggested. It may be
useful, in the meantime, to create spatial or temporal separation of herbicide
use and biological control. For example, insects can be released in the center of a biennial thistle
infestation, and the borders sprayed to prevent further weed spread. Or,
herbicides can be applied at a time when direct exposure of insects to herbicides will be
minimized, such as when insects are pupating [<a href="#11">11</a>].
</p>



<p>Cattle and domestic sheep and goats sometimes consume musk thistle flower and seedheads,
and it has been suggested that domestic goats can help to minimize the presence of both
bull [<a href="#131">131</a>] and musk [<a href="#92">92</a>] thistles. There is concern regarding
whether cattle and domestic goats may facilitate musk thistle seed dispersal by eating
seedheads. However domestic goats may prefer early flowering stages [<a href="#92">92</a>].
</p>



<p><font face="Bell MT">Chemical:</font>    
Herbicides are effective in gaining initial control of a new
invasion or a severe infestation, but are rarely a complete
or long-term solution to weed management [<a href="#16">16</a>]. Herbicides are more effective on large infestations when incorporated into 
long-term management plans that include
replacement of weeds with desirable species, careful land use management, and
prevention of new infestations.
Control with herbicides is temporary, as it does not change conditions that
allow infestations to occur [<a href="#133">133</a>].
See the <a href="http://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/handbook.html">Weed Control Methods
Handbook</a> for considerations on the use of herbicides in natural areas and
detailed information on specific chemicals. Chemical control of musk thistle is
reviewed by Beck [<a href="#11">11</a>].
</p>

<p>Clopyralid, dicamba, MCPA, picloram, 2,4-D, metsulfuron, and chlorsulfuron
and some combinations thereof will all kill bull and musk thistles. Herbicide
choice and rates are influenced by growth stage, stand density, and
environmental conditions (e.g. drought or cold temperatures) [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Auxin
herbicides are effective only when applied during
periods of active growth of seedlings or rosettes, usually during spring
or fall [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>]. Fall is a good time to control biennial
thistles with herbicides because all live plants will be seedlings or rosettes,
though cold weather may decrease the effectiveness of some chemicals [<a href="#11">11</a>].
Popay and Medd [<a href="#92">92</a>] and Medd and Lovett [<a href="#82">82</a>] suggest that spring
application of herbicides may
be more effective since musk thistle seedlings may still emerge in the spring after fall
treatments. Herbicide tolerance of musk thistle increases after bolting [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>]. Spraying
thistles after they have bolted may reduce, but not eliminate, viable seed
production. Because of the large numbers of seeds produced by musk thistle,
reduction of flowering and seed production is unlikely to lead to an overall reduction in
levels of infestation. Since seeds accumulate in soil, even effective
herbicide treatment may have only a short term effect on musk thistle populations [<a href="#92">92</a>]. Clorsulfuron and metsulfuron are
effective when applied in the bolting and early
bud stages and may, therefore, be compatible with biocontrol agents [<a href="#11">11</a>].
</p>



<p>
Combinations of herbicides and nitrogen fertilizer were
tried in Nebraska, with results suggesting that the added nitrogen favored the
thistle over the perennial grasses [<a href="#96">96</a>]. Similarly, Austin and others [<a href="#6">6</a>]
determined in a greenhouse experiment that yield of musk thistle increased in
response to increasing nutrient concentration.
</p>



<p>Musk thistle was found to be resistant to 2,4-D in New Zealand and may also
be cross-resistant to other synthetic auxin herbicides [<a href="#47">47</a>]. When
herbicides are used for musk thistle control, managers should consider an herbicide rotation to prevent
development of resistance [<a href="#73">73</a>]. See <a href="http://www.weedscience.org/in.asp">weedscience.org</a>
for more information on herbicide resistance.
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Cultural: </font>
No matter what method is used to kill
weeds, reestablishment of competitive, desirable plant cover is imperative for
long-term control. Reseeding with competitive, adapted species is often necessary
in areas without a residual understory of desirable plants [<a href="#98">98</a>].
Vegetative suppression is applicable both before weed establishment and after weed control.
</p>

<p>Bull and musk thistle germination and establishment are favored in open areas and by disturbance [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Vigorously 
growing grass competes with musk thistle, and fewer thistles occur
in pastures where grazing is deferred. However, musk thistle can also become a
problem in pasture or rangeland that is in good condition [<a href="#9">9</a>]. In New
Zealand, pasture species and legume swards inhibited seedling shoot and root
growth of both bull and musk thistles. Rate of musk thistle seedling emergence was also negatively
correlated with
pasture cover density (r=-0.666; p&lt;0.05), presumably as a consequence of alteration of light
quality by the pasture [<a href="#124">124</a>]. On Konza Prairie, musk thistle was
present in heavily grazed spots, and burning favored establishment of musk thistle
seedlings in areas where grazing had reduced vigor of prairie grasses. However,
where the native prairie plants were vigorous, musk thistle was crowded out, whether
burned or not [<a href="#54">54</a>]. A field plot study in Virginia indicated that musk
thistle growth was seriously reduced by competition with tall fescue (<i>Festuca
arundinacea</i>), more than infection by <i> T. horridus</i>, and <i>R. conicus</i>. Musk thistles planted simultaneously
with tall fescue produced flowering plants but with reduced size and
number of seeds per plant. When musk thistle was planted in 1-year-old tall
fescue, germination was low and seeds that did germinate did not reach
reproductive age. Because of its extensive root system and its ability
to effectively compete for nutrients, seeding tall fescue where it is well adapted
may be a
practical method of musk thistle control in pastures, waste areas, and roadsides
[<a href="#63">63</a>]. Tall fescue is not appropriate in drier areas [<a href="#70">70</a>]. Tall fescue is also an
exotic, invasive species and is not, therefore, appropriate for natural areas.
</p>

Re-establishment of desirable vegetation after controlling existing
populations of musk thistle will usually be necessary for
successful control. Choice of species to sow will depend
upon climate, location, and management objectives. The Natural Resource
Conservation Service and land grant
universities are sources of information about appropriate
species for a particular purpose and location [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Reece and Wilson [<a href="#96">96</a>] express the importance of controlling weeds
for more than 1 year to provide grasses with a competitive advantage that will help
grasses recover fully. Following musk thistle population explosion after fire at
Mesa Verde National Park, planting native perennial grasses slowed but did not stop the spread of musk
thistle. Aerial seeding was the most effective treatment for preventing the spread of
musk thistle when compared with hand pulling and biocontrol [<a href="#34">34</a>]. Pasture competition
decreases germination and increases
mortality of musk thistle seedlings, and slows growth of survivors. Encouraging early,
rapid growth of pasture in fall can help reduce numbers of
established musk thistle seedlings [<a href="#30">30</a>]. Management that allows grasses
to grow taller in spring can also shade musk thistle seedlings, thus decreasing
musk thistle establishment and growth
[<a href="#11">11</a>].
