<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Invasion and formation of M. polymorpha mats after fire helps to prevent
soil erosion [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

In southeastern British Columbia, M. polymorpha colonized mineral soil
exposed by skid trails [<a href="#38">38</a>].

Marchantia polymorpha has a high lead tolerance and may be an indicator
of high lead concentrations [<a href="#10">10</a>].  It also tolerates other heavy metals
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Gemmalings grow in lead concentrations to 400 parts per
million (p/m) and zinc concentrations to 100 p/m.  Copper suppresses
growth but chelated copper complexed with ethylene-diaminetetraacetic
acid is tolerated at high levels [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Historically, M. polymorpha was thought to be an antidote for diseases
of the liver and tuberculosis due to the fact that its form and texture
resemble that of an animal liver [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Dichlorophen kills M. polymorpha [<a href="#11">11</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Marchantia polymorpha
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Marchantia polymorpha has a flat, branching form.  The thallus is
generally 0.8 to 4 inches (2-10 cm) long and 0.3 to 0.8 inch (7-20 mm)
broad.  Thalli are dichotomously branched and exhibit apical growth.
Numerous rhizoids attach the gametophyte (thallus) to the soil.  Smooth
rhizoids penetrate the soil, while tuberculate rhizoids run horizontally
along the surface of the plant.  Marchantia polymorpha is dioecious
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].
 


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Marchantia polymorpha has two alternate forms in its life cycle:  a
gametophytic stage and a sporophytic stage.  The gametophyte propagates
itself vegetatively and also produces the gametes which give rise to the
sporophyte [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].

In sexual reproduction, antheridia and archegonia develop on separate
plant bodies and are borne on stalked antheridiophores and
archegoniophores, respectively.  Fertilization takes place prior to
elongation of the stalk, and a sporophyte is formed.  Spores with
hygroscopic elaters (slender threads that twist and coil as they dry and
propel spores into the air) subsequently develop and are released [<a href="#8">8</a>].
As many as 7 million spores may be formed on each plant [<a href="#55">55</a>].

Vegetative reproduction may occur as a result of fragmentation or gemma
cup production.  In fragmentation, new plants are formed when older
plant parts die at the fork of a branch of a thallus.  The two branches
then become separate individuals [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Gametophytes produce propagative
structures called gemma cups.  Each gemma gives rise to numerous gemmae
that are released when the cup fills with water.  Gemmae that are
transported to favorable sites form a pair of young plants [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Marchantia polymorpha grows on a wide variety of sites within its range
including cliffs, closed forests, alpine heathlands, peat bogs,
minerotropic fens, springs, swamps, grasslands, and tundra [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].
It is most often found on moist or wet mineral soil, especially in
recently burned areas [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Marchantia polymorpha grows best in
subcalcareous soil conditions (pH 6.0) under full sunlight [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

In central Canada, M. polymorpha is a primary invader of marshes and
edges of small ponds that are associated with fluctuating water tables
[<a href="#12">12</a>].

Marchantia polymorpha mats can interfere with the establishment of
seedlings of other vegetation [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Marchantia polymorpha gametophores appear and archegonia are ready for
fertilization in early to late May [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Sporogonia mature and spores
are released in July [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Gemmae production ceases in late spring
in Michigan [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Marchantia polymorpha rapidly invades burned areas by light wind-borne
spores [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Exposed mineral soil and high lime concentrations
present after a severe fire provide favorable conditions for gametophyte
establishment [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].

<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Marchantia polymorpha is widely recognized as an initial or early
invader of burned sites [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  It exhibits dramatic growth
following fire and in some cases attains 100 percent cover
[<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  Marchantia polymorpha dominates the early moss-herb
stage after a fire but does not persist through subsequent stages of
succession [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  In Alaska and Canada, M. polymorpha colonies
are not present in preburn communities [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].

In northeastern Minnesota, cover of M. polymorpha on burned jack pine
(Pinus banksiana)-black spruce (Picea mariana) sites increased until
postfire year 3, but it was replaced by lichens (Peltigera spp.) by
postfire year 5 [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Marchantia polymorpha produced large spreading mats on thin mineral soil
and charred humus after a severe fire in New Jersey.  The mats persisted
for 2 to 3 years, then were replaced by shrubs and forbs [<a href="#49">49</a>].

In interior Alaska, M. polymorpha found in burned white spruce (Picea
glauca) and mesic black spruce types had the following frequency and
cover percentages [<a href="#21">21</a>]:

After the 1971 Wickersham Dome Fire near Fairbanks, Alaska, M.
polymorpha was present in severely burned black spruce and trembling
aspen (Populus tremuloides) stands but was not present in adjacent
unburned control plots or in lightly burned stands.  Marchantia
polymorpha attained its highest frequency the third year after the fire
when it reached 5 percent and 45 percent on black spruce and trembling
aspen sites, respectively.  Biomass production in grams per square meter
was as follows [<a href="#52">52</a>]:

                        Black spruce         Aspen 
                       -----------------------------

             1974          0.8               69.6

In Alaska, M. polymorpha was more predominant on well-drained sites than
poorly drained sites after fire due to the fact that exposed mineral
soil provided a more favorable seedbed [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Marchantia polymorpha revegetates areas where mineral soil has been
exposed.  Colonies aid in the renewal of the humus and prepare the soil
for the establishment of other vegetation [<a href="#49">49</a>].

<b>CASE NAME : </b>
The effects of experimental fires on black spruce forests


<b>REFERENCE : </b>
Dyrness, C. T.; Norum, R. A. 1983 [<a href="#19">19</a>]


<b>SEASON/SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION : </b>
Summer/light to severe fires


<b>STUDY LOCATION : </b>
The site lies within the W 1/2 sec. 12, and the NE 1/4 sec. 13, T4N,
R2W, of the Fairbanks Meridian, Alaska.
 


<b>PREFIRE VEGETATIVE COMMUNITY : </b>
Before burning, the vegetation was an open black spruce (Picea
mariana)/feather moss (Pleurozium schreberi) forest.  The mature, open
black spruce tree layer comprised a mosaic of two dominant age-classes
of about 85 and 140 years.  Some of the seven units burned included
small groups of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and scattered
paper birch (Betula papyrifera).  The tall shrub layer was represented
by scattered American green alder (Alnus viridis ssp. crispa), willows
(Salix spp.), and prickly rose (Rosa acicularis).  The most common
low-growing shrubs were mountain cranberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea), bog
blueberry (V. uliginosum), crowberry (Empetrum nigrum), and bog Labrador
tea (Ledum groenlandicum).  The herbaceous layer was sparse but the
entire forest floor was covered with feather mosses.


<b>TARGET SPECIES PHENOLOGICAL STATE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>SITE DESCRIPTION : </b>
The total burned area covered approximately 32 acres (13 ha).  The
elevation was 1,575 to 1,706 feet (480-520 m).  The slope was 10 to 15
percent, and the aspect was generally southeast to south from a main
ridge running southwest to northeast.  The position of the fires was on
the upper third of the slope.  The soil in the experimental area was
silty loam, somewhat poorly drained in shallow loess over schist
bedrock.  Before the fire, a forest floor layer 8 to 12 inches (20-30
cm) thick was present.  The mineral soil was made up of a very
dark-brown silty loam surface horizon underlain by a yellowish-brown,
stony (30-50 percent by volume), silty loam subsoil.  Bedrock was
generally within 29 inches (75 cm) of the surface.


<b>FIRE DESCRIPTION : </b>
Seven units of approximately 5 acres (2 ha) each were burned between
July 19 and August 8, 1978.  The woody fuels on the forest floor were
meager and scattered and therefore contributed little to fire behavior
or subsequent fire effects.  Fire behavior within the units ranged from
slowly moving surface fires to rapidly advancing crown fires.  The crown
fires were passive, making the transition after hot surface fire had
passed beneath the trees.  Consequently, the surface fires determined
the rate of spread, and the crown fires followed, with flames reaching
50 feet (15 m) or more.  Most of the units were completely covered by
fire and had burned down to glowing combustion within an hour after
being ignited.  Weather conditions during the fires were as follows:

                                            Unit

<b>FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES : </b>
M. polymorpha was not present in the prefire vegetation.  In heavily
burned areas, M. polymorpha, fire moss (Ceratodon purpureus), and
fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium) dominated the postfire community for
the first 3 years.  M. polymorpha maintained a biomass of about 15 to 20
grams per square meter throughout that period.


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS : </b>
M. polymorpha invades heavily burned areas by light, wind-borne spores.
Competition from sprouters on lightly burned sites will prevent or limit
M. polymorpha colonization.  Sites must be severely burned if M.
polymorpha establishment is desired in the postfire community.
