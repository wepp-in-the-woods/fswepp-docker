<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
True mountain-mahogany commonly occurs as a dominant shrub or small tree
in almost-pure stands, as a codominant in mountain shrub communities,
and as an understory species in pinyon (Pinus spp.)-juniper (Juniperus
spp.) communities.

Where true mountain-mahogany forms a canopy layer, it is associated with
grassy species [<a href="#10">10</a>].  In Utah, true mountain-mahogany stands supported a
total plant cover of 12.8 percent [<a href="#66">66</a>].  In the Black Hills true
mountain-mahogany grows in dense stands [<a href="#53">53</a>].  

The mountain shrub community usually exhibits a mosaic pattern of
several codominant shrub species distributed across a heterogeneous
landscape.  In such communities true mountain-mahogany is commonly
associated with other mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus spp.), scrub oak
(Quercus spp.), bigtooth maple (Acer grandidentatum), antelope
bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata), Stansbury cliffrose (Purshia mexicana
var. stansburiana), mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp.
vaseyana), pachistima (Pachistima myrsinities), ninebark (Physocarpus
malvaceus), ceanothus (Ceanothus spp.), serviceberry (Amelanchier spp.),
chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), bitter cherry (P. emarginata), and
snowberry (Symphoricarpos spp.) [<a href="#33">33</a>].

The pinyon-juniper community is a tree/annual forb community type with
relatively low cover value but high species diversity [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].
Pinyon-juniper sites in Utah supported a total plant cover of 26.8
percent.  The relative frequency of true mountain-mahogany on these
sites was 0.8 percent [<a href="#66">66</a>].

True mountain-mahogany occurs as an understory species in Gambel oak
(Quercus gambelii) stands and Arizona chaparral [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  In
southwestern Oregon, true mountain-mahogany is codominant with Oregon
white oak (Quercus garryana) [<a href="#43">43</a>].  In the Wasatch Mountains of Utah and
Idaho, true mountain-mahogany codominates with antelope bitterbrush
[<a href="#42">42</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
True mountain-mahogany is good forage for all classes of browsing
animals in both summer and winter [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  Livestock and big game
browse new growth in the spring [<a href="#48">48</a>].  True mountain-mahogany
constituted 56 to 92 percent of the summer diet of bighorn sheep in
Waterton Canyon, Colorado [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Deer and elk consume the leaves and
twigs of true mountain-mahogany in the summer and browse the twigs in
winter [<a href="#48">48</a>]. 


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
True mountain mahogany is highly palatable forage.  New spring foliage
is preferred by livestock and wildlife and remains palatable until late
fall [<a href="#48">48</a>].  The palatability of true mountain-mahogany to livestock and
wildlife is rated as follows:

                        CO      MT      UT      WY

Cattle                Good    ----    Fair    ----

Waterfowl             ----    ----    Poor    Poor
        


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
True mountain-mahogany is nutritious forage.  Mineral levels in true
mountain-mahogany compare favorably with those of other forage species,
and true mountain-mahogany has a desirable calcium to phosphorus ratio
(7.5:1) [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Summer foliage of true mountain-mahogany in Waterton
Canyon, Colorado, contained 11.2 to 16.3 percent crude protein and 33.4
to 38.7 percent digestible organic matter [<a href="#44">44</a>].  In the Uintah Basin,
Utah, true mountain-mahogany leaves and twigs collected in early October
contained the following mineral concentrations in parts per million
[<a href="#10">10</a>]:

        Zn		  34.2
        Cu		  28.9
        Mn		  12.0
        Fe		 166.4
        Ca		5486.0
        Mg		2632.0
        Na		 386.6
        P		 731.8
        N		9048.0

True mountain-mahogany has low manganese, iron, potassium, and
phosphorus when compared to its associates.  Copper concentration is
relatively high; browsing animals would be poisoned by copper toxicity
if true mountain-mahogany were their sole diet item [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
True mountain-mahogany provides cover for a wide variety of wildlife
species due to the juxtaposition of stands within forested and
nonforested communities [<a href="#16">16</a>].

The degree to which true mountain-mahogany provides environmental
protection during one or more seasons for wildlife species is as follows
[<a href="#17">17</a>]:

                        CO              UT              WY

Pronghorn             ----            ----            Good
Elk                   ----            Fair            Fair
Mule deer             ----            Good            Good
White-tailed deer     ----            Fair            Poor
Small mammals         Good            Fair            Good
Small nongame birds   Good            Fair            Good

Waterfowl             ----            Poor            Poor
    


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
True mountain-mahogany can be used to improve ranges or rehabilitate
mountain shrub and pinyon-juniper communities [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>], although it may
be difficult to establish [<a href="#31">31</a>].  True mountain-mahogany exhibits
relatively low seedling vigor and initial growth rates [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Regional seed sources should be used in revegetation work [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Achenes
should be collected in years when precipitation during the growing
season is average or above average [<a href="#46">46</a>].  The average germination rate
of seeds collected during a dry year was 33 percent; it was 80 percent
in years when precipitation was average or above average in Colorado.
Seeds from northwest-facing slopes had much higher germination rates
than those from southwest-facing slopes.  Achenes should be collected
when they are just beginning to fall naturally (September 15 to October
5 in Colorado) [<a href="#46">46</a>], and collection should be limited to the first seeds
detaching from the bush.  Immature and poor-quality seeds adhere to the
plant and disseminate last [<a href="#33">33</a>].

True mountain-mahogany seeds can be stored for a number of years.  Smith
[<a href="#46">46</a>] found that true mountain-mahogany seeds from Colorado could be
stored at 41 degrees Fahrenheit (5 deg C) for up to 3 years before
viability was reduced.  Stevens and others [<a href="#51">51</a>] stored seeds in an open,
unheated, and uncooled warehouse in Utah.  Germination rates remained at
64 percent for storage years 2 through 5.  Germination for storage year
7 was 46 percent, and by storage year 10, germination had dropped to 25
percent.  Viability was highest for true mountain-mahogany seeds stored
at either -5 to -10 degrees Fahrenheit (-20.5 to -23.3 deg C) or 36 to
44 degrees Fahrenheit (2.2-6.7 deg C) [<a href="#47">47</a>].

True mountain-mahogany may be seeded or transplanted.  Allison [<a href="#2">2</a>]
recommended seeding New Mexico rangeland at a rate of 0.9 seeds per
square foot [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Competing vegetation should be reduced to a practical
minimum.  Nitrogen fertilizers should not be used; they may increase use
of soil moisture to the detriment of young seedlings, increase
undesirable competition from forbs or grasses, and increase the
palatability of young plants.  True mountain-mahogany should be
transplanted in the fall.  Protection from the effects of overbrowsing
may be necessary [<a href="#46">46</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
True mountain-mahogany is used in landscaping.  As a heat- and
drought-tolerant plant, it can be used for water-efficient landscaping
in arid environments [<a href="#20">20</a>].  It is planted as an ornamental throughout
the Southwest [<a href="#49">49</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Because true mountain-mahogany grows more slowly than many of its
associates, it continues to provide succulent forage after other species
become unpalatable [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Disturbance and browsing may promote the
health and vigor of true mountain-mahogany.  Very old, undisturbed
stands of true mountain-mahogany may become decadent, and their forage
may become less palatable or out of reach to most browsing animals [<a href="#34">34</a>].
Protecting true mountain-mahogany from browsing may result in growth
stagnation; 40 years of protection from browsing resulted in
significantly decreased true mountain-mahogany stem elongation in
Laramie, Wyoming [<a href="#55">55</a>].  In southwestern Colorado browse weight yields of
true mountain-mahogany increased when current annual growth stems were
clipped by 20 to 80 percent.  Clipping true mountain-mahogany by 60
percent resulted in maximum growth rates [<a href="#45">45</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cercocarpus montanus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
True mountain-mahogany is a native, xerophytic, deciduous shrub or small
tree growing up to 19.8 feet (6 m) tall [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Leaves are
simple, alternate, lanceolate to roundish, and 0.28 to 2.4 inches (0.7-6
cm) long [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Flowers are borne solitarily or in fascicles on short
spur branchlets [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Achenes retain their long (up to 4 inches [10
cm]), twisted, plumose styles [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].

The stout, lateral roots of true mountain-mahogany arise from a large
root crown.  In alluvial soils, they descend downward to depths of 3.3
feet (1 m) or more.  In shallow soils underlain by tuff, they penetrate
to the depth of the bedrock, grow at right angles until encountering a
crack, and descend downward once again.  Average root depth for true
mountain-mahogany in north-central New Mexico was 3.7 feet (1.13 m)
[<a href="#67">67</a>].  Near Colorado Springs, Colorado, true mountain-mahogany roots
reached maximum depths between 4 and 5.6 feet (1.2-1.7 m) on residual
loamy soils [<a href="#5">5</a>].  True mountain-mahogany roots may have associations of
nitrogen-fixing endomycorrhizae [<a href="#56">56</a>].

True mountain-mahogany is probably long-lived.  In the Uintah Basin of
Utah, some true mountain-mahogany was 54 years old [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
True mountain-mahogany reproduces vegetatively and sexually.  True
mountain-mahogany sprouts from the root crown following disturbance
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  In favorable years, true mountain-mahogany produces a good
crop of seedlings [<a href="#48">48</a>]; however, seedling establishment can be very
sporadic.  True mountain-mahogany did not reproduce during a 10-year
period from 1965 to 1975 on a northeast-facing slope in Chadron,
Nebraska [<a href="#69">69</a>].  Stanton [<a href="#48">48</a>] suggested that poor seedling establishment
may be caused by drought or frost.  Woodmansee [<a href="#71">71</a>] found that
relatively mesic habitats were critical for true mountain-mahogany
seedling success in New Mexico.  Establishment was dependent on abundant
sheltering and shading and the presence of litter.  Germination occurred
under or near mature true mountain-mahogany.

The germination requirements of true mountain-mahogany may vary with
site climatic factors.  Seeds collected from Utah and Colorado varied in
their chilling requirements; however, true mountain-mahogany probably
does not require extremely long periods of chilling for germination
[<a href="#27">27</a>].  Scarifying seeds from a Wyoming collection did not result in
increased germination.  Both vernalization and soaking seeds in
distilled water did increase germination [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Monsen and Christenson
[<a href="#32">32</a>] recommended a long stratification period.  Smith [<a href="#46">46</a>] recommended
after-ripening true mountain-mahogany seeds by storing them at room
temperature for 5 months, dry-storing them for 6 weeks at 41 degrees
Fahrenheit (5 deg C), and wet-prechilling the seeds for 2 to 3 weeks.
Day and night temperatures should alternate between 86 and 68 degrees
Fahrenheit (20.0/30.0 deg C).  Differences in size among seed
collections from northern New Mexico did not explain differences in
germination rates; collections containing mostly large seeds did not
exhibit a greater average germination rate than those with a fewer large
seeds and more small seeds [<a href="#37">37</a>].

True mountain-mahogany seeds are wind dispersed [<a href="#7">7</a>].  The pointed basal
end of the achene and the corkscrew-like tail enable it to penetrate the
ground [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
True mountain-mahogany commonly grows on plains, foothills, moderately
steep slopes, ridges, and bluffs [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  Its occurrence is not
usually related to a particular parent material [<a href="#9">9</a>], but in the Black
Hills, true mountain-mahogany grows only on limestone formations [<a href="#53">53</a>].
True mountain-mahogany commonly grows in coarse, shallow, well-drained
residual soils on sunny sites [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>], and it sometimes grows in the
moist, fertile, relatively deep soil of canyon bottoms [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  The
average pH at sites dominated by true mountain-mahogany in Utah was 7.7
[<a href="#66">66</a>].

True mountain-mahogany distribution is dependent on moisture
availability [<a href="#70">70</a>].  In Utah true mountain-mahogany communities on
south-facing slopes always occur at higher elevations than those on
north-facing slopes [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].  In central and western Colorado, where true
mountain-mahogany occurs in mountain shrub communities from 4,000 to
10,000 feet (1,200-3,000 m) elevation, annual precipitation averages
from 10 to 20 inches (2,540-5,080 mm) [<a href="#46">46</a>].  In the Laramie Basin,
Wyoming, true mountain-mahogany stands grow at 7,000 to 8,000 feet
(2,100-2,400 m) elevation, and the average annual precipitation is 10 to
17 inches (2,540-4,318 mm).  Temperatures at Laramie may range from -47
degrees Fahrenheit (-43.8 deg C) in winter to 97 degrees Fahrenheit
(36.1 deg C) in summer [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Dittberner and Olson [<a href="#17">17</a>] list elevations for true mountain-mahogany as
follows:
	
	Colorado	4,000 to 10,000 feet (1,220-3,049 m)  
	Utah		5,000 to 7,000 feet (1,524-2,134 m)
	Wyoming	        4,400 to 8,500 feet (1,341-2,591 m) 


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
True mountain-mahogany is somewhat shade tolerant.  It is able to grow
in open ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir stands; however, it occurs most
often and grows more vigorously on sites without forest canopy.

The successional role of true mountain-mahogany may vary with community
type.  In north-central Utah true mountain-mahogany communities on xeric
sites are more likely to persist and those on mesic sites are more
likely to be seral [<a href="#70">70</a>].  In central Utah Anderson [<a href="#3">3</a>] found evidence
indicating succession of true mountain-mahogany stands towards mountain
shrub communities dominated by other species.  Greenwood and Brotherson
[<a href="#66">66</a>] observed the establishment of pinyon and juniper in true
mountain-mahogany communities in Utah.  In 11 out of 20 sites where true
mountain-mahogany was the dominant species growing in shallow soil
within slickrock areas, pinyon seedlings grew beneath true
mountain-mahogany shrubs.  The deeper soil and modified habitat around
true mountain-mahogany apparently provided a route for pinyon
establishment.  Juniper seedlings were also present.

In the Black Hills, climax mountain shrub communities dominated by true
mountain-mahogany occur near ponderosa pine communities.  In the
ponderosa pine communities, succession after fire includes a stage of
true mountain-mahogany that may be shaded out by the overstory canopy of
ponderosa pine.  However, true mountain-mahogany is rarely eliminated
from the community.  Some stands are ecotonal between ponderosa pine and
true mountain-mahogany and may remain so indefinitely [<a href="#23">23</a>].



<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
The seasonal development of true mountain-mahogany varies by region and
elevation.  In Utah flowering varies from mid-May to late June and fruit
ripens from late July to mid-September [<a href="#6">6</a>].  In Idaho true
mountain-mahogany fruits from August to October [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Phenological data
from two elevations on the Wasatch Plateau in Utah are presented below

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cercocarpus montanus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
True mountain-mahogany is usually temporarily damaged by fire [<a href="#41">41</a>].
True mountain-mahogany burns less readily than other shrubs [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>] and
sprouts vigorously from the root crown after most fires [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].

In open, dry habitats where true mountain-mahogany is likely to occur,
fires in presettlement times were of low severity because of fuel
discontinuity.  Today, many formerly open stands are dominated by
conifers and decadent shrubs which provide greater fuel loads.  When
fires occur, they are likely to be more severe [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tall shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<pre><center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cercocarpus montanus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire generally top kills true mountain-mahogany [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Live crowns of
plants occurring in Arizona chaparral dominated by shrub live oak
(Quercus turbinella) and true mountain-mahogany were reduced by 88.5 to
99 percent during prescribed fires of various intensities.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
True mountain-mahogany sprouts vigorously after fire.  True
mountain-mahogany sprouted after severe fire in Bandelier National
Monument, New Mexico.  Prefire canopy cover consisted mainly of
ponderosa pine; tree foliage was either completely scorched or consumed
by the fire in the two stands where true mountain-mahogany occurred.
True mountain-mahogany density and height in postfire year 2 were as
follows [<a href="#39">39</a>]:

                        clumps/acre     sprouts/acre    average height
                                                             (cm)
Frijoles Rim stand          70               75               38
Burnt Mesa stand             5               20               83
  
The cover of true mountain-mahogany in Arizona chaparral before a
prescribed fire was 16.5 percent.  By postfire year 5, true
mountain-mahogany had recovered to 8.5 percent cover through sprouting.
Herbicide was applied to leaves of oaks in the stand in order to assure
fuel flammability.  Oak leaf moistures averaged 13 percent or less after
herbicide desiccation; untreated oak leaf moistures averaged 85 percent
or greater [<a href="#36">36</a>].

True mountain-mahogany seedlings may establish after fire, although
seedling establishment may be relatively low.  One year after a
prescribed fire in Arizona chaparral, seven true mountain-mahogany
seedlings per acre were observed [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Five seedlings per acre emerged
in postfire year 2.  No seedlings emerged in postfire years 3, 4, or 5.
Seedling mortality may be high.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
The response of true mountain-mahogany to fire may vary seasonally.
High- and low-severity fire treatments applied to true mountain-mahogany
during the dormant season in north-central Colorado were more effective
in increasing biomass production than those applied during the growing
season [<a href="#57">57</a>].  Current annual growth production of true mountain-mahogany,
expressed as a ratio to control plant production, for high- and
low-intensity fire treatments were as follows:

Fire                    Growing-season        Dormant-season
                        1971      1972        1971      1972

High-intensity          0.6       1.0         4.8       4.6
Low-intensity           1.0       1.7         6.5       9.1

Fire treatments were applied to plants individually with a
kerosene-burning flame gun.


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fuel loadings for chaparral communities containing true
mountain-mahogany are described [<a href="#35">35</a>].
