<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Zuckia brandegeei
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Silt bush is mostly restricted to the Colorado River drainage in
south-central Wyoming, western Colorado, eastern Utah, northeastern
Arizona, and northwestern New Mexico [<a href="#16">16</a>].  The only known population
outside of the Colorado River drainage system is in the Great Basin,
just northwest of Sterling, Utah [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].

The chromosomal populations of silt bush reportedly differ in
geographical distribution.  Diploid populations occur mostly in
south-central Utah and northeastern Arizona [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Tetraploids tend to
grow in isolated populations or in more continuous bands wherever 2:1
clay substrates are exposed in northeastern Utah, south-central Wyoming,
eastern Colorado, and northwestern New Mexico [(Pendleton, pers. comm.
1987), 16].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Silt bush can be found growing near Stansbury cliffrose (Purshia
mexicana var. stansburiana) communities, pinyon-juniper and juniper-oak
woodlands, and salt desert shrublands [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].  Where silt bush
grows with other species it is more commonly found in saltbush
communities that are in a very early seral stage [Pendleton pers. comm.,
1987].  It may also occur as a pioneer plant restricted by competition
to steep 2:1 clay slopes where other plants cannot survive [Pendleton
pers. comm., 1987].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Zuckia brandegeei
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Silt bush has good tolerance to grazing and is a valuable winter forage
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  It is browsed by livestock and big game, especially in the
spring when it is in full leaf [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The early spring and summer growth of silt bush is reported to be good
to very good in palatability, but the foliage retained over the fall and
winter is only fair in palatability [<a href="#11">11</a>].  The degree of use shown by
livestock and wildlife species for silt bush is rated as follows [<a href="#3">3</a>]:

                       UT        WY

Cattle                Fair      Fair
Sheep                 Good      Fair
Horses                Poor      Fair 
Pronghorn             Fair      ____
Elk                   Poor      ____
Mule deer             Fair      ____
Small mammals         Good      ____
Small nongame birds   Poor      ____ 
Upland game birds     Fair      ____   
Waterfowl             Poor      ____


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Silt bush is rated fair in energy and protein value [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The degree to which silt bush provides environmental protection during
one or more seasons for wildlife species in Utah is as follows [<a href="#3">3</a>]:

Pronghorn             Poor
Elk                   Poor
Small mammals         Fair
Small nongame birds   Fair
Upland game birds     Fair
Waterfowl             Poor


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Silt bush is rated as having low to medium potential for both erosion
control and short-term revegetation, and medium potential for long-term
revegetation projects [<a href="#3">3</a>].  It provides good surface soil stabilization
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].

Silt bush has a fair to medium natural rate of spread [<a href="#11">11</a>].  It
reproduces well from seed and spreads effectively on disturbed sites
such as roadcuts and roadfills [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Silt bush apparently increases
after soil disturbances [<a href="#9">9</a>].  It was given a higher suitability rating
for restoring big game ranges than was spiny hopsage [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Silt bush germinates and produces seedlings readily, but unless
protected, seeds and seedlings are often eaten by small mammals and
birds [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].

Seed can be stored up to 5 years, but only 2 years is recommended to
ensure good viability [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Cold stratification or dry storage
improves germination [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Winged fruits average 189,950 to 190,000 per
pound (86,142-86,165 kg) [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].

Poor results have been obtained from rooting of stem cuttings [<a href="#7">7</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Zuckia brandegeei
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Silt bush is a native, perennial shrub or subshrub that grows from 0.5
to 1.6 feet (10-50 cm) in height [<a href="#18">18</a>].  The slender, erect or ascending
annual stems are branched from a persistant woody base 2 to 8 inches
(5-20 cm) tall [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  The branches lack spines [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Leaves are
alternate with linear-oblanceolate to obovate blades and reach 0.6 to
1.8 inches (1.5-4.5 cm) in length [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>].

Identification between the chromosomal races proposed by Stutz and
others [<a href="#16">16</a>] is possible due to variations in stature and leaf size.
Diploid populations (Z. brandegeei var. brandegeei) grow 0.8 to 1.3 feet
(2-4 dm) tall and have narrow linear leaves, while the larger statured
tetraploids (Z. brandegeei var. plummeri) reach 0.10 to 1.6 feet (3-5 dm)
in height and have wider, more oval-shaped leaves [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].

Silt bush has been desbribed as dioecious or less commonly monoecious
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Pendleton [<a href="#10">10</a>] has, however, shown silt bush to be
monoecious.  The only exceptions were found on plants where the second
sexual function failed to mature [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Silt bush is heterodichogamous;
separation of sexual functions is complete [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Environmentaly induced
sex changes have been reported [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Silt bush has a spreading root system that provides good resistance to
drought [<a href="#7">7</a>].  It often grows on saline and seleniferous soils [<a href="#17">17</a>] and
has been listed as a possible secondary or facultative selenium absorber
[<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Silt bush reproduces by winged seed which is produced annually [<a href="#13">13</a>].  It
is reported to germinate and produce seedlings readily [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Germination
is improved by cold stratification or dry storage [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Silt bush also regenerates vegetatively.
 


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Silt bush is generally restricted to the drier plains and foothills in
the Upper Colorado River drainage [<a href="#7">7</a>].  One isolated population occurs
in the Great Basin [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Stutz [<a href="#15">15</a>] found silt bush grew almost
exclusively on talus and steep mud slopes.  These steeper sites show
little soil development [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Growth is reported to be good on gentle
to moderate slopes and fair on steep [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Silt bush occurs on a variety of soils that range from sandy, loamy,
silty clay loam, to clayey in texture [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].  It is typically found on
heavy clay substrates derived from shale, but it will occur on flatter,
sandier sites in the southern extension of its range [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Soils are
often saline and seleniferous [<a href="#17">17</a>].

The chromosomal races of silt bush are reported to grow in soils with
slight differences in mineral content.  Stutz and others [<a href="#16">16</a>] found
diploid populations occupied soils higher in iron and manganese, while
soils occupied by tetraploids had consistently higher contents of
potassium and zinc [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Silt bush is adapted to juniper-oak woodlands, pinyon-juniper sites, and
salt desert shrublands [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].  It may occur in pure stands but is
often found growing in association with Stansbury cliffrose, shadscale
(Atriplex confertifolia), big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), and
blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima) [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].  Silt bush occurs from 3,000
to 7,000 feet (900-2,100 m) in elevation [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Elevational ranges for
several western states are as follows [<a href="#3">3</a>]:

         from  5,000 to 6,000 feet (1,524-1,982 m) in CO
               4,800 to 8,000 feet (1,463-2,439 m) in UT
               6,800 to 7,300 feet (2,073-2,225 m) in WY


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Silt bush is reported to increase after disturbance [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Information on the phenological development of silt bush is scant.  It
can be in full leaf by early to late May [<a href="#9">9</a>].  The leaves appear in
early April and dehisce in late summer [<a href="#16">16</a>].  The flowering period
varies from mid-June to mid-August [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Pendleton [<a href="#10">10</a>] reported that
flowering begins sometime in May and fruit set is complete by early
July.  The leaves continue to develop after fruit set and become thick
and leathery [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Generalized flowering dates for silt bush in several
western stated are as follows [<a href="#3">3</a>]:

 State       Beginning of Flowering       Flowering       End of Flowering
  CO                 July                    July              August
  UT                 June                    July              August
  WY                 July                    July              August
                                             
Seed ripens in late September to early October, but the utricles remain
on the plant until January [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Smith [<a href="#13">13</a>] reported fruit ripening
begins in September and lasts until mid-December.  Fruits may persist on
the plant through the winter but are often eaten by small mammals and
birds [<a href="#1">1</a>].
