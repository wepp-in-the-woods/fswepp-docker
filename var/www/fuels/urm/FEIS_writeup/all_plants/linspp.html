<p>For the purposes of this review, the common name toadflax will be used when 
discussing characteristics common to both species, or when it is unclear which
of the species was studied. When referring to individual species, the common 
names listed above will be used to represent the respective scientific name. 
</p> 

<p>A review by Saner and others [<a href="#95">95</a>] reports that hybrids between yellow toadflax  and 
Dalmatian toadflax can be produced in the 
laboratory, and therefore occurrence of this hybrid in the field cannot be 
excluded. Hybrids between yellow toadflax and striped toadflax (<i>Linaria repens</i>) commonly occur. 
This hybrid was described as <i>Linaria</i> x <i>sepium</i> 
J. G. Allman from the British Islands in 1843 and was discovered near St. John's, 
Newfoundland, in the early 1900s ([<a href="#95">95</a>] and references therein).</p>

GENERAL DISTRIBUTION:</a>
</span>
<br />


The following discussion of the origin, introduction and distribution of 
Dalmatian toadflax and
yellow toadflax is based on several review articles [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>], unless other sources are cited.

<p>Dalmatian toadflax is a native of the Mediterranean region from Yugoslavia to 
Iran [<a href="#88">88</a>]. Yellow toadflax is native to the steppes of southeastern
Europe and southwestern Asia [<a href="#95">95</a>]. Both species have been
cultivated as ornamentals for centuries and are widely distributed throughout
the world [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>].</p>

<p>It has been suggested that Dalmatian toadflax was introduced to North America as an
ornamental in the late 1800s; however, the earliest authentic specimen was
collected in California in 1920 [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>]. Yellow 
toadflax was
introduced to New England in the late 1600s as an ornamental and medicinal plant
and continues to be sold in nurseries and seed
catalogs.  For example, Gutknecht [<a href="#35">35</a>] lists &quot;<i>Linaria vulgaris</i>
(common toadflax or butter-and-eggs)&quot; as a plant that is 
well suited for xeriscaping. The spread of toadflax was facilitated by its use as an ornamental, 
medicinal, magical, and dye plant, although accidental introduction and distribution along roads and railway 
corridors, or in crop seed, baled hay, ship ballast, and clothing likely
increased its spread [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].</p>

<p>Toadflax occurs throughout the continental U.S. and in almost every Canadian
province [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>]. Yellow toadflax is most 
common in northeastern North America, and localized 
in other parts of the continent, particularly the western Canadian provinces [<a href="#57">57</a>]. 
The northern limits of yellow toadflax's North American range are approximately 55<font face="Times New Roman">°</font> 
N to 65<font face="Times New Roman">°</font> N [<a href="#95">95</a>]. The latitudinal range of 
Dalmatian toadflax in North America is from about 33<font face="Times New Roman">°</font> 
N to about 56<font face="Times New Roman">°</font> N, as compared to a range of 
about 35<font face="Times New Roman">°</font> N to 47<font face="Times New Roman">°</font> 
N in Eurasia [<a href="#1">1</a>]. Dalmatian toadflax is most common in western North America, especially in California, 
Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Alberta, and British Columbia 
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>], and it is spreading in the Southwest.
For example, it is estimated to have invaded 200,000 acres (80,000 ha) on the Coconino National Forest in 
northern Arizona as of 2001 [<a href="#76">76</a>].</p>

<p>Toadflax is most commonly found in cultivated fields, roadsides, railways, 
&quot;waste areas&quot;, clearcuts, overgrazed pastures and
rangeland, and in plant communities that are typically open or disturbed 
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>]. Neither species occurs as frequently 
in intact wildlands and natural areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The
following lists include some ecosystems, habitats, and forest and range cover types
in which toadflax is known or thought to be invasive, as well as several that
may be invaded by toadflax following disturbances in which vegetation is killed 
and/or removed (e.g. cultivation, logging, fire, grazing, herbicide application, flooding). 
These lists are speculative and not exhaustive. More information 
is needed regarding incidents and examples of particular ecosystems and plant 
communities where toadflax is invasive.</p>

<br />


Toadflax most commonly invades disturbed plant communities typical of cultivated 
areas, roadsides and other &quot;waste places.&quot; It also invades communities
with 
naturally-occurring disturbances or small openings [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>]. 
For example,
Dalmatian toadflax is said to be highly invasive and 
competitive in sagebrush (<i>Artemisia</i> spp.) ecosystems [<a href="#77">77</a>], and is 
often invasive in open ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>), bunchgrass, and 
riparian communities. 

<p>Dalmatian toadflax may displace natives in shrub-steppe communities in Washington [<a href="#81">81</a>]. 
It was found in trace amounts in ponderosa pine-bluebunch wheatgrass (<i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i>) and 
ponderosa pine-Thurber needlegrass (<i>Achnatherum thurberianum</i>) habitat types in Washington 
and Idaho in the late 1960s [<a href="#16">16</a>]. In Oregon, Dalmatian toadflax is found in bluebunch wheatgrass-Sandberg 
bluegrass (<i>Poa secunda</i>) and Idaho fescue (<i>Festuca idahoensis</i>)-bluebunch 
wheatgrass communities, and on gravel bars in riparian  communities [<a href="#81">81</a>].</p>

<p>In Montana, Dalmatian toadflax forms large colonies in dry mountain grasslands of valleys and foothills [<a href="#56">56</a>], 
on sites formerly dominated by native prairie species such as Idaho fescue 
and bluebunch wheatgrass. These sites are 
now dominated by Dalmatian toadflax, leafy spurge (<i>Euphorbia esula</i>), spotted knapweed (<i>Centaurea 
maculosa</i>), cheatgrass (<i>Bromus tectorum</i>) [<a href="#61">61</a>], and 
sulphur cinquefoil (<i>Potentilla recta</i>) (personal observation). In 
Glacier National Park, Montana, Dalmatian toadflax occurs in rough fescue (<i>Festuca altaica</i>)-Idaho 
fescue habitat types along roadsides [<a href="#107">107</a>].</p>

<p>In Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, Dalmatian toadflax was found at Mammoth Campground in a big sagebrush 
(<i>Artemisia tridentata</i>)/bluebunch wheatgrass habitat type. It was not found at 
 campgrounds at higher elevations [<a href="#2">2</a>].</p>

<p>Toadflax often occurs in riparian areas in Colorado. It is found, for example, on gravel bars 
in the south fork of the San Miguel River that are flanked by riparian forests 
of cottonwood (<i>Populus</i> spp.) and spruce (<i>Picea</i>  spp.) [<a href="#82">82</a>]. Along the Yampa River area in Colorado, 
Dalmatian toadflax spreads in from adjacent upland 
areas and along the river. It is found in gravel bars, riparian pastures, and 
open meadows, and may compete with cottonwood seedlings for establishment sites 
on gravel bars. In Phantom, Colorado, the river and trails are 
conduits to dispersal of Dalmatian toadflax. It may also invade mountain-mahogany (<i>Cercocarpus</i> 
spp.) shrubland and 
shortgrass prairie communities adjacent to riparian corridors [<a href="#81">81</a>].</p>

<p>In Utah, Dalmatian toadflax is found in oak (<i>Quercus</i> spp.), quaking aspen (<i>Populus 
tremuloides</i>), sagebrush, mountain&nbsp;brush, and riparian communities [<a href="#119">119</a>].</p>
<p>Dalmatian toadflax is found, though rare, in sandy soils and washes in oak woodland in Fort Bowie 
National Historic Site in southeastern Arizona [<a href="#116">116</a>]. It is also 
found in northern Arizona in Bebb willow (<i>Salix bebbiana</i>) wet meadow, 
fescue (<i>Festuca</i> spp.)-muhly (<i>Muhlenbergia</i> spp.) grassland, and mixed conifer understory communities [<a href="#81">81</a>].</p>
<p>Less information is available for plant communities in which yellow toadflax is found. It 
is most common in agricultural areas  
[<a href="#95">95</a>].</p>

<p>Yellow toadflax was found in a jack pine (<i>Pinus banksiana</i>)-lichen woodland of the upper boreal forest in northern 
Quebec, 2 years after wildfire [<a href="#100">100</a>]; and was identified in a ponderosa pine/bluebunch wheatgrass community in Montana [<a href="#83">83</a>].</p>

In Kentucky, yellow toadflax is found along roadsides with purple crownvetch (<i>Coronilla varia</i>) and 
tall fescue (<i>Festuca arundinacea</i>) (used to 
revegetate the roadsides), along with staghorn sumac (<i>Rhus typhina</i>), 
bluegrass (<i>Poa</i> spp.), great ragweed (<i>Ambrosia trifida</i>), and 
goldenrod (<i>Solidago</i> spp.) [<a href="#60">60</a>].

GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />

The following description of toadflax presents characteristics that may be 
relevant to fire ecology, and is not meant for identification. Correct 
identification of toadflax is important if control strategies are planned, 
because it may be confused with native snapdragons (<i>Antirrhinum</i> spp.).
Keys for identification are available (e.g. [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>]).

<p>Dalmatian and yellow toadflax are 
deep-rooted, short-lived, herbaceous perennials. They reproduce by seed, and can
form colonies by means of adventitious buds on roots. Toadflax shoots are&nbsp; tough
and somewhat woody near the base, and are produced singly or in clumps of up to 25 stems per crown, spaced 
along the shallow, lateral roots [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>].</p>

<p>Dalmatian toadflax is variable in many characteristics [<a href="#1">1</a>]. Stems of Dalmatian toadflax are 16 to 36 inches (40-90 cm) 
tall or taller, somewhat woody at the base, and the upper portion is frequently branched. 
Decumbent to weakly ascending stems are produced in the fall [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>]. Both leaves and stems are waxy. Leaves are usually 
heart-shaped, 0.8 to 2 inches (2-5 cm) long, 0.4 to 0.6 inch (10-16 mm) wide 
with clasping bases. Flowers grow in the axils of upper leaves, in loose, 
elongate, terminal racemes and have a spur that is about as long as the rest of 
the flower (0.6 to 0.9 inch (14-24 mm)). The fruit is a capsule, 6-7 mm long and 4-8 
mm wide, bearing an average of 140 to 250 seeds [<a href="#87">87</a>]. Seeds are 1.2-2 mm long with wings [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>].</p>

<p>Yellow toadflax has a variable habit, depending on environmental factors such 
as shading, grazing, or soil type, which may be expressed in flower and pollen grain 
morphology [<a href="#95">95</a>]. Yellow toadflax 
stems are usually 12 to 36 inches (30-90 cm) tall, simple to branched. Yellow 
toadflax leaves are narrow, 
linear, 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) long, 2-6 mm wide, somewhat pointed at both ends, and not clasping. 
Yellow toadflax flowers occur at first in 
clusters near the ends of the stems, growing at the bases of upper leaves, and becoming more widely spaced along the stem 
as the season progresses [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>]. Yellow toadflax flowers also have a spur that is about as 
long as the rest to the flower (10-14 mm) [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>]. Yellow toadflax fruit is a capsule, 
5-12 mm long, bearing a highly variable number of viable seeds [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>] about 2 mm long with broad wings [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].</p>

<p>Mature toadflax plants have extensive, well-developed root systems. Taproots of 
a mature Dalmatian toadflax 
plant may reach depths of 4 to 10 feet (1.3-3 m), and lateral roots can extend 
12 feet (3.6 m) from the parent plant. Vegetative buds were found as deep as 6 
feet (1.8 m) in coarse soil. However, most Dalmatian toadflax plants produced from vegetative 
buds occur on lateral roots that are  found in the upper 2 to 12 inches 
(5-30 cm) of soil [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>]. Mature yellow toadflax taproots may grow 3.3 
feet (1 m) deep, and lateral roots can be several meters long. Shoots tend to 
grow from vegetative buds that are around 0.8 to 2 inches (2-5 cm) below the 
soil surface [<a href="#95">95</a>].</p>

<p>These extensive root systems allow toadflax plants to 
exploit water resources efficiently and provide an effective anchor&nbsp;that prevents grazing animals and 
cultivation methods from dislodging or destroying plants. Superficial yellow 
toadflax roots do not overwinter; however, the roots are able to survive freezing to 
5 degrees Fahrenheit 
(-15 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) after artificial acclimatization to 
low temperatures [<a href="#95">95</a>].</p>

<p>Roots of both Dalmatian toadflax and yellow toadflax are colonized by VAM 
fungi, probably less so in cultivated soil than in populations established in
less disturbed areas [<a href="#39">39</a>].</p>

<p> A life span of at least 4 years for individual roots has been reported for 
yellow toadflax [<a href="#95">95</a>], while individual Dalmatian toadflax 
plants are thought to live an average of 3 to 5 years. Dalmatian toadflax patches can persist for 13 years or more under 
favorable conditions. Dalmatian toadflax stands sometimes disappear for several years, then 
re-establish, either from buried seeds, or perhaps from vegetative root buds [<a href="#88">88</a>]. In this way a stand may persist 
indefinitely [<a href="#57">57</a>]. The age of toadflax plants may be determined by observing growth rings in the 
secondary xylem of the main root [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>].</p>

Dalmatian toadflax and yellow toadflax reproduce by seeds and by vegetative buds on  roots. New infestations of 
toadflax usually originate from seed. Established 
patches of Dalmatian toadflax expand by both seed and vegetative reproduction, while 
yellow toadflax patches 
expand primarily by vegetative reproduction.

<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Breeding system:</font></b> 
Both Dalmatian toadflax and yellow toadflax are self-incompatible [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>]. However, a review by 
Saner and others [<a href="#95">95</a>] suggests that a small proportion of yellow toadflax seeds can develop without cross-pollination.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Pollination:</b></font>
Dalmatian toadflax and yellow toadflax are both insect pollinated [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>]. Conspicuous yellow flowers with bright 
orange palates (nectar guides) make toadflax well adapted to insect pollination. 
Yellow toadflax is pollinated mostly by bumblebees and it is only of minor importance for honeybees [<a href="#95">95</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Seed production:</font></b>
Viable seed production in toadflax is variable due to availability of outcross pollen [<a href="#12">12</a>], pollinator limitation, 
predation by insects [<a href="#6">6</a>], resource limitations [<a href="#12">12</a>], and 
variable flowering phenology [<a href="#95">95</a>].</p>

<p>Robocker [<a href="#87">87</a>] studied seed production in Dalmatian toadflax and found that capsules on main 
stems averaged 250 seeds per capsule while those on branches contained an 
average of 140 seeds per capsule. He calculated that, with minimal competition 
and good moisture availability, a Dalmatian toadflax plant with 10 stems could
potentially produce 500,000 seeds. A review by Vujnovic and Wein [<a href="#114">114</a>] cites a 
study finding that plants with 12-15 stems produced up to 400,000 seeds.</p>

<p>Studies of yellow toadflax report low seed set and low seed viability. The average number of seeds 
per capsule ranges between 3 and 47 in North America [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>] and from 70 to 110 in central Europe. 
Capsules formed later in the growing season tend to produce more viable seed. Some populations of yellow 
toadflax may never produce more than 25% viable seed [<a href="#12">12</a>]. Average number of seeds produced per 
yellow toadflax stem may vary from 165 to 5,584. Seed counts on a per plant basis are difficult to 
compare as the definition of what constitutes an individual is unclear. Mean 
numbers from 1,500 to 30,000 have been reported ([<a href="#95">95</a>] and 
references therein).</p>

<p>Nadeau and King [<a href="#69">69</a>] found that seed production of 210,000 
seeds per m<sup>2</sup> within a 0.5 m radius around yellow toadflax parent plants was reduced to 1,410 
seeds per m<sup>2</sup> within a 0.5 m radius in the subsequent year when 
biological control insects were abundant.</p>

<p>Many seed studies fail to differentiate between viable and nonviable seeds. 
Clements and Cavers [<a href="#12">12</a>] observed seasonal differences in 
number of viable seeds produced by yellow toadflax and attributed these differences to 
differential seed development in response to variable resource availability.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seed dispersal:</b></font> Toadflax seeds are formed in 
capsules on the terminal portions of branched stems. 
The capsules dry over time, crack open and release seeds [<a href="#69">69</a>]. Although the 
seeds are winged, and wind has been considered a major means of seed dispersal 
for toadflax species [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>], Nadeau and King [<a href="#69">69</a>] 
observed that over 80% of yellow toadflax seeds fell within an 18-inch (50 cm) radius of the 
parent plant, and &quot;very few&quot; seeds fell more than 5 feet (1.5 m) from the parent 
plant.</p> 

<p>Average seed size is similar for yellow and Dalmatian toadflax. Dalmatian 
toadflax seeds are slightly heavier [<a href="#87">87</a>], and the papery wing surrounding the seeds is less 
developed on Dalmatian toadflax. This suggests that 
Dalmatian toadflax seeds probably also fall within short distances of the parent 
plant. When seeds of either species fall from upright dried floral 
stems onto crusted snow, they can be blown by wind across the surface of the
snow ([<a href="#57">57</a>] and references therein).</p> 

<p>A review by Saner and others [<a href="#95">95</a>] suggests yellow toadflax seeds may also be 
dispersed by water, ants, birds, and rodents. Seed dispersal via farm 
equipment is likely an important mode of dispersal in agricultural areas. Dalmatian 
toadflax may also be dispersed by cattle, deer and other browsing animals [<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>].&nbsp;Dalmatian 
toadflax seeds can remain viable after passing through the gastrointestinal 
tracts of cattle, and possibly deer [<a href="#87">87</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seed banking:</b></font> 
Nadeau and King [<a href="#69">69</a>] found that yellow toadflax seeds kept in the dark at 
68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) produced few 
seedlings, suggesting a strong dormancy in yellow toadflax seeds. Dormancy was 
broken with wet stratification, with maximum germination obtained after 8 weeks 
of wet stratification [<a href="#69">69</a>]. Seed stored at room temperature for 13 years had a 
germination rate of 67%, at optimum germination temperatures. Under field conditions at Spokane, 
Washington, researchers estimate Dalmatian toadflax seed longevity at 10 years, 
with duration of viability dependent on soil and climatic conditions [<a href="#87">87</a>].</p>

<p>Results presented by Grieshop and Nowierski [<a href="#32">32</a>] 
suggest  Dalmatian toadflax produces enough seeds to exceed potential emergence sites. 
Therefore, many Dalmatian toadflax seeds may remain ungerminated each year [<a href="#32">32</a>]. 
Because only a portion of toadflax seeds may germinate in any given year, and 
because seeds can remain viable for several years [<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>], dormant, 
soil-stored seeds can reinfest a site following control applications or other disturbances that reduce plant 
competition [<a href="#57">57</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Germination:</b></font> 
Toadflax seed viability and germination rates are variable. Factors that may affect toadflax seed viability include 
resource limitation, seed predators, and  pollinator 
limitation. Germination is affected by temperature, light, seed dormancy and 
after-ripening.</p> 

<p>Nadeau and King [<a href="#69">69</a>] found 40 to 51% average seed viability 
(by tetrazolium chloride test) in yellow toadflax seed collected throughout the 
season in Alberta. Clements and Cavers [<a href="#12">12</a>] found most of the observed seasonal differences 
in yellow toadflax seed viability in their 
study were the result of differential seed development in response to variable 
resource availability. Insect predation can also affect toadflax seed viability.
McClay [<a href="#63">63</a>] found that seed viability and individual seed weight 
were seriously reduced on plants attacked by <i>Brachypterolus pulicarius</i>, and 
Nadeau and King [<a href="#69">69</a>] observed reduced seed viability in a year when there was 
heavy predation by <i>B. pulicarius</i> and <i>G. antirrhini</i> (see the
<a href="management_considerations.html#Biological">Biological control</a> section for more information 
on these biological control
insects).</p> 

<p>Yellow toadflax seed germination 
rates vary greatly but are usually low. Clements and Cavers [<a href="#12">12</a>] report yellow toadflax germination rates 
ranging from 13.5% to 65.8%. Remaining seeds are either dormant or nonviable 
[<a href="#12">12</a>].  Some yellow toadflax seeds may germinate immediately, but most seeds remain dormant. Seed 
dormancies of 8 years have been reported. Yellow toadflax seeds germinate in the top 0.8 to 1.2 
inches (2-3 cm) of 
soil and may also germinate on the soil surface. In most experiments, light 
appeared to induce germination. Germination rates of 88% were observed following chilling 
and subsequent exposure to alternating temperatures ([<a href="#95">95</a>] and 
references therein). Wet stratification can also  induce germination of yellow toadflax seeds [<a href="#69">69</a>].</p> 

<p>Germination rates may be as high as 75% for Dalmatian toadflax [<a href="#57">57</a>]. Robocker 
[<a href="#87">87</a>] found that Dalmatian toadflax seeds germinated within a narrow temperature 
range, and that many seeds were carried over from year to year. Seeds germinated 
if they were not buried deeper than 1 inch (2.5 cm) in clay and loamy sand soil, 
and 1.2 inches (3 cm) in sandy soil [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>]. In the field, emergence of Dalmatian 
toadflax seeds usually occurs from depths less than 5 mm. Newly harvested 
Dalmatian toadflax seeds are usually dormant. Dormancy declines and germination
rates increase with seed age up to 5 to 
6 weeks after maturation. Of the Dalmatian toadflax seeds produced during the 
first 5 weeks of maturation, 67% germinated in October (about 3 months after 
collection). Low winter temperatures break dormancy [<a href="#87">87</a>]. Some Dalmatian toadflax seeds
germinate in fall, but most germinate in spring, with peaks in 
April and May [<a href="#57">57</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seedling establishment/growth:</b></font> 
Toadflax seedlings are vulnerable to dehydration, competition from other 
species, and certain control strategies.</p>

<p> Dalmatian toadflax seedlings died following rapid or extreme temperature changes or dehydration
in field and greenhouse studies. When Dalmatian toadflax seeds germinate in autumn, seedling 
survival the next year depends on sufficient spring and early summer 
precipitation, or a lack of competition from other plants. Dalmatian toadflax seedlings are easily outcompeted 
by established plants, especially perennial species [<a href="#87">87</a>], and also by cheatgrass 
on fertile soils. Conversely, cheatgrass does not compete well with established 
Dalmatian toadflax plants [<a href="#88">88</a>]. Cultivation or soil disturbance that removes 
perennial plants may increase Dalmatian toadflax seedling survival [<a href="#87">87</a>].</p>

<p>Grieshop and Nowierski [<a href="#32">32</a>] found, under the field conditions of their 2-year 
study, that Dalmatian toadflax populations filled most &quot;safe seedling emergence 
sites&quot; and seedling recruitment of Dalmatian toadflax was limited more by interspecific resource 
competition than by seed numbers. Because Dalmatian toadflax can produce enough seeds
to exceed potential emergence sites, and because Dalmatian toadflax plants reproduce
vegetatively, it appears that individual seedling recruitment in Dalmatian 
toadflax is more important for establishing new populations than it is for maintaining
established populations [<a href="#32">32</a>].</p>

<p>Similarly, vegetative reproduction in yellow toadflax is more important than 
seedling establishment for maintaining populations of yellow toadflax. Yellow toadflax can produce a large number 
of seeds. However, low viability and strong seed dormancy result in poor yellow 
toadflax seedling establishment, especially with competition. Once
established, yellow toadflax seedlings have a rapid rate 
of growth and vegetative spread, enabling them to colonize a suitable niche 
quickly when competitive stresses are low [<a href="#69">69</a>].</p>

<p>Yellow toadflax seedlings (genets) can produce daughter shoots (ramets) from vegetative
root buds as early as 3 weeks after cotyledon appearance. A single ramet or genet of 
yellow toadflax would be equally capable of initiating a new yellow toadflax infestation; however, 
young genets are highly susceptible to control techniques and crop competition in the first 3 
weeks of growth, while the larger root system of ramets may resist the 
effects of control treatments such as mowing and tillage. Tillage operations 
could readily spread toadflax infestations because of the ability of small portions of 
underground plant parts to produce new shoots [<a href="#70">70</a>]. It has been 
reported that a yellow toadflax patch with a radius of almost 3.3 feet (1 m) 
developed from a first-year seedling in 1 growing season, and  established 
patches can increase in diameter an average of 4 feet (1.2 m) per year 
in Saskatchewan [<a href="#95">95</a>].</p>

<p>Roots of Dalmatian toadflax seedlings grow an average of about 2 inches (6 cm) per week, with 
the uppermost primary branch tending to grow horizontally at depths of 0.8 to 4 
inches (2-10 cm) [<a href="#88">88</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Asexual regeneration: </b></font>
Toadflax can reproduce vegetatively by the formation of adventitious shoots from both the
tap and lateral roots, and from root fragments [<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>]; and can  sprout from 
buds in the axils of vestigial leaves at the bases of floral shoots when shoots 
are removed [<a href="#89">89</a>].</p>

<p>Vegetative reproduction is possible from toadflax root fragments as 
short as 0.4 inch (1 cm)&nbsp;and is common from fragments of 4 inches (10 cm). In Alberta, 
a 4-inch-long (10 cm) piece of yellow toadflax root with a 4-inch-high (10 cm) shoot produced a 
patch 3.3 to 6.6 feet (1-2 m) in diameter in one growing season, and produced an average of 75 or 
694 shoots, in barley (<i>Hordeum</i> spp.) or on fallow land, respectively. Seedlings appear to be  
important in initiating new yellow toadflax infestations in nonarable lands, while in arable land, 
root pieces can cling to farm implements, easily initiating new infestations [<a href="#68">68</a>].</p>

<p>A review by Saner and others [<a href="#95">95</a>] describes the mature root system of yellow 
toadflax as having &quot;long roots&quot; that are perennial and bear buds, and 
&quot;short roots&quot; that are annual. The rate of bud formation in yellow 
toadflax roots is highly variable, stimulated by exposure to light, and somewhat inhibited by soil disturbance. 
Vegetative reproduction from yellow toadflax root buds can begin as early as 2 to 3 
weeks after germination, and an extensive root system may develop within a 
single growing season. Yellow toadflax plants typically produce 90 to 100 secondary shoots from the root 
system in the 1st year and 200 to 250 shoots by the 
2nd year ([<a href="#95">95</a>] and references therein).</p>

<p>Established infestations of yellow toadflax appear to expand mainly by 
vegetative reproduction rather than by seed. Since the majority of yellow 
toadflax seed is dispersed within 6.6 feet (2 m) of the parent plant, and 
vegetative spread is common, this species is likely to spread by increasing 
individual patch size [<a href="#69">69</a>]. Distribution of toadflax patches may be influenced by competition. Nadeau 
and others [<a href="#68">68</a>] observed small clumps of shoots consistently appeared in a ring 
around the original yellow toadflax stand on fallow land, whereas in a barley 
crop clumping was reduced and shoots did not form a ring. Yellow toadflax 
produced 20 to 75 shoots in a 1.3- to 3.3-foot-diameter (0.4-1 m) patch when 
growing with barley, as compared with 197-694 stems in 3.3- to 6.6-foot-diameter 
(1-2 m) patch growing on fallow land in Alberta [<a href="#68">68</a>].</p>

<p>In studies in Pullman, Washington, persistence of Dalmatian toadflax was 
dependent on both yearly extension of lateral roots and establishment of new 
seedlings [<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>].</p>

Lajeunesse [<a href="#57">57</a>] suggests that a high degree of genetic variation in toadflax 
allows it to adapt to a wide variety of conditions. These species evolved in 
areas where much of the land is cultivated, and are adapted to the periodic 
disturbances of agriculture 
[<a href="#57">57</a>]. In North America, they are most commonly found on disturbed sites such as 
roadsides, fencelines, areas near dwellings, vacant lots, cemeteries, gravel pits, 
croplands, clearcuts, pastures, waste areas, and other disturbed sites where 
removal of vegetation allows toadflax seedlings to establish [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>]. Similarly, 
typical yellow toadflax habitats in Europe include vineyards, woodland 
clearings, and clearcuts. In Europe, large populations of yellow toadflax 
were observed on fields where competing vegetation was depressed by grazing or 
fire, and on some sites (e.g. between trees in orchards or in train yards) that 
had been subject to regular application of broad-action herbicides [<a href="#95">95</a>]. Dalmatian 
toadflax invasion is also encouraged by repeated grazing and  herbicide applications [<a href="#81">81</a>].

<p>Toadflax can also establish and spread in sparsely 
vegetated areas and sites with naturally-occurring disturbances, small 
openings, and/or little competition between species. Examples of such sites 
include dry, open areas in grassland and bunchgrass communities, sagebrush, open coniferous forests, 
sand dunes, riparian areas, and borders of woods (e.g. 
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>]).</p>

<p>Toadflax populations may establish but not spread widely into nearby natural 
areas. At a disturbed site in northern Manitoba, for example, yellow toadflax is among the 45% of introduced species that  persist after initial establishment,  as indicated by surveys done in 1959 and 
again in 1989. These yellow toadflax populations  reproduce vegetatively, but do not mature fruits during the short 
growing season. Yellow toadflax is completely absent from natural communities in the area, 
and rarely occurs away from points of introduction. It does 
occur away from these points    in the vicinity of human habitations or 
human disturbance (e.g. roadsides and railway tracks) [<a href="#101">101</a>]. This study site is near the northern limits of 
yellow toadflax's range (approximately 55<font face="Times New Roman">°</font> to 65<font face="Times New Roman">°</font> 
north latitude) [<a href="#95">95</a>].</p>

<p>Toadflax is most often found in well-drained, relatively coarse-textured 
soils varying from coarse gravels to sandy loams, but is  sometimes found in 
heavier soils in North America. Similarly, native Eurasian habitats of this 
species are predominantly sandy, gravelly, or rocky [<a href="#1">1</a>]. Dalmatian toadflax is highly competitive 
in areas where summers tend to be dry in 
the northwestern&nbsp; and intermountain areas of the U.S., particularly on 
south- and southeast-facing slopes [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>]. </p>

<p>In central Europe, yellow toadflax prefers dry to moderately humid sandy 
loam soils that are moderate to 
rich in nutrients and minerals. Yellow toadflax may  exhibit heavy metal tolerance. 
Yellow toadflax is 
more commonly associated with relatively summer-moist, coarse soils in the 
northwestern and north-central U.S. Yellow toadflax may grow well in moist areas of high fertility, 
but is more likely to be displaced by other species than on drier, less fertile sites. Yellow toadflax plants 
growing on dry sites are stunted but tend to be comparatively more persistent [<a href="#95">95</a>]. In many areas in 
North America, yellow toadflax is infrequent 
except in areas disturbed by cultivation [<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].</p>

Toadflax can readily establish on open and disturbed sites where competition 
from other plants is reduced [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>]. While individual crowns of toadflax are relatively short-lived (~4 
years), individual patches may persist for more than 13 years on some sites. 
Soil disturbance and freedom from competition are important for stand 
persistence. On some sites, stands may disappear for several years and then 
reestablish from either buried seeds or  vegetative buds [<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>].

<p>Dalmatian toadflax is often associated with several other nonnative, invasive species.
In ponderosa pine/Idaho fescue associations in northeastern Washington, grazing 
pressure can shift understory dominance from native grasses to cheatgrass, 
Dalmatian toadflax, and St. Johnswort (<i>Hypericum perforatum</i>), apparently irreversibly [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].
Dalmatian toadflax is competitive with cheatgrass in large parts of eastern Washington on the 
eastern edge of the Columbia Basin [<a href="#38">38</a>]. Dalmatian toadflax may be more tolerant of control methods, 
especially herbicides, than other species, and may therefore establish or spread following control 
attempts. In British Columbia, Dalmatian toadflax appears to be spreading as diffuse 
knapweed (<i>Centaurea diffusa</i>) and spotted knapweed 
are controlled [<a href="#40">40</a>]. Similarly, Dalmatian toadflax invaded sites where biological 
control has suppressed St. Johnswort on rangeland in Washington and Idaho [<a href="#114">114</a>].</p>

<p>Succession may also lead from toadflax dominance to dominance by other invasive species. Sites where 
Dalmatian toadflax 
has established in Washington, for example, may be susceptible to infestations by rush skeletonweed 
(<i>Chondrilla</i> <i>juncea</i>) [<a href="#73">73</a>].</p>

<p>While toadflax tends to be more common in open areas,
Dalmatian toadflax also tolerates moderate amounts of shade. At Yellowstone National Park, 
Dalmatian toadflax 
was found under a wide range of canopy cover, from 0 to 85%, although it was 
predominantly found under low canopy cover [<a href="#2">2</a>].</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT">
SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:</a>

<br />


Toadflax phenology can be variable, as it is dependent on environmental 
conditions.

<p>In early autumn, 1st-year Dalmatian toadflax plants often produce prostrate stems, forming a 
mat-like rosette that survives into the following spring. This &quot;rosette stage&quot; 
is important for carbohydrate 
storage. The following spring, floral stems grow from the prostrate stems. This sequence 
also occurs to a lesser degree in mature plants [<a href="#88">88</a>]. With 
the exception of these prostrate stems, top-growth dies back in the fall and is 
regenerated from the root system each spring [<a href="#57">57</a>].</p>

<p>Toadflax seedlings emerge both in spring and fall [<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>]. Dalmatian toadflax seedlings emerging 
in spring appear to have a higher survival 
rate than those emerging in fall [<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>]. In eastern Washington, 
Dalmatian toadflax emerges on south-facing 
slopes during the 1st or 2nd week in March through the 3rd week in April. 
Emergence on level ground occurs 2 to 3 weeks later, coinciding with 
soil temperatures of 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 <font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C) 
at a depth of 1 inch (2.5 cm) [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>]. Yellow toadflax seedling emergence begins in early to mid-May in Alberta [<a href="#69">69</a>], 
and earlier in warmer regions.</p>

<p>In northern Germany (also relevant to phenology in Canada), yellow toadflax vegetative shoots usually emerge in 
early to mid-April, when soil temperatures reach 42 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit (5-10
<font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C), and possibly in mid- to late March in warmer regions of the U.S. [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>]. 
Dalmatian toadflax plants observed  in eastern Washington 
fields developed floral stems only after a winter's dormancy and exposure to temperatures below 
68 degrees Fahrenheit (20
<font face="Times New Roman">°</font>C). Floral stems emerge a few days later 
than seedlings in the spring [<a href="#88">88</a>]. Weak floral stems and some seed can be 
produced by 1st-year seedlings [<a href="#87">87</a>].</p>

<p>Flowering of Dalmatian toadflax begins in May or June and continues until August 
or October, but can occur earlier in warm seasons or warm habitats [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>].
When flowering stems of yellow toadflax are 16 to 24 inches (40-60 cm) tall, branching 
begins, which signals the beginning of flower bud formation [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>]. In northern 
Germany, yellow toadflax flower buds occur at the end of June, flowering begins mid-July, and the peak of 
flowering is at the end of July. On warm sites in Canada, flowering may begin in mid-June [<a href="#95">95</a>].</p>

<p>Dalmatian toadflax seed production  begins in late June or early July and continues until 
September or early October in northern climates. Toadflax seed dispersal may begin on lower portions of the 
stem while flower buds are still forming on upper 
portions. Dalmatian toadflax seed dispersal begins as early as July in northern climates and 
continues into winter [<a href="#88">88</a>]. In a greenhouse study in Washington, most seeds were 
produced between late July and early September, and about 97% of seeds were 
produced in the first 5 weeks of production [<a href="#87">87</a>]. Yellow toadflax seed dispersal 
begins in August or September in northern climates and continues into winter 
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>]. In a study in 
Alberta, yellow toadflax capsules were formed and open by early August, when stem height was 
up to 3.3 feet (1 m), and seed shed started 2 weeks later. The majority of seed was 
shed between late September and October [<a href="#69">69</a>].</p>

Yellow toadflax ramets die at freezing temperatures but the stronger stems, including some fruit capsules, 
may remain erect. Some seeds may remain in the fruit capsule until strong winds occur or until the stem falls 
over [<a href="#95">95</a>]. Dried floral stalks can remain standing for 2 years, 
retaining some seeds but dispersing most during the 1st year [<a href="#88">88</a>].

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font> 
Toadflax has a deep and extensive perennial, sprouting root system that is likely to allow it to survive even 
severe fire. Toadflax is also capable of establishing either from on-site seed, 
or seed dispersed into a burned area. Seed may be dispersed by 
animals into recently burned areas where it is adapted to establish under 
conditions of reduced competition. It is unclear what the effects of fire are on 
toadflax seed.

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font> 
Dalmatian toadflax occurs in ecosystems with historic fire regimes of varied frequency and 
severity; from frequent, low-severity fires in ponderosa pine ecosystems, to 
less frequent and more severe fires in bunchgrass and sagebrush ecosystems, to 
frequent and severe fires in plains and prairie grassland ecosystems. Yellow 
toadflax occurs primarily in 
agricultural communities in the western U.S. and throughout Canada, and in 
disturbed areas in the north-central and northeastern U.S. A variety of native 
plant communities once dominated these areas, and historic fire regimes have been 
dramatically altered.</p>

<p>Toadflax was not widespread in these communities when historic fire regimes 
were functioning, but has established since habitat alteration and fire exclusion began. It is 
unclear how historic fire regimes might affect toadflax populations, and it is 
unclear how the presence of toadflax in native ecosystems might affect fire 
regimes.</p>

<p>In general, in ecosystems where toadflax replaces plants similar to itself 
(in terms of fuel characteristics), it may alter fire intensity or slightly 
modify an existing fire regime. However, if toadflax is  qualitatively 
unique to the invaded ecosystem, it has the potential to completely alter the 
fire regime [<a href="#15">15</a>]. No examples of fire regimes altered by toadflax invasion are

Toadflax is likely to be top killed by fire, however its deep, extensive root 
system is likely to survive even severe fire and allow reestablishment of the 
population from vegetative buds on roots. Many root-sprouting plants, including toadflax, have high fire survival rates, 
regardless of burn severity. This is because even the most severe fires 
typically damage roots only to 4 inches (10 cm) below the soil [<a href="#29">29</a>], and toadflax roots typically 
penetrate the soil to a depth of several feet.<p>There is little information 
available regarding the direct effects of fire on toadflax plants, and no information available regarding heat 
or fire effects on toadflax seed.

Toadflax is able to recover after fire and may even be promoted by fire, 
especially if other 
species are reduced. The postfire environment is well suited to toadflax 
establishment by seed.

<p>Three sites in big sagebrush-bluebunch wheatgrass communities in western Montana 
were burned under prescription in mid-March to reduce shrubs and trees. Dalmatian toadflax 
density, cover, biomass per square meter, per plant biomass and per plant seed 
production were measured on burned plots and immediately adjacent unburned plots 
6 months after burning. Dalmatian toadflax density and cover were not different 
between burned and unburned plots. Biomass of Dalmatian toadflax per square 
meter varied depending on site, while biomass per plant was significantly higher 
(p&gt;0.05) on all burned plots compared with unburned plots. Burning also 
significantly increased (p&gt;0.05) Dalmatian toadflax seed production per plant at 
all 3 sites. Seed production ranged from 7 to 79 seeds per plant on unburned 
plots, and from 158 to 1,328 seeds per plant on burned plots [<a href="#44">44</a>].</p>

Response of toadflax to fire may depend on site characteristics and the fire 
adaptations of other species in the plant community. Most reviews suggest that 
toadflax is likely to increase or to be unaffected by fire (e.g. [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>]). Several 
studies provide examples of toadflax establishment following fire [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>]. 

<p>A study in south-central New York designed to investigate the effects of 
accidental spring fires on the vegetation and soils of native plant communities 
found that yellow toadflax cover in quaking aspen groves was not significantly different (p&lt;0.05) 
between burned and unburned stands. The authors suggested that toadflax is a 
neutral species with regard to fire [<a href="#105">105</a>].</p>

<p>Other studies suggest that toadflax is negatively affected by fire (e.g. [<a href="#71">71</a>]), although experimental evidence is lacking.
Percent cover of yellow toadflax decreased 2 growing seasons after spring prescribed fire 
on 2 study sites in Buena Vista Marsh, Wisconsin. Percent cover was recorded as 
follows [<a href="#36">36</a>]:</p>

FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>

<font face="Bell MT">

<b>Fire as a control agent:</b></font>
Burning is not usually a recommended or effective control method for toadflax, 
because root buds and buried seeds are unaffected by fire, and burning may 
increase competitiveness of toadflax by removing desirable plants [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>]. Removal of 
toadflax top-growth may even stimulate production of vegetative shoots [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].  Nonetheless, 
Nernberg [<a href="#71">71</a>] describes a mixed-grass prairie 
restoration program in Saskatchewan in which &quot;appropriately timed&quot; prescribed 
burning is used to control growth and eliminate seed production in yellow 
toadflax and other 
nonnative invasive species; although no specific details or results are provided.</p>

<p>Scorching of floral stalks using propane burners can help prevent toadflax seed production [<a href="#57">57</a>].</p>

<p>Prescribed fire can be used as a management tool on some sites in an effort to 
restore historic fire regimes and promote desirable species. The disturbance 
created by fire may, however, favor many invasive species. At the time of this 
writing, there are ongoing studies in 
western Montana designed to test the effects of prescribed fire combined with 
herbicide application to control 
Dalmatian toadflax 
and other invasive species [<a href="#85">85</a>]. Herbicides may prevent 
domination by invasive species after fire in the short term; however, they also affect 
nontarget forbs that can compete with invasive species [<a href="#45">45</a>].</p>

<p>On a big sagebrush-bluebunch wheatgrass site in western Montana, Jacobs and 
Sheley [<a href="#45">45</a>] tested the effects of prescribed burning with 
and without herbicide application on density, cover, and biomass of Dalmatian 
toadflax and native forbs as well as species richness, diversity, and evenness. Herbicides 
(picloram at 0.56 kg a.i./ha, and chlorsulfuron at 0.075 kg a.i./ha) were 
applied in October (prior to burning) and April (after burning). Burning was 
conducted in April. They found that fire effectively killed nearly all trees on 
the test plots (primary objective of prescribed burning), but did not affect 
species richness, diversity, or evenness. One season after burning, the biomass 
and cover of toadflax, but not its density, were 2 times greater on burned plots 
than on unburned plots. All herbicide treatments reduced biomass, cover, and 
density of Dalmatian toadflax to 90% of the control. Chlorsulfuron decreased overall forb 
biomass to 50% of the control, while picloram decreased forb biomass to nearly 0. Both herbicides 
reduced richness and diversity, but not evenness. 
Timing of herbicide application made no difference in toadflax control or 
diversity indices, although spring application resulted in higher grass 
production. The authors conclude that using an herbicide such as chlorsulfuron 
may provide short-term control of Dalmatian toadflax. However, the combination of open niches 
left by forbs killed by herbicides, trees and shrubs killed by fire, and pressure on 
grasses by wildlife leaves sites susceptible to reestablishment of Dalmatian 
toadflax from the soil seed bank [<a href="#45">45</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Postfire colonization potential:</b></font> 
Because of its propensity to establish in dry, open areas with little plant competition, 
toadflax has high potential for 
establishing after fire (when competition from other vegetation is removed or 
reduced) either by seed imported to the site or by soil-stored 
seed. Several examples follow where toadflax established following fire. It is 
not clear in any of these examples whether  toadflax plants or seeds were on-site 
prior to burning.</p>

<p>Two fire case studies near Flagstaff, Arizona, (Chimney Spring and Limestone 
Flat) were established to determine a burning 
interval that would adequately manipulate fuels and stocking of a ponderosa pine 
stand so that it could survive wildfire. The initial objective 
was to reduce fuel loads by 
reintroducing fire in areas where it had long been suppressed and fuels had 
accumulated. The fire at Chimney Spring reduced forest floor fuels by 63%, compared to a 42% reduction of forest 
floor fuel at Limestone Flat. In both places, several invasive species were 
abundant after fire, including Dalmatian toadflax, common mullein (<i>Verbascum thapsus</i>), and thistle 
(<i>Cirsium pulchellum</i>). Common mullein and Dalmatian toadflax were dominant on heavily burned sites 
around large, old-growth trees that have died since the initial burns [<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>].&nbsp; Similarly,
Kyle [<a href="#54">54</a>] observed several sites in northern Arizona where large-scale, 
high-severity fires have burned over the past 4 decades and noted that many of 
these areas are  dominated by nonnative plants such as cheatgrass, smooth brome (<i>Bromus 
inermis</i>), sweetclover (<i>Melilotus</i> spp.), orchardgrass (<i>Dactylis glomerata</i>), perennial ryegrass 
(<i>Lolium perenne</i>), and Dalmatian toadflax.</p>

<p>In ponderosa pine forest sites in northern Arizona in 1989, prescribed burning 
was conducted to investigate its effects on the rare 
plant, Flagstaff pennyroyal (<i>Hedeoma diffusum</i>). Dalmatian toadflax was not noted prior to burning or 
during counts from 1989 to 1995; but in 2000 it had invaded all of the spring 
burn plots, the control plot (which was adjacent to the spring burn plots), and 
none of the fall burn plots. It is unclear whether it was present prior to the 
initiation of the study, or if it was introduced during fire line construction, or 
following burning; however, it had not yet invaded the area surrounding 
the burn study area where grasses were very dense. The authors urge caution and 
awareness of Dalmatian toadflax and other weed species when prescribing fire treatments [<a href="#76">76</a>].</p>

<p>Yellow toadflax was found in a jack pine-lichen woodland of the upper boreal forest in northern 
Quebec, 2 years after wildfire [<a href="#100">100</a>].</p>

<p>Toadflax invasion after fire may also be related to soil disturbances brought 
about through fire suppression activities. For example, after a wildfire and 
suppression activities in Glacier National Park, Montana, Dalmatian toadflax was 
found in trace amounts in bulldozed areas, but was not present in either burned 
or undisturbed areas [<a href="#8">8</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Preventing postfire establishment and spread:</b></font>
The USDA Forest Service's &quot;Guide to Noxious Weed Prevention Practices&quot; [<a href="#109">109</a>] provides 
several fire management considerations for  preventing 
establishment of invasive species that apply to toadflax.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Preventing invasive plants from establishing in weed-free burned areas is 
the most effective and least costly management method. This can be 
accomplished through early detection and eradication by careful monitoring, and by limiting invasive 
plant seed dispersal into the burned area by [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>]:</p>

adjacent to burned areas to prevent or limit seed 
dispersal into the site [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>]</p>

<p>Revegetation necessity can be based on the degree of desirable vegetation 
displaced by invasive plants prior to burning and on postfire survival of 
desirable vegetation. Revegetation necessity can also be related to invasive 
plant survival as viable seeds, root crowns, or rhizomes capable of 
reproduction. In general, postfire revegetation should be considered when 
desirable vegetation cover is less than about 30% [<a href="#29">29</a>]. </p>

<p>When prefire cover of toadflax is absent to low (and has been so for 10 or 
more years- i.e. no seeds in the seed bank), and prefire cover of desirable 
vegetation is high, revegetation is probably not necessary after low- and medium-severity burns. 
After a high-severity burn on a site in this condition, 
revegetation may be necessary (depending on postfire survival of desirable 
species), and intensive monitoring for invasive plant establishment is necessary 
to detect and eradicate newly established invasives before they spread [<a href="#29">29</a>].</p>

<p>When prefire cover of toadflax is moderate (20 to 79%) to high (80-100%), 
revegetation may be necessary after fire of any severity if desired vegetation 
cover is less than about 30%. Toadflax plants are likely to survive even severe 
fires, so intense weed management is also recommended, especially after fires of 
moderate to high severity [<a href="#29">29</a>].</p>

<p>Fall dormant broadcast seeding into  ash will cover and retain seeds. If there is insufficient ash, 
seedbed preparation may be necessary. A seed mix should contain  quick-establishing grasses 
and forbs (exclude forbs if broadleaf herbicides are anticipated) that can 
effectively occupy available niches. Managers can enhance the 
success of revegetation (natural or artificial) by excluding livestock until 
vegetation is well established (at least 2 growing seasons)&nbsp;[<a href="#29">29</a>].</p>

When planning a prescribed burn, managers should preinventory the project area 
and evaluate cover and phenology of any toadflax present on or adjacent 
to the site, and avoid ignition and burning in areas at high risk for toadflax establishment or 
spread due to fire effects. Avoid creating soil 
conditions that promote weed germination and establishment. Discuss weed status 
and risks in burn rehabilitation plans. Also, wildfire managers might consider 
including weed prevention education and providing weed identification aids 
during fire training; avoiding known weed infestations when locating fire lines; 
monitoring camps, staging areas, helibases, etc., to be sure they are kept weed 
free; taking care that equipment is weed free; incorporating weed prevention 
into fire rehabilitation plans; and acquiring restoration funding. Additional 
guidelines and specific recommendations and requirements are available [<a href="#109">109</a>].

IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Very little information is available regarding the use of toadflax by livestock and 
wildlife. A review by Lajeunesse [<a href="#57">57</a>] notes that Dalmatian toadflax 
and yellow toadflax evolved in plant communities that are grazed moderately to 
intensely, primarily by domestic sheep and goats and to a lesser extent by cattle. 
Cattle will sometimes casually browse flowering shoots, while domestic sheep will use 
Dalmatian toadflax 
as a major food source [<a href="#57">57</a>]. Domestic sheep and goats have been used to control toadflax [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>].

<p>A review by Saner and others [<a href="#95">95</a>] points out 
that several secondary compounds present in yellow toadflax may 
explain why cattle avoid it. It contains glycosides that may be insecticidally active, 
flowers contain flavonoids, and seeds contain saponins. This review also 
indicates that cattle eat 
dried yellow toadflax, that yellow toadflax is not generally poisonous to 
livestock, and that it has been used as a medicinal plant 
for cattle that cannot ruminate [<a href="#95">95</a>]. According to Mitich [<a href="#65">65</a>], occasional cases of mild poisoning 
from yellow toadflax have been reported for cattle, but such cases are rare because 
cattle usually avoid toadflax.</p>

<p>Uresk and Lowrey [<a href="#112">112</a>] found no evidence through fecal 
analysis that cattle consumed yellow toadflax in an area where it was abundant. Estimates of 
toadflax use by cattle may be inaccurate if identified by microhistological analysis, since the 
toadflax epidermis apparently does not survive the 
slide making process [<a href="#94">94</a>].</p>

<p>Although deer have been observed to graze Dalmatian toadflax, and toadflax seed is 
used by some species of birds and rodents, it is not known to be heavily used by 
any native animal species [<a href="#87">87</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Palatability/nutritional value:</b></font> 
Toadflax is usually avoided by cattle as it is said to be distasteful, or mildly 
poisonous [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Cover value:</font></b> 
Toadflax can provide cover for small animals [<a href="#57">57</a>].</p>



<span class="subframeName">
<a name="OTHER USES">
OTHER USES:</a>
</span>
<br />

Yellow toadflax is used in folk medicine and homeopathy; as an insecticide; as a yellow dye; 
and as a plant of religious and magical attributes [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].

<p>Yellow toadflax is said to be useful to prevent erosion, and in reclamation of mined areas, 
sites despoiled by dumping of heavy metal-laden sewage sludge, and abandoned 
gravel pit slopes [<a href="#95">95</a>].</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="IMPACTS AND CONTROL">
IMPACTS AND CONTROL:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Impacts:</b></font> 
Toadflax can be a serious agricultural weed that is favored by reduced-tillage farming methods, is 
resistant to many herbicides, and provides over-wintering sites for cucumber 
mosaic virus and broad bean wilt virus in New York [<a href="#95">95</a>]. 

<p>Its impacts in wildlands and natural areas are not as clear. Like any invasive 
plant, it can displace plant communities and associated animal life. This can 
result in a loss of forage in pastures and rangelands that can impact livestock 
and some big game species, especially on winter ranges. Where 
sod-forming or bunchgrass communities are replaced by toadflax, soil erosion, 
surface runoff, and sediment yield can be increased. However, on harsh, sparsely 
vegetated sites toadflax can actually help stabilize soil [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].</p>
<p>In a survey of ranchers and farmers in north-central Idaho, 1% of respondents 
perceived Dalmatian toadflax as a moderate threat in 1982, and none perceived it as a problem in 
1988 [<a href="#10">10</a>]. Toadflax can, however, spread rapidly, and it is 
important to eradicate infestations while they are still small in order to 
contain their spread [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>]. For example, Dalmatian toadflax was introduced at a mine 
site in the 1970s on private land adjacent 
to the Raymond Mountain Wilderness Study Area in Wyoming. From this site, 
Dalmatian toadflax spread 
over 15 years to cover a 10-mile radius in the wilderness area and adjacent 
private land [<a href="#120">120</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Control:</b></font> 
Keys to successful control of toadflax are prevention of seed production, depleting root reserves, and killing 
seedlings before vegetative reproduction begins (within 2-3 weeks of germination) 
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>]. Reducing seed production may limit 
the spread of toadflax, although is not likely to result in a reduction of 
toadflax stand size or density because of vigorous vegetative reproduction. 
Reduction of toadflax stand size or density 
is more likely achieved by reducing the number of stems, limiting toadflax stem and lateral root-bud 
production, and encouraging desirable plant populations that 
provide strong competition for resources [<a href="#32">32</a>].</p>

<p>The diverse geographic range of toadflax throughout North America and its 
genetic variability result in localized populations that can respond differently to 
the same management methods and environmental conditions. Determining the most effective and economical 
control methods for a particular toadflax 
population will require annual monitoring, mapping, evaluation, and follow-up 
treatments. In this way, site-specific management efforts can be adjusted to determine the best combination of 
control strategies for a particular site [<a href="#57">57</a>].</p>

<p>Monitoring treatment areas is best done when toadflax plants have formed buds 
and are beginning to flower (around early June in most areas). Many control techniques 
are  most effective at this time because root carbohydrate reserves are at 
their lowest, which makes it more difficult for  root systems to recover. 
Follow-up work within the first 2 months of initial treatment (in late June or 
early July) is recommended to locate and remove any late-flowering plants 
[<a href="#11">11</a>].</p>

<p>Because toadflax occurs and is competitive with several other invasive species 
(e.g. [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>]), management to control 
it and/or  other species must consider the possibility of succession to 
an equally undesirable species when plants are removed [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><font size="4">Prevention:</font> </font>
Because toadflax species are expensive, labor-intensive, and difficult to manage once  
established, preventing infestations is the most time- and cost-effective 
management approach. This is accomplished by maintaining desirable plant communities, by 
preventing toadflax seeds and root pieces from entering uninfested areas, and by careful 
monitoring for and early eradication of newly established plants. This is especially 
important  where toadflax is common in areas around the management 
site, especially along roads, trails, and rivers (e.g. [<a href="#81">81</a>]).</p>

<p>Maintain desirable plant communities by limiting spring grazing (since 
toadflax seedlings can more effectively compete with grazed plants), minimizing 
soil disturbance, and  seeding disturbed sites with desirable species 
(see the <a href="fire_effects.html#FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">Fire Management Considerations</a> and 
<a href="#Cultural:">Cultural control</a> sections of this report) [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].</p>

<p>Prevent seeds and root pieces from entering uninfested areas as follows [<a href="#57">57</a>]:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p class="subframeText"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">
     Check and clean equipment before moving it into uninfested areas or before bringing it from infested areas</font></li>
  <li><p class="subframeText"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">
     When moving livestock from infested to uninfested areas, hold them in corrals or small pastures until viable 
     seeds have had time to pass through the digestive tract (6 days for cattle, 11 days for sheep)</font></li>
  <li><p class="subframeText"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">
     Monitor for toadflax seedling establishment in livestock holding areas and areas where fill dirt has been imported</font></li>
  <li><p class="subframeText"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">
     Avoid purchasing feed or seed that could be contaminated with weed seeds</font></li>
</ul>

<p>Toadflax is a common roadside weed. Prevention of its establishment (and the 
establishment of many other invasive species) requires that road construction 
projects be avoided whenever possible, especially in nature reserves. When 
unavoidable, road construction projects should be treated and funded as 10- to 20-year 
biological projects rather than 1- to 2-year engineering projects, with 
biologists and resource managers overseeing road construction. Projects should 
not be considered complete until native vegetation is fully established. Topsoil 
removed during construction can be redeposited in roadside ditches, and 
roadsides reseeded with native species. Roadsides should then be regularly 
monitored and actively managed for control and eradication of nonnative 
species [<a href="#107">107</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Integrated management:</font> 
Successful management of toadflax  requires integrating as many management strategies as possible. 
Management programs for toadflax should emphasize both the prevention of seed formation and 
vegetative spread [<a href="#57">57</a>].</p>

<p><font size="4"><font face="Bell MT">Physical/mechanical:</font></font> 
Removal of the aboveground portion of toadflax 
plants can eliminate seed production for that year (if done in spring or early 
summer, before seed set), and reduce the current year's growth, but it will not 
kill them. Removal each year for 5 or 6 years may be necessary to deplete the 
remaining root system of reserves, and 10 to 15 years may be required to remove seedlings 
produced from dormant seeds. Hand-pulling, mowing, and tillage can be effective 
in preventing seed production and starving toadflax roots, thereby controlling infestations under certain conditions 
only if done repeatedly and/or in combination with other control methods [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].</p>

<p>Pulling toadflax by hand can 
effectively  remove seedlings and small 
infestations and limit spread of large infestations by pulling around patch 
perimeters. Pulling is most effective in sandy or moist soils, because more root 
length can be removed. It is important to pull as much of the root as possible 
and to follow lateral roots to their ends [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>]. Managers at several nature preserves 
in Colorado, Idaho, and Oregon have used 
hand-pulling to remove toadflax and keep infestations from spreading. Most say 
that early treatment, removal of as much of the roots as possible, and persistence 
for several years are important for hand-pulling to be 
effective [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]</p>

<p>A decade-long hand-pulling experiment at Magnusson Butte Preserve, Washington, demonstrates the 
effectiveness of repeated hand-pulling. The 
experiment was begun in a 5 by 5 meter test plot, and was then 
expanded to the entire 28-acre preserve. During the 1st week of June, a team of 
about 30 volunteers walked the preserve pulling all toadflax plants found. 
At this time, flowers were beginning to appear making plants easier to locate, 
and soils were still moist, making plants easier to pull with minimal soil 
disturbance. In the beginning, stems were removed in bags to avoid a mulching effect on 
desirable native plants, but in later years when there were fewer plants they 
were dropped in place with no ill effect. A follow-up visit was conducted during 
the last week in June to remove any late-flowering plants that might have been 
missed. Teams were able to reduce the number of flowering stems each year by an 
estimated 90-95% preserve-wide. In the 3rd year, it was noticed that flowering 
stems were not only reduced in number, but were  smaller in size 
and lower in vigor [<a href="#11">11</a>].</p>

<p>Mowing and cutting of toadflax may be used to help decrease seed production, 
but will not eliminate toadflax stands [<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>]. Cutting flowering stems 
every year for several successive years can stress plants and help control 
infestations [<a href="#51">51</a>]. Mowing and cutting are usually not recommended, because they 
do not prevent root growth or affect buried seed [<a href="#57">57</a>]. Cutting may even 
contribute to stand longevity by stimulating dormant buds in the axils of 
vestigial leaves at the bases of cut floral shoots, as was observed in Dalmatian 
toadflax in Washington [<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>]. Considerable secondary and tertiary branching 
can occur following injury to the main stem [<a href="#1">1</a>]. Mowing may be less effective than 
cutting since plants that are cut several inches above the soil surface may  sprout more rapidly. In addition, 
mowing may seriously damage desirable plants and is usually not feasible or 
desirable in natural areas [<a href="#11">11</a>].</p>

<p>Consistent, intensive, clean cultivation for at least 2 years 
with 8 to 10 cultivations the 1st year and 4 to 5 cultivations the 2nd year, 
will control toadflax (reviews by [<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>]). Care 
must be taken not to transport toadflax root pieces to clean fields, as root pieces as short as 1 cm 
long can sprout new plants and expand rapidly [<a href="#68">68</a>]. Seedlings less than 2-3 weeks old are particularly susceptible to tillage 
since, at this stage, vegetative reproduction has not started [<a href="#95">95</a>]. Tillage is generally inappropriate for natural areas.</p>

<p>Several insect species  that feed on toadflax have been purposely or 
accidentally released in the U.S. and Canada. Flower feeding beetles (<i>Brachypterolus pulicarius</i> 
and <i>Gymnetron antirrhini</i>) appear to be the most important insects for 
reducing seed production in toadflax. <i>B. pulicarius </i>larvae develop inside 
floral ovaries, and adults feed on buds and young stems. <i>B. pulicarius</i> can reduce seed production 
in yellow toadflax by 80 to 90%, and by 43 to 93% in Dalmatian toadflax [<a href="#33">33</a>]. <i>G. antirrhini </i>
can reduce seed production in yellow toadflax by 85-90% [<a href="#72">72</a>]. A 
stem-boring weevil (<i>Mecinus janthinus</i>), whose larvae  and 
adults feed on shoots of both toadflax species, seems to be the most promising biocontrol 
agent for toadflax as of this writing [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>].  Of the biocontrol agents listed for 
toadflax, the toadflax moth 
(<i>Calophasia lunula</i>) is not suggested for redistribution since it attacks native 
snapdragons in California [<a href="#108">108</a>].</p>

<p>Domestic sheep and goats have been used to control toadflax [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>]. Preliminary results of 
field trials in Montana show that domestic sheep can help suppress stands of Dalmatian toadflax and limit seed 
production. In these studies, 1,000 ewes and lambs were placed in a hilly 
rangeland area of moderate to heavy infestations of Dalmatian toadflax (densities of 25 to 100% of the vegetation). 
Approximately 35 to 45% of toadflax foliage was stripped, including the terminal 6 to 10 inches 
(15-25 cm) of plant stems. Although domestic sheep only nibbled the plants 
initially, within 2 to 3 weeks they were consuming Dalmatian toadflax regularly, even though other forage was 
present. In these studies, the sheep did well and showed acceptable weight gain ([<a href="#57">57</a>] 
and references therein).</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Chemical:</font> 
Tu and others [<a href="#106">106</a>] provide information and 
considerations for chemical control of invasive species in general, and detailed 
information on individual chemicals and adjuvants in their Weed Control Methods 
Handbook. Carpenter and Murray [<a href="#11">11</a>] provide detailed 
information on chemical control of toadflax, including contacts 
for authorities on each of the chemicals discussed. These documents can be 
accessed through The Nature Conservancy's
<a href="http://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/index.html">Wildland Invasive Species Program</a> 
website.</p>

<p>Lajeunesse [<a href="#57">57</a>] suggests that chemical control of toadflax is 
complicated by the plant's high genetic variability, the waxy leaf surface that can 
hinder herbicide uptake, and coarse soils (in which toadflax is often found) 
that can allow herbicides to leach below the root zone. Even when chemical 
control appears  effective, reinvasion by toadflax may occur from buried 
seed. Where herbicides appear effective, it is necessary to treat an infestation 
every 3 to 4 years for as long as 12 years [<a href="#57">57</a>]. Permanent, long-term control 
of toadflax cannot be achieved with herbicide treatment alone ([<a href="#95">95</a>] 
and references therein).</p>

<p>Triclopyr, fluroxypyr, 2,4-D, MCPA, 2,4-DB,  MCPB, and mecoprop are ineffective for toadflax control 
([<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>] and references therein). Glyphosate did not 
effectively control toadflax, but did kill neighboring plants, thereby giving toadflax the 
competitive advantage [<a href="#81">81</a>]. Effective herbicides for Dalmatian toadflax include 
chlorsulfuron (results for 1-2 years) [<a href="#45">45</a>], dicamba (results 
for 1 year),  picloram (although it is ineffective on some sites), and imazapic ([<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>] and references therein).</p>

<p>Picloram at the rate of 1.5 to 2 lb a.i. per acre, is purported to be the most 
effective herbicide treatment for Dalmatian toadflax in Montana, although it will not usually 
provide complete control [<a href="#55">55</a>], and it may also harm desirable 
plants. </p>

<p>Sebastian and Beck [<a href="#97">97</a>] measured percent control of Dalmatian toadflax and 
percent injury to crested wheatgrass (<i>Agropyron cristatum</i>) in plots treated with various rates of picloram, fluorxypyr, 
and a mix of the 2 chemicals applied at different time/growth stages for 3 
years after application. Better control was achieved with lower rates of picloram (0.5 lb a.i./acre), 
possibly because there was less injury to competing wheatgrass at the lower 
rates. Fluroxypyr resulted in no control when applied alone, and did not improve control rates 
when mixed with picloram over picloram alone [<a href="#97">97</a>].</p>

<p>The reduction of desirable nontarget species by picloram may be 
unacceptably high at application rates recommended for toadflax control. At much lower rates (0.28 kg a.i./ha), 
fall applications of picloram depressed species 
richness and diversity on rough fescue grassland (<i>Festuca </i>spp.) and early 
seral Douglas-fir/snowberry forest (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>/<i>Symphoricarpos 
albus</i>) treated to control spotted knapweed in western Montana. In these 
cases species diversity recovered to untreated levels within 3 years of the initial 
applications, and the authors described these effects as &quot;small and transitory.&quot; 
Spring applications, however, caused depressions in diversity 
that persisted through the last year of sampling (6 years after initial 
application) [<a href="#84">84</a>]. Similarly, applications of picloram at 0.56 kg a.i./ha (in 
combination with prescribed burning) to control Dalmatian toadflax on big 
sagebrush-bluebunch wheatgrass sites in southwestern Montana reduced biomass, cover, 
and density of Dalmatian toadflax to 90% of the control, and decreased overall 
forb biomass to nearly 100% of the control. Applications of chlorsulfuron had 
similar effects on Dalmatian toadflax in this study, but slightly less negative impact on native 
forbs. The authors conclude that while herbicides may help provide short-term 
control on burned rangeland, the combination of forb reduction, open niches from 
burned trees and shrubs, and pressure on grass from wildlife may leave sites 
susceptible to reestablishment of toadflax from the soil seed bank [<a href="#45">45</a>].</p>

<p>An experiment to determine the effects of 6 different herbicides at 3 rates 
on established spotted knapweed populations indicated that all rates reduced 
spotted knapweed biomass by 95-100%. However, suppression of 
spotted knapweed with clopyralid allowed yellow toadflax to become the dominant plant in 
those treatment areas. Picloram appeared to suppress yellow toadflax to 
some degree, as it did not become dominant in picloram treated plots [<a href="#58">58</a>]. 
Similarly, it appears that some agricultural herbicides encourage Dalmatian toadflax in Washington [<a href="#81">81</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><font size="4"><a name="Cultural:">Cultural:</a></font></font>
Vigorous, healthy plant communities can often outcompete toadflax seedlings and thus 
prevent their establishment. In areas where toadflax is already established, 
initial toadflax control should be followed by establishment of well-adapted, 
desirable plant species that provide competition throughout the season at all levels of the 
soil-root profile. This can  provide longer-term 
suppression. Proper grazing management to maintain the competitive ability of 
these plant communities is important for long-term control of toadflax [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].</p>

<p>Communities that are in good condition may recover without replanting  desirable species 
as long as follow-up control is conducted annually. 
Increases in native and nonnative annual grasses, forbs, and residual native 
perennial forbs were observed following toadflax removal at Magnusson Butte 
Preserve in Washington. However, replanting native grasses and forbs can help 
accelerate recovery of an area [<a href="#11">11</a>].</p>

Rose and others [<a href="#91">91</a>] tested 5 grasses ('Hycrest' crested 
wheatgrass (<i>Agropyron cristatum</i>), 'Luna' pubescent wheatgrass 
(intermediate wheatgrass (<i>Thinopyrum intermedium</i>)), 'Critana' thickspike 
wheatgrass (<i>Elymus lanceolatus</i>), 'Bozoisky' Russian wildrye (<i>Psathyrostachys 
juncea</i>), and 'Sodar' streambank wheatgrass (<i>Elymus lanceolatus</i>)) for 
their competitive ability against Dalmatian toadflax. They began by spraying the area (a dry, 
disturbed grassland site invaded by Dalmatian toadflax) with picloram in the fall, 
then rototilled and seeded the following April and August. Areas seeded in the 
spring to crested wheatgrass, intermediate wheatgrass, and thickspike wheatgrass 
showed significant (p&lt;0.05) reductions of Dalmatian toadflax. The August seeding did not 
establish as quickly as the April seeding, but by the 3rd year, late summer 
seedings were all equal to or greater in competition than those established in 
spring. Dalmatian toadflax production (above ground dry weight) was greater in control plots than in plots seeded with 
thickspike, pubescent (intermediate), and crested wheatgrasses. Production of 
Dalmatian toadflax in areas seeded with streambank wheatgrass and Russian wildrye did not differ 
from production in unseeded controls. Each grass has characteristics that make 
it desirable in different situations, and areas to be revegetated should be 
assessed to determine which grasses would be most suitable depending on soil 
types, moisture level and use. Russian wildrye, intermediate wheatgrass, and 
crested wheatgrass are all nonnative species [<a href="#91">91</a>] and some of these are invasive 
in natural areas.
