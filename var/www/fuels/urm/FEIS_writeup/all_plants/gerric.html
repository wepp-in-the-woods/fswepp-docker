<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Richardson's geranium occurs in a wide variety of forested habitat
types, as well as grassland, meadow, alpine, and riparian zones
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].

Richardson's geranium occurs in both climax and seral communities.  It
is a member of the giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum)-mixed
conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada of California [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Richardson's
geranium is abundant in the true pinyon-Rocky Mountain juniper (Pinus
edulis-Juniperus scopulorum) habitat type of Utah [<a href="#14">14</a>].  It is an
important understory species in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa),
subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii),
blue spruce (P. pungens), white fir (A. concolor), and Douglas-fir
(Pseudotsuga menziesii) habitat types of Arizona and New Mexico
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Richardson's geranium is a common understory species in
subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce habitat types of the Intermountain
West [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].

</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Richardson's geranium is a valuable forage species for livestock, deer
and elk [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  It provides forage for mule deer in wet meadows of Utah
[<a href="#12">12</a>].  In mixed conifer forests of Arizona, Richardson's geranium is an
important forage species for deer and elk on logged and unlogged sites
[<a href="#55">55</a>].  In Montana, Richardson's geranium is utilized by deer, elk,
pronghorn, upland game birds, passerine birds, waterfowl, and small
mammals [<a href="#9">9</a>].  


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability of Richardson's geranium is rated good for sheep and fair
for cattle and horses [<a href="#9">9</a>].  


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Richardson's geranium is rated good in nutritional value for elk, mule
deer, and white-tailed deer, poor for pronghorn and waterfowl, and fair
for small mammals, small nongame birds, and upland game birds.  Energy
rating and protein content are poor [<a href="#9">9</a>].  

Throughout the Intermountain region, nutritional value of Richardson's
geranium is rated good to excellent for cattle and sheep during early
growth stages, and poor to good in later growth stages [<a href="#51">51</a>].
  


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Erosion control, short-term revegetation potential, and long-term
revegetation potential are rated as medium for Richardson's geranium
[<a href="#9">9</a>].  


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
The effects of clearcutting on wildlife habitat were studied in a moist
subalpine forest in central Colorado.  Percent understory cover of
Richardson's geranium before and after clearcutting was [<a href="#11">11</a>]:  

       before logging             years after logging (1978-1982)
          (1976)                     1     2     3     4     5

            5.1                     3.9   4.2   3.7   3.2   7.5

Richardson's geranium can withstand heavy grazing by cattle because of
its stout woody taproot [<a href="#51">51</a>].  It is an increaser species and dominant
forb on cattle-grazed rangelands in Utah.  However, Richardson's
geranium decreases on sheep-grazed rangelands [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Half of a 4-acre fenced plot in a subalpine grassland of central Utah
was trapped from 1942 to 1950 to free it from pocket gophers.  Pocket
gophers in the other half were not disturbed.  Richardson's geranium
increased slightly in percent cover on sites where pocket gophers were
present and also on sites where they were absent.  Pocket gophers did
not seem to influence the percent cover of Richardson's geranium [<a href="#15">15</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Geranium richardsonii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Richardson's geranium is a native, perennial herb 12 to 36 inches (30-90
cm) tall [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  It grows from a stout, simple or branched,
sometimes rhizomatous caudex [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  Young plants (1-3 years)
generally do not have rhizomes; older plants develop rhizomes in the
upper 2.8 to 4.0 inches (7-10 cm) of soil [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Rhizomes are 1.2 to 6.8
inches (3-17 cm) long and arise from a stout woody taproot [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].
Leaves are 1.2 to 6.0 inches (3-15 cm) wide and 2 to 12 inches (5-30 cm)
long [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].

In addition to rhizomes, Richardson's geranium has a fibrous root system
that can grow from 24 to 28 inches (60-70 cm) deep [<a href="#21">21</a>].

<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Richardson's geranium reproduces by seed and rhizomes [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  Bees
are common pollinators, and flower beetles may also pollinate
Richardson's geranium.  It is an active ballist; seed is throw 3.3 feet
(1 m) or more from the parent plant.  Flower beetles may aid in
dispersal.  Seed does not remain viable for more than one winter [<a href="#21">21</a>].



<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Richardson's geranium occurs in a variety of habitats including
woodlands, forest openings, grasslands, meadows, and riparian areas such
as stream terraces, alluvial benches, wet valley bottoms, and stream and
lake margins [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  It is most commonly found in moist areas
[<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].

Richardson's geranium grows best on moist to semiwet soils with good
drainage [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  It is moderately tolerant of drought [<a href="#51">51</a>].  It
grows best on loam, sandy loam, and clayey loam soils derived from shale
and limestone, but occurs on gravelly substrates as well [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].


Elevations for Richardson's geranium for several states are as follows:

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Richardson's geranium occurs in seral and climax communities.  It is
shade tolerant, but also grows in some open habitats [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  It
is a facultative wetland species in California [<a href="#47">47</a>], and a facultative
upland species in Montana [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Richardson's geranium is a common
understory species in aspen community types, which are usually
successional to coniferous climax types in subalpine forests of Colorado
and the Intermountain region [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  Richardson's geranium is a
member of aspen stands of northwestern Wyoming that are 81 to 120 years
old [<a href="#31">31</a>].  It is a facultative species in aspen and Douglas-fir forests
of Utah [<a href="#14">14</a>].  In Utah, Richardson's geranium is present in seral stands
of lodgepole pine [<a href="#12">12</a>].  It is a member of the scrub climax and forest
climax communities of the Black Hills [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Richardson's geranium
occurs in mature to climax subalpine forests in Utah, which are
dominated by subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce [<a href="#64">64</a>].  

In Utah, Richardson's geranium is a chief invader of cattle-grazed
rangelands [<a href="#16">16</a>].  



<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Richardson's geranium flowering dates for several states are as follows:

Arizona                       April-Oct     [<a href="#30">30</a>]
California                    July-Aug      [<a href="#40">40</a>]
Montana                       late July     [<a href="#34">34</a>]
Utah                          June-Aug      [<a href="#21">21</a>]
Great Plains                  May-Aug       [<a href="#20">20</a>]

In the Intermountain West, Richardson's geranium flowers in July and
early August and seed matures in September [<a href="#51">51</a>].  In Oregon, seed is
produced in the fall and germinates in March.  Dormancy begins in the
second or third week of August and is complete after the first frost, in
late September [<a href="#21">21</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Richardson's geranium has rhizomes which may produce new stems after
fire [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  Richardson's geranium is a member of moist or wet
subalpine fir-Engelmann spruce habitat types in Idaho and Wyoming which
have estimated average fire-free intervals of about 330.  Stands are
susceptible to severe burns when drought occurs [<a href="#66">66</a>].  Richardson's
geranium also occurs in communities characterized by more frequent fire,
including lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) [<a href="#65">65</a>], subalpine fir [<a href="#67">67</a>], and
quaking aspen [<a href="#63">63</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Geranium richardsonii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Richardson's geranium is probably top-killed by fire.  In north-central
Colorado, two quaking aspen stands containing some lodgepole pine were
prescribed burned in November, 1981.  Richardson's geranium was present
before burning in both stands, but only in one stand in postfire year 1
[<a href="#62">62</a>].  


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Richardson's geranium may sprout from rhizomes following fire.  


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Since Richardson's geranium is considered an increaser species when
grazed by cattle, fire plans to ensure Richardson's geranium seedling
establishment or inhibition may have to be coordinated with grazing
management.
