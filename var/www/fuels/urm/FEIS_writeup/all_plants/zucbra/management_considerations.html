<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Silt bush has good tolerance to grazing and is a valuable winter forage
[<a href="references.html#11">11</a>,<a href="references.html#13">13</a>].  It is browsed by livestock and big game, especially in the
spring when it is in full leaf [<a href="references.html#1">1</a>,<a href="references.html#9">9</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The early spring and summer growth of silt bush is reported to be good
to very good in palatability, but the foliage retained over the fall and
winter is only fair in palatability [<a href="references.html#11">11</a>].  The degree of use shown by
livestock and wildlife species for silt bush is rated as follows [<a href="references.html#3">3</a>]:

                       UT        WY

Cattle                Fair      Fair
Sheep                 Good      Fair
Horses                Poor      Fair 
Pronghorn             Fair      ____
Elk                   Poor      ____
Mule deer             Fair      ____
Small mammals         Good      ____
Small nongame birds   Poor      ____ 
Upland game birds     Fair      ____   
Waterfowl             Poor      ____


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Silt bush is rated fair in energy and protein value [<a href="references.html#3">3</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The degree to which silt bush provides environmental protection during
one or more seasons for wildlife species in Utah is as follows [<a href="references.html#3">3</a>]:

Pronghorn             Poor
Elk                   Poor
Small mammals         Fair
Small nongame birds   Fair
Upland game birds     Fair
Waterfowl             Poor


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Silt bush is rated as having low to medium potential for both erosion
control and short-term revegetation, and medium potential for long-term
revegetation projects [<a href="references.html#3">3</a>].  It provides good surface soil stabilization
[<a href="references.html#7">7</a>,<a href="references.html#11">11</a>].

Silt bush has a fair to medium natural rate of spread [<a href="references.html#11">11</a>].  It
reproduces well from seed and spreads effectively on disturbed sites
such as roadcuts and roadfills [<a href="references.html#9">9</a>].  Silt bush apparently increases
after soil disturbances [<a href="references.html#9">9</a>].  It was given a higher suitability rating
for restoring big game ranges than was spiny hopsage [<a href="references.html#11">11</a>].

Silt bush germinates and produces seedlings readily, but unless
protected, seeds and seedlings are often eaten by small mammals and
birds [<a href="references.html#1">1</a>,<a href="references.html#9">9</a>].

Seed can be stored up to 5 years, but only 2 years is recommended to
ensure good viability [<a href="references.html#11">11</a>,<a href="references.html#14">14</a>].  Cold stratification or dry storage
improves germination [<a href="references.html#7">7</a>].  Winged fruits average 189,950 to 190,000 per
pound (86,142-86,165 kg) [<a href="references.html#11">11</a>,<a href="references.html#13">13</a>].

Poor results have been obtained from rooting of stem cuttings [<a href="references.html#7">7</a>].
