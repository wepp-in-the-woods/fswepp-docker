<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Zuckia brandegeei
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Silt bush is mostly restricted to the Colorado River drainage in
south-central Wyoming, western Colorado, eastern Utah, northeastern
Arizona, and northwestern New Mexico [<a href="references.html#16">16</a>].  The only known population
outside of the Colorado River drainage system is in the Great Basin,
just northwest of Sterling, Utah [<a href="references.html#10">10</a>,<a href="references.html#16">16</a>].

The chromosomal populations of silt bush reportedly differ in
geographical distribution.  Diploid populations occur mostly in
south-central Utah and northeastern Arizona [<a href="references.html#16">16</a>].  Tetraploids tend to
grow in isolated populations or in more continuous bands wherever 2:1
clay substrates are exposed in northeastern Utah, south-central Wyoming,
eastern Colorado, and northwestern New Mexico [(Pendleton, pers. comm.
1987), 16].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Silt bush can be found growing near Stansbury cliffrose (Purshia
mexicana var. stansburiana) communities, pinyon-juniper and juniper-oak
woodlands, and salt desert shrublands [<a href="references.html#2">2</a>,<a href="references.html#9">9</a>,<a href="references.html#10">10</a>,<a href="references.html#11">11</a>].  Where silt bush
grows with other species it is more commonly found in saltbush
communities that are in a very early seral stage [Pendleton pers. comm.,
1987].  It may also occur as a pioneer plant restricted by competition
to steep 2:1 clay slopes where other plants cannot survive [Pendleton
pers. comm., 1987].
