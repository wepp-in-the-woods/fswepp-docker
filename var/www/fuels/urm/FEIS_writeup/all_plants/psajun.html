<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The fully documented scientific name of Russian wildrye is
Psathyrostachys juncea (Fischer) Nevski.  The taxonomy presented here
follows that of Barkworth and Dewey [<a href="#2">2</a>] who do not recognize any
varieties or forms within North America.  The genus Pasthyrostachys is
composed of ten species native to the steppes and arid regions of
southeastern Europe.  Russian wildrye is the only species of this genus
to establish in North America [<a href="#2">2</a>]. 

The synonym Elymus junceus Fisch. is frequently encountered in the
literature.

<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Psathyrostachys juncea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Russian wildrye is native to the steppe and desert regions of Russia and
China.  Although first introduced to the United States in 1927, wide
utilization of this species in rangeland rehabilitation and improvement
was not initiated until the 1950's [<a href="#18">18</a>].  It has recently been
introduced throughout the Intermountain West and northern Great Plains.
It is currently distributed from Manitoba and Saskachewan southward to
Arizona [<a href="#18">18</a>].  This species is becoming established in North America
[<a href="#12">12</a>].  Naturalized plants have been reported for a few localities in
Utah, Wyoming, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba [<a href="#5">5</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Russian wildrye has been widely utilized for rangeland rehabilitation
and restoration throughout the Intermountain West and northern Great
Plains because of its drought resistance and salt tolerance [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].
Once established, this bunchgrass provides one of the best sources of
forage on many semiarid rangelands.  Plants produce abundant and
nutritious early season forage, and the dense basal leaves remain green
and retain their nutritional value longer than many other often seeded
grasses such as crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum).


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Russian wildrye is highly palatable to both livestock and big game [<a href="#15">15</a>].
This cool-season bunchgrass resumes growth very early in the spring and
is often the first forage utilized on many spring ranges in Utah.  Since
plants are capable of remaining green well into the summer, Russian
wildrye is commonly selected over other grasses later in the grazing
season.  Plants also cure well.

The degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife species for Russian
wildrye in several western states is rated as follows [<a href="#8">8</a>]:

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Psathyrostachys juncea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Russian wildrye is a hardy, vigorous, drought-resistant, long-lived,
densely tufted, cool-season, introduced, perennial bunchgrass.  This
species superficially resembles crested wheatgrass (Agropyron
cristatum), another frequently cultivated Eurasian bunchgrass [<a href="#17">17</a>].
Plants produce abundant, fibrous roots [<a href="#16">16</a>] and are strictly caespitose,
never forming rhizomes [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Culms are densely tufted, typically 1.3 to
3.7 feet (4-11 dm) tall and erect or decumbent at the base.  Old sheath
bases are usually persistent, often ultimately shredding into fibers
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Leaves are mostly basal, abundant, and lax; blades are flat to
involute.  The inflorescense is an erect, dense, flat-cylindric spike
from 1.3 to 6.4 inches (3-16 cm) long [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Lemmas are short-awned.

<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Elevational ranges for several western states are presented below
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].

       from  5,500 to 7,000 feet (1,677-2,134 m) in CO
	     4,198 to 9,414 feet (1,280-2,870 m) in UT
	     6,900 to 8,500 feet (2,104-2,591 m) in WY


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Russian wildrye is an introduced species that has been seeded in a wide
variety of early seral situations in numerous nonforested communities
throughout the Intermountain West and northern Great Plains.  Once
established, plants are strong competitors and on seeded pastures
typically self-thin into open stands.  This species is relatively
long-lived when under cultivation.  Wasser [<a href="#17">17</a>] estimates longevity to
be approximtely 25 years or longer in the northern Great Plains and
perhaps somewhat shorter on sites within the Great Basin.  When seeded
on mountain-brush sites in Utah, Russian wildrye was more productive
growing in the light shade of greasewood (Sarcobatus spp.), big
sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), and rubber rabbitbrush (Chrysthosamnus
spp.) than on sites lacking these associated woody species [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Detailed information on the phenological development of Russian wildrye
is lacking.  This cool-season bunchgrass begins growth early in the
spring, almost as early as crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum)
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Russian wildrye is noted for its ability to remain green
throughout the summer on sites where moisture is adequate, even after
early seed maturity.  Apparently fall regrowth is made quickly, with
plants remainomg green into the fall.
