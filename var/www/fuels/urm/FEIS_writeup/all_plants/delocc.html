<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Delphinium occidentale
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Duncecap larkspur-dominated tall forb communities are utilized by elk,
moose, deer, cattle, and domestic sheep [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Cattle prefer duncecap
larkspur flowers and immature seed pods [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability of duncecap larkspur is rated fair to good for sheep,
poor to fair for cattle, and poor for horses [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Duncecap larkspur is poor in protein and energy value [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Duncecap larkspur provides good cover for small nongame birds and small
mammals [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Larkspur species are cultivated as ornamentals [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Crushed larkspurs (Delphinium spp.) were used by Native Americans for
controlling lice and other insects [<a href="#23">23</a>].  


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
The tall larkspurs (duncecap larkspur and Barbey larkspur [D. barbeyi])
are highly poisonous and are responsible for more cattle deaths on
mountain ranges in the western United States than any other plant
species.  Presence of the tall larkspurs on cattle allotments dictates
when and how ranges are grazed.  As many as 1,000 head of cattle have
been lost lost in a 1-year period on managed rangelands of the
Intermountain Forest Service Region.  Duncecap larkspur is palatable to
both cattle and sheep, but sheep can tolerate about four times more
duncecap larkspur in their diet than cattle.  Duncecap
larkspur-dominated tall forb communities on high mountain ranges are
often considered good sheep foraging areas [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].

Duncecap larkspur produces several alkaloids.  Highest concentrations of
these alkaloids occur in spring and early summer while plants are in the
vegetative stage of growth.  Toxicity generally declines as plants
mature.  Toxicity varies between sites or even on the same site in
different years.  Total alkaloid content of duncecap larkspur may
increase with the application of herbicides.  Plants remain palatable,
however, which may result in loss of livestock [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].

Three potential methods for controlling duncecap larkspur have been
suggested.  First, defer grazing of larkspur-infested ranges until after
flowering, when alkaloid levels have declined.  Second, sequentially
graze sheep before cattle, close-herding sheep through larkspur-infested
areas to trample plants and make them unacceptable to cattle.  Third,
control duncecap larkspur with herbicides [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Glyphosphate,
metsulfuron, triclopyr, and picloram control duncecap larkspur [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Delphinium occidentale
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Duncecap larkspur is a robust perennial forb with deep, woody roots.
Stems may be numerous, and are usually 24 to 80 inches (60-200 cm) tall
and hollow.  Leaves are alternate and palmately divided.  Flowers are
borne in racemes and the fruit is a many-seeded follicle.  Seeds are
about 0.08 to 0.1 inches (0.2-0.25 cm) long [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Duncecap larkspur reproduces by seed [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Seeds may be stored in the
soil [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Duncecap larkspur is found on streambanks and moist talus slopes, and in
meadows, thickets, and open woods [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  It most often occurs on
moist to wet sites and is often concentrated in areas of late snowmelt
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Duncecep larkspur is found on dry, shallow gravel to sandy
clay, but grows best on rich loamy soils [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  It grows well on level
ground to steep slopes [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].  Upper and lower elevational limits of
duncecap larkspur in a few western states follow [<a href="#4">4</a>]:

Colorado     6,500- 9,800         1,970-2,970
Wyoming      5,500-10,000         1,670-3,030
Montana      7,800- 8,500         2,360-2,575


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Duncecap larkspur grows well in open to shaded sites [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  In
subalpine forb communities of the Bridger-Teton National Forest,
Wyoming, duncecap larkspur is found on pristine sites as well as sites
highly disturbed by pocket gophers [<a href="#8">8</a>].  It is also found in climax
trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides)/tall forb stands and seral
trembling aspen-subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) stands in the
Intermountain Region [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Duncecap larkspur occurs in Idaho fescue
(Festuca idahoensis)-cutting wheatgrass and mountain big sagebrush
(Artemisia tridentata spp. vaseyana) habitat types in the Shoshone
National Forest, Wyoming [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Duncecap larkspur begins growth in late spring.  It flowers in July and
August and the seeds mature from August to September [<a href="#23">23</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Duncecap larkspur is probably killed by most fires.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>

<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Information regarding the response of duncecap larkspur following fire
is lacking in available literature.  Duncecap larkspur was not present
in prefire communities but became an important species following
moderately severe to severe prescribed fires in trembling aspen stands
in Idaho.  Its method of colonization was not determined, but it may
have invaded the burned area from other sites [<a href="#2">2</a>].
