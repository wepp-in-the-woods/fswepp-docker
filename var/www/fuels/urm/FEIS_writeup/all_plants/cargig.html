<h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carnegiea gigantea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Saguaro occurs throughout most of the Sonoran Desert in Arizona,
California, and Mexico [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  The northern limits of its distribution
are on the edge of the Hualapait Mountains in Arizona and along the
Colorado River in southeastern California [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].  The range of
saguaro extends southward; the largest populations of this species occur
in Sonora, Mexico [<a href="#67">67</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Saguaro is a dominant or codominant member of the paloverde (Cercidium
spp.)/saguaro (also known as the spinose suffrutescent community) and
the paloverde/bursage (Ambrosia spp.) desertscrub community types on
bajadas (i.e., eroded outwash fans) [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>].  Infrequently, on
the southwestern edge of its range, saguaro occurs in creosotebush
(Larrea spp.) communities as a xeroriparian species in arroyos and
washes [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].

Saguaro is a community type indicator species in the following

<h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carnegiea gigantea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
The flowers, fruits, and seeds of the saguaro are important food sources
for wildlife, such as collared peccary, long-nosed bats, heteromyid
rodents, western white-winged doves, woodpeckers, and insects
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].

Saguaro fruits comprised a small amount (e.g., 1 to 5 percent of
collected rumen contents) of mule deer summer diets [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].
The fruits were also utilized by desert bighorn sheep; they were present
in 10 percent of bighorn fecal pellets analyzed [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>].

Saguaro provides nesting habitat for birds and small mammals [<a href="#49">49</a>].
Saguaro mortality can have a high negative impact on bird species that
use it for cover and nesting [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Saguaro is highly palatable to rodents and jackrabbits; however, saguaro
tissue contains oxalates that deter some herbivory [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].



<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The nutritional value of saguaro fruits is variable throughout the
season and among studies.  Saguaro fruits are moderately digestible
[<a href="#80">80</a>].  The amount of protein reported varied from 10 to 26 percent
[<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].  Acid detergent fiber amounts in the fruits varied from 26 to
62 percent, and dry matter was 11 to 35 percent [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Saguaro is considered a softwood snag [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Cavity-nesting birds,
especially woodpeckers, and sometimes woodrats nest in saguaro
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Saguaro fruits were a major food staple of the Papago and Pima Indians;
the fruits were processed (i.e., dried, fermented, canned) and stored
for year-round use [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Seeds, rich in fat, were ground for use
as flour and in porridges [<a href="#55">55</a>].  Fruits were used for trade and in
religious practices by the Papago Indians [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].

The internal heavy, woody ribs were used for firewood and building
houses and fences [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].

Saguaro is grown in desert gardens as an ornamental [<a href="#89">89</a>].  It is the
state flower of Arizona and is used in commercial advertisements of
Southwestern living [<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Intensive grazing can prevent recruitment of saguaro seedlings [<a href="#47">47</a>].
Various areas in the Sonoran Desert have been protected from domestic
livestock grazing for 50 years or more.  One early study showed that
there was no significant (p>0.05) difference between saguaro abundance
on protected and unprotected plots [<a href="#8">8</a>].  More recent studies, however,
have shown that saguaro increased by 33 to 200 percent in protected
areas [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>].  Saguaro seedlings may be impacted negatively when nurse
plants are browsed [<a href="#47">47</a>].

Models to predict saguaro age from growth parameters (for example,
height-age equivalents) have been developed [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].

In transplant experiments, mortality was 100 percent for unshaded
saguaro seedlings compared to 65 percent for shaded seedlings [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Saguaro are susceptible to few diseases [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Healthy saguaro often
wall off larvae tunnels, woodpecker holes, or other wounds [<a href="#47">47</a>].  Some
necroses may occur, however, after mechanical damage to saguaro from
breakage, frost, or lightning [<a href="#71">71</a>].  Insects, saprophytic yeasts, molds,
and bacteria readily inhabit and breed in saguaro necroses [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].

Temperatures below 23 degrees Fahrenheit (-5 deg C) will damage saguaro.
Death will occur after exposure to below freezing temperatures for 29 or
more consecutive hours [<a href="#85">85</a>].  Fluctuations in saguaro numbers often are
due to recurring catastrophic freezes [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].

Saguaro is protected under the Arizona Native Plant Law.  Cactus
poaching is of concern around Saguaro National Monument and urban
centers [<a href="#90">90</a>].  Natural environmental extremes in temperature and
drought, however, are more of a threat to the survival of this species
[<a href="#37">37</a>].

<h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carnegiea gigantea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Saguaro is a native, arborescent, stem succulent that grows from 9.8 to
52.5 feet (3-16 m) tall and 5.9 to 29.5 inches (5-75 cm) in diameter
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].  It is the largest of the columnar cacti growing in the
United States [<a href="#89">89</a>].  Saguaro has a deep anchoring taproot (up to 3.2
feet [1 m] deep) and extensive lateral roots (13 to 98 feet [4-30 m]
long) [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].  The stems are simple with one to five (rarely up to 49)
lateral, erect branches [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].  Saguaro trunks have many prominent
ribs, armed with dense, stout spines that are up to 2.8 inches (7 cm)
long [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Flowers are 3.4 to 4.9 inches (8.7-12.5 cm) long and
occur at the ends of branches [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Fruits are oblong and contain
up to 2,500 seeds [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Stem succulent


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Saguaro reproduce sexually and are self-incompatible [<a href="#2">2</a>].  

Reproduction begins when a plant is approximately 7.2 feet (2.2 m) tall
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  Growth is extremely slow [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  At the end of 2 years,
seedlings will be about 0.25 inch (0.6 cm) tall [<a href="#10">10</a>].  At 3.2 feet (1
m), plants may be 20 to 50 years old [<a href="#47">47</a>].

Flowers only develop at branch and main stem tips.  An increase in
branch number increases the reproductive potential of an individual
[<a href="#37">37</a>].

Many different animals pollinate the nocturnally blooming saguaro
flowers and are detailed elsewhere [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Flowers are open for less
than 24 hours [<a href="#2">2</a>].  A plant averages four open flowers per day for about
30 days [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Plants commonly have more than 100 fruits [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].

Seeds germinate readily [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Conditions for germination are detailed
elsewhere [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>].  Saguaro seeds are short-lived; seed reserves are
not maintained in the soil [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>].  In random soil samples, relative
densities of saguaro seeds were between 0.3 and 2.0 percent [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Less
than 1 percent of the annual seed production germinates due to predation
or moisture stress [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  Heavy seedfall can occur during the summer
rains [<a href="#68">68</a>].  Drought during the 12 to 14 months following germination is
the most critical factor threatening seedling survival [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].

Perennial shrubs, such as foothills paloverde (Cercidium microphyllum),
are important as nurse plants for facilitating saguaro establishment
[<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  Seed dispersal by frugivorous birds is a primary factor
in saguaro establishment beneath shrub canopies [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Saguaro seedling
density significantly (p<0.05) decreased from the center to the outer
edges of nurse plant canopies [<a href="#29">29</a>].

On the margins of its range, recruitment has not kept pace with
mortality caused by freezing temperatures and drought [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>].  Saguaro
has lower fruit production at the drier western edge of its range [<a href="#52">52</a>].
In some areas where cattle grazing has not occurred, recruitment
appeared to occur in pulses correlated with above-normal precipitation
[<a href="#76">76</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Compared to other columnar cacti, saguaro occurs over the broadest range
of habitats from gently sloping alluvial flats of the lower bajadas to
steep, rocky, high-elevation volcanic slopes [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].  The greatest
densities of saguaro are found in the more mesic eastern parts of its
range [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Saguaro occurs on shallow soils that are light, coarse-textured, and
rocky.  The soils are underlain at 3.2 to 9.6 feet (1-3 m) depths by an
impervious caliche layer [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>].  There is usually no differentiation of
the soil into horizons [<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>].  Saguaro is found at elevations from
1,640 to 5,000 feet (500-1,525 m) [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].  Saguaro has been
reported on all aspects [<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>].  However, most individuals occur on
open east- and west-facing slopes, and the fewest occur on north-facing
slopes [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].

The Sonoran Desert is a warm desert with a semiarid to arid continental
or an arid subtropical climate [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].  Precipitation is bimodal,
falling December to February and July to August, and amounts vary from
year to year [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  Average amounts of rain per year are 6 to 15
inches (152-400 mm) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>].

Common arborescent associated species are Organ Pipe Cactus
(Lemierocereus thurberi), barrelcactus (Ferocactus wislizeni), cholla
(Opuntia spp.), ocotillo (Fouqueria splendens), catclaw acacia (Acacia
greggii), ironwood (Olneya tesota), and jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis)
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Other associated species are littleleaf krameria
(Krameria parvifolia), fluffgrass (Erioneuron pulchellum), tobosa
(Hilaria mutica), Indian-wheat (Plantago insularis), and thelypody
(Thelypodium lasiophyllum) [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Climax Series

Succession in desert systems is difficult to define [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Saguaro may
be considered a climax species.  Establishing in the shade of perennial
shrubs, saguaro usually outlives and surpasses the nurse plants.
Regeneration of saguaro continues in suitable areas of its range.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Saguaro flowers from late April to June [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Fruits mature
during June and July before the summer rains [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].  Most growth of
saguaro occurs during the summer rainy season [<a href="#6">6</a>].

<h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carnegiea gigantea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Saguaro is not truly adapted to fire because there is no postfire
stimulation of flowering or seed production [<a href="#73">73</a>].  It has several
prominent morphological characteristics, however, that may aid its
survival when burned.  The apex is protected to some degree by tissue
folds and spines.  Vascular tissue is protected by a thick cortex that
has a high thermal capacity close to that of water.  As saguaro ages,
ribs at the base of a plant may develop a woody bark which is more
resistant to burning than young tissue [<a href="#73">73</a>].

Although mortally injured by fire, death may be delayed if the saguaro
can live off of its reserves, which may enable a plant to flower for 1 to 6
years more [<a href="#73">73</a>].  Singed saguaro have been observed to flower from
unburned branches.  However, scorched plants may die due to reduced
vigor [<a href="#58">58</a>].  Fire may remove spines from a saguaro, making it vulnerable
to herbivory [<a href="#73">73</a>].

Nurse plant species influence saguaro fire survival.  Although desert
fire temperatures are variable, fire temperatures beneath foothills
paloverde were lower than under triangleleaf bursage (Ambrosia
deltoidea) [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Fire-free periods in the Sonoran Desert are greater than 250 years [<a href="#73">73</a>].
Saguaro would be eliminated under a fire frequency of less than 30 years
[<a href="#58">58</a>].  Fires that do occur are usually of low intensity due to small
fuel loads [<a href="#41">41</a>].

<h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carnegiea gigantea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire top-kills saguaro, and it may kill existing seedlings [<a href="#73">73</a>].
Because there is a lag time between time of injury by fire and time of
death, postfire mortality may be underestimated [<a href="#58">58</a>].  Small saguaro,
less than 6.6 to 13 feet (2-4 m) tall, with large amounts of fuel at the
plant base do not survive.  Larger saguaro may survive with limited
damage [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Postfire recovery is dependent upon individual plant recovery and seed
dispersal from unburned plants [<a href="#58">58</a>].  Surviving saguaro with little or
no injury will resume growth [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Absorption of rain following
fire-caused injuries can result in fire scars splitting, which opens the
plant to insects and infections [<a href="#73">73</a>].

Vegetation surveys done the third and fourth years following an early
summer fire found no sprouting of saguaro and no seedlings [<a href="#59">59</a>].  Two
studies that compared burn and adjacent wildfire areas 2 years after
prescribed burning found that 100 percent of saguaro present in plots
had died.  Plots were read before and after fire.  There were no sprouts
or seedlings [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fire would be an effective tool to control saguaro invasion or density
[<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>].

Along major highways in Arizona, motorist-caused fires have completely
eliminated the saguaro over large areas [<a href="#58">58</a>].
