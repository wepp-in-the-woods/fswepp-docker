<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
Sitka alder is described under a variety of scientific names by numerous
authors.  The most commonly used scientific name, which designates Sitka
alder as a distinct species, is Alnus sinuata (Reg.) Rydberg
[<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  However, more recent studies have shown Sitka alder to
be a member of a circumpolar taxon distributed across America, Europe,
and Asia [<a href="#18">18</a>].  This taxon has been separated into the following two
subspecies [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>]:

      Alnus viridis ssp. crispa (Aiton) Turill - green alder - northern
                                                 North America, including
                                                 northwestern N. America
                                                      
      Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata (Regel) Love & Love - Sitka alder -
                                                 northwestern North
                                                 America  

Intermediate forms between these subspecies are found where their ranges
overlap [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].

<pre><center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Sitka alder is occasionally used for firewood [<a href="#27">27</a>].  


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Sitka alder has little forage value for big game animals or livestock
[<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  Plants are occasionally eaten by mule deer [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Dense stands
impede the movements of livestock [<a href="#11">11</a>] but provide cover for wildlife
[<a href="#36">36</a>].

Sitka alder-dominated avalanche chutes are considered excellent habitat
for grizzly bears.  Grizzly bears often forage in these areas, eating
mesic herbaceous plants as they green up in the spring and berries from
shrubs in the summer and fall [<a href="#51">51</a>].

Muskrats, beavers, cottontails, and snowshoe hares eat alder (Alnus
spp.) twigs and leaves [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Beavers eat the bark of alders, and build
dams and lodges with the stems [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Alder seeds, buds, and catkins,
are eaten by redpolls, siskins, goldfinches, chickadees, and grouse, and
are an important winter food source [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability of Sitka alder to big game animals and livestock is
generally poor [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Often forming dense thickets, Sitka alder provides thermal and hiding
cover for many wildlife species, and is especially valuable as hiding
cover for big game animals [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Thickets also provide nesting and
foraging habitat for many bird species [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Thickets in Idaho often
have high population densities of pocket gophers and hares [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Sitka alder is valuable for slope stabilization and erosion control on
steep slopes [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Its seeds are adapted to invade bare mineral soil and
can be sown onti cool, moist, disturbed sites.  To obtain seed, proven
cone collection and seed extraction procedures should be followed [<a href="#24">24</a>].
Transplanting seedlings is most successful when 2- and 3-year-old
container-grown stock is used [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Red alder is suitable for revegetating sterile soils because it fixes
atmospheric nitrogen.  An Alaska study found that Sitka alder seedlings
originating from windblown seed of nearby plants quickly invaded coal
mine spoils [<a href="#14">14</a>], indicating its potential usefulness for revegatating
such areas.


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The bark and foliage of alders is very astringent and was used by Native
Americans for medicinal purposes.  Preparations from alder bark were
also used by Native Americans to tan and dye leather and textiles [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Nurse crop:  Sitka alder improves soil fertility both by fixing nitrogen
and by producing a nitrogen-rich leaf litter [<a href="#20">20</a>].  It has therefore been
proposed for interplanting with Douglas-fir or other desirable conifers
on sites where additional nitrogen is desirable [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Based on juvenile
height-growth patterns, Douglas-fir should be planted 2 to 6 years
before Sitka alder to ensure that it is not overtopped and suppressed.

Competition:  Attempts to establish conifers on Sitka alder sites have
generally proved unsuccessful.  It can be a major competitor with
planted conifer seedlings, especially if it was established in the
understory prior to harvest [<a href="#20">20</a>].  On good sites, Sitka alder-dominated
brushfields may develop following wildfire or logging [<a href="#40">40</a>].  When
established in the understory or where "conifer islands" occurring within
Sitka alder communities have been removed, sites should receive
immediate conifer regeneration treatment [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Moisture relationships:  Sitka alder is indicative of high water tables.
Stands may therefore make access for timber harvest difficult [<a href="#46">46</a>], but
may prove useful for hikers searching for water.  Trails should cross
avalanche chutes at right angles to prevent water from being diverted
downhill [<a href="#6">6</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sitka alder is a deciduous shrub or, rarely, a small tree.  Plants are
typically multistemmed and bushy, up to 10 or 15 feet (3 or 4.6 m) tall,
often forming dense thickets [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Occasionally, plants may grow to
30 or 40 feet (9 or 12 m) at lower elevations [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Height growth
generally decreases with increasing elevation [<a href="#22">22</a>].  The resilient
branches are seldom damaged by snow creep or avalanches, allowing dense
thickets to form on steep slopes subject to these disturbances [<a href="#17">17</a>].  On
these sites the 3 to 6 inch (7.6-15.2 cm) diameter stems often point
downhill and then bow strongly upwards [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  The bark is thin,
smooth, and reddish brown or gray [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  The leaves are alternate,
ovate, 0.8 to 2.5 inches (3-10 cm) long, shiny green, with doubly
serrate margins [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Sitka alder has a shallow root system [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Male and female flowers occur on the same plant in catkins.  The
separate male and female catkins are in small clusters on the same twig
[<a href="#20">20</a>].  Clusters of three to six pistillate catkins are approximately 0.5
inch (1.25 cm) long, each with a long, 1 to 1.5 inch (2.5-3.75 cm) stalk
[<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (microphanerophyte)
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (nanophanerophyte)
   Burned or Clipped State:  Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction:  Male and female flowers of Sitka alder occur in
catkins on the same plant.  The small (about 0.5 inch [1.25 cm] long)
female catkins are wind pollinated, and turn semiwoody and conelike at
maturity.  The fruit is a small, single-seeded nutlet with wide lateral
wings.

Seeds are dispersed during the fall [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Sitka alder's seeds are
lightweight and have broad wings about as wide as the body of the nut,
which allows them to travel long distances by wind and water [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Germination from seed on disturbed habitats is the primary form of
reproduction of Sitka alder [<a href="#20">20</a>].  The wind-dispersed seeds colonize
bare soil created by disturbances such as fire, avalanches, soil slump,
and retreating glaciers.  Seeds require a moist mineral soil for
germination, which normally takes place in the spring.  Studies in
western Washington found that it takes 3 to 4 years for Sitka alder
seedlings to reach 3 feet (1 m) in height, and 10 years to reach 13 feet
(4 m) [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Seedlings take 4 to 7 years to start producing seed
[<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].

Vegetative Reproduction:  Sitka alder plants can sprout from the root
collar or stump when damaged.  Although alder wood is resilient and
somewhat limber, avalanches can damage plants, which afterwards often
sprout [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Sprouting also often occurs from root crowns following
fire [<a href="#47">47</a>].

Propagation:  Stem cuttings of Sitka alder seldom, if ever, produce
roots [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sitka alder is generally found at middle to high elevations in the
mountains of northwestern North America.  It is moderately shade
tolerant [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>], which allows it to survive under stands of lodgepole
pine (Pinus contorta), Engleman spruce (Picea engelmannii), subalpine
fir, grand fir (Abies grandis), western hemlock, mountain hemlock (Tsuga
mertensiana), Douglas-fir, and Pacific silver fir [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>]; however,
it cannot tolerate a dense overstory.  Scattered thickets of Sitka alder
are normally located on cool moist sites, on north-facing slopes, or
other shady aspects [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  It is a vigorous invader of talus
slopes, avalanche chutes, seepage areas, and high elevation mountain
swales, which often have an abundance of surface moisture [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].
These sites are often subject to deep winter snow accumulations and
recurrent avalanches.  Although typically mentioned as a seral shrub of
cool, moist, shady upland sites, it also occurs along cool mountain
streams in Oregon and Washington [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].

Soils:  Sitka alder is found on a wide variety of parent materials and
soil textures [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Surface soil textures vary from silts to coarse
sands, and are consistently more acidic than those in adjacent conifer
communities [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Soils under Sitka alder are normally higher in
available nitrogen than soils in adjacent communities, since this
species can fix between 18 to 55 pounds per acre (20-62 kg/ha) of
nitrogen annually [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Its ability to fix nitrogen allows it to invade
sterile mineral soil recently exposed by glaciers or avalanches [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Associated species:  Sitka alder is commonly found with shrubs such as
Rocky Mountain maple (Acer glabrum), vine maple (A. circinatum),
elderberies (Sambucus spp.), willows (Salix spp.), prickly currant
(Ribes lacustre), mountain ash (Sorbus spp.), rusty leaf menziesia
(Menziesia ferruginea).  Commonly associated herbs and forbs (usually
shade tolerant) include heartleaf miners lettuce (Montia cordifolia),
Siberian miners lettuce (M. sibirica), arrowleaf groundsel (Senecio
triangularis), wild ginger (Asarum caudatum), lady fern (Athyrium
felix-femina), queencup beadlily (Clintonia unifloria), broadleaf arnica
(Arnica latifolia), sidebells shinleaf (Pyrola secunda), pioneer violet
(Viola glabella), nettles (Urtica dioica), northern bluebells (Mertensia
paniculata), and bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum) [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].

Elevation:  Sitka alder is mostly distributed above 3,000 feet (914 m)
[<a href="#3">3</a>].  Sitka alder does not grow below 1,640 feet (500 m) in Washington
[<a href="#22">22</a>].  Elevational ranges for the following western states are presented
below [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>]:

from 3,500 to 8,000 feet (1,067-2,438 m) in MT
     5,700 to 7,000 feet (1,737-2,134 m) in Eagle Cap Wilderness, OR


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Sitka alder is generally considered a pioneer or early seral species,
capable of colonizing disturbed or sterile soils and often appears on
avalanche chutes, talus slopes, fresh alluvium, and at the head of
retreating glaciers [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  On steep terrain in heavy snowpack
areas, recurrent avalanches are partially responsible for the creation
and maintenance of Sitka alder communities [<a href="#17">17</a>].  The soils exposed by
avalanches provide an ideal seedbed for Sitka alder seeds.  Once
established, its resilient wood, bowed growth form, and ability to
resprout if stems are broken allow Sitka alder to withstand repeated
avalanche destruction, which would normally kill other plants.  Other
Sitka alder communities appear to be stable and long-lived and are
apparently midseral or even climax.  When conifers are removed by
disturbances such as wildfire, avalanche, or massive soil slumping,
Sitka alder quickly invades disturbed sites having high water tables or
seasonally high moisture such as from snow melt [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Dense stands of
Sitka alder that develop can sometimes retard the establishment of
conifers on the site, and these stands appear to be stable [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
The staminate catkins of Sitka alder are produced during the preceeding
growing season, and are exposed during the winter.  The pistillate
catkins emerge with the leaves in the spring [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Flowering occurs in
the spring, cones ripen in mid-September to mid-November depending on
latitude and elevation, and seed is dispersed immediately thereafter
[<a href="#20">20</a>].  Leaves remain green until they are dropped in the fall.

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Sitka alder generally sprouts from the root crown following fire
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Numerous wind-dispersed seeds are produced by off-site plants
and on-site plants which sprout following fire.  Sitka alder's frequency
and extent increase rapidly in early successional communities following
fire [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].

Fire tends to occur infrequently on the moist sites occupied by Sitka
alder communities [<a href="#10">10</a>].  The nonflammable bark and nonresinous leaves
protect alders somewhat from low intensity fires [<a href="#10">10</a>].

<pre><center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Severe fires can completely remove organic soil layers leaving alder
roots exposed and charred, thus eliminating basal sprouting.  Low to
moderate severity fires kill only aboveground plant parts [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Sitka alder is generally favored by fire.  It often increases in
frequency and extent in the early seral communities that follow a fire.
Although aboveground plant parts may be killed by fire, plants usually
recover by sending up several new shoots from their root crown, which
often increases stand density [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Sitka alder's wind-dispersed seeds
quickly colonize soils exposed by fire, and seedlings often become an
important part of the first postfire generation [<a href="#47">47</a>].

Throughout northern Idaho, Sitka alder is more common on burned lands
than on unburned.  On sites repeatedly burned over a 30-year period both
frequency and cover have increased.  In unburned climax coniferous
stands, Sitka alder attained a frequency of less than 1 percent, but on
nearby areas burned more than once, it had a frequency of 30 percent
[<a href="#37">37</a>].

In another northern Idaho study, Sitka alder sprouts originating from
root crowns following a wildfire flowered 5 years after the fire.
Seedlings were first detected during the 8th postfire year with a 5
percent frequency, and 2 years later increased to a frequency of 75
percent [<a href="#47">47</a>].

Sitka alder, in the Kamloops Forest Region of British Columbia,
reportedly takes 5 to 7 years to "recover" from broadcast burns of
moderate to severe intensity [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
In the subalpine fir zone of British Columbia, Sitka alder stands are
common in some drier areas.  Pojar and others [<a href="#41">41</a>] speculate that this
may be related to fire history.  Since Sitka alder is a nitrogen-fixing
species, it may be a more successful invader in these drier areas where
fires were hotter and removed much of the surface organic matter.
