<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Barrel cactus is primarily found in desert grassland and desert shrub
habitats in the Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  It also
extends into communities at higher elevations in interior chaparral and
is found in the Madrean evergreen woodland in encinal woodlands with a
mixture of evergreen oaks (Quercus spp.) and junipers (Juniperus spp.)
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Barrel cactus is not listed as a dominant or codominant species
in available publications.

Some species generally associated with barrel cactus include prickly
pear or cholla (Opuntia spp.), acacia (Acacia spp.), ocotillo (Fouqueria
splendens), yucca (Yucca spp.), saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea), grama
(Bouteloua spp.), and threeawn (Aristida spp.) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Barrel cactus is often consumed by cattle and rabbits if the spines are
removed by a disturbance such as fire [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].

Mule deer in the Sonoran Desert readily consume barrel cactus fruits.
Mule deer diets consisted of 35.6, 42.5, 5.4, and 1.9 percent barrel
cactus fruits in the fall, winter, spring, and summer, respectively
[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Collared peccary also consume barrel cactus fruits when they
are available [<a href="#39">39</a>].

Barrel cactus seeds are eaten by many birds [<a href="#38">38</a>].

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Barrel cactus fruits are reported to be highly digestible (greater than
50% of dry matter) by mule deer.  The following in vitro dry matter

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Native Americans have used barrel cactus pulp for making jelly and
cactus candy [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  Barrel cactus is extensively collected and used
in landscaping themes and cactus gardens [<a href="#38">38</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Glendening [<a href="#10">10</a>] and Brown [<a href="#4">4</a>] reported that barrel cactus increased over
17- or 18-year periods, respectively, on desert grasslands of Arizona.
Both studies included treatments that excluded cattle and rabbits (no
grazing), excluded cattle only (light grazing), and contained areas open
to grazing.  The following average numbers of barrel cactus plants under
each treatment were reported by Glendening [<a href="#10">10</a>] on the Santa Rita
Experimental Range:

            No grazing        Light grazing         Open
    ________________________________________________________
    1932       0                  0.5                0.5
    1949      30.5               24.0                5.0

Blydenstein [<a href="#3">3</a>] stated that there was no significant difference in
frequency of barrel cactus between lightly grazed desert shrub
communities and communities that had been protected from grazing for 50
years.

Barrel cactus populations are negatively affected by urban development
and cactus collection [<a href="#27">27</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ferocactus wislizenii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Barrel cactus is a native stem succulent that is barrel-shaped or
sometimes columnar with rarely more than one stem.  It ranges from 2
to 10 feet (3 m) tall, with a diameter of 18 to 33 inches (45-83 cm).
Barrel cactus has 20 to 28 ribs.  The spines are dense, somewhat
obscuring the surface of the stem.  There are four central spines per
areole, the larger ones 1.5 to 2 inches (3.8-5.0 cm) long, and 12 to 20
radial spines to 1.8 inches (4.5 cm) in length.  Flowers form on growth
of the current season near the stem apex.  The fruit is yellow,
barrel-shaped, and fleshy at maturity [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].

According to Cannon [<a href="#7">7</a>], the root system of barrel cactus is shallow and
confined to the upper soil layers.  At one site a main anchoring root
extended down to about 8 inches (20 cm) and had several short laterals.
Horizontal roots originated from the root crown and were very shallow.
Depth of burial decreased with distance from the plant and ranged from
0.6 to 1.2 inches (1.5-3.0 cm).  Roots were often exposed after rain
storms.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Stem succulent


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Glendening [<a href="#10">10</a>] stated that barrel cactus reproduces from seeds only,
which are dispersed by birds and rodents [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  No offsets were
reported after fires in southern Arizona; growth was from the apical
meristem only [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Ferocactus species will often branch at the apex
following injury to the terminal bud [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Limiting factors for germination of barrel cactus seeds are temperature
and light.  Greatest germination takes place at 68 to 86 degrees
Fahrenheit (20-30 deg C) after at least 8 hours of light.  Seeds do not
germinate in the dark [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Barrel cactus is found on rocky, gravelly, or sandy soils of hills,
flats, canyons, wash margins, and alluvial fans in desert shrublands and
grasslands from 990 to 5,280 feet (300-1,600 m) elevation [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  It
also extends into woodland communities occurring at elevations below
6,500 feet (1,970 m) [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Barrel cactus is frost-sensitive [<a href="#28">28</a>], which
is a limiting site factor at higher elevations and northern latitudes.


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Barrel cactus' life span has been reported to be from 50 [<a href="#11">11</a>] to 130
years [<a href="#26">26</a>].  It is a climax member of the desert grassland [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Barrel cactus flowers sporadically in late spring and profusely in the
summer (July to September) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ferocactus wislizenii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Large succulents such as barrel cactus have a thick cortex that
insulates the vascular tissue.  The cortex thickens with age, so older
individuals may be more resistant to fire than younger ones.  Taller
individuals are more likely to survive fire because the apical meristem
may be above flame height.  Cacti escape fire in refugia and in areas
with fuels too sparse to carry fire.  Cacti do not appear to store seed
in soil seedbanks [<a href="#30">30</a>].

Although desert vegetation rarely burns completely due to a lack of
continuous fuels, unusually heavy winter rains may produce a cover of
annual species dense enough to carry a fire when cured.  Fires resulting
from this situation tend to occur at the desert-desert grassland ecotone
[<a href="#16">16</a>], a common habitat of barrel cactus.  Thomas [<a href="#30">30</a>] has cited
references suggesting that fire intervals in desert grasslands may be as
short as 3 to 40 years.  Repeated fires may be disastrous to barrel
cactus populations, whose recovery period has been estimated at more
than 15 years [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Most desert habitat does not produce enough
vegetation to support frequent fires.  If frequent fires do occur they
gradually reduce succulent populations, although a small percentage of
individuals may survive in refugia [<a href="#30">30</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ferocactus wislizenii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Barrel cactus plants more than 1 foot (0.3 m) tall are rarely killed by
fire since only their spines are combustible.  However, plants less than
that height may suffer up to 75 percent mortality as a direct result of
fire damage to the apical meristem, or a combination of fire damage to
the meristem and damage from herbivory [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Succculents in general rarely actually burn, but spines may ignite and
carry flames to the apex.  The cactus body may scorch and blister
without pyrolysis, leaving undamaged parts of the plant alive.
Mortality results from death of the photosynthetic tissue and underlying
cambium and phloem.  Cacti may appear completely scorched with no green
tissue visible, yet survive fire.  However, fire can cause delayed
mortality, which may not occur for months or even years [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Removal
of the spines also increases subsequent herbivory [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  Survival of
succulents depends primarily on protection of the apical meristem.  If
the apical meristem is undamaged, the cactus will resume growth [<a href="#30">30</a>].




<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Average mortalities of 50 to 67 percent have been reported for barrel
cactus within the first 2 years following fire in desert grassland and
desert shrub communities in southern Arizona [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].

Two consecutive winters of heavy rain produced enough fuel to carry a
fire in a portion of the Sonoran Desert where fire is usually considered
ecologically insignificant.  Following the Granite Fire in Arizona in
June 1979, large-diameter cacti including barrel cactus had the lowest
mortality rate of all cacti.  Many severely burned plants survived and
produced flowers and seeds.  An average of 20 plants per hectare
occurred on unburned sites, and 15 plants per hectare occurred on burns
in postfire years 1 and 2.  Barrel cactus had an overall mortality rate
of 59 percent in burned areas within the first 19 postfire months [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Barrel cactus had an average of 6 percent and 31 percent mortality on
unburned and burned sites, respectively, following fires in semidesert
grasslands on the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge and in the
Sierrita Mountains of southern Arizona.  Plants were counted within 11
to 14 postfire months.  Barrel cactus also had significantly greater
(p<.001) fire mortality when under a mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) canopy
(53%) than in open grassy areas (19%) [<a href="#31">31</a>].
