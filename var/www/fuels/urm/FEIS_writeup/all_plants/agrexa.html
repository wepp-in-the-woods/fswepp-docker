<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of spike bentgrass is Agrostis
exarata Trin. [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  It is a member of the Poaceae family.
There are three recognized varieties:

A. e. var. exarata
A. e. var. pacifica Vasey [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>]
A. e. var. monolepis (Torrey) Hitchc. [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>]

Spike bentgrass apparently hybridizes with ticklegrass (A. scabra) and

<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Agrostis exarata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Spike bentgrass is mostly a western grass.  It occurs from Manitoba,
South Dakota, Nebraska, Texas, and Mexico west to the Pacific states and
provinces, including Alaska [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Spike bentgrass is widely
distributed in the mountains of northern California and occurs on Santa
Cruz Island, off the coast of southern California [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Zifka [<a href="#30">30</a>]
discovered an adventive colony of spike bentgrass (Agrostis exarta var.
monolepis) in Rutland County, Vermont, in 1982.

understory species in quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) communities
[<a href="#32">32</a>].  

In northwestern Oregon, spike bentgrass is a component of the
Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forest [<a href="#17">17</a>].  

Along montane forest river valleys in Colorado, spike bentgrass occurs
in cottonwood-willow (Populus-Salix spp.) and red-osier dogwood (Cornus

Spike bentgrass is a member of the pink mountain heather-white mountain
heather (Phyllodoce empetriformis-Cassiope mertensiana) meadow community

In the annual grasslands of California, spike bentgrass is a member of
the fescue-oatgrass (Festuca-Danthonia) community [<a href="#10">10</a>].  In southern
California, it is also a member of coastal sage scrub, particularly the
purple sage (Salvia leucophylla) association [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Spike bentgrass occurs in tundra on the northeastern arctic slope of
Alaska [<a href="#19">19</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Agrostis exarata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Spike bentgrass is an important source of montane forage for livestock
in the summer [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Herbage stays green and palatable
throughout the summer [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Spike bentgrass is rated good for cattle, horses, and elk, and fair to
good for sheep and deer [<a href="#29">29</a>].  


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Spike bentgrass has been used as a soil stabilizer in degraded areas
[<a href="#27">27</a>].
  


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Spike bentgrass is considered the most valuable native redtop (Agrostis
spp.) on California rangelands because of its abundance and wide
distribution [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Spike bentgrass decreases with overgrazing in climax
meadows of the Sierra Nevada [<a href="#21">21</a>].

In the spring of 1972, there was a spill of diesel fuel in a subalpine
meadow on Mount Baker, Washington.  The estimated prespill cover of
spike bentgrass was minute.  All plants were killed by the diesel fuel.
Spike bentgrass was not found in a survey of the area conducted in 1980
[<a href="#3">3</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Agrostis exarata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Spike bentgrass is a native, perennial bunchgrass.  Culms are slender
and erect, usually 3.3 to 5 feet (1-1.5 m) tall [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  The
blades are ascending to spreading, 0.08 to 0.4 inch (2-10 mm) wide, and
up to 8 inches (20 cm) long [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  The panicle is narrow, open to
spikelike, and 4 to 10 inches (10-25 cm) tall [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  Spike bentgrass
occasionally develops slender rhizomes [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Spike bentgrass reproduces primarily by seed but may also spread
laterally by rhizomes [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Seeds colonize recently disturbed sites
that have exposed mineral soil seedbeds [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Spike bentgrass occurs in a wide variety of habitats including
woodlands, forest openings, grasslands, shrublands, meadows, marshes,
and stream and lake margins [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  It is most commonly found in
moist open places [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>] but is also found in dry habitats such as
semiarid grasslands [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Spike bentgrass grows on disturbed sites
such as ditches and along roadsides [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  Spike bentgrass occurs
from sea level to alpine zones [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  It occupies sites as
high as 10,500 feet (3,150 m) in Utah [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Spike bentgrass grows well on soils derived from schists, limestones,
sandstones, and conglomerates [<a href="#32">32</a>].



<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Spike bentgrass is generally a pioneer species.  It is relatively shade
intolerant and thrives in open, sunny locations [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Seed becomes
established on bare mineral soil.  Seedlings of spike bentgrass become
established on old-growth forests that have been recently harvested
[<a href="#13">13</a>].  Once spike bentgrass becomes established, it may remain important
throughout the early seral stages [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Spike bentgrass is a component
of relatively undisturbed riparian communities in Colorado [<a href="#2">2</a>].  In the
Sierra Nevada, spike bentgrass may occur in climax meadow vegetation
[<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Spike bentgrass flowers from June to August [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  Seed ripens and
sheds during August and September, depending on altitude [<a href="#24">24</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Agrostis exarata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
No information was available in the literature concerning spike
bentgrass fire ecology or adaptations.  However, a similar species,
ticklegrass (Agrostis scabra), colonizes bare mineral soil on recently
burned sites and may store seeds in the soil for short durations,
allowing for early establishment of areas burned in the spring (see the
FEIS write-up for Agrostis scabra).


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tussock graminoid
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<pre>
<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Agrostis exarata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Grasses are generally top-killed by fire so spike bentgrass is probably
top-killed by fire.  Specific fire effects, however, are not described
in the literature.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
No specific information on spike bentgrass response to fire is available
in the literature.  Ticklegrass, a similar species, increases in
abundance in response to fire (see the FEIS write-up for Agrostis
scabra).


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Since spike bentgrass is considered a decreaser species when overgrazed
[<a href="#21">21</a>], fire plans may have to be coordinated with grazing management to
ensure seedling establishment.
