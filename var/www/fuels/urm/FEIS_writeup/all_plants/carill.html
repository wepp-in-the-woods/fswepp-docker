<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carya illinoensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Pecan grows principally in the bottomlands of the Mississippi River
valley.  Its range extends westard from southern Indiana through
Illinois, southeastern Iowa, and eastern Kansas, south to central Texas,
and eastward to western Mississippi and western Tennessee.  Pecan occurs
locally in southwestern Ohio, Kentucky, Alabama, and central Mexico.
Its best commercial development is on river-front lands of the
Mississippi Delta and along major rivers west of the Delta to Texas
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Pecan is cultivated in Hawaii [<a href="#25">25</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carya illinoensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Pecan wood is inferior to that of other hickories and is not important
commercially.  It is occasionally used for furniture, flooring,
agricultural implements, tool handles, and fuel [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Pecan nuts are eaten by a number of bird species, fox and gray
squirrels, opposums, racoons, and peccaries [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  White-tailed deer
sometimes heavily browse older pecan trees [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Pecan provides cover for a variety of birds and mammals in the
oak-hickory forests of southeastern United States [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Pecan has been successfully planted on surface-mined lands of Indiana,
Oklahoma, and Missouri [<a href="#3">3</a>].  The deep, lateral roots can provide
excellent watershed protection [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Pecan is widely planted as an ornamental, and for its sweet edible nuts.
The nuts have a high percentage of fat and are used extensively in
candies and cookies [<a href="#20">20</a>].  The leaves and bark are sometimes used as an
astringent [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Pecan seedling establishment is difficult due to small mammals pilfering
seed and girdling seedlings [<a href="#24">24</a>].  A number of small insects attack
pecan but rarely become epidemic [<a href="#18">18</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carya illinoensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Pecan is a long-lived, medium to large, native, deciduous tree ranging
from 100 to 150 feet (30-45 m) in height and 6 to 7 feet (1.8-2.1 m) in
diameter [<a href="#5">5</a>].  The gray trunk is shallowly furrowed and flat-ridged with
ascending branches forming an irregular, rounded crown.  The twigs are
gray brown and hairy when young but become rough and furrowed on mature
trees.  Flowers are borne in staminate and pistillate catkins.
Staminate catkins are in threes and bear small green flowers;
seed-bearing flowers occur singly or a few at the end of new growth.
The leaves are narrow, pointed, and curved at the tip with tooth margins
yellow-green above and paler below.  The nut is brown, cylindric,
thin-shelled, and enveloped in a four-winged husk [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Seed production and dissemination:  Seed production starts when the
trees are about 20 years old, but optimum seed-bearing age is 75 to 225
years.  The trees bear fair to good crops almost every year.  A mature
tree yields about 100 pounds (40 kg) of nuts per year.  The seed is
disseminated by water, squirrels, and birds [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].

Seedling development:  Under normal conditions, pecan nuts remain
dormant until germination starts in early April.  Exceptionally dry
weather or heavy competition greatly reduces seedling survival.  Under
favorable condition, pecan seedlings grow 3 feet (0.9 m) per year after
they have been established for several years [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Small stumps and fire-girdled seedlings and
saplings sprout very rapidly.  Horticultural varieties of pecan are
propagated by budding and stem grafting [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Pecan is most common on well-drained loamy soils not subjected to
prolonged flooding.  Throughout its range it is largely limited to
bottom alluvial soils of relatively recent origin.  Its best development
is on riverfront ridges and well-drained flats [<a href="#18">18</a>].  It rarely grows on
low and poorly drained clay flats; it is usually replaced by water
hickory (Carya aquatica) on these sites [<a href="#1">1</a>].

In addition to the species listed in the SAF cover types, common tree
associates of pecan include slippery elm (Ulmus rubra), sugarberry
(Celtis laevigata), box elder (Acer negundo), silver maple (A.
saccharinum), roughleaf dogwood (Cornus drummondii), and swamp-privet
(Forestiera acuminata).  Common understory components include pawpaw
(Asimina triloba), giant cane (Arundinaria gigantea), and pokeweed
(Phytolacca americana).  Vines often present are poison-ivy
(Toxicodendron radicans), grape (Vitis spp.), Alabama supplejack
(Berchemia scandens), greenbriers (Smilax spp.), and Japanese
honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Pecan is classified as shade intolerant but is more shade tolerant than
cottonwood or willow.  It responds well to release in all age groups,
provided that the trees have good vigor.  Pecan is a subclimax species
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Pecan flowers from March to May about a week after the leaves have
started to open.  The nuts mature from September to October; seedfall
begins in September and ends in December [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carya illinoensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Pecan is susceptible to fire damage at all ages because of the low
insulating capacity of the bark [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by animals or water; postfire yr 1&2

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carya illinoensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Light fires will kill the tops of small pecan trees and saplings.  Heavy
burns may kill trees 10 to 12 inches (25-30 cm) d.b.h. and wound others,
providing entries for serious butt-rotting fungi.  Particularly hot
fires may kill mature pecan trees [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Pecan will sprout from the stump after aboveground portions are killed
by fire [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Periodic fires in late spring and early summer effectively controlled
pecan growth in the Mississippi River Basin, killing most of the
seedling reproduction [<a href="#24">24</a>].
