<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lespedeza bicolor
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Bicolor lespedeza provides good cover for birds and small mammals [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].
It is often planted as food for northern bobwhite and other upland game
birds [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  On the Alabama Piedmont, the seeds of bicolor lespedeza
comprised nearly 34.1 percent of the total food volume consumed by
northern bobwhite [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Rabbits eat the bark in the winter.  When
planting bicolor lespedeza for wildlife food, direct seeding in the
field is more successful than transplanting seedlings [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Bicolor
lespedeza has been grown in Japan for hay production.  Yields and
quality are good [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Bicolor lespedeza seeds are high in protein content but are generally
low in digestibility [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Nutritional values of aerial parts of fresh,
immature and fresh, early bloom to full-bloom bicolor lespedeza are fair
to poor.  Some nutritional values (percent) are listed below [<a href="#22">22</a>]:

                aerial part, fresh immature     fresh, early bloom

calcium                 1.63                         1.57

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Bicolor lespedeza is a nitrogen-fixing legume planted for wildlife
habitat improvement, erosion control, and stabilization along
streambanks and steep slopes [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  In the East it grows rapidly,
and its leaves produce a heavy soil-protecting mulch.  Nursery stock and
field seedings of about 10 pounds per acre (1.5 kg/ha) are used for
wildlife habitat enhancement and erosion control [<a href="#14">14</a>].  It has been
planted on infertile acidic soils in the lower Coastal Plain of
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and in the Piedmont of North
Carolina and Virginia [<a href="#17">17</a>].  It has also been planted on sandy soils of
eastern Texas [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Establishment is usually most rapid and assured by
planting seedlings but can also be accomplished by direct seeding.
Normally, seed is mixed and sown with herbaceous species [<a href="#29">29</a>].

The cultivator 'Natob' is an early maturing, hardy, geographic strain of
bicolor lespedeza.  'Natob' is more winter hardy than any other
lespedeza shrub grown in this country [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].  This culitvator is
recommended where the growing season is 145 days or longer and the first
frost is September 25 or later.  Its seed yield is about 350 pounds per
acre (52.9 kg/ha) in most parts of the recommended area [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Bicolor lespedza is a good source of pollen for honey bees [<a href="#14">14</a>].  It is
often planted as an ornamental in the southeastern United States [<a href="#25">25</a>].
Tryptophane-derived alkaloids having uterus-contracting or halucinogenic
properties have been isolated in Japanese laboratories from Lespedeza
bicolor var. japonic [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Bicolor lespedeza can interfere with initial tree growth and survival
and make later management operations difficult [<a href="#17">17</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lespedeza bicolor
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bicolor lespedeza is an introduced, large, leguminous, deciduous shrub
ranging in height from 4 to 10 feet (1.2-3 m) [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  It has an upright
spreading stem with many slender branches [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  The leaves are
rounded 0.79 to 2 inches (2-5 cm) long [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Bicolor lespedeza has no
taproot but does have a much branched, well-nodulated, lateral root
system [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction:  Bicolor lespedeza is easily propogated by seed.
The flowers are self-pollinated or cross-pollinated by honeybees,
bumblebees, and other insects [<a href="#29">29</a>].  The fruit is a one-seeded,
indehiscent pod [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Seeds are stored in the seed bank or ingested by
birds and dispersed in their droppings [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Invitro bicolor
lespedeza seeds immersed in water for 16 hours at room temperature
required at least 3 days to germinate.  Germination was 10 percent after
3 days and 30 percent after 7 days [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Germination is enhanced by
scarification [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Seeds may remain viable for up to 20 years if
stored at 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 deg C) and 40 percent relative
humidity [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Bicolor lespedeza will sprout from the root
crown after top-kill [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bicolor lespedeza is found in fields, open woodlands, clearings, fence
and hedge rows, and along roadsides [<a href="#13">13</a>].  It occurs at elevations from
sea level to 2,500 feet (762 m) [<a href="#30">30</a>].  It is capable of maintaining
itself on acidic (lower pH limit 4.5) nutrient-poor soils [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  It
is not frost tolerant and is often killed to the ground where the date
of the first killing frost is September 30 or earlier [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Bicolor
lespedeza is somewhat shade tolerant [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Bicolor lespedeza is a colonizer of early- to mid-seral grassland and
some open forest communities after disturbance.  It is most abundant in
communities that are frequently disturbed and may become the dominant
species in these areas [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Bicolor lespedeza abundance will gradually
decrease in the absence of disturbance.  Bicolor lespedeza densities
generally remain high in areas with a disturbance regime of 4 years
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Bicolor lespedeza generally flowers in July and August, but flowering
begins as early as June in Mississippi and as late as September in
Maryland [<a href="#29">29</a>].  The fruit ripens in late September to late October
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  The pods fall to the ground when ripe and most of them are down
by early winter [<a href="#29">29</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Bicolor lespedeza will sprout from the root crown following top-kill
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Both on-site, fire-scarified seeds and off-site seeds are
important sources for colonizing burned areas [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by animals or water; postfire yr 1&2
   Ground residual colonizer (onsite, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lespedeza bicolor
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire may top-kill bicolor lespedeza.  High-severity fires may consume
seeds stored in the seed bank and destroy underground portions of the
plant.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Bicolor lespedeza generally increases in density under a frequent
burning regime (4 years) [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>] because it sprouts from the root crown
after top-kill [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>] and establishes new individuals from both on-
and off-site seed sources [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
On a site cleared and burned every 4 years since 1962 in the Georgia
Piedmont, bicolor lespedeza density was 1,529 per acre (619/ha) compared
to 0 on an adjacent site with no previous burning history [<a href="#5">5</a>].  The
effects of burning, fertilizing and a combination of both on the plant
community in the Alabama Piedmont was studied.  The extent of coverage
of bicolor lespedeza on the various treated sites is as follows [<a href="#26">26</a>]:

Unburned and unfertilized= 0.01
Fertilized only= 0.16
Burned only (4 year interval)= 0.73
Burned and fertilized= 0.60

Bicolor lespedeza spread into the woods as a result of regular burning
on the North Auburn area and on a large Piedmont private quail preserve
in Alabama.  On these areas it has become the dominant understory
species [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Bicolor lespedeza germination has been shown to increase with dry heat
treatments of up to 194 degrees Fahrenheit (90 deg C).  The percent
germination of bicolor lespedeza seed treated with dry heat during the
summer of 1966 was as follows [<a href="#9">9</a>]:

                              Dry heat (degrees C)
          Control        45   60   70   80   90   100   110
             
(% germ)    4            44   68   80   100  100   0     0       
          


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Prescribed fire can increase bicolor lespedeza density [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>] and
consequently improve the habitat for northern bobwhite and other game
birds.  Nitrogen is a main soil nutrient lost during fire [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Because
bicolor lespedeza is a nitrogen-fixing plant, it can be planted on
burned sites to restore nitrogen to the soil [<a href="#17">17</a>].
