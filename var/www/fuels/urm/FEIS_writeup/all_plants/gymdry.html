<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Gymnocarpium dryopteris
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Oak fern has a circumboreal distribution [<a href="#16">16</a>].  In North America it
occurs form Alaska south to isolated populations in Oregon and east
across all provinces of Canada to the Atlantic Coast.  It occurs
throughout New England south to Virginia and west to Ohio.  Scattered
populations are found in the northern Midwest states of Wisconsin,
Michigan, and Minnesota, and it reaches as far south as Iowa.  Oak fern
also occurs in isolated populations of the Intermountain West and in New
Mexico and Arizona [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Gymnocarpium dryopteris ssp. disjunctum is
found along the West Coast and in parts of Idaho and eastern Washington
[<a href="#18">18</a>].

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Because of its ease and success at transplanting, oak fern is a desirable
garden plant [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Oak fern can interfere with the growth of Engelmann spruce (Picea
engelmanni) seedlings [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Glyphosate can injur oak fern when applied
from July to September [<a href="#26">26</a>].  It controls growth of oak fern following
harvesting, allowing growth of desired tree species.  Oak fern responses
to logging vary.  In areas where logging leads to decreases in site
moisture, oak fern will decrease [<a href="#8">8</a>].  In wet, high-elevation areas
logging can increase oak fern abundance [<a href="#25">25</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Gymnocarpium dryopteris
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
The deciduous oak fern is delicate in appearance and grows up to 11.8
inches (30 cm) tall [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Its petioles are 4 to 12 inches (10-30 cm)
long and parallel to the ground [<a href="#21">21</a>].  The blade is divided into three
triangular leaflets [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Each petiole arises from a single node on the
creeping rhizome [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Spore covers are absent [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Oak fern reproduces by spores and sprouts from rhizomes. The spores are
adapted for high wind dispersal [<a href="#18">18</a>].  There is much outcrossing in this
species, and no intragametophytic fertilization [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Spores have been
found in soil seedbanks where adult plants are absent [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Spores have
sprouted in a greenhouse from soil samples taken from beneath canopy
gaps in northern hardwood forests [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Oak fern occurs on mesic to wet sites in mixed conifer and northern
hardwood stands [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Soils are moist to well-drained, with pH ranging
from 4.5 to 6.4 [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  Soil textures are gravelly or sandy to silty
clay loams [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].  Oak fern grows at elevations from 21 to 1,700 feet
(7-518 m) in the Adirondacks [<a href="#20">20</a>].  In Alberta it occurs from 1,960 to
4,300 feet (600-1,300 m), and in Idaho oak fern occurs at elevations
between 2,500 and 4,500 feet (760-1,370 m) [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].  Oak fern occurs on
moderately steep slopes and northeast to north and west aspects [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].

Some plant species associated with oak fern include Alaska-cedar
(Chamaecyparis nootkatensis), devil's club (Oplopanax horridus), alder
(Alnus spp.), mountain maple (Acer spicatum), red-osier dogwood (Cornus
sericea), twinberry honeysuckle (Lonicera involucrata), thimbleberry
(Rubus parviflorus), prickly rose (Rosa acicularis), highbush cranberry
(Viburnum edule), twinflower (Linnaea borealis), heartleaf arnica
(Arnica cordifolia), starry Solomon's-seal (Smilacina stellata), and
bluejoint reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis) [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Oak fern is an indicator of cool, moist sites and mid- to late-seral
forests [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>]. Oak fern will grow on disturbed sites before
canopy cover is established in the subboreal spruce (Picea) zone of
British Columbia [<a href="#14">14</a>].  It is present in that zone in both mesic seral
communities and climax forests.  Similarly, in spruce-hemlock (Tsuga)
forests of southeast Alaska oak fern will begin establishing in 25- to
35-year-old stands following disturbance by logging or fire [<a href="#1">1</a>].  They
will then dominate the understory for the following century.  Oak fern
has been used as a site-quality indicator species on lodgepole pine
(Pinus contorta) and white spruce (Picea alba) stands in west-central
Alberta [<a href="#34">34</a>].  It is also used as a secondary indicator of slope
instability in grand fir (Abies grandis)/pachistima (Pachistima
myrsinites) habitat types on the Clearwater National Forest, Idaho [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Oak fern unfolds its fronds in early spring [<a href="#6">6</a>] and senesces in autumn
[<a href="#16">16</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Gymnocarpium dryopteris
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Oak fern has rhizomes which may allow it to sprout following fire [<a href="#25">25</a>].
Because spores are stored in the soil seedbank, fires that do not damage
upper soil layers may not permanently eliminate oak fern from an area.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Gymnocarpium dryopteris
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire can topkill oak fern, and repeated burning can significantly reduce
it's frequency [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
In white spruce climax forests of Alaska, light surface fires usually do
not affect understory species composition, of which oak fern is a part
[<a href="#22">22</a>].  However, stand-replacement fires that completely eliminate white
spruce result in early seral communities where oak fern is not present.
In cedar-hemlock forests of northern Idaho, oak fern successively
decreased in abundance on sites that were logged, slashpile-burned,
broadcast burned once, and burned two or more times over a 30-year
period [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Oak fern appears to decrease in constancy and/or cover following logging
and burning [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
In the East Slope Region of central Alberta, oak fern is not present
until the climax stages of succession following fire [<a href="#9">9</a>].  On severely
burned sites in northern Idaho (where all trees and groundlayer
vegetation was consumed), oak fern appeared in the third postfire year
only [<a href="#32">32</a>].  This occurence was rare because oak fern is not considered a
fire-surviving species.  In the subboreal spruce zone of British
Columbia, oak fern was present within 10 years following fire on four
sites ranging from fairly dry to wet [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Fires were broadcast burns
following logging, and its effects on specific plants were not studied
at the time of the fire.
