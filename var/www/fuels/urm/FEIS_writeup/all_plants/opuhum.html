<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Eastern prickly-pear cactus flourishes in open desert areas where other
vegetation is lacking [<a href="#1">1</a>].  It is also prominent in seabeach and other
dune communities [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Conover [<a href="#8">8</a>] lists eastern prickly-pear cactus as an
indicator species of prairie habitat.  It has not been listed as an
indicator of dominance or subdominance in habitat typings.

Associated species:  Eastern prickly-pear cactus is not associated with the
presence of any one species or genera of other plants, except those also
occurring in open areas [<a href="#2">2</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Opuntia humifusa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
The stems and fruits of eastern prickly-pear are eaten by the ornate box turtle,
endangered in Wisconsin [<a href="#7">7</a>], various birds, rodents, and lagomorphs
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>], white-tailed deer [<a href="#23">23</a>], and all classes of livestock [<a href="#28">28</a>].
Rodents also consume roots and seeds [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The stems of spiny phenotypes are generally preferred by livestock and
wildlife species when young, before spines mature [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Eastern prickly-pear cactus is poor forage for livestock [<a href="#15">15</a>].  The nutritional
value of fresh, immature eastern prickly-pear stems in the United States is as
follows [<a href="#21">21</a>]:

      Percent Composition         Percent Digestible Protein
     ash            2.6                 cattle    0.5       
     crude fiber    1.2                 horses    0.4
     protein        0.9                 rabbits   0.5
                                        sheep     0.5


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Snakes and lizards use eastern prickly-pear cactus for shade cover.  Various
birds sometimes nest among the stems, where spines aid in protecting
eggs and nestlings from predators [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Eastern prickly-pear cactus can be useful in wildlife habitat and other
restoration projects.  An eastern prickly-pear population was established from
nursery-germinated seedlings on a sand and gravel borrow-pit reclamation
site in Greene County, Ohio [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Eastern prickly-pear cactus is also easily
established from stem cuttings, which are buried to approximately
three-fifths of their length to promote optimum rooting [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Humans eat eastern prickly-pear fruits [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].  Native Americans consumed the
fresh and dried fruits of eastern prickly-pear cactus, and roasted and ate the
stems.  The mucilaginous stem sap was used as a wound dressing [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Eastern prickly-pear cactus is sometimes used for emergency forage on depleted
ranges.  It does not provide a maintenence diet for cattle [<a href="#15">15</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Opuntia humifusa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Eastern prickly-pear is a native, low clump- or mat-forming cactus, usually 3 to
4 inches (7.5-10 cm) in height.  It occasionally grows to 12 inches (30
cm) in height in Florida.  The succulent stems or pads are from 1.5 to
4 inches (3.8-10 cm) long and from 1.6 to 2.4 inches (4-6 cm) wide.
Zero to two spines are found on the upper areoles of stems.  Fruits are
fleshy and persist until spring.  The fiberous roots lack prominent
tubercules [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Stem succulent


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Eastern prickly-pear cactus reproduces by seed.  Seed is disseminated
when seed-bearing fruits drop from mature stems in spring [<a href="#2">2</a>], or by
frugiverous birds and mammals.  Clustered populations of eastern prickly-pear are
sometimes established when ground squirrels gather seed from animal
droppings and store them in caches [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Germination is slow in this
genus [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Flowers are produced at 2 years of age [<a href="#8">8</a>], and are
pollinated by insects [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Vegetative:  Eastern prickly-pear cactus reproduces asexually from semiprostrate
stems, which root in soil [<a href="#29">29</a>].  The genus can sprout from the caudex
when the aboveground portion of the plant is destroyed [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Eastern prickly-pear cactus grows on open, sunny, dry flats or south-facing
exposures with up to a 50 degree slope.  Soils vary from organic
detritus to shale-loam, sandy loam, coastal beachland and Lakewood sand.
The species tolerates low-nutrient, acid, and alkaline soils [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Eastern prickly-pear cactus colonizes disturbed sites and may persist through
late seral stages of plant succession.  It colonizes bare coastal dunes
in some areas of the Northeast [<a href="#27">27</a>].  On the dunes of southern Lake
Michigan, it appears in early seral stages, where it invades the
beachgrass (Ammophilia breviligulata)-prairie sandreed (Calamovilfa
longifolia) communities of young dunes.  It is found in late seral,
shrub-populated dunes on the shores of western Lake Michigan [<a href="#22">22</a>], and
in climax sand sage (Artemisia filifolia) communities in northeastern
Colorado [<a href="#24">24</a>].  It is probably a relict in climax communities, however.
Eastern prickly-pear is shade-intolerant [<a href="#17">17</a>] and is generally replaced by other
species in advanced stages of succession [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Eastern prickly-pear cactus produces flowers and fruits year-round in semiarid
regions of the Southwest [<a href="#19">19</a>].  In southwestern Wisconsin, flowers
appear in June, fruits ripen in late summer and fall, and drop in early
spring [<a href="#7">7</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Opuntia humifusa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fire information is lacking for this species.  Opuntia spp. sprout from
the root crown and from surviving stems following light fire [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Prickly
pear cactus colonizes burned areas when off-site seed is transported
on-site by animals [<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species;  on-site surviving root crown
   off-site colonizer;  seed carries by animals or water; postfire yr 1&2
   secondary colonizer;  off-site seed carried to site after year 2

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Opuntia humifusa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Moderate-severity fire kills Opuntia spp.  Some portions of stem may
survive light-severity fire [<a href="#3">3</a>].  


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Mortality of fire-weakened surviving cacti may be high the first 3
postfire years.  A closely related species, brownspine eastern prickly-pear (O.
phaecantha), experienced high die-off following light-severity fire in
Callahan County, Texas.  Initial fire mortality was 20 percent.  Insects
entered surviving plants through fire-scarred tissue, spreading
bacterial and fungal infections.  New sprouts appeared within a few
weeks following the fire, but many sprouting plants lost their vascular
connection to the root because of insect damage and decay.  By the end
of the third year, mortality exceeded 70 percent.  Most plants surviving
through postfire year 3 had sprouted from the caudex [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Frequent fire reduces populations of small Opuntia species like prickly
pear cactus [<a href="#3">3</a>].
