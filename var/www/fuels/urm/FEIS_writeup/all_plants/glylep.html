<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Wild licorice occurs in a variety of habitats but is most often found in
prairie and other grassland communities or riparian areas.  On native
tallgrass prairie in eastern North Dakota, wild licorice is a member of
three community types:  bluegrass-bluestem-needlegrass (Poa
spp.-Andropogon spp.-Stipa spp.), bromegrass (Bromus spp.)-bluegrass,
and bluegrass-sweetclover (Melilotus spp.).  Associated plant species in
these communities include Louisiana sagewort (Artemisia ludoviciana),
western snowberry (Symphoricarpos occidentalis), field sowthistle
(Sonchus arvensis), heath aster (Aster ericoides), and northern bedstraw
(Galium boreale) [<a href="#15">15</a>].  On mixed-grass prairie in North Dakota, wild
licorice occurs in two community types:  big bluestem-Indian grass
(Andropogon gerardii var. gerardii-Sorghastrum nutans) and a lowland
forb community dominated by Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus
maximiliani), Canada goldenrod (Solidago canadensis), and prairie
dogbane (Apocynum sibericum) [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Wild licorice is a member of the
plains cottonwood (Populus deltoides), quaking aspen-birch (P.
tremuloides-Betula spp.), and Rocky Mountain juniper (Juniperus
scopulorum) community types in western North Dakota [<a href="#41">41</a>].

In South Dakota, wild licorice occurs in grasslands of the Black Hills
[<a href="#40">40</a>].  

Wild licorice occurs in riparian areas dominated by plains cottonwood in
Colorado, North Dakota, and Utah [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Some common plant
associates in eastern Colorado include sandbar willow (Salix exigua),
peachleaf willow (S. amygdaloides), saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissima),
Wood's rose (Rosa woodsii), eastern poison-ivy (Toxicodendron radicans),
Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia), and western wheatgrass
(Pascopyrum smithii) [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Wild licorice is eaten by deer and pronghorn [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  It is grazed in
the summer and early fall by mule deer in Colorado [<a href="#7">7</a>].  In the Great
Plains, wild licorice roots are eaten by plains pocket gophers, foliage
is eaten by deer and pronghorn, and seeds are eaten by birds and rodents
[<a href="#7">7</a>].  In Utah and Wyoming, wild licorice is eaten by deer, elk,
pronghorn, upland game birds, passerine birds, waterfowl, and small
mammals [<a href="#46">46</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability ratings for wild licorice from selected western states are
as follows [<a href="#45">45</a>]:

horses           poor      poor      poor      poor      fair



<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Wild licorice is rated poor in nutritional value for pronghorn and fair
for elk, mule deer, white-tailed deer, upland game birds, waterfowl,
small nongame birds, and small mammals [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Energy rating is fair and
protein content is poor [<a href="#46">46</a>].  


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Wild licorice cover values are as follows [<a href="#46">46</a>]:

In South Dakota, wild licorice is used for shade by sharp-tailed grouse
during the brood season [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Wild licorice has good potential for revegation of disturbed and denuded
lands [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>], but may be difficult to establish due to restrictive
habitat requirements [<a href="#17">17</a>].  It has good soil-binding capabilities and
can be used for soil stabilization [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  In North Dakota, wild
licorice was directly seeded and container-grown seedlings were
transplanted onto coal mine spoils.  Both methods resulted in the
production of successful stands of wild licorice, although the
transplant method resulted in more rapid growth of seedlings.  Estimated
number of seedlings produced in one growing season on mine spoil plots
was 22.3 per square foot (248/sq m) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Native Americans of the Great Plains used wild licorice for medicinal
and nutritional purposes.  The Lakota used wild licorice as a fever
remedy for children.  Steeped leaves were used for earaches, and the
roots were chewed and held in the mouth to relieve toothaches and sore
throats.  The roots were also eaten for nourishment [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

The sweet roots of wild licorice contain glycyrrhizin, which is used by
druggists and confectioners [<a href="#22">22</a>].  


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Wild licorice has potential as a valuable forage and conservation
species throughout the Great Plains.  However, three species of the
bruchid beetle may have substantial impacts on seed production of wild
licorice.  The bruchid beetle seed predators are Acanthoscelides
aureolus, A. fraterculus, and Bruchophagus grisselli [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  In North
and South Dakota, seed predation by A. fraterculus reduced viable seed
production by 7 to 71 percent [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Wild licorice can become a serious weed on fertile soils in Arizona
[<a href="#20">20</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Glycyrrhiza lepidota
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Wild licorice is a native, perennial, leguminous forb that grows from 1
to 4 feet (0.3-1.2 m) tall [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  It may form colonies by
adventitious shoots from roots and deep-seated rhizomes
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Rhizomes are many-branched and may grow up to several
feet long [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Leaves are 0.8 to 2.8 inches (2-7 cm) long and 0.16 to
0.8 inch (4-20 mm) wide [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  Legumes are indehiscent, sessile, and
bur-like with hooked prickles, and are O.4 to 0.6 inch (12-15 mm) long
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  Seeds are 0.08 to 0.12 inch (2-3 mm) long [<a href="#44">44</a>].  

In addition to rhizomes, wild licorice has an extensive system of deep,
fleshy roots [<a href="#42">42</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Vegetative:  Wild licorice spreads vigorously by sprouting from rhizomes
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

Sexual:  Wild licorice produces abundant seeds with relatively low
germination rates, which can be increased with scarification [<a href="#37">37</a>].
Seeds were collected from native ranges in western North Dakota.  Three
storage treatments were applied to separate lots of seed.  Germination
results (in %) were [<a href="#2">2</a>]:

 room Temp storage            dry cold storage           wet cold storage
Jan Feb Mar Apr May          Jan Feb Mar Apr May        Jan Feb Mar Apr May

The hooked prickles of wild licorice seedpods adhere to animals so the
fruits are widely dispersed [<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Wild licorice occurs in fields, meadows, borrow ditches, and along
roadsides [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  It occurs in open, unshaded areas on
disturbed soils [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  It is a facultative wetland species, most
commonly found in moist areas such as terraces, seeps, streambanks, wet
meadows, floodplains, and along lakeshores [17,37,43,46,,47].

Wild licorice grows best on moist to semiwet soils with good drainage
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  It grows best on loam, sandy loam, and clayey loam soils,
but occurs on gravelly substrates as well [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  

Elevations for wild licorice for several states are as follows:

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Wild licorice is probably top-killed by fire.  At the Woodworth Station
in North Dakota, a mixed-grass prairie was burned in May 1970 to
determine the effect of fire on wildlife populations.  Wild licorice was
a component of the prairie that was burned.  During postfire year 1,
wild licorice was reported as showing "no change" in percent cover, that
is, cover change was between +99% and -49% [<a href="#21">21</a>].  In North Dakota, a
bluegrass-sweetclover prairie containing wild licorice was burned in
1964; the following year, herbage production on burned and unburned
plots was comparable [<a href="#15">15</a>].
