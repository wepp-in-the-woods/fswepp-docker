<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name for bigtooth aspen is Populus
grandidentata Michx. (Salicaceae) [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  Bigtooth aspen, along with five
other aspen species, has been assigned to the subsection Trepidae of
the section Leuce in the genus Populus.  Because of their similarities,
these six species are sometimes considered a single super species [<a href="#44">44</a>].
Bigtooth aspen and quaking aspen (P. tremuloides) are the only two North
American aspen species.

In literature concerning areas where both North American aspen species
occur, many authors do not distinguish between bigtooth aspen and
quaking aspen.  The information is reported about "aspen" in general.
In this writeup, "aspen" is used when citing studies in which both
species are discussed collectively.

Bigtooth aspen naturally hybridizes with the following species [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>]:

   x P. tremuloides:  P. xsmithii Boivin
   x P. alba (white poplar):  P. xrouleauiana Boivin

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Bigtooth aspen usually grows in even-aged mixed stands, most commonly
with quaking aspen [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  It is a codominant tree in both hardwood
and conifer forests [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Bigtooth aspen does not occur as a subdominant
species because of its extreme shade intolerance [<a href="#38">38</a>].

Quaking aspen is the predominant species in aspen stands in the
Northeast and Great Lakes Region, but bigtooth aspen dominates
on the drier upland sites [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Aspen stands dominated by bigtooth
aspen are generally more open than those dominated by quaking aspen
[<a href="#17">17</a>].

Overstory associates not previously mentioned in DISTRIBUTION AND
OCCURRENCE include balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera), bur oak (Quercus
macrocarpa), white oak (Q. alba), basswood (Tilia americana), black
cherry (Prunus serotina), and sassafras (Sassafras albidum) [<a href="#29">29</a>].

A tall shrub layer is an important component of aspen forests [<a href="#35">35</a>].
Shrub associates include chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), downy
serviceberry (Amelanchier arborea), dogwood (Cornus spp.), willow (Salix
spp.), beaked hazel (Corylus cornuta), speckled alder (Alnus rugosa),
American hazel (Corylus americana), and sweetfern (Comptonia peregrina)
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].

Bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum) and dwarf bush-honeysuckle (Diervilla
lonicera) are frequent subdominant understory species in bigtooth aspen
stands [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].

Bigtooth aspen is listed as a dominant or codominant species in the
following publications:

1.  Wilderness Ecology:  virgin plant communities of the Boundary Waters
      Canoe Area [<a href="#35">35</a>] 
2.  Aspen association in northern lower Michigan [<a href="#17">17</a>]

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Populus grandidentata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Bigtooth aspen wood is light colored, straight grained, finely textured,
and soft.  It is primarily used for pulp, but is also used to make
particle board and structural panels.  Minor uses include log homes,
pallets, boxes, match splints, chopsticks, hockey stick components, and
ladders [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].

Bigtooth aspen bark is pelletized for fuel and supplemental cattle feed
[<a href="#29">29</a>].



<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Bigtooth aspen provides food and cover for wildlife.  Moose and
white-tailed deer browse bigtooth aspen [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  Beaver eat bark,
leaves, twigs, and branches [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Aspen provides the basic habitat for ruffed grouse over much of its
range.  Ruffed grouse feed on the leaves in the summer, staminate flower
buds in the winter, and catkins prior to the breeding season.  In
feeding, ruffed grouse prefer quaking aspen to bigtooth aspen [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Approximately 116 nongame bird species breed in aspen-birch (Betula
spp.) forests [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Cavity nesters use bigtooth aspen [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].  In a mixed hardwood forest
in central New York, bigtooth aspen accounted for 25 percent of the
trees with cavities although it made up only 12 percent of the potential
cavity trees sampled [<a href="#65">65</a>].



<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Bigtooth aspen leaves are highly palatable to ruffed grouse [<a href="#20">20</a>].



<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Dry-weight bigtooth aspen browse averages 5.0 percent protein, 3.4
percent ether extract, 14.8 percent crude fiber, and 26.6 percent
nitrogen-free extract [<a href="#61">61</a>]. The simulation of animal use by clipping did
not alter the nutritional quality of bigtooth aspen browse [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Other normal foliar nutrient levels have been reported [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Bigtooth aspen provides cover for ruffed grouse.  The best cover is
provided by 5- to 25-year-old sapling stands with 3,000 to 8,000 stems
per acre (7,000-20,000 stems/ha) [<a href="#20">20</a>].




<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Bigtooth aspen is of limited importance for revegetating coal mine
spoils.  Bigtooth aspen has been planted on mine spoils in Ohio and West
Virginia [<a href="#63">63</a>].

Bigtooth aspen naturally regenerated on acidic sites in Pennsylvania,
especially on sites where the soil had been ameliorated [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Bigtooth aspen regenerated naturally on barren, acidic,
metal-contaminated soil near Sudbury, Ontario.  The soil, contaminated
by smelter fallout, had been treated with a surface application of
limestone.  Bigtooth aspen apparently colonized the site from off-site
seed [<a href="#67">67</a>].



<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In the literature, the management of bigtooth aspen is rarely
distinguished from that of quaking aspen.

In order to regenerate a well-stocked vigorous aspen stand, the
overstory must be removed [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Removing apical dominance stimulates
aspen suckering [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].  If the parent stand is not harvested, it can
be removed by shearing, chainsaw felling, girdling, treating with
herbicide, or prescribed burning [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Discing and roller chipping
are not recommended because these techniques damage the roots [<a href="#41">41</a>].

For optimum sucker density the parent aspen stand must have had at
least 20 square feet basal area per acre (4.6 sq m/ha).  At age two, an
adequately stocked sucker stand exceeds 4,000 to 5,000 stems per acre
(10,000-12,000 stems/ha) [<a href="#41">41</a>].

Although aspen groves thin naturally, additional thinning improves
growth [<a href="#29">29</a>].  When thinning, bigtooth aspen should be favored over
quaking aspen because of its superior growth and resistance to disease
and insects, especially on dry sites [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Clones with superior
growth and stem form should also be favored.  Yields differ as much as
200 percent between clones on the same site [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Barnes [<a href="#7">7</a>] has
developed a list of characteristics to use when distinguishing between
clones in any given season.

Only one thinning is recommended for aspen forests managed for for pulp.
The stand should be thinned at age 30, leaving 240 trees per acre (590
trees/ha).  Two thinnings are recommended if sawtimber is desired, one
at age 10 leaving 550 trees per acre (1,360 trees/ha) and one at age 30
leaving 200 trees per acre (490 trees/ha).  The final cut should be
delayed for as long as the stand is healthy [<a href="#41">41</a>].

Repeated harvest of aspen on a site, especially by the whole-tree
method, may reduce long-term productivity [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Short-term rotation
management also reduces a stand's long-term health.  Repeated
short-rotation aspen harvest increases the colonization rate of
Armillaria root rot (Armillaria mellea) [<a href="#57">57</a>].

Regeneration failure of aspen occurs if roots have been damaged by
harvesting equipment.  Aspen harvested on flat or gently rolling sites
early in the summer may also have regeneration problems because of
saturated soils [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Genetic improvement research on aspen has been conducted in the past two
decades because of the increasing importance of aspen as a source of raw
material for the pulp and paper industries.  However, most recent work
has concentrated on quaking aspen [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Bigtooth aspen responded to fertilizer (nitrogen, phosphorus, and lime
in various combinations) with increased height, diameter, and volume
growth during the 10-year period following the treatments.  However,
mortality of quaking aspen fertilized with nitrogen suggests further
study is necessary before utilizing widespread fertilizer application in
bigtooth aspen stands [<a href="#49">49</a>].

Herbicides control bigtooth aspen [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].

Bigtooth aspen is more disease resistant than quaking aspen.  The most
serious disease of bigtooth aspen is Hypoxylon canker (Hypoxylon
mammatum) [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  Other rots, fungi, and root decay affect this
species [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Bigtooth aspen is a preferred host of gypsy moth.  Death
occurs when nearly complete defoliation by gypsy moth is followed by a
fungal infection by Armillaria spp. [<a href="#22">22</a>].

By cutting trees and damming waterways, beaver destroy large aspen
stands [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Biomass estimates have been reported for bigtooth aspen [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Populus grandidentata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bigtooth aspen is a native, short-lived, dioecious, medium-sized
deciduous tree with a straight trunk and gently ascending branches.  It
is distinguished from quaking aspen by slightly larger leaves and large
irregular teeth on the leaf edges.  The fruit is a two-valved capsule
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].

Bigtooth aspen is a rapidly growing tree.  At maturity, it attains
heights of 60 to 80 feet (18-24 m) and diameters at breast height of 8
to 10 inches (20-25 cm).  Stands begin to deteriorate after 50 to 70
years on good sites, but individuals may live as long as 100 years [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Bigtooth aspen is a clonal species.  Clones resemble small groves
consisting of many individual stems [<a href="#7">7</a>].

The roots of bigtooth aspen are shallow and wide spreading; the lateral
root spread of a tree in a forest may be 33 to 66 feet (10-20 m).
Generally, four to five lateral roots originate from the tree and then
branch within 2 feet (0.6 m).  Vertical, penetrating roots near the base
anchor the tree [<a href="#29">29</a>].

The bark of young trees is smooth, but after three or more decades, it
becomes rough and develops grooves [<a href="#7">7</a>].



<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Bigtooth aspen regenerates by seed and vegetative reproduction.

Bigtooth aspen is a prolific seed producer; a single tree may produce
more than 1.5 million seeds [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Bigtooth aspen generally has good or
better crops (greater than 61% of a full crop) 2 out of every 3 years
[<a href="#18">18</a>].  The light seeds are dispersed long distances by wind [<a href="#29">29</a>].
Germination rates are high [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Seeds germinate under a wide range
of temperatures as long as there is sufficient moisture.  They will even
germinate when submerged in water [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Despite high seed production
and high germination rates, seedling establishment is uncommon.  Few
seedlings reach more than a few inches in height.  Bare moist soil free
of competition is necessary for seedling establishment.  Short seed
viability (2-3 weeks) also limits establishment.  A seedling may grow 6
to 8 inches (15-20 cm) the first year [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].

Most bigtooth aspen forests regenerate vegetatively.  When the parent
tree is killed or the soil is heated, suckers develop from extensive,
shallow lateral roots.  Bigtooth aspen roots that produce suckers are
generally less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter and about 3 to 7 inches
(7.5-17.8 cm) deep.  A sucker grows 3 to 6 feet (0.9-1.8 m) the first
year, considerably more than a seedling.  After a mature aspen stand is
destroyed by fire or logging, roots may produce 3,200 to 24,000 suckers
per acre (8,000-60,000/ha) [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Root suckers are initially dependent
on the parent roots for water and nutrients.  Their dependence decreases
with time but is still substantial after 25 years.  By age 25, the
parent roots contribute the nutrient requirements for approximately half
the yearly growth [<a href="#68">68</a>].

Multiple suckers result in a clone, a multistemmed vegetatively
reproduced individual.  Interclonal differences can be substantial,
especially in sprouting ability [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  Within a stand, clones are
distinguished by sex, phenology, leaf morphology, disease resistance,
bark and stem differences, branching habits, and other characteristics
[<a href="#7">7</a>].

Sakai and Sharik [<a href="#51">51</a>] investigated the hypothesis that female bigtooth
aspen clones would invest energy in fruit production at the expense of
vegetative growth.  They found no significant differences (P>0.05) in
mean dbh or basal area density (basal area per unit clonal area) between
male and female clones.

The roots of bigtooth aspen may remain alive in a forest long after the
last tree has died.  The longevity of bigtooth aspen roots has not been
documented.  However, the roots of quaking aspen are known to persist in
the absence of an aspen canopy.  The roots are sustained by transient
suckers that survive only a few years [<a href="#54">54</a>].



<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bigtooth aspen most commonly occur on floodplains, gently rolling
terrain, and the lower slopes of uplands.  Large stands grow on sands,
loamy sands, and light sandy loams.  However, minor amounts of bigtooth
aspen are found growing on almost any type of soil [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Bigtooth
aspen has a lower soil pH limit of 4.0 [<a href="#63">63</a>].

Bigtooth aspen tolerates drier conditions than quaking aspen [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].
It has been classified as a subxeric species [<a href="#10">10</a>].  However, for good
growth on upland sites the watertable must be at least 2 feet (0.6 m),
but not more than 5 feet (1.5 m), below the ground surface.  The soil
must be moist but well aerated for good growth [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Bigtooth aspen ranges in elevation from sea level to over 3,000 feet (915
m) in North Carolina [<a href="#29">29</a>].



<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Bigtooth aspen is very shade intolerant [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>]. It is a pioneer
species on disturbed sites [<a href="#13">13</a>]. It persists in seral communities until
senescence.  Because of the tenacity and lateral extensiveness of its
roots, aspen is able to regenerate and dominate disturbed sites that
only had a minor aspen component in the original stand [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

Palik and Pregitzer [<a href="#38">38</a>] reported no evidence of past suppression nor
release of bigtooth aspen in a mature aspen forest.  They suggest that
most suppressed bigtooth aspen stems die.

The rapid height growth of bigtooth aspen suckers allows it to
outcompete other sprouting species such as northern red oak (Quercus
rubra) and red maple (Acer rubrum) on many sites.  Another reason for
bigtooth aspen's propensity to dominate a site after disturbance is the
large amount of space its lateral roots occupy.  Oaks (Quercus spp.) and
maples (Acer spp.) are generally limited to stump and root crown sprouts
[<a href="#38">38</a>].

In the absence of disturbance, bigtooth aspen is replaced by conifers
and hardwoods.  On dry sites aspen is replaced by red pine (Pinus
resinosa), oak, and red maple; on intermediate sites by eastern white
pine (Pinus strobus); and on mesic sites by northern hardwoods, spruce
(Picea spp.), and fir (Abies spp.) [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].

In the Great Lakes Region at the turn of the century, many mature pine
forests were logged and burned.  Bigtooth aspen and quaking aspen
frequently dominated the postdisturbance forests [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].
Without fire or other disturbance, these forests are being replaced by
later successional, shade-tolerant species [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].

In a study of forest succession in northern Michigan, bigtooth aspen,
which dominated the postfire forest, was replaced by red maple and
eastern white pine within 53 years [<a href="#53">53</a>].

On fine till soils in central New Hampshire, early successional species
including aspen dominate postdisturbance stands.  These species are
replaced by sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and American beech (Fagus
grandifolia) [<a href="#69">69</a>].

In the absence of fire, aspen-birch forests in Maine are succeeded by
spruce [<a href="#70">70</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Flowering in bigtooth aspen occurs in April or May, depending on air
temperature.  The seeds mature in May or June.  Seeds disperse before
the leaves are fully expanded.  Bigtooth aspen flowers, foliates, and
disperses seeds about 1 to 3 weeks later than quaking aspen in the same
location [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Populus grandidentata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Although bigtooth aspen is easily top-killed by fire, extensive
vegetative reproduction, prolific off-site seed production, and the
tenacity and lateral extent of its roots enable bigtooth aspen to
perpetuate after fire [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  Removal of the overstory and heating of
the soil stimulate the sprouting of aspen roots [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  Fire also
creates a suitable seedbed and reduces competition [<a href="#56">56</a>].

Aspen almost always retains or extends its range following fire [<a href="#15">15</a>].
The extensive aspen root system allows it to dominate the postfire
forest, even if aspen was only a minor component of the prefire stand
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Aspen roots persist an undetermined length of time in the
absence of canopy aspen, making it possible for aspen to regenerate in a
stand in which aspen was not even represented in the prefire overstory
[<a href="#44">44</a>].

Aspen-dominated forests do not readily burn, especially when young and
healthy [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Slow burning, low-severity surface fires are
typical [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  Decadent aspen stands contain more fuel and are
more likely to burn than younger stands [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  An understory of
conifer species increases the flammability of aspen stands [<a href="#24">24</a>].
However, aspen is generally incapable of supporting a severe fire [<a href="#25">25</a>].
Crown fires in the surrounding forest generally drop into surface and
ground fuels when they enter aspen stands [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Fire every 150 years may be necessary to maintain aspen [<a href="#56">56</a>].
Presettlement fires in aspen stands probably occurred most often in the
fall when fuels are dry and leaf litter is deep [<a href="#31">31</a>].  The presettlement
fire interval of aspen-birch-fir forests in the Great Lakes Region is
estimated to have been about 80 years for very large [greater than
10,000 acre (4,000 ha)] fires [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Aspen-birch forests may have burned at intervals of 50 years or less
[<a href="#23">23</a>].  Fahey and Reiners [<a href="#71">71</a>] estimated that aspen-birch forests in
Maine had a 100-year fire interval during the 50-year period from 1909
to 1959.  However, this estimate may be high because fires were
declining during this time period due to fire suppression.

Heinselman [<a href="#24">24</a>] suggested that aspen parklands had fire intervals of 10
years for large [1,001 to 10,000 acre (400-4,000 ha)] fires.
Although quaking aspen is the principal tree in aspen parklands [<a href="#24">24</a>],
bigtooth aspen occurs in the prairie-forest edge in Minnesota [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Historically, bigtooth aspen frequently occurred in vegetational
patterns that are associated with fire.  For instance, bigtooth aspen
occurred with oak and quaking aspen along the west side of the Big Woods
in Minnesota.  These fire-tolerant species served as a firebreak between
the frequently burned prairie and the fire-sensitive climax forest of
the Big Woods.  Aspen served as a fire break because grassland fires
normally did not travel far into aspen stands due to low flammability.
However, fuel would build up in the aging aspen stands and eventually an
intense fire would destroy the aboveground biomass, rejuvenate the
aspen, and eliminate the less fire-tolerant species.  At the same time,
frequent fire in the prairie prevented aspen expansion [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Another example of a fire-influenced vegetational pattern is in the
Boundary Waters Canoe Area in Minnesota.  Aspen commonly occurs in areas
that frequently burn, such as large uplands areas distant from water and
upwind of natural fire breaks such as lakes [<a href="#23">23</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Bigtooth aspen trees are very susceptible to fire, although bigtooth
aspen roots are very fire resistant.  Bigtooth aspen bark is thin and
does not protect the cambium from heat damage [<a href="#29">29</a>].  If there is
sufficient fuel in a young sapling stand for a fire to burn, the fire
will kill the saplings [<a href="#44">44</a>].  An average scorch height of 0.6 feet (0.2
m) will kill most aspen stems smaller than 6 inches (15 cm) in dbh [<a href="#55">55</a>].

Since most fires in aspen are of low severity, mature trees do not
always succumb to fire.  However, basal wounds caused by low-severity
fire serve as entry points for disease organisms [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

Prolonged drought and large amounts of slash are required to raise the
soil temperature high enough to kill the roots of aspen [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Bigtooth
aspen roots are deeper in the soil than quaking aspen roots, making root
damage from fire highly unlikely in bigtooth aspen [<a href="#40">40</a>].



<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
A fire-killed aspen stand regenerates from surviving roots [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>],
which are stimulated to produce suckers when apical dominance is removed
[<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].

Roots must have a high cytokinin to auxin ratio to initiate sucker
growth.  If a low-intensity fire girdles aspen such that the downward
movement of auxin in the phloem is interrupted but the upward movement
of cytokinin continues in the xylem, the tree may survive for several
years.  Since the cytokinin continues to move out of the roots, it does
not accumulate, and suckers do not develop [<a href="#64">64</a>].

Roots are stimulated to sprout if the soil is heated [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  The soil
is heated not only by the fire, but also by blackening of the soil
surface and removal of overstory and duff [<a href="#48">48</a>].

The density and growth of suckers is dependent in part on fire severity.
A low-severity fire that does not kill all of the overstory does not
result in suckers as dense or vigorous as those produced after a
moderate-severity fire [<a href="#25">25</a>].

Fire also prepares a favorable seedbed for bigtooth aspen.  Seeds from
off-site sources may blow onto burned sites and establish if there is
sufficient moisture and if the competition is not severe [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].

Most shrub species in the understory of aspen forests are able to sprout
after fire [<a href="#13">13</a>], as are many hardwood associates [<a href="#38">38</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Prescribed fire is used as a management tool to regenerate aspen stands
[<a href="#41">41</a>].  Moderate-severity fire which kills all remaining canopy stems and
removes duff is recommended following harvest to maximize the number of
suckers [<a href="#25">25</a>]. A low-severity fire does not always induce sufficiently
dense and vigorous suckers to regenerate an aspen stand [<a href="#25">25</a>].

Soil nutrient concentrations increased after wildfire on both clearcut
and wholetree harvested sites that had formerly supported adjacent
northern red oak-bigtooth aspen forests [<a href="#73">73</a>].

A mature aspen stand that is clearcut will generally have enough slash
for fire to kill any residual standing trees.  Fuel loadings of at least
10 tons per acre (22 t/ha) of slash less than 3 inches (8 cm)
in diameter are recommended [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Refer to Beyerhelm and Sando [<a href="#72">72</a>] for
fuel loading estimation techniques for aspen-northern hardwood stands.

The recommended weather conditions needed to burn a harvested aspen site
are reported for those stands with less than 25 percent conifers,
greater than 25 percent conifers, and with little slash [<a href="#41">41</a>].

In northern lower Michigan, Scheiner and others [<a href="#52">52</a>] studied the
vegetational response to clearcutting followed 1 year later by burning.
Prior to cutting, bigtooth aspen dominated the site with 153 stems per
acre (378 stems/ha).  One year postcut, but prefire, the vegetation was
dominated by red maple, northern red oak, and paper birch (Betula
papyrifera) sprouts.  However, in postfire year 1, bigtooth aspen was
again the most abundant species with 9,911 sucker stems per acre (24,481
stems/ha).  Although declining in number, bigtooth aspen continued to
dominate the site for the duration of the study (5 years).

Weber [<a href="#64">64</a>] studied the response of a quaking aspen and bigtooth aspen
stand to four different treatments:  surface burning before and after
spring leaf flush and clearcutting before and after leaf flush.  Three
years after treatment, the preflush cut had the greatest stem density,
average height, and basal diameter.  Both cut treatments had greater
stem densities than the burn treatments.  The preflush cut treatment
probably had more stems than the postflush cut treatment because
carbohydrate root reserves were not depleted.

One reason for low rates of suckering after prescribed burning was that
the fires did not completely kill the overstory.  The existing trees
survived one to two postfire growing seasons and continued to show
apical dominance, thereby preventing sucker development.  The postflush
fire resulted in more suckers than the preflush fire, probably because
it was a hotter fire and killed more overstory trees [<a href="#64">64</a>].

Simard and others [<a href="#55">55</a>] developed equations for using postfire
observations to predict fire-caused injury to and mortality in aspen.

The National Fire-Danger Rating System uses the total ash and
silica-free ash content of fuels as one of its variables.  Ash is a
noncombustible constituent of organic material and reduces the
combustion rate of fuel.  In a study in Michigan, the total ash content
of dead bigtooth aspen litter fuels was 3.7 percent in the fall, 5.4
percent in the spring, and 6.2 percent in early summer.  The silica-free
ash content was 2.0, 2.8, and 3.5 percent for fall, spring, and early
summer, respectively [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Ambrosia beetle (Xyleborus saxesceni) attacks fire-damaged bigtooth
aspen [<a href="#58">58</a>].

Because of its low flammability, bigtooth aspen has been recommended for
use in fire breaks, especially on droughty, sandy sites [<a href="#27">27</a>].
