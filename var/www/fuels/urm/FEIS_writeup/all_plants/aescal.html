<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
California buckeye woodland is recognized as a distinct plant community
[<a href="#13">13</a>].  The species may also codominate oak (Quercus spp.) woodland.
Interior live oak (Q. wislizenii) and blue oak (Q. douglasii) are the
most common codominants of oak woodland [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  In chaparral, it
is sometimes a dominant shrub or tree [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>].
       
The following published classification schemes list California buckeye as a
climax species or a dominant part of the vegetation in community types

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Aesculus californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
California buckeye is occasionally used for lumber and paper pulp [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>

California buckeye is toxic to all classes of livestock and wildlife.
The bark, leaves, stems, fruits, and seeds all contain glycosidal
compounds which cause haemolytic action on red blood cells and depress
the central nervous system when ingested.  This species has been
implicated in inducing abortion in cattle [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Despite its toxicity, California buckeye flowers, leaves, and shoots are
palatable to livestock and wildlife.  Hedrick [<a href="#14">14</a>] has listed it among
the 20 chaparral browse plants most preferred by cattle and black-tailed
deer.  The palatability of the seeds for black-tailed deer, rodents, and
Stellar's jay is fair to poor [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The dry matter composition of California buckeye seeds is 80 percent
carbohydrate, 5 percent protein, 1 percent fat, 2 percent ash, 3 percent
fiber, and 9 percent miscellaneous [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Protein content of the leaves
and stems varies from 31 percent in April to 5 percent in October [<a href="#6">6</a>].
Carbohydrate content of leaves and stems varies from 50 percent in April
to 1 percent in October [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Since California buckeye is a systemic
poison, how much of this nutrition is actually metabolized by
seed-eating or browsing livestock and wildlife in unknown. (see
Importance to Livestock and Wildlife).


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The cover value of California buckeye is poor from late spring through
late winter due to early leaf fall.


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
California buckeye is valuable as a soil binder on stream or river banks
and on steep slopes [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Seed can be obtained by harvesting
native plants.  Seed propagation methods have been detailed [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].



<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
California buckeye is used as a landscaping ornamental [<a href="#24">24</a>].

The seeds of California buckeye served as a staple for California
Indians, who would mash the roasted seeds and then leach them to remove
the poison [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Native Americans also secured the seeds in streams and
other waterways in order to stupefy fish for easy capture [<a href="#21">21</a>].



<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Grazing:  California buckeye often considered undesirable on rangeland
because of its toxicity.
 
Apian considerations:  Honeybees are the chief pollinators of California
buckeye, but the pollen and nectar are toxic to them [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Losses
of adult honeybees and their larvae due to poisoning can be severe [<a href="#9">9</a>].
Human beings have been poisoned by eating honey made from California
buckeye [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Control treatments:  California buckeye is susceptible to spray or
injection/cut surface treatments of phenoxy herbicides and picloram
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Hand or mechanical brush control is ineffective unless the
root crown is removed [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Aesculus californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
California buckeye is a large shrub or tree up to 23 feet (7 m) tall.
The 2-to 6-inch-long (5-15 cm) leaves are deciduous and palmately
compound [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Flowers are borne on a terminal panicle 4 to 8 inches
(10-20 cm) long.  The pear-shaped, light brown fruit contains one to six
glossy brown seeds 0.8 to 1.2 inches (2-3 cm) in diameter [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  California buckeye reproduces by seed [<a href="#5">5</a>].  The average tree
produces approximately 100 seeds per year.  Seed dispersal is poor and
is accomplished mainly by gravity or water; dispersal by animals is rare
[<a href="#13">13</a>].  Seeds are viable for only 1 year and are shed from November to
mid-February [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Germination occurs within several weeks of shedding
if the soil temperature is above 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees C).
If the temperature persists below 40 degrees for 2 months or more the
seeds are susceptible to fungal infections or desiccation [<a href="#12">12</a>].
Germination success rates of 75 percent have been reported under
laboratory conditions [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Asexual:  California buckeye can sprout from the stump or root crown
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
California buckeye grows on dry slopes, in canyons, and along waterways
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  In the Central Valley it occurs along stream and river banks
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  It is associated with poison-oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum)
in most communities in which it occurs [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].
                
Soil:  California buckeye grows in sandy, sandy-loam, or gravelly-loam
soils [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Climate:  California buckeye occurs in a Mediterranean climate with cool
moist winters and hot dry summers [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  The mean annual rainfall
is less than 14 inches, and temperatures are in excess of 100 degrees
Fahrenheit (38 degrees C) for several successive days every summer [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Elevation:  California buckeye occurs below 4,000 feet (1,219 m) [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
California buckeye exhibits both tolerant and intolerant
characteristics.  It occurs as a widely scattered individuals in open
grasslands.  It also occurs as an understory shrub in mixed evergreen
forest [<a href="#3">3</a>].  It is a climax indicator in chaparral and mixed oak
communities [<a href="#1">1</a>] and in California buckeye woodlands [<a href="#8">8</a>].
    


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
California buckeye flowers from April to September [<a href="#24">24</a>].  New leaves
emerge from March to June while soil moisture is abundant [<a href="#20">20</a>].  The
leaves dry up and are shed in late spring or early summer in Sierra
Nevada foothill populations but may be retained through fall in coastal
populations when soil moisture remains available [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Fruits ripen from
September to October and are dropped from November to December [<a href="#24">24</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Aesculus californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Plant adaptations:  California buckeye sprouts from the root crown after
aboveground portions of the plant have been damaged [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Seeds would
probably not survive fire because they are highly susceptible to
desiccation by heat [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Seed is often transported by water and could
be carried to a burn site in that manner [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Fire ecology:  Early leaf fall results in accumulation of dry litter
around the plant early in the fire season.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species;  on-site surviving root crown or caudex
   off-site colonizer;  seed carried by animals or water; postfire yr 1&2
   secondary colonizer;  off-site seed carried to site after year 2

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Aesculus californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire top-kills California buckeye [<a href="#25">25</a>]. 


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Information regarding California buckeye's response to fire is limited.
Sampson [<a href="#25">25</a>] has said that sprouting chaparral brush species, including
California buckeye, recover rapidly following a fire, sending out new
shoots during the first growing season.  Growth in subsequent seasons is
also rapid, with the plant sometimes exceeding its prefire mass within a
few years.  Sprouting can occur within a few weeks following fire, even
in the summer months.  Growth is supported by drawing on food and water
reserves in the fully developed root system [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Grazing considerations:  California buckeye cannot be successfully
eliminated by prescribed burning.  Fire will bring it under control if
the area is reburned every 7 to 8 years and immediately reseeded with
herbaceous vegetation [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Otherwise, California buckeye will recover
at the expense of more desirable herbaceous plants [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].
