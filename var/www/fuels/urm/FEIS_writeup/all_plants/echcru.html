<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
In the Sacramento Valley of California, barnyard grass occurs in wetland
communities with swamp grass (Crypsis schoenoides) and bearded
sprangletop (Leptochloa fascicularis) [<a href="#47">47</a>].

Barnyard grass is found in the southern High Plains region of northern
Texas and southern New Mexico.  In this region, it is codominant with
red sprangletop (L. filiformis) in wet meadow and prairie communities
and is also found in shinnery communities [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].

Barnyard grass occurs in temporarily flooded palustrine wetlands of the
northern prairie and plains communities [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>].  

In eastern Colorado and western Kansas, barnyard grass occurs in the
plains cottonwood (Populus deltoides) riparian zone.  Common associates
include saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissima), sandbar willow (Salix exigua),
and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  Barnyard grass is
also a member of saltcedar and willow-cottonwood communities in Arizona
[<a href="#55">55</a>].  

Barnyard grass is the dominant species in some wetlands of North Dakota.
Common associates include water plantain (Alisma triviale), American
slough grass (Beckmannia syzigachne), needle spikerush (Eleocharis
acicularis), hedge hyssop (Gratiola neglecta), and pale smartweed
(Polygonum lapathifolium) [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>].  

In South Dakota, barnyard grass occurs in mixed-grass prairie dominated
by blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides),
western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii), and needlegrass (Stipa spp.).
Other associates include needleleaf sedge (Carex eleocharis), Sandberg
bluegrass (Poa secunda), sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), and
little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].  In tallgrass
prairies of northeast Kansas, barnyard grass occurs in communities
dominated by big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii var.  gerardii), little
bluestem, and Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans) [<a href="#14">14</a>].

At Gettysburg National Military Park in Pennsylvania, barnyard grass
occurs in a variety of forest cover types as an understory species.
Species associated with barnyard grass not previously mentioned include
white ash (Fraxinus americana), mockernut hickory (Carya tomentosa),
shagbark hickory (C. ovata), black walnut (Juglans nigra), eastern
redbud (Cercis canadensis), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida),
sassafrass (Sassafrass albidum), and red pine (Pinus resinosa) [<a href="#85">85</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Echinochloa crus-galli
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Barnyard grass is readily grazed by livestock in Arizona and West
Virginia, and can be cultivated for hay [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].  

Seeds of barnyard grass are eaten by songbirds, waterfowl, and greater
prairie chickens [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>].  Barnyard grass is an important source
of food and cover for waterfowl in the Sacramento Valley [<a href="#47">47</a>].  In the
playa lakes of Texas and New Mexico, meadows dominated by barnyard grass
are important habitat for waterfowl and pheasant [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Barnyard grass produces fair pasture when grazed during early growth
stages but becomes harsh and unpalatable at maturity [<a href="#68">68</a>].  It is
palatable to sheep in Minnesota [<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Barnyard grass has fair to poor forage value for livestock [<a href="#68">68</a>].  In
Minnesota, toxic levels of nitrate have been reported in barnyard grass
[<a href="#40">40</a>].  Nutritional values of sun-cured barnyard grass in the milk stage
are as follows [<a href="#87">87</a>]:

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Barnyard grass has colonized desert riparian and wetland community sites
along the Gila river in Arizona that were supplied by year-round flows
of wastewater.  If wastewater areas are managed on a permanent
year-round basis, habitat rehabilitation and avian colonization may
occur [<a href="#55">55</a>].

Barnyard grass can be utilized for quick, temporary erosion control on
coal mine sites in the eastern United States [<a href="#75">75</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Generally, seed yields from barnyard grass stands are reduced in 2 to 3
years because of competition with other weeds [<a href="#43">43</a>].  In Missouri,
natural seeding of barnyard grass was stimulated by periodic draining
and flooding of a wetland site; a July 1 to September 15 drawdown
produced an excellent stand of barnyard grass which was utilized by
waterfowl [<a href="#6">6</a>].  In California, draining barnyard grass fields in the
spring and discing them can benefit stands.  At the Mendota Waterfowl
Management Area, California, this practice has been used to perpetuate
stands of barnyard grass for up to 6 years.
  
Barnyard grass may harbor a virus-like disease of cereals [<a href="#17">17</a>].   

Toxicity tests of effluents in water and sediment were conducted using
the two varieties of barnyard grass.  Effluents from a sewage treatment
plant, tannery, textile mill, pulp and paper mill, and coking plant
inhibited germination, chlorophyll synthesis, and growth of
barnyard grass [<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Echinochloa crus-galli
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Barnyard grass is an introduced, nonrhizomatous, warm-season annual.
Stems may be solitary or in small tufts, erect or reclining at the base,
up to 6.6 feet tall (2 m) [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].  Leaves are flat, 4 to 12
inches (10-30 cm) long and 0.2 to 0.6 (5-15 mm) inch wide [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].
The panicle is 2 to 8.4 inches (5-21 cm) long, upright or nodding
[<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  Barnyard grass has a fibrous root system [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Therophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Barnyard grass reproduces by seed.  It is self-pollinating [<a href="#51">51</a>] and a
prolific seed producer [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  A healthy plant can produce from
750,000 to one million seeds [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Barnyard grass seed is water
dispersed [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Seed viability in soil is variable [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  In
Stoneville, Mississippi, in 1972, a 50-year study on longevity of buried
seed of barnyard grass was initiated.  Seed viability was 1 percent
after burial for 2.5 years; less than 6 percent of seed survived 6
months or longer [<a href="#10">10</a>].  However, according to Dawson [<a href="#8">8</a>], barnyard grass
seed may be viable in the soil for up to 13 years.  In another study by
Mitich [<a href="#44">44</a>], seed viability of barnyard grass was 100 percent after 6 to
8 years of dry storage in irrigated sandy loam soil, and all seed was
nonviable after 15 years.  Watanabe [<a href="#79">79</a>] found that barnyard grass seed
germination rate was 27 percent after burial for 6 months and 3 percent
after burial for 6.5 years.  Barnyard grass seed germinates over a wide
temperature range, 55 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit (13-40 deg C), with
optimum germination occurring from 68 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (20-30
deg C) [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].

The buoyancy and hence dispersal by water of barnyard grass seeds is
probably influenced by their weight.  A survey of seed weight [<a href="#1">1</a>]
demonstrated that seeds of E. crus-galli var. oryzicola were on the
average 2 to 3 times heavier than those of E. crus-galli var.
crus-galli.  The lighter seeds of E. crus-galli var. crus-galli
exhibited greater buoyancy, with approximately 50 percent of seeds
remaining afloat after 4 to 5 days in water.  In contrast, 95 percent of
E. crus-galli var. oryzicola seeds had sunk after 5 days.  Decay of
dormancy in E. crus-galli var. oryzicola is more rapid than in E.
crus-galli var. crus-galli following dry storage and burial in soil.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Barnyard grass is widespread in fields, waste places, ditches, marshes,
wet meadows, floodplains and along lakeshores and streambanks
[<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  It is locally common in floodplains, riverbottoms,
and seasonally wet habitats [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>], but also occurs in drier habitats
[<a href="#24">24</a>].  Barnyard grass is most often found on disturbed, generally
nonsaline soils [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>], but grows on a variety of soil types
[<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  Echinochloa crus-galli var. crus-galli is generally absent
from sites that have greater than 12 inches (30 cm) of standing water
for more than 4 weeks at a time [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>].  It occurs in shallow water or
after drawdown [<a href="#63">63</a>].  Barnyard grass tolerates poor drainage and
flooding, but not severe drought [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].

In California, the two varieties of barnyard grass differ in habitat
preference and colonizing ability.  Echinochloa crus-galli var.
crus-galli is a cosmopolitan weed of wet, disturbed ground and occurs in
shallow water around the periphery of rice fields.  Echinochloa
crus-galli var. oryzicola is a crop mimic that is found primarily in
permanently flooded cultivated rice fields [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Wyoming         3,700-5,100    1,110-1,530    [<a href="#86">86</a>]


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Barnyard grass is a pioneer species that readily invades disturbed sites
[<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  It is found most often in open, unshaded areas [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>], and is
intolerant of dense shade [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Barnyard grass invades South Dakota
rangelands and rapidly colonizes overflow and subirrigated range sites
that have been denuded or disturbed in Nebraska [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  In Idaho,
barnyard grass is an increaser species on periodically flooded sites
along streams [<a href="#58">58</a>].  At a restoration prairie site in Ohio, barnyard
grass established at the edge of an ephemeral pond that is subject to
periodic flooding and drying [<a href="#7">7</a>].  In an old-field succession deciduous
forest in southwestern Ohio, barnyard grass was found growing in a
2-year-old stand, but was not present in stands 10, 50, 90, or 200 years
old [<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].
