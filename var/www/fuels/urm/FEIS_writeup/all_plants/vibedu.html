<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Viburnum edule
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Highbush cranberries are consumed by many small mammals and songbirds
[<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  Game birds including spruce grouse and ruffed grouse also eat
the berries [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Foliage is browsed by beaver, rabbit, and snowshoe
hare [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Highbush cranberry is of low to moderate importance as browse to
Roosevelt elk, Rocky Mountain elk, mountain goat, bighorn sheep,
black-tail deer, mule deer, white-tailed deer, and caribou [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].  The
foliage is also browsed by moose throughout the year [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].

Highbush cranberries are a major food of grizzly bears [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Black
bears consume highbush cranberries in late fall [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Viburnum foliage is low in palatability to livestock [<a href="#55">55</a>].

Pease [<a href="#42">42</a>] states that Viburnum foliage is highly unpalatable to snowshoe
hare, but others report it to be a preferred hare food in some areas [<a href="#60">60</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Highbush cranberry's current annual stem and leaf growth collected in
July from Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, were analyzed for browse quality to
moose.  In-vitro dry matter digestibility was 52.8 percent and protein
content was 10.3 percent.  Concentrations of the following elements
were found [<a href="#41">41</a>]:
                             Macroelements (ppm)

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Viburnum species are important components of forest-edge and hedgerow
habitats that provide cover for small mammals and birds [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
The value of highbush cranberry for rehabilitative purposes has not been
well documented.  It was studied for its use in oil sands reclamation,
but no results were detailed [<a href="#17">17</a>].
  


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Highbush cranberries are edible and make excellent jams, jellies, and
sauces if picked before fully mature [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  The berries were an
important food of Native Americans of the Bella Coola region of British
Columbia, where a single shrub may yield up to 100 berries [<a href="#38">38</a>].  The
plant is cultivated for its brilliant red autumnal foliage [<a href="#58">58</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Highbush cranberry is not considered to be a primary competitor to
conifers but is a component of major brush complexes that occur on
moist, productive sites on floodplains or under deciduous canopies.  It
can compete significantly with natural or planted white spruce seedlings
in the Sub-Boreal Spruce and Boreal White and Black Spruce (Picea
mariana) Zones, where it is most abundant [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Highbush cranberry has shown varying responses to overstory removal.
Near Prince George, British Columbia, highbush cranberry in white
spruce-subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) forests had not become a
significant component of the vegetation 6 years after clearcutting,
although it was present on all sites prior to the harvest [<a href="#14">14</a>].  In
Alberta, highbush cranberry had significantly lower cover in 6- to
12-year-old clearcut areas than in adjacent mature lodgepole pine
stands.  In contrast, logging of a balsam poplar stand in Alaska caused
a dramatic increase in highbush cranberry density.  It was one of the
dominant shrubs and reached 3.3 feet (1 m) in height within 4 years
[<a href="#22">22</a>].  In general, frequency and cover are expected to remain constant
or decrease slightly in the first few years after overstory removal.
Vigor may increase slowly on favorable sites [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Highbush cranberry is a seed-banking species, and soil disturbance
resulting from mechanical site preparation favors germination of stored
seed.  The disturbance may also provide favorable seedbeds for freshly
deposited seed.  Plants damaged in site preparation sprout from root
stocks and stem bases [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Highbush cranberry increased less in a winter-logged balsam poplar stand
than in one that had been summer-logged.  Higher soil disturbance on the
summer-logged site may have stimulated sprouting.  However,
scarification did not enhance cover of highbush cranberry in clearcut
areas near Edson, Alberta [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Highbush cranberry was also less
abundant on mechanically prepared sites than on unscalped sites in
interior Alaska.  Frequency and cover of highbush cranberry 3 years
after clearcutting and shelterwood cutting of white spruce stands were
as follows [<a href="#63">63</a>]:
  
                        Clearcut                  Shelterwood
                  scalped      unscalped       scalped     unscalped
                _____________________________________________________
Frequency (%)      13.3          38.3            13.3         20.0
Cover (%)           1.8           5.2             1.7          3.2
      
Highbush cranberry can be propagated vegetatively by hardwood or
softwood cuttings, although softwood cuttings are far more successful at
producing roots.  Softwood cuttings root sooner and more prolifically in
sand than in perlite.  Rooting success greatly increases by treating
cuttings with IBA (Indole-3-butyric acid).  Rhizome cuttings also
successfully produce roots when planted immediately after fall
collection [<a href="#30">30</a>].

Seeding may also be used for propagation of Viburnums.  Seeds may be
broadcast sown on prepared seedbeds and mulched with sawdust or sown
with drills and mulched with straw.  Seedlings may require shading,
depending on location.  Fertile, moist soils which are neutral to
slightly acidic result in best germination [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Herbicides can be used to control highbush cranberry.  Glycophosphate
exhibits good control and causes moderately severe damage to the plant
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Aerially spraying a young aspen-balsam poplar stand in June
resulted in 95 percent defoliation and heavy mortality of highbush
cranberry [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Roundup also causes defoliation and moderate mortality
rates [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Hexazinone does not appear to control highbush cranberry
effectively [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>].

Highbush cranberry is utilized heavily in tent caterpillar outbreaks
[<a href="#52">52</a>].  Aphids, thrips, spider mites, and scale are also likely to occur
on Viburnums.  A leaf spot (Ascochyta viburni) has been found on plants
along coastal British Columbia, and a rust (Puccinia linkii) has been
found on plants in northern British Columbia.  Neither of these diseases
is considered serious [<a href="#22">22</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Viburnum edule
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Highbush cranberry is a straggling to erect deciduous shrub that reaches
heights ranging from 2 to 12 feet (0.6-3.5 m) [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  It has
several to many stems that may grow to 1.5 inches (4 cm) in diameter
[<a href="#58">58</a>].  The plant has smooth gray bark and sharply toothed leaves that
are shallowly lobed.  Milky-white flowers are borne in few-flowered
terminal cymes.  The fruit is an orange to red drupe that contains one
seed [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  The berries often overwinter on twigs.  Highbush
cranberry roots in the organic layer [<a href="#51">51</a>] and is rhizomatous [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte (Microphanerophyte)
   Phanerophyte (Nanophanerophyte)
   Cryptophyte (Geophyte)


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction:  Highbush cranberry begins to produce fruits at
approximately 5 years of age, and then produces large quantities nearly
every year thereafter.  The one-seeded fruits are dispersed by the birds
and mammals that consume them [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Germination is normally delayed
until the second growing season after ripening.  The seeds exhibit seed
coat and embryo dormancy that requires a two-stage stratification to be
broken.  Most successful germination takes place when a warm period is
followed by cold stratification [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  The radicle emerges and
begins growth during the warm period, and the cold period breaks the
dormancy of the plumule, which then grows when temperatures become
warmer.  The time period of these stages is critical but has not been
worked out in detail.  Clean, air-dried seeds can be stored up to 10
years without losing viability.  Highbush cranberry is a seed-banking
species [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Highbush cranberry can reproduce vegetatively
by natural layering and sprouting from damaged root stocks, stembases,
and stumps.  The plant is rhizomatous, but there is no evidence of
lateral spread from the parent by rhizome or root suckers [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Highbush cranberry is found in moist woods or forests, along stream or
lake margins on gravel or rocky banks, and on swamp or bog margins
[<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  In British Columbia, the plant is found from sea level to
about 4,900 feet (1,500 m) [<a href="#22">22</a>], but in Colorado elevational range is
7,000 to 9,000 feet (2,100-2,700 m) [<a href="#26">26</a>]. The southern extent of
highbush cranberry's distribution is determined by high temperatures and
low humidity.  Its presence at northern latitiudes indicates a high
tolerance to frost and the ability to grow in low soil and air
temperatures.  In moist climates, highbush cranberry grows on submesic
to subhydric soils, but in drier climates it is restricted to subhygric
and wetter moisture regimes.  Highbush cranberry commonly grows under a
deciduous or coniferous canopy but probably develops best under full
sunlight [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Highbush cranberry grows best on well-drained, alluvial soils
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  Soil textures include clay, silty clay, sandy clay loam,
and fine loam [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  Soil types include Luvisols, Brunisols,
Humo-Ferric Podzols, Regosols, and Gleysols [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Highbush cranberry is moderately shade tolerant [<a href="#6">6</a>] and is important
throughout all stages of forest succession [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  In floodplain
succession, highbush cranberry is present from the pioneer willow
through seral balsam poplar stages.  It remains important in mature and
climax white spruce and black spruce-white spruce types [<a href="#56">56</a>].

Highbush cranberry sprouts following fire and is an important component
of early, midseral, and climax postfire communities [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  The
following frequencies and densities were found in white spruce stands in
interior Alaska:

  Stage        Years after fire    Frequency(%)    Density(stems/acre)
_______________________________________________________________________
Newly burned         0-1               78         15,201 (37,562 st/ha)
Moss-herb            1-5               21           2,795 (6,906 st/ha)
Tall shrub-sapling   3-30              30         13,445 (33,222 st/ha)
Dense tree          26-45              36           3,713 (9,175 st/ha)
Hardwood            46-150             55         15,378 (38,000 st/ha)
Spruce             150-300+            39           2,049 (5,062 st/ha)

Low successive peaks between the newly burned, tall shrub-sapling, and
hardwood stages may have been caused by stand differences or successful
establishment followed by opportunism [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Highbush cranberry flowers from May to August, depending on location.
Fruits ripen from August to October and persist throughout the winter
[<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  Leaf flush begins in April or May, and senescence and
abscission take place earlier than on associated shrubs [<a href="#22">22</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Viburnum edule
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Highbush cranberry sprouts from the stump, roots, or underground stems
following fire [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  Sprouting may also occur at the base of
fire-killed aboveground stems [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Highbush cranberry roots are
buried approximately 8 inches (20 cm) below the soil surface, allowing
them to survive light fires that do not entirely remove the organic
layer [<a href="#51">51</a>].  Rhizomes will also survive fires of this nature.  Highbush
cranberry seeds are hard and have thick seed coats, making them somewhat
resistant to fire [<a href="#59">59</a>].  Regeneration by seeds stored in the soil may
actually be favored by low-severity fires [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex
   survivor species; on-site surviving rhizomes
   ground-stored residual colonizer; fire-activated seed on-site in soil
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by animals or water; postfire yr 1&2

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Viburnum edule
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire top-kills highbush cranberry.  Moderate- to high-severity fires
which remove soil organic layers may kill roots, underground stems, and
buried seeds.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Highbush cranberry sprouts within weeks following fire [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>] and often
becomes one of the dominant postfire shrubs [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Low-severity fires
stimulate germination of seeds stored in the soil [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Abundance of
the plant may be initially reduced after fire, but an increase over
prefire density may take place within the next 10 years [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Prescribed fires of low-severity and short duration are recommended for
the management of highbush cranberry.  Fires of this type favor the
germination of buried seeds and sprouting of vegetative structures
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].
