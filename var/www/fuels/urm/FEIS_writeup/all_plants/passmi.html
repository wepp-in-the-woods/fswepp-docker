The fully documented scientific name of western wheatgrass is <i>Pascopyrum
smithii</i> P.A. Love (Poaceae) [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].  There 
has been much confusion concerning the taxonomy of western
wheatgrass [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>].  It is believed to be the product 
of an allo-octoploid (2n=56) derived from hybridization 
of 2 tetraploid grasses (2n=28); thickspike wheatgrass (<i>Elymus lanceolatus</i>) 
and beardless wheatgrass (<i>Pseudoroegneria
spicata</i> ssp. <i>inerme</i>) [<a href="#111">111</a>].  Barkworth and Dewey [<a href="#12">12</a>] recognize 
the monotypic genus Pascopyrum A. Love.
<p>

Ecotypes of western wheatgrass vary in forage and seed production
characteristics and in color, coarseness, and competitiveness [<a href="#68">68</a>].</p>

Western wheatgrass 
grows in grasslands and sagebrush (<i>Artemisia</i> spp.) deserts; it commonly grows in 
pure stands, but more often grows mixed with other grasses 
[<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>].  It is 
often the dominant grass in mixed-grass prairie
communities [<a href="#10">10</a>].
<p>

Western wheatgrass is a codominant or indicator in many habitat types in
sagebrush-grassland, pinyon-juniper (<i>Pinus</i> ssp.)-(<i>Juniperus</i> ssp.), 
and Rocky mountain juniper (<i>J. scopulorum)</i> types [<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>].  It
is of major importance in the central and northern Great Plains
grassland where it is commonly associated with blue grama (<i>Bouteloua
gracilis)</i>, sideoats grama <i>(B. curtipendula)</i>, alkali 
sacaton (<i>Sporobolus airoides)</i>, buffalo grass (<i>Buchloe 
dactyloides)</i>, prairie junegrass (<i>Koeleria macrantha)</i>, 
needle and thread grass (<i>Hesperostipa comata)</i>, 
green needlegrass (<i>Nassella viridula)</i>, and little bluestem 
(<i>Schizachyrium scoparium)</i> [<a href="#11">11</a>].</p>
<p>

Western wheatgrass occurs with a number of shrubs including big 
sagebrush <i>(A. tridentata)</i>, bitterbrush 
<i>(Purshia tridentata)</i>, and 
broom snakeweed <i>(Gutierrezia sarothrae)</i> [<a href="#1">1</a>].</p>

On the sagebrush rangeland of the Intermountain area, western wheatgrass
is often mixed with bluebunch wheatgrass 
<i>(Pseudoroegneria spicata)</i> and thickspike
wheatgrass [<a href="#25">25</a>].  In northern 
mixed-grass prairies, western wheatgrass occurs as a 
dominant with needle-and-thread grass, blue grama, and 
bluestems [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Publications using western

Western wheatgrass is an important forage species on ranges in good
condition in pinyon-juniper, chaparral, northern desert shrub, and
shortgrass prairie [<a href="#48">48</a>].  It is one of the most
valuable North American wheatgrasses [<a href="#88">88</a>].  
Although leaves are stiff, they rarely
become sufficiently coarse to discourage animal use [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>].
<p>

Western wheatgrass is one of the primary grasses eaten by
cattle in New Mexico and in central and eastern Montana
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].  It provides 
important domestic sheep forage in southeastern Montana, 
particularly during June, July, and August [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Fall 
regrowth cures well on the stem, so western wheatgrass is considered good winter forage for domestic 
livestock [<a href="#68">68</a>].</p>
<p>

Bison feed on western wheatgrass in the Great Plains; it is 
preferred by bison to blue grama in northeastern Colorado 
[<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>].  Western wheatgrass makes up a 
higher percentage of bison diets on heavily grazed ranges 
than on lightly grazed sites [<a href="#112">112</a>].  In Wind Cave National 
Park, South Dakota, elk consume western wheatgrass
during the fall, winter, spring, and summer [<a href="#172">172</a>].  It is
eaten by white-tailed deer in eastern and central Montana, with 
heaviest use during the spring [<a href="#4">4</a>].</p>
<p>

Western wheatgrass is used by various small mammals.  It is
heavily used by pocket gophers from May
through September [<a href="#35">35</a>].  It is also heavily grazed by 
black-tailed prairie dogs in South Dakota [<a href="#83">83</a>].</p>

PALATABILITY:</a>

<br />
<p class="subframeText">

Western wheatgrass is described as "very palatable" [<a href="#31">31</a>].  
New growth is particularly palatable to cattle
and to domestic sheep.  Plants often
become coarse by early summer and palatability declines [<a href="#68">68</a>].  
In some areas plants may become "stemmy
and unpalatable" by late summer [<a href="#130">130</a>].  
The degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife species is rated as follows:

Western wheatgrass is described as 
"highly nutritious" [<a href="#31">31</a>].
It is rated as "good" in energy value and "fair" in protein value [<a href="#45">45</a>].
<p> 

However, protein content varies by plant part and by seasonal 
development.  Protein content peaks during
the period of most rapid growth in the southern plains 
(usually in April) and is generally lowest at or just 
after the end of flowering [<a href="#129">129</a>].  Specific crude protein 
values are as follows [<a href="#111">111</a>]:</p>

<pre>early May                     31.6%
regrowth in early July        13.0%
late 1st harvest early July    9.8%
1st harvest late July          7.9%
</pre>

In-vitro digestible dry matter by season is as follows [<a href="#111">111</a>]:
<pre>initial harvest early May     74.5%
initial harvest mid May       76%
late 1st harvest early July   59%
1st harvest late July         54%         
</pre>

In a Wyoming study, calcium and magnesium content did not increase
with maturity and the iron content remained fairly constant during the
growing season, but manganese increased after September 30th and phosphorus
became deficient prior to August 17th.  Crude
protein content declined steadily from 14.5% on June 29th to 4.7% 
by October 29th [<a href="#117">117</a>].

Protein content per gram is greater in the tops, roots, and 
rhizomes of clipped plants than in nonclipped plants; 
the soluble sugars and starch per gram are less 
in clipped plants.  Recovery and growth of plant tops is 
prevented by frequent removal of vegetation [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  The 
nutrient quality of plants can also be altered by 
defoliation by grasshoppers.  Severe defoliation 
can produce decreased foliar nitrogen and carbohydrates, and 
can increase phenolic concentrations [<a href="#118">118</a>].

Western wheatgrass can be used to produce good stands of nesting
cover for various ducks in the Dakotas [<a href="#91">91</a>].  
It provides good nesting sites for mallards, gadwalls, and 
blue-winged teal [<a href="#99">99</a>].  Grasses, including
western wheatgrass, are frequently selected for nesting sites by 
green-winged teal, pintail, and northern

<p class="subframeText">

Western wheatgrass is a good soil binder and is well suited for 
reclamation of disturbed sites such as surface coal mines, 
erosion control, and soil stabilization [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>].  It is 
commonly included in seed 
mixtures used for rangeland seeding, revegetation of 
saline-alkali areas such as saltwater blowout sites, and in 
critical areas for erosion control [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].  It can also be seeded 
onto wet 
areas or waterways [<a href="#131">131</a>].
<p>

Since rhizomes may persist in land broken for 
cultivation, western wheatgrass spreads
rapidly on abandoned land [<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>].  In Wyoming and Montana, 
western wheatgrass is one of the most promising 
grasses for reclaiming saline seeps, as well as other problem 
sites [<a href="#121">121</a>].  In Nebraska and Saskatchewan, it shows potential value
for controlling wind erosion in sand blowouts or on dunes 
[<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>].  Western wheatgrass is used for roadside
revegetation at "higher elevations" in Arizona, and along roadsides

In Arizona, successful coal-mine reclamation
included the use of fertilizers, a combination of natural 
rainfall and sprinkler irrigation for the first 2 years, and seeding
perennial grasses including western wheatgrass, 
crested wheatgrass <i>(Agropyron cristatum)</i>, and Indian
ricegrass <i>(Achnatherum hymenoides)</i> [<a href="#129">129</a>].  
The effects of 3 soil 
materials, 3 mulching treatments, and 2 soil moisture treatments 
on the growth and forage production of western
wheatgrass when used in the reclamation of coal mine spoils were
investigated during a 3-year experiment in Arizona.  Average 
stems per pot and dry forage yield per pot for western
wheatgrass were determined for all treatment combinations.  The highest
number of stems per plot, the tallest plants, and the highest forage
yield were produced with Gila loam soil, barley straw mulch, and 
soil moisture treatment with maximum production.  More 
vigorous plants and more forage were produced when soil mulch 
was used than when soils were not mulched [<a href="#36">36</a>].</p>
<p>

Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae are a common component of arid soils.
They usually increase nutrient and water intake, as well as increasing the
dry mass of plants.  The disturbance of land often leads to the
reduction or elimination of mycorrhizal fungi propagules.  Workers
investigating the development of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae and
proliferation of roots of western wheatgrass in a revegetated mine spoil
in southeastern Wyoming found that western wheatgrass was not highly
dependent on mycorrhizal infection for survival [<a href="#100">100</a>].  Researchers at
the Kemmerer Coal Mine in southwestern Wyoming found that
mycorrhizae benefited western wheatgrass [<a href="#3">3</a>].</p>
<p>

Western wheatgrass can be successfully drilled or broadcast seeded 
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>].  It can be successfully seeded during
the spring or fall [<a href="#120">120</a>].  Numerous cultivars, adapted to a wide
range of environmental conditions, are available for commercial 
use [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p class="subframeText">

Western wheatgrass can tolerate moderate grazing but is damaged 
by close spring grazing [<a href="#152">152</a>].  Heavy grazing "may be tolerated, but 
production will be lowered considerably by this practice" [<a href="#130">130</a>].  
Western wheatgrass is a decreaser 
on upland sites in the Great Plains with less than 20 inches 
(500 mm) average annual precipitation.  In areas
with over 20 inches, it is an increaser.  When western
wheatgrass is mixed with taller or more palatable species, it often
increases.  When it is mixed with shorter grasses and warm-season
species, western wheatgrass decreases when grazed early in the spring
[<a href="#152">152</a>].  However, Hafenrichter and others [<a href="#68">68</a>] report that
continuous early spring grazing of mixed stands can result
in nearly pure stands of western wheatgrass.  
Western wheatgrass increases in both density and frequency after 
grazing and chaining in pinyon-juniper communities [<a href="#149">149</a>].  
<p>

Western wheatgrass is susceptible to grasshopper damage during
moderate to heavy infestations.  In prolonged wet periods, forage
quality is decreased from ergot, as well as leaf and stem rusts [<a href="#152">152</a>].</p>
<p>

In some instances
large increases in western wheatgrass have been reported after
herbicide application.  In a Wyoming study, increases of 260% were 
reported within 2 years of herbicide applications, with increases
of 490 to 720% live canopy cover reported during the 7th year
after application [<a href="#167">167</a>].  Detailed information on response to various
herbicides is available [<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>].</p>
<p>

In North Dakota, western wheatgrass produces approximately
1/3rd of its annual yield prior to May 20th.  The
bulk of production occurs from May 20th to June 30th [<a href="#165">165</a>].</p>

Western wheatgrass is a long-lived, native perennial, cool-season,
endomycorrhizal grass [<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>].  It is an aggressive 
sod-forming grass characterized by an abundance of long, branched 
rhizomes [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Rhizomes 
allow plants to survive moderately severe drought
[<a href="#152">152</a>].  The erect culms reach 12 to 36 inches (30-90 cm) in height
[<a href="#130">130</a>].
<p>

Rhizomes lie 0.5 to 2 inches (1.3-5 cm) below the soil surface.  
The highly branched root system may penetrate the soil to a 
depth of 7 feet (21 m).  In the deep rich soils of eastern Nebraska and Kansas, 
roots may extend 
as deep as 11.8 feet (3.6 m).  
Root extensions in more arid eastern Colorado may extend downward
to depths of only 4.9 feet (1.5 m) [<a href="#34">34</a>].  In dry grasslands of 
Montana, only 6% of the roots of western wheatgrass were 
observed in the top 0 to 0.5 inch (0-1 cm) soil layer.</p>
<p> 

Longevity of western wheatgrass roots was studied 
by banding roots of plants grown in containers from seed.  In 
the second year 55 and 60% of the banded roots were dead.  
By the end of the second summer
western wheatgrass roots had a survival of 42% [<a href="#154">154</a>].  Zhang 
and Romo [<a href="#174">174</a>] report tiller longevity of 2 to 3 years 
in Saskatchewan.</p>

Western wheatgrass regenerates vegetatively through rhizomes to form
uniform stands [<a href="#68">68</a>].  It also spreads 
via seeds.  A limited seed supply 
usually matures late, but this is offset by reproduction from 
rootstocks [<a href="#150">150</a>].  Stands are slow to develop from seed [<a href="#27">27</a>], 
but once established are vigorous,
hardy, and drought resistant.  Seeds germinate slowly, but a fairly
uniform sod is usually obtained within 2-3 years [<a href="#10">10</a>]. 
<p>

Western wheatgrass exhibits a low and much-delayed germination at 
66 to 73 degrees Fahrenheit (19-2 <sup>o</sup>C) [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>].  
Germination is most successful with alternating temperatures of 59
degrees Fahrenheit (15 <sup>o</sup>C) and 86 degrees Fahrenheit 
(30 <sup>o</sup>C) [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Light does not affect germination [<a href="#122">122</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>].</p>
<p>

Peak germination response for western wheatgrass was 94%
at 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18.5 <sup>o</sup>C) for 8 
hours and 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 <sup>o</sup>C) for 16 hours.  
The mean germination time was 11.8 days.  In constant

Western wheatgrass is drought tolerant, and established stands 
can survive even extended periods of drought [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>].  
It commonly occurs
along ephemeral creeks where it grows through thick layers of
silt in areas that flood in spring [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  It also grows 
on well-drained upland sites
[<a href="#130">130</a>].  Western wheatgrass grows in mesic areas, swales, overflow sites, and
subirrigated lowlands.  Western wheatgrass is tolerant of
periodic flooding, poor drainage, and 
water tables within 6 inches (15 cm) of the soil surface [<a href="#27">27</a>].
<p>Western wheatgrass commonly grows on medium to heavy textured soils [<a href="#27">27</a>].  
It can grow on even heavy gumbo soils, but does poorly on sand 
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>].  In parts of Colorado, western
wheatgrass grows on clayey soils with an average pH of 7.78 [<a href="#9">9</a>].Western wheatgrass is highly tolerant of saline to
alkali soils [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Western wheatgrass is adapted to areas that receive 14 to

Western wheatgrass occurs in all seres.  It is 
however, frequently described as a "late successional species" 
[<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>].  It is present 
in many climax plant communities [<a href="#115">115</a>].  Western wheatgrass 
increases during secondary succession.  
Its ability to rapidly reestablish after disturbance is 
attributed to its rhizomatous growth habit 
[<a href="#123">123</a>].  Samuel and Hart [<a href="#124">124</a>]
report that it typically appears much earlier and in much greater
abundance than other long-lived perennial grasses on disturbed
sites in Wyoming.
<p>

Western wheatgrass grows in a variety of successional stages in 
sagebrush (<i>Artemisia</i> spp.) communities.  It has been 
described as a "mid-seral species" in semi-arid 
sagebrush  communities of northwestern Colorado.  In these sagebrush communities, 
annual forbs dominate disturbed sites for the first 2 years 
after disturbance.  By year 3, cheatgrass <i>(Bromus
tectorum)</i> typically becomes dominant and perennial grasses such as
western wheatgrass become dominant by the 4th year after disturbance
[<a href="#104">104</a>].  In big 
sagebrush communities, western wheatgrass may among the 
earliest species to become prominent following disturbance
[<a href="#19">19</a>].  In Wyoming big sagebrush communities,
western wheatgrass dominates "late intermediate seral stages" in
steppe communities [<a href="#16">16</a>].  It replaces blue grama in "early 
intermediate seral stages" and is replaced by
big sagebrush later in succession.</p>
<p>

Western wheatgrass is common on disturbed sites (abandoned
towns) in parts of southwestern Montana [<a href="#92">92</a>].  During the drought of the 1930s, western wheatgrass
supplanted tall grasses over much of the eastern Kansas prairie 
[<a href="#113">113</a>].  Grasses reverted to the original composition as more
"normal" (more moist) conditions returned.</p>
<p>

In certain Montana riparian communities, years of heavy grazing
can cause cottonwood stands to be replaced by shrub/grass
communities dominated by silver sagebrush <i>(Artemisia cana)</i>, 
greasewood <i>(Sarcobatus vermiculatus)</i>, and 
western wheatgrass [<a href="#70">70</a>].</p>

Western wheatgrass produces best growth in
spring.  Flowering occurs in June, and seeds ripen 
in August or September [<a href="#150">150</a>].  In South Dakota, vegetative
growth typically begins in early June, flowering
begins by mid to late June, and seeds shatter by mid-August [<a href="#85">85</a>].  Flowering dates by state 
are as follows [<a href="#45">45</a>]:

<pre>State   Earliest date observed   Latest date observed

A representative phenology for a population of western wheatgrass from
the northern Great Plains is as follows [<a href="#143">143</a>]:

<pre>Dormancy         5-20 November
Early growth    15-20 April
Rapid growth     1-10 June

A western Wyoming study of phenological development of
western wheatgrass from 1973 to 1975 showed that "normal" seed
dissemination was difficult to predict as
inflorescences appearing in July did not necessarily produce viable
seed.  Seed may not shatter until late fall or early the
following summer [<a href="#90">90</a>].

In a 2nd Colorado study, seasonal growth was initiated by
the 2nd or 3rd week of April and flowering began by the 1st week
of June, with maximum flowering by the 3rd week of June.  
Maximum rate of leaf area increase occurred
from late May through June [<a href="#109">109</a>].   	   
In Texas, western wheatgrass generally begins fall growth by
September.  The short growing period in the fall is followed by peak
growth in late spring (April) when maximum leaf widths are reached.
Plants did not grow during winter, even under irrigation [<a href="#129">129</a>].
<p>

The growth and phenological stages of western wheatgrass plants are
inversely related to carbohydrate reserve storage.  Lowest root and
crown total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) levels are reached during
the 3rd leaf stage in April.  The highest TNC levels occur during the
5th leaf stage in late June and at the end of the growing season, fall
quiescence [<a href="#106">106</a>].  Seed maturity occurs when water concentrations reach 
approximately 300 to 350 g/kg (dry weight basis) [<a href="#17">17</a>]</p>

The major adaptation of western wheatgrass to fire is its rhizomatous
growth form [<a href="#151">151</a>].  Western wheatgrass is characterized by loosely
clustered, coarse culms with a minimum of leafy material.
During a fire these culms usually burn rapidly with little heat
transferred downward into meristematic tissue.
<p>

Fire did not alter species composition after fire in a South Dakota
mixed-grass prairie community containing western wheatgrass [<a href="#158">158</a>].  This may not be true of all

Western wheatgrass cover usually increases or changes little after 
fire.  On sagebrush (<i>Artemisia</i> spp.)-grass ranges western wheatgrass often 
revegetates rapidly after fire [<a href="#152">152</a>].  Recovery occurs within 
2 to 5 years in sagebrush and pinyon-juniper zones of the 
Intermountain region [<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#161">161</a>].  In Nevada, western 
wheatgrass increased in frequency after fire; above 
ground biomass increased more than 7 times above preburn levels 
during the 1st postfire season [<a href="#28">28</a>].  
In sagebrush <i>(Artemisia</i> spp.) communities of Wyoming, western wheatgrass generally 
increases after fire [<a href="#133">133</a>].  In eastern Montana, 
western wheatgrass production was unaffected 
by spring or fall burns [<a href="#75">75</a>].  In some instances, vegetative spread of
western wheatgrass is enhanced by fire [<a href="#158">158</a>].</p>  

Variable responses by season of burn have been reported for 
western wheatgrass.  

Spring burns often favor western 
wheatgrass [<a href="#6">6</a>] by increasing density during the 1st growing
season after fire [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>].  Although the height of 
western wheatgrass is reduced by burning at all dates, plants 
usually increase in 
abundance and density after spring fire
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#37"37</a>,</a><a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>].  In the northern Great Plains, 
best response of western 
wheatgrass may be observed after very early spring 
(March-April) or late summer burns [<a href="#76">76</a>].  Kruse and Higgins [<a href="#94">94</a>] 
report that 
spring burns may produce increases, decreases or no change in 
western wheatgrass cover.   Gartner and White [<a href="#63">63</a>]
report that late spring and early summer burns can cause 
increases or decreases during the 1st growing season, but no 
difference between preburn and control was evident by the 
2nd growing season in mixed-grass prairie communities.
<p>

Fall burns can also stimulate
productivity of western wheatgrass, but sometimes to a lesser
degree than can spring burns [<a href="#162">162</a>,<a href="#163">163</a>].  In Montana, plants burned in fall and 
spring exhibited similar yields after mid-May [<a href="#163">163</a>].  Studies in eastern Montana indicate that western wheatgrass
increases in abundance after spring, summer, and early fall
burns.  However, best response was noted 
after late summer or early fall fires 
[<a href="#75">75</a>].</p>
<p>

Summer burns generally produce increases in western wheatgrass
cover or production [<a href="#94">94</a>]. In the northern 
Great Plains, best response of western 
wheatgrass may sometimes be observed after late summer (August-September) 
burns [<a href="#76">76</a>].</p>
<p> 

Winter burns produce no change or result in 
increases in cover in South Dakota [<a href="#63">63</a>].</p>

On a clay upland range site with a shortgrass mixture of buffalo grass
and blue grama in Kansas, a March fire consumed dry vegetation to ground
level.  Western wheatgrass yields did not fully recover until the 3rd growing
season after the fire.  For the 1st and 2nd years, it was reduced
82% and 39%, respectively [<a href="#98">98</a>].
<p>

In western North Dakota on a mesic mixed-grass prairie with annual
precipitation of 16 inches (410 mm), the effects of 3 wildfires (May,
August, and September) were studied on areas subject to trespass
grazing.  Frequency of western wheatgrass plants remained the 
same or higher than before burning on all 3 treatments.</p>
<p>

In western South Dakota, yield and density of western wheatgrass 
were increased by late winter or early spring burns [<a href="#22">22</a>].   
Western wheatgrass and Japanese brome <i>(Bromus japonicus</i>) were codominants in Badlands
National Park in west-central South Dakota on land that had not been
cultivated or grazed for at least 25 years.  A study investigating the
effects of fire on western wheatgrass found that vegetative propagation
of western wheatgrass was enhanced immediately following burns and growth returned to the
level of unburned plots during the 2nd growing season.  Plots were burned in April and May, 1983 and 1984, and
clipped in April 1983.  Western
wheatgrass spread vegetatively during the 1st growing
season but often did not produce seed until the 2nd growing season
following burning [<a href="#152">152</a>].</p>
<p>

Although growth of new shoots from rhizomes can sometimes be 
retarded by early spring burning, this effect often does 
not persist, as fall- and spring-burned plants have 
similar yields after mid-May.  In eastern Montana, spring-burned
plants quickly overcame initial slow growth and herbage yields 
equaled those on fall-burned plots [<a href="#163">163</a>].  By mid-June spring 
burned plots may have higher yields of western wheatgrass than 
adjacent unburned plots [<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#161">161</a>,<a href="#170">170</a>].  In an eastern Montana study, 
spring and fall-burned plots
produced significantly more (P < 0.05) forage than unburned plots, but
by the end of July, no differences were noted [<a href="#163">163</a>]:</p>

Following years in which precipitation is below average, western wheatgrass
tiller density may be lower in plots with "reduced surface litter," such
as burned plots, than in areas with undisturbed surface litter [<a href="#158">158</a>].  
Plants on burned plots may dry out more rapidly
than on unburned areas and may provide less standing forage after early 
July.  Reductions in western wheatgrass yields after late 
spring burns have been attributed to moisture stress [<a href="#162">162</a>].<p></p>

Burns in the spring after new growth is initiated can severely injure
western wheatgrass [<a href="#148">148</a>].  Bushey [<a href="#28">28</a>] reported that 
prescribed fire generally has a positive impact on the 
frequency and aboveground biomass of
western wheatgrass in Nevada.
<p>In the northern Great Plains, forage yield can be increased with 
the use of fire and careful timing of reintroduction of 
livestock to the burned range [<a href="#151">151</a>].  Areas burned can become 
attractive to grazers where yields and density of western 
wheatgrass increase [<a href="#22">22</a>].  After fire, western wheatgrass recovers more 
rapidly on ungrazed pasture than on grazed plots [<a href="#32">32</a>].</p>
<p>

Forage quality can be improved with burning [<a href="#151">151</a>].  Burning 
(with or without mechanical treatments) can increase the crude 
protein content of western wheatgrass 
within the first postfire growing season.  Results from a South Dakota area burned in the 
spring of 1984 are as follows [<a href="#60">60</a>]:</p>

</pre>


Frequent defoliation of western wheatgrass severely reduces plant
reserves.  In northern Colorado on a shortgrass prairie, a 14- to
26-month resting period from grazing was sufficient for the recovery of plants from a
single heavy defoliation.  After this period plants exhibited 
vigor and total nonstructural carbohydrate levels which were similar to
control plants [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  Defoliation during dormancy had 
the least effect on yield [<a href="#143">143</a>].  A greenhouse study showed that 
the frequency of clipping significantly ("P=5%") reduced cumulative
aboveground production of western wheatgrass.  The
height of clipping affected aboveground and belowground production.  Western wheatgrass plants that were clipped at either a 2 inch 
(5.0 cm) or 4 inches (10.0 cm) stubble height had significantly (P=0.05)
less root biomass than did unclipped control plants [<a href="#125">125</a>].
<p>
  
Fine fuel amounts should total at least 600 lbs/acre for good fire 
spread in rhizomatous wheatgrass [<a href="#133">133</a>].

Objectives were to control ponderosa pine encroachment onto grassland and to evaluate effects of burning in different seasons. Treatments were: (1) prefrost fall burning (18 Sept. 1973); (2) postfrost winter burning (13 Feb. 1974); (3) early spring burning (10 April 1974); and (4) no burning (control). Total fuel load was more than 2 tone/acre (oven dry) and did not vary significantly between burning dates. Herbaceous fuels averaged 4,814, 4,234, and 4,895 lbs/acre on the ridge, slope, and meadow sites, respectively. Conditions at time of burning were as follows:

Density of western wheatgrass was greater on all burned sites compared to the unburned site; however, yields were pronouncedly different between replicates. Yields increased after spring burning on the ridge but were slightly reduced on the slope and meadow sites. One month after fall burning, western wheatgrass was 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) tall. In general, fall- and winter-burned treatments greened-up later and grew more slowly than the spring-burned site. Recovery of western wheatgrass on 26 May 1974 was as follows:

In the spring 30 acres (12 ha) were burned at the Rankin Ridge site with an 
additional 45 acres (18 ha) burned in the winter. The late spring burn 
(May 27, 1976) was initiated on the northwest and southwest edges of the site. 
The fire then burned into the wind, widening the firebreaks. The northeast 
and southeast edges were then ignited and a headfire carried the fire across the 
study area. In the late winter (March 1, 1977), a burn was ignited 
at the southwest corner. The northwest, northeast, and 
southwest lines were widened by burning into the wind. Once 
the lines were widened the southeast edge was ignited, and 
a headfire carried the fire across the study area. Burning 
was initiated at about 1000 hours and completed by 1130. 
<p>

On the Wind Cave Canyon study area, 35 acres (14 ha) were burned. 
Vegetation was burned between two strips 
of fire retardant that were about 6 to 9 feet (2-3 m) apart.
Both burns at this study site were conducted on March 21, 
1976. The south fire line was reinforced by burning 
west to east strips from the existing line toward a slope. 
The fire was then backed downhill through mountain-mahogany 
(<i>Cercocarpus</i> spp.) to reduce fuels and minimize damage 
to shrubs. Along the east end of the area the fire burned with 
the wind through ponderosa pine. 
Burning was initiated at about 0830 and completed by 1130.</p>

spring burn on Rankin Ridge had lower yield of western wheatgrass the first 
postfire year but not the second year.  Yield on the late winter 
burn did not differ significantly (p=0.10) from that on control plots.

Prescribed burning is effective for creating firebreaks for 4 to 5 years,
or until the mulch layer is replaced.  Burning when mulch is 
moist helps retain a mulch layer that reduces evaporation from the soil, 
thus increasing grass yields.  The size of burned areas can affect 
postburn recovery, since bison attracted to burns can easily 
overgraze small areas.
