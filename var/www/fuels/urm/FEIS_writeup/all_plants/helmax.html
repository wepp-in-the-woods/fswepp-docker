<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Maximilian sunflower is part of the tall, thick, ungrazed cover in North
Dakota that ducks and pheasants seek out for nesting.  It also provides
winter cover and its seeds are an important winter food [<a href="#40">40</a>].

In Montana, Maximilian sunflower is rated as valuable fall forage for
Rocky Mountain elk [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Maximilian sunflower is a palatable livestock forage of good quality,
[<a href="#22">22</a>], and is also used by deer [<a href="#44">44</a>].  It remains green after
many other forbs have matured [<a href="#22">22</a>], but little use is made of the
herbage after frost [<a href="#44">44</a>].  The seeds are choice food for quail and
dove [<a href="#42">42</a>], and are eaten by many other birds [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Maximilian sunflower palatability for livestock in several western
states is as follows [<a href="#10">10</a>]:

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Maximilian sunflower was determined by the Soil Conservation Service
Plant Materials Center in Kansas to be appropriate for use in
rehabilitation of degraded sites and for visual enhancement.  In field
tests it showed excellent vigor [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Maximilian sunflower has been used successfully for revegetation of coal
minespoils in Kansas.  It established with native grasses on abandoned
spoils graded to rolling topography, limed, and disced [<a href="#43">43</a>].

The Soil Conservation Service recommends Maximilian sunflower cultivar
"Aztec" for use in rehabilitation in southern Oklahoma, all of Texas
except the Trans-Pecos region, and eastward.  The cultivar "Prairie
Gold" has greater cold tolerance, and can be used for revegetation
farther north [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Maximilian sunflower is suggested for use on roadsides, in parks, for
wildlife habitat, and in establishing prairies [<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Maximilian sunflower roots can be prepared and eaten like those of
Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus).  Native American tribes of
the Great Plains ate them raw, boiled, or roasted [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Maximilian sunflower was evaluated as a potential source of industrial
raw materials.  Since the natural rubbers present are of low molecular
weight, they may have commercial applications [<a href="#35">35</a>].

Maximilian sunflower is used as a garden ornamental [<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Planting for wildlife:  Maximilian sunflower has been planted for cover
and as a food source for scaled quail, northern bobwhites, and mourning
doves in the High and Rolling Plains of Texas [<a href="#6">6</a>].  It is a good
addition to a mix of shrubs, forbs, and grasses for use as wildlife
habitat [<a href="#42">42</a>].

Planting for prairie establishment:  Due to its aggressive spreading,
Maximilian sunflower should be lightly seeded in prairie grass mixtures.
Optimal seeding times are November to May in the Central Great Plains,
and January to March in the Southern Great Plains.  Early planting may
aid in breaking seed dormancy [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Maximilian sunflower requires low
to moderate moisture and full sun [<a href="#37">37</a>].  It was included in a mix of
native prairie grasses and forbs used to establish prairie on previously
cultivated fields in eastern Nebraska from 1975 to 1978.  It proved to
be susceptible to herbicides, and established best when mechanical means
were used to control weeds [<a href="#5">5</a>].

When buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica) in Minnesota was removed by cutting
and stump treatment with herbicide in 1985, Maximilian sunflower, which
had not been present, germinated in treated areas within 3 months of
initial treatment [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Maximilian sunflower was evaluated and grown at the Soil Conservation
Service Plant Materials Center in Kansas.  Planting procedures are
described [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Maximilian sunflower seed accessions are held at
the wild sunflower (Helianthus spp.) nursery of the Plant Introduction
Station in Ames, Iowa.  The collection can be used for problems in
prairie establishment or restoration [<a href="#45">45</a>].

Grazing:  Maximilian sunflower is not common on closely grazed ranges.
Seedlings should be protected from close use and trampling.  Moderate
grazing and periodic deferment of grazing during the growing season
enhance the persistance of Maxmimilan sunflower [<a href="#44">44</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Helianthus maximiliani
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Maximilian sunflower is a warm-season, bunching, perennial native forb
[<a href="#44">44</a>].  It grows 1.6 to 8.2 feet (0.5-2.5 m) tall [<a href="#17">17</a>], with a spread of
1 to 3 feet (0.3-0.9 m) [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Stems grow singly or clustered from short
rhizomes [<a href="#44">44</a>].  The flowers occur in long, raceme-like inflorescences
[<a href="#15">15</a>].  The floral head is 1.5 to 3 inches (4-8 cm) wide [<a href="#1">1</a>].  The fruit
is an achene 0.12 to 0.16 (3-4 mm) long [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Maximilian sunflower has
short, thick, rhizomatous rootstocks [<a href="#17">17</a>] with crown-buds [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Maximilian sunflower is a perennial which reproduces by seed [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].
It also spreads vegetatively by rhizomes, and can form large colonies
[<a href="#44">44</a>].

Maximilian sunflower cultivar "Aztec" seeds germinate within 1 to 3
weeks with a germination temperature regime of 12 hours each day at 86
degrees Fahrenheit (30 deg C) or lower [<a href="#31">31</a>].  With other seed sources,
germination can occur in 7 to 14 days, but nearly half can be dormant.
Seedling vigor is good [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Maximilian sunflower seeds from the soilbank at 22 typical habitats in
Kansas were collected in November, 1945, and stored in cool, dry
conditions until February, 1946.  Subsequent germination tests showed
two major periods of germination:  one between days 6 and 25, and another
between days 46 and 55 [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Maximilian sunflower occurs on dry to moist open prairie, often on sandy
sites [<a href="#17">17</a>].  It is best adapted to deep, sandy to clayey loam upland
soils of subhumid prairies [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Growth is poor on gravel and dense
clay, fair on sand and clay, and good on sandy to clayey loam.
Maximilian sunflower grows poorly on saline soils.  Its optimum soil
depth is 20 inches (50 cm) or more.  It is more common on heavier soils
[<a href="#44">44</a>].  It is also found on waste ground, roadsides, pastures [<a href="#1">1</a>], fence
rows [<a href="#33">33</a>], riverbanks [<a href="#18">18</a>], and other disturbed areas [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Maximilian sunflower generally occurs in areas with 10 to 50 inches
(250-1270 mm) annual precipitation [<a href="#35">35</a>], but it can occur on lowlands
with better moisture conditions in the semiaric zones [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Maximilian sunflower exhibits good growth on gentle slopes and poor
growth on moderate and steep slopes [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Maximilian sunflower occurs at the following elevations [<a href="#10">10</a>]:

                    Elevation (feet)    Elevation (m)

          CO          3,500-7,000        1,067-2,134

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Maximilian sunflower thrives in sunlight and has only fair shade
tolerance [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Stand longevity can be 5 or more years [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Maximilian sunflower seeds germinate best when soil is warm [<a href="#31">31</a>],
generally in May throughout much of the area in which it occurs.  Stands
develop rather rapidly from seed.  Growth occurs in late spring and
summer [<a href="#43">43</a>], with some flowering possible by the end of the first
growing season in the South.  However, plants are not usually fully
developed until the second year [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Maximilian sunflower dies back to
the ground each year, and regenerates new growth from rhizomes or
root crown buds [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Plants continue to spread by rhizomes after
establishment [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Maximilian sunflower flowering times are:

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Helianthus maximiliani
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Maximilian sunflower has good fire tolerance in the dormant state, and
can reproduce by rhizomes [<a href="#44">44</a>].  It produces numerous, small,
wind-dispersed seeds which germinate over a wide range of temperature
and moisture regimes [<a href="#38">38</a>] and can establish on burned sites.  Maximilian
sunflower thrives in the open, sunny conditions created by fire [<a href="#14">14</a>].
Maximilian sunflower seeds have been found in the seedbank [<a href="#26">26</a>], and it
may be an initial on-site colonizer, but no information was available on
seed tolerance to heat or length of seed viability in the seedbank.

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Helianthus maximiliani
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Maximilian sunflower is probably top-killed by fire during the growing
season.  It survives by sprouting from persistent rhizomes [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Fire usually enhances Maximilian sunflower, probably by removing litter,
allowing more sunlight to reach the soil surface, and reducing
competition.

Maximilian sunflower was burned in prescribed fires in May, 1970 and
May, 1971 in east-central North Dakota.  It increased in cover more than
100 percent within the first 2 postfire years [<a href="#23">23</a>].

When dead vegetation mulch was burned in North Dakota in 1968 and 1969,
Maximilian sunflower and other plants grew taller, stiffer, and seeded
more vigorously [<a href="#40">40</a>].

Tallgrass prairie sites containing Maximilian sunflower in northwestern
Minnesota were subjected to prescribed fire in early May, 1972.  The
removal of litter by fire varied with the site.  In undisturbed prairie
on a mesic site, flowering decreased significantly following fire.  On a
wet-mesic site in highly disturbed prairie, there was a slight,
nonsignificant decrease in flowering.  On a wet swale in undisturbed
prairie, there was a very significant increase in flowering [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In southwestern Minnesota, a degraded prairie that had been invaded by
shrubs and cool-season grasses was burned each spring from 1983 to 1987.
Native warm-season grasses and forbs, including Maximilian sunflower,
increased in dominance, and the prairie became more open each year.
Maximilian sunflower showed increased vigor, and new individuals were
established [<a href="#2">2</a>].

In the High and Rolling Plains of Texas, prescribed fire is used every 3
to 5 years to maintain optimum quail habitat in the grass stands where
Maximilian sunflower occurs [<a href="#6">6</a>].

In the Northern Great Plains, the best increases in Maximilian sunflower
vigor, canopy cover, and seed production are obtained with late spring
(May-June) fires [<a href="#19">19</a>].
