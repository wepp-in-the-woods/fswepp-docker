<b>COMMON NAMES : </b>
   Cusick's bluegrass


<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The scientific name of Cusick's bluegrass is Poa cusickii Vasey
(Poaceae) [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Accepted subspecies are:

Poa cusickii ssp. cusickii [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>]
P. c. ssp. epilis (Scribn.) Weber [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>]
P. c. ssp. pallida R. J. Soreng [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>]
P. c. ssp. purpurascens (Vasey) R. J. Soreng [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>]

Kartesz [<a href="#16">16</a>] and Welsh and others [<a href="#49">49</a>] consider Cusick's bluegrass
synonymous with mutton grass (P. fendleriana).  Based upon chloroplast
DNA anaylsis and differences in morphologies and mating systems,
however, Soreng [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>] has classified Cusick's bluegrass and mutton
grass as distinct species.  A separate report on mutton grass is
available in FEIS.

Poa X nematophylla Rydb. is a stable, apomictic taxon probably resulting
from hybridization of P. c. ssp. pallida and mutton grass [<a href="#35">35</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Cusick's bluegrass is a minor component of most plant communities in
which it occurs [<a href="#4">4</a>].  It dominates some eastern Washington, Oregon, and
California plant communities, however [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  Cusick's bluegrass is
dominant on some xeric meadows in eastern Oregon [<a href="#43">43</a>].  A big
sagebrush-silver sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata-A. cana)/Cusick's
bluegrass plant association occurs in the Ochoco Mountains and Basin of
Oregon and the Warner Mountains of California [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  A list of
publications describing plant communities dominated by Cusick's
bluegrass follows.

Vegetation types of Utah [<a href="#1">1</a>]
Riparian zone associations: Deschutes, Ochoco, Fremont, and Winema
  National Forests [<a href="#18">18</a>]
Use of geomorphology in the classification of riparian plant
  associations in mountainous landscapes of central Oregon, U.S.A. [<a href="#19">19</a>]
Plant associations of the central Oregon Pumice Zone [<a href="#44">44</a>]

Cusick's bluegrass meadows in Oregon associate with lodgepole pine
(Pinus contorta) forests upslope and more mesic meadows downslope.
Downslope mesic meadows are usually dominated by Kentucky bluegrass (Poa
pratensis) and/or tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia cespitosa).  Flora on
Cusick's bluegrass meadows are more diverse than on downslope meadows.
Plants commonly found in Cusick's bluegrass meadows include California
oatgrass (Danthonia californica), slender wheatgrass (Elymus
trachycaulus), prairie junegrass (Koeleria macrantha), slenderbeak sedge
(Carex athrostachya), threadleaf sedge (C. tilifolia), analogue sedge
(C. simulata), western yarrow (Achillea millifolium), western aster
(Aster occidentalis), and pussytoes (Antennaria spp.) [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

Associates in the bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria
spicata)-Cusick's bluegrass mountain grasslands of Utah include
Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda), Indian ricegrass (Oryzopsis
hymenoides), needle-and-thread grass (Stipa comata), sand dropseed
(Sporobolus cryptandrus), globemallow (Sphaeralcea spp.), phlox (Phlox
spp.), and boreal sweetvetch (Hedysarum boreale ssp. boreale) [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Cusick's bluegrass occurs in shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia)-
bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides) communities of eastern
Oregon.  Sandberg bluegrass and cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) are also
common in the community [<a href="#17">17</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Cusick's bluegrass makes up only a small proportion of the biomass of
the sagebrush communities in which it lives, but it is often taken
preferentially by cattle, especially early in the season [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Deer,
elk, and mountain goat also use Cusick's bluegrass early in the season
[<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
In eastern Washington, livestock prefer the less plentiful Cusick's
bluegrass over bluebunch wheatgrass or Sandberg bluegrass [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].

In eastern Oregon, Cusick's bluegrass is rated moderately palatable to
livestock, deer, and elk in early summer, and less palatable as plants
mature in July [<a href="#20">20</a>].  

The degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife species for Cusick's
bluegrass in several other western states has been rated as follows [<a href="#6">6</a>]:

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Cusick's bluegrass decreases with continuous grazing or heavy grazing
early in the growing season.  As a palatable, early-season grass that
grows on dry sites, it is especially vulnerable to overgrazing [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].
Cusick's bluegrass meadows in poor to very poor condition are common in
eastern Oregon.  When livestock grazing is managed according to the
condition of graminoids on more mesic downslopes, Cusick's bluegrass
invariably declines [<a href="#43">43</a>].

Annual production in Cusick's bluegrass meadows of eastern Oregon in
good condition is approximately 2,800 lbs/acre (dry weight).  In poor
condition, production is about 600 lbs/acre (dry weight).  Volland [<a href="#43">43</a>]
provides rangeland and soil rating guidelines for Cusick's bluegrass
meadows and other eastern Oregon grassland communities.

Cusick's bluegrass declined under moderate-intensity grazing in eastern
Washington.  Cusick's bluegrass had a 39 percent reduction in leaf
length and a 20 percent reduction in flowering culm length.  The
proportion of grass plants with flowering culms was 62 percent lower on
grazed plots than on ungrazed plots.  The number of flowering culms per
plant may also be lower.  Cusick's bluegrass was more adversely affected
by grazing than bluebunch wheatgrass or Thurber needlegrass (Stipa
thurberiana) [<a href="#30">30</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Poa cusickii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Cusick's bluegrass is a cool-season, native perennial bunchgrass. It
grows in dense, often large tufts.  Culms are 8 to 24 inches (20-60 cm)
long [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Cusick's bluegrass is dioecious with apomictic subspecies
and races in which only pistillate plants are present [<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Cusick's bluegrass reproduces from seed and by tillering [<a href="#20">20</a>].
Predominantly to entirely female populations are common.  All Poa
cusickii ssp. purpurascens plants are pistillate [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Both sexual and
apomictic races produce viable seed [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Cusick's bluegrass stores
seed in the soil.  More Cusick's bluegrass germinated from seed in soil
samples collected on plains rough fescue (Festuca altaica ssp. hallii)
prairie in Saskatchewan than from seed of any other grass species,
including plains rough fescue [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Germination rate of seed collected
from mixed-grass prairie in Saskatchewan was 42 percent [<a href="#56">56</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Cusick's bluegrass occurs mostly on dry sites.  It grows on rocky
slopes, terraces, dry margins of meadows, and inactive floodplains
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  It has shown minor coverage on moist sites [<a href="#24">24</a>].

In eastern Washington, Cusick's bluegrass tends to be restricted to
north-facing slopes in the basin big sagebrush (Artemisia
tridentata)/bluebunch wheatgrass habitat types.  In many stands,
Cusick's bluegrass occurs primarily beneath canopies of shrubs,
particularly big sagebrush and spiny hopsage (Grayia spinosa) [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].
Cusick's bluegrass occurs on all aspects in eastern Oregon [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Cusick's bluegrass occurs mostly on loamy-textured soils [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  In
Wyoming, it grows on Cryoboroll soils [<a href="#25">25</a>].  In eastern Oregon, Cusick's
bluegrass is an indicator species for meadows with pumice soils and dry
sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) floodplain sites [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Cusick's bluegrass occurs at mid- to high elevations [<a href="#18">18</a>]  The
elevational range of Cusick's bluegrass in several western states is
reported below [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Little is known of Cusick's bluegrass' place in succession.  In
floodplain succession, Cusick's bluegrass does not occur on new
floodplains.  Instead, it occurs on inactive floodplains and dry
terraces [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Cusick's bluegrass is a minor component of big
sagebrush/bluebunch wheatgrass and other climax habitat types [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Phenological decelopment of Cuisck's blugrass in most states has not
been described.  In Montana, Cusick's bluegrass flowers from June to
August [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Wet weather can extend reproduction and growth period of Cusick's
bluegrass.  In Washington, Cusick's bluegrass flowered and continued
growing for a longer period of time after the unusally wet fall and
winter of 1973-1974 than after the dry winter of 1973-1974.
Precipitation during the fall and winter of 1972-1973 was 5.4 inches
(135 mm); preciptation the fall and winter of 1973-1974 was 15 inches
(375 cm).  Mutton grass phenology was as follows [<a href="#31">31</a>]:

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Cusick's bluegrass regenerates after fire from seed and by tillering
[<a href="#20">20</a>].  

Few quantitative data are available on Cusick's bluegrass response to
fire.  A few studies have shown short-term decline after fire [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].
In general, bluegrasses (Poa spp.) are relatively resistant to fire
damage [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  Cusick's bluegrass matures rapidly in the spring and
is in a dormant state when summer and fall fires occur [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Poa cusickii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Data on the immediate effects of fire on Cusick's bluegrass are not
available.  The effects of fire on Cusick's bluegrass are probably
comparable to those observed on mutton grass, a closely related and
morphologically similar species [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Mutton grass is unharmed to
slightly harmed by light-severity fall fire [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Mutton grass
appears to be harmed by and slow to recover from severe fire [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].

Pedestalling increases the susceptibilty of bunchgrasses to fire.  When
grasses are elevated, new tillers are no longer insulated from fire by
the soil [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Cusick's bluegrass plants that have become
pedestalled by local erosion may be severely damaged or killed by fire,
although fuels at such sites may be too patchy to support fire spread.
Overgrazed Cusick's bluegrass rangelands are characterized by 25 to 45
percent bare ground and pedestalled Cusick's bluegrass plants [<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Most information on Cusick's bluegrass response to fire is anecdotal
[<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  Cusick's bluegrass recovery from fire is reported as
"moderately rapid" [<a href="#20">20</a>] to "very rapid" [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  Least damage occurs
with late summer or fall fire when Cusick's bluegrass is dormant.  Most
damage is thought to occur from spring fire that occurs after plants
have started growth [<a href="#53">53</a>].

Wildfire in mid-August, 1973, reduced vegetative growth and reproduction
of Cusick's bluegrass for at least 3 years.  The wildfire burned through
a portion of a bluebunch wheatgrass-Thurber needlegrass (Stipa
thurberiana) community on the Arid Lands Ecology Reserve in
south-central Washington.  An unburned portion of the community (fire
excluded for at least 30 years) was used as a control.  Basal area was
reduced by 42 percent the first year after fire and remained reduced for
all 3 postfire years on the burned site [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Leaf length,
flowerhead length, and number of flowering culms were reduced the first
year after fire.  In postfire year 2, the number of flowering culms per clump
was much greater than that on an unburned stand.  By postyear 3, leaf
length and the number of flowering culms equalled plants on the unburned

<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Repeated prescribed fire is recommended for reducing sagebrush (Artemsia
spp.) on sagebrush/Cusick's bluegrass rangelands in eastern Oregon.
Kovalchik [<a href="#18">18</a>] reported that on big sagebrush-silver sagbrush/Cusick's
bluegrass communities that are in fair or better condition, repeated
prescribed fire greatly decreases big sagebrush cover and increases
cover of Cusick's bluegrass.  Silver sagebrush cover is not reduced as
much as big sagebrush cover because silver sagebrush sprouts, but silver
sagebrush decreases at least somewhat as Cusick's bluegrass increases in
vigor [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Considering Cusick's bluegrass meadows of eastern Oregon, Volland [<a href="#43">43</a>]
wrote that, "Nothing is known about the effect of prescribed burning on
this plant community."  Because it is nonrhizomatous, Cusick's
bluegrass may decline at the expense of Kentucky bluegrass, which is
rhizomatous and common in Cusisk's bluegrass communities.  Volland
cautioned that if Cusick's bluegrass meadows are burned, they should be
protected from grazing for at least one growing season after fire.
