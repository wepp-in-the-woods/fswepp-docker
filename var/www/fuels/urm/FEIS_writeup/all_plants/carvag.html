<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
In the western area of the Northwest Territories, (south of the arctic
circle and to the west of Great Bear Lake) in a subarctic black spruce
(Picea mariana) ecosystem, sheathed sedge is one of nine species that
form the dominant understory cover and biomass of the vascular plants.
The other associated species are bog Labrador tea (Ledum groenlandicum),
crowberry (Empetrum nigrum), blueberry willow (Salix myrtillifolia),
littletree willow (Salix arbusculoides), red fruit bearberry
(Arctostaphylos rubra), bog blueberry (Vaccinium uliginosum), sedge
(Carex membranacea), and polargrass (Arctagrostis latifolia) [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Sheathed sedge is associated with a wide variety of species.  Associated
species are listed for white spruce (Picea glauca)-green alder (Alnus
crispa)-willow (Salix spp.) communities in northwestern Northwest
Territories [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Associates are listed for low shrub birch (Betula
glandulosa)-willow-green alder communities and for white spruce (Picea
glauca)-balsam poplar (Populus balsamifer) communities in south-central
Alaska [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Associates are also listed for the boreal forest of
eastern Ontario and western Quebec [<a href="#3">3</a>], northern Ontario [<a href="#17">17</a>], and
central Saskatchewan, Canada [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Sheathed sedge grows in tundra communities as well as in the boreal
forest [<a href="#23">23</a>].

<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Sheathed sedge and other vegetation in wet sedge meadows underlain by
permafrost in the northwestern Northwest Territories are highly
susceptible to disturbance by roads and seismic lines in summer.  They
are least affected by winter operations.  Sheathed sedge increased from
0 percent to 2.1 percent cover (equal to control plots) over 2 years on
the disturbed seismic lines [<a href="#10">10</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carex vaginata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sheathed sedge is a native, perennial, monoecious graminoid [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Culms
are 4 to 24 inches (10-60 cm) tall [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  Principal foliage leaves are
basal [<a href="#11">11</a>], mostly shorter than the culms [<a href="#7">7</a>], and 0.06 to 0.20 inches
(1.5-5 mm) wide [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].  The terminal inflorescence is a spike 0.4 to 0.8
inches (1-2 cm) long; there are one to three lateral spikes as well.
The fruit is a small triangular achene [<a href="#1">1</a>].  The perigynia surrounding
the achene is ovoid and 0.12 to 0.20 inches (3-5 mm) long [<a href="#7">7</a>].  There
are 3 to 20 perigynia per spike [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Sheathed sedge has long, slender
rhizomes [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>]; it also has stolons [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sheathed sedge sprouts from perennating buds at the base of the culms
and from rhizomes and stolons [<a href="#7">7</a>].  It also reproduces by seed [<a href="#9">9</a>].

In disturbed sites in the northwestern Northwest Territories, sheathed
sedge grew and expanded from intact rhizomes.  Some seed establishment
may also have occurred [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sheathed sedge occurs on a wide variety of substrates and in a variety
of moisture regimes, from hydric to mesic.  It occurs in moist to wet
mossy woods, bogs, and other wet places [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  In west-central
Alberta it occurs on poor to rich, wet soils [<a href="#4">4</a>].  In boreal forest in
central Saskatchewan, sheathed sedge occurs on soil that shows no
evidence of standing water at any time during the year [<a href="#5">5</a>].

In south-central Alaska sheathed sedge occurs on soils containing 70 to
85 percent sand [<a href="#20">20</a>].  In the northeastern United States it occurs
chiefly on calcareous soils [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  Sheathed sedge in boreal forest in
eastern Ontario occurs on wet coniferous sites with acidic peat
substrates [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Sheathed sedge at some sites in south-central Alaska
occurs on soil with pH of 5.4 to 6.7 [<a href="#20">20</a>].

In Alaska sheathed sedge occurs from sea level to at least 2,494 feet
(760 m) elevation [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  In west-central Alberta it is found from
1,641 to 4,593 feet (500-1,400 m) [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Most information on the role of sheathed sedge in succession is related
to fire.  See the Plant Response to Fire section of FIRE EFFECTS.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Sheathed sedge blooms from June to August in the central and
northeastern United States and adjacent Canada [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carex vaginata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Since sheathed sedge reproduces vegetatively [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>], it probably sprouts
from rhizomes after aerial portions are burned.  Sheathed sedge is
long-rhizomed, and has a rather diffuse growth form [<a href="#7">7</a>].  However, where
thicker tufts form, they may protect basal buds from fire damage.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil
   Tussock graminoid

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carex vaginata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Sheathed sedge culms are probably top-killed by fire during the growing
season.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Vegetation regrowth after fire is very fast in low arctic tundra sedge
(Carex spp.)-dominated communities [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Sedges increase in importance
following fire in these habitats [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Sheathed sedge in northern Ontario was sparse at the beginning of
succession after fire.  Its numbers continued to rise for 10 years.  It
then disappeared over about a 2-year period as black spruce and jack
pine (Pinus banksiana) began to regenerate [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Sheathed sedge occurs in the central Saskatchewan boreal forest, which
has had a history of frequent fire.  Sheathed sedge in previously burned
sites in this region occurred at a frequency of 31 percent in balsam
poplar stands.  Balsam poplar is considered a pioneer species.  Sheathed
sedge occurred at a frequency of 1 to 9 percent in later successional
stands, dominated by jack pine and black spruce, and did not occur at
all in climax vegetation [<a href="#5">5</a>].
