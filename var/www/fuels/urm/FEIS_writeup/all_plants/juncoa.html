<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name for redberry juniper is Juniperus coahuilensis 
(Martinez) Gaussen [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Confusion about the correct name for this entity arose 
over its morphological resemblance to oneseed juniper (J. monosperma) and over its red 
cones, which resemble those of Pinchot juniper (J. pinchottii).  Redberry juniper 
intergrades with Pinchot juniper in the Trans-Pecos region of Texas, where their 
ranges overlap.  There is a probable hybrid swarm in the Basin of the Chisos Mountains,
Texas [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Zanoni and Adams [<a href="#24">24</a>] determined that redberry juniper and Pinchot 
juniper are the most closely related junipers based on similarity of leaf oil 
terpenoids and other characters.

<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Redberry juniper occurs in disjunct populations from western Texas
(Trans-Pecos), southwestern New Mexico, and southern Arizona south to
San Luis Potosi, Mexico [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
In the Southwest junipers (Juniperus spp.) are associated with oaks
(Quercus spp.) and true pinyon (Pinus edulis).  Junipers increase in
dominance over oaks and pinyons on dry sites [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Redberry juniper is
common in alligator juniper (J. deppeana)-pinyon woodlands and savannas,
and in areas where its range overlaps with Utah juniper (J.
osteosperma), oneseed juniper (J. monosperma), and Rocky Mountain
juniper (J. scopulorum) [<a href="#8">8</a>].  It occurs in evergreen oak woodlands with
Emory oak (Q. emoryi) and Mexican blue oak (Q. oblongifolia) [<a href="#11">11</a>].
Redberry juniper is also found in Arizona chaparral woodlands with shrub
live oak (Q. turbinella) and Arizona rosewood (Vauquelinia californica)
[<a href="#20">20</a>].  It occurs as scattered individuals in grama (Bouteloua spp.)
grasslands, along with scattered velvet mesquite (Prosopis velutina),
Mexican blue oak, and alligator juniper [<a href="#14">14</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Redberry juniper wood is used locally for posts and fuel [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
The fleshy, berry-like cones of redberry juniper are eaten by at least
four species of songbirds, Gambel's quail, coyotes, foxes, raccoons,
rock squirrels, Hopi chipmunks, and probably other birds and mammals [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juniperus coahuilensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Redberry juniper is a native, evergreen, small tree or large shrub.
Mature height usually ranges from 12 to 15 feet (3.6-4.5 m), with
spreading and ascending branches forming an open, irregular crown.  The
ovulate cones contain one seed [<a href="#15">15</a>].  The bark is shreddy, but but is
formed close to the trunk.  Redberry juniper tends to have a central
erect stem with lower branches originating near the ground level [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Redberry juniper reproduces by seed.  Further information specific to
reproduction in redberry juniper is not available.  Pinchot juniper is
one of the few juniper species known to sprout after top-kill, and it is
closely related to redberry juniper.  In most junipers germination may
be delayed up to 2 years through embryo dormancy, seedcoat
impermeability, or chemical inhibitors.  Juniper seedling establishment
is enhanced by light shade, which helps maintain adequate moisture [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
In Trans-Pecos Texas junipers are most common on rocky or poor soils
[<a href="#14">14</a>].  Redberry juniper occurs most often on dry, well-drained soils in
full sun [<a href="#19">19</a>].  It occurs at elevations of 4,000 feet (1,200 m) to 6,500
feet (2,000 m) through its range [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Redberry juniper is intolerant of shade [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Junipers often invade
grasslands and are gradually replaced by pinyons [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Redberry juniper is pollinated in late fall, and the ovulate cones
mature in late spring [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Most juniper seeds germinate in spring [<a href="#7">7</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juniperus coahuilensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Redberry juniper occurs on juniper savannas, which are kept open by
fire.  Fires in these habitats tend to be surface fires carried by
grasses, which burn so rapidly that heat levels lethal to large redberry
juniper are rarely generated [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Fire-free intervals of 10 years or
more are usually sufficient to allow juniper (Juniperus spp.) saplings
to reach fire-resistant size:  about 3 to 6 feet (1-2 m) [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Redberry
juniper occurs in evergreen oak woodlands [<a href="#11">11</a>] which experience rapidly
burning grass fires approximately every 10 to 20 years [<a href="#22">22</a>].

In some areas, junipers (probably including redberry juniper) are
encroaching on grasslands that were historically kept clear of trees and
shrubs by very frequent fires.  Climatic changes and intensive livestock
grazing have also been implicated in this encroachment [<a href="#7">7</a>].
