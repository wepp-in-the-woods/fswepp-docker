<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Atriplex lentiformis

<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Big saltbrush occurs along the coast of California from San Francisco
southward into central Baja California, east to Nevada, Utah, Colorado,
central Arizona, New Mexico, and northwestern Sonora, Mexico
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  It is cultivated in Hawaii [<a href="#37">37</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Big saltbrush seldom obtains dominance or codominance in plant
communities.  It therefore has not been identified in the literature as
an indicator species.

Big saltbrush is commonly associated with the following species:
salt-cedar (Tamarix chinensis), arrow-weed pluchea (Pluchea sericea),
screwbean mesquite (Prosopis pubescens), honey mesquite (P. glandulosa),
seepwillow baccharis (Baccharis glutinosa), devil-weed aster (Aster
spinosis), and shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Atriplex lentiformis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
The twigs and foliage of big saltbrush provide forage for livestock,
mule deer, pronghorn, and many small mammals [<a href="#8">8</a>].  The seeds are
consumed by small mammals, and birds such as Gambel quail and
ring-necked pheasants [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
In Utah, palatability of big saltbrush foliage has been rated as fair
for cattle, good for sheep, and poor for horses [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Atriplex spp. are known for their high productivity and quality forage
[<a href="#31">31</a>].  Nutritional value of big saltbrush is high; it contains almost as
much protein, fat, and carbohydrates as alfalfa hay [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Percent
nutrient values for big saltbrush are as follows:  6.11 percent water,
4.73 percent ash, 7.81 percent crude protein, 27.05 percent crude fiber,
1.99 percent fat, and 52.31 percent nitrogen-free extract [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Forage quality is influenced by age and phenological stage at the time
of harvest.  During the establishment years, high dry matter yields are
generally associated with lower nutritional values [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Big saltbrush grows in dense stands providing fair to good cover for
wildlife [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  The degree to which this shrub provides environmental
protection during one or more seasons for wildlife species in Utah is
rated as follows [<a href="#8">8</a>]:

                        Pronghorn              Fair
                        Elk                    Poor
                        Mule deer              Fair
                        Small mammals          Good
                        Small nongame birds    Good
                        Upland game birds      Fair


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Big saltbrush has been used for erosion control on disturbed riparian
sites in the San Joaquin Valley and Tapo Canyon Creek, California
[<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  After one growing season in the San Joaquin valley, big
saltbrush survival was 88 percent.  Most surviving shrubs were healthy
and grew quickly [<a href="#35">35</a>].

This shrub is also used for wildlife habitat restoration.  In a Colorado
River Valley study, bird and rodent use was abundant 2 years after
planting with native species such as Fremont cottonwood (Populus
fremontii) and big saltbrush [<a href="#7">7</a>].  'Casa' big saltbrush, a cultivator
originating from San Bernito County, California, was utilized in 1979
for wildlife habitat plantings in California.  However, it lacks
sufficent cold hardiness to be recommended throughout the species'
range.  Nurseries produce about 15,000 plants annually [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Native Americans ground big saltbrush seeds for meal and for use as an
emetic.  They ground the roots and flowers to sooth ant bites [<a href="#6">6</a>].  This
shrub is also used as an ornamental hedge in coastal California [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Atriplex shrubs harbor spinach mildew and consequently should not
be planted where spinach is grown [<a href="#27">27</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Atriplex lentiformis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Big saltbrush is a deep-rooted, fast-growing, native perennial shrub
[<a href="#20">20</a>].  Branches are numerous, widespreading, slender, and flexible [<a href="#29">29</a>].
It normally grows to a height of 0.5 to 5.0 feet (0.15-1.52 m) [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>],
but may reach 10.0 feet (3.0 m) in areas where the water table is high
[<a href="#15">15</a>].  Leaves are thickish with a fine, scaly surface and are 0.3 to 2.0
inches (1.0-5.0 cm) long and 0.15 to 1.6 inches (0.5-4.0 cm) wide
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  They are deciduous in desert ecotypes but tend to be evergreen
elsewhere [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte
   Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Flowers:  Big saltbrush flowers are dioecious and wind pollinated [<a href="#21">21</a>].
These plants have the ability to alter their sexual state from one
season to the next in response to environmental conditions [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Plants
which change sex appear to begin reproducing earlier than pistillate
plants, while producing as many seeds [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Seeds and Germination:  Big saltbrush plants produce many seeds [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>]
which are borne on bracts and wind dispersed [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Seeds germinate
well without pretreatment or light [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].

Vegetative reproducition:  Big saltbrush has been vegetatively
propagated by means of stem cuttings [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Big saltbrush is a phretophyte and halophyte that is found in both
coastal and desert habitats [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Coastal populations typically occur
at the base of coastal bluffs and on coastal floodplains [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Interior
populations are found along valley bottoms and margins of dry lakebeds
[<a href="#14">14</a>], where groundwater of moderate salinity is available [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Soils:  Big saltbrush usually grows on poorly drained, saline, and/or
saline-sodic soils [14,15,29,31,] with a pH from 7.5 to 8.3 [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Elevation:  This shrub occurs from 300 to 4,500 feet (91-1,372 m)
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>] but most commonly below 1,600 feet (488 m) [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Temperature/Precipitation:  Big saltbrush typically occurs in areas with
mean annual temperatures of 59 to 71 degrees Fahrenheit (14.8-21.9 deg
C) and 3 to 16 inches (7.6-40.6 cm) of mean annual precipitation [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Big saltbrush exhibits characteristics of a stress-tolerant ruderal and,
therefore, occurs in early to mid-seral communities.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Big saltbrush flowers mature from June to August.  Fruits mature from
September to October [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Maximum growth occurs in early summer [<a href="#20">20</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Atriplex lentiformis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
The foliage of big saltbrush appears to have fire-retarding qualities
associated with the salt content of the leaves [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Additionally,
this species is a profuse seeder [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Atriplex lentiformis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Although big saltbrush foliage is somewhat fire resistant [<a href="#6">6</a>], a severe
fire will typically kill aboveground portions of the plant [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Specific information on big saltbrush's response to fire is lacking.
However, this shrub is known to be a profuse seeder and probably
colonizes burned sites by wind dispersed seeds [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
NO-ENTRY
