<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Diospyros texana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Texas persimmon is endemic to southern and central Texas and northern
Mexico.  In Texas, it occurs in the Rio Grande Plains, Edwards Plateau,
and the southeastern corner of the Trans-Pecos region.  In Mexico, Texas
persimmon occurs in the northern portions of Neuvo Leon, Coahuila, and
Tamaulipas [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  It may also occur in the extreme northeastern
corner of Chihuahua [<a href="#25">25</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Texas persimmon is a common component in many mature riparian and woody
upland communities [<a href="#40">40</a>].  On floodplain terraces Texas persimmon is a
characteristic component of riparian forests which are dominated or
codominated by live oak (Quercus virginiana), netleaf hackberry (Celtis
reticulata), sugarberry (C. laevigata), pecan (Carya illinoensis),
cedar-elm (Ulmus crassifolia), western soapberry (Sapindus saponaria
var. drummondii), great leucaena (Leucaena pulverulenta), and ash
(Fraxinus spp.) [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  Associate understory species include
granjeno (Celtis pallida), huisache (Acacia farnesiana), and lime
pricklyash (Zanthoxylum fagara) [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].

In the Cedar Breaks region of the Edwards Plateau, Texas persimmon
occurs in scrub evergreen forests with Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei),
mescalbean sophora (Sophora secundiflora), and Texas live oak (Quercus
virginiana var. fusiformis) [<a href="#39">39</a>].

In invading thorn woodlands on former grassland sites, Texas persimmon
occurs with Texas prickly pear (Opuntia lindheimeri), lime pricklyash,
granjeno, lotebush (Condalia obovata), agarito (Mahonia trifoliolata),
and blackbrush acacia (Acacia rigidula) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  On the Rio Grande
Plains, Texas persimmon occurs in a honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa
var. glandulosa)-mixed brush shrubland community and in a honey
mesquite/bristlegrass (Setaria spp.)/forb woodland [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Texas persimmon may become codominant in the netleaf hackberry-huisache
association and the honey mesquite-granjeno association [<a href="#27">27</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Diospyros texana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Texas persimmon wood is black, hard, and heavy.  It takes a high polish
and is used for tools, engraving blocks, and art work [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Wildlife use Texas persimmon for food, shelter, and cover.  Coyote,
raccoon, ringtail, foxes, and other mammals and birds eat the fruit
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Spanish goats consume large amounts of Texas persimmon foliage
[<a href="#22">22</a>].  White-tailed deer browse the foliage lightly [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].

In brushy habitats Texas persimmon and other woody species form a tall
overlapping canopy which produces thermal, hiding, and escape cover for
white-tailed deer [<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Texas persimmon browse is of low preference to white-tailed deer [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Dry-weight Texas persimmon browse averages 14 percent protein, 0.25
percent phosphorus, 1.55 percent potassium, 2.46 percent calcium, 0.64
percent magnesium, and 0.08 percent sodium [<a href="#19">19</a>].  The browse has medium
food value for white-tailed deer [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Container-grown Texas persimmon was planted with other native species on
a borrow pit reclamation site in central Texas.  The exposed subsoil and
sandstone was covered with 4 to 6 inches (10-15 cm) of topsoil before
planting.  Eighty percent of the woody transplants survived the first
summer and winter [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Texas persimmon fruit is edible and used in puddings and custards.  The
fruit pulp produces an indelible black stain.  Mexicans use it to dye
animal hides [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].

Texas persimmon is used for landscaping [<a href="#33">33</a>].



<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Texas persimmon is one of many woody species that has contributed to
brush problems on Texas rangeland.  With overgrazing, drought, increased
seed dispersal, and decreased fire frequency, woody species have
expanded from lowlands onto uplands.  Managers are concerned with the
corresponding decrease in grass forage and are experimenting with
methods for controlling brush [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Double chaining is an effective means of opening up dense stands of
scrub oak (Quercus spp.)-juniper (Juniperus spp.) communities which
contain Texas persimmon.  In a study on the Edwards Plateau, brush
canopy was 80 percent lower on treated than untreated brush stands 1
year after double chaining [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Mechanical brush removal followed by
prescribed fire is the most effective brush control method (See FIRE
MANAGEMENT) [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].

Texas persimmon is generally resistant to herbicides.  Texas persimmon
was only slightly susceptible to soil application of picloram pellets
[<a href="#23">23</a>].  Canopy reductions of Texas persimmon after aerial application of
picloram and 2,4,5,-T are described [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Spanish goats can be used to control brush.  Optimum goat stocking
densities and management are described [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Bryant and Kothmann [<a href="#12">12</a>] estimated Texas persimmon browse biomass using
regression equations with crown volume and weight relationships.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Diospyros texana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Texas persimmon is a small, native, dioecious tree with smooth, peeling
bark [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Texas persimmon leaves are generally deciduous at the
northern edge of its range but become persistent further south [<a href="#33">33</a>].
Texas persimmon generally grows to about 10 feet (3 m) in height, but
may grow to 40 feet (12 m) on good sites [<a href="#33">33</a>].  The three- to
eight-seeded fruit is about 0.8 inches (2 cm) in diameter [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].

Several characteristics enable Texas persimmon to survive in semiarid
environments.  The broad upwardly inclined leaves and smooth bark with
low water retention serve to funnel rainwater down the stems.  Stemflow
volume of Texas persimmon is 5.6 percent of the total precipitation over
the crown of the tree [<a href="#29">29</a>].  In addition, the leaves are sclerophyllous
and drought deciduous [<a href="#45">45</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Texas persimmon regenerates by vegetative reproduction and seed.

Five- to six-year-old individuals may begin producing fruit [<a href="#33">33</a>].  The
seeds are dispersed by animals.  In a study on the Edwards Plateau, more
than 90 percent of carnivore feces collected between September and
November contained Texas persimmon seeds.  The study did not include
data on herbivores.  Seeds are not destroyed by mastication or
digestion [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Texas persimmon seeds washed free of fruit pulp germinate readily, but
seeds covered with intact fruit do not.  The fruit apparently contains
an inhibitor.  Texas persimmon fruit pulp inhibited the root growth of
germinating honey mesquite [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Texas persimmon seeds are nondormant.  Laboratory acid treatments are
detrimental to germination [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Seeds germinate anytime that
soils are moist.  In wet years fall germination is followed by slow
winter growth and increased growth in the spring.  In dry years seeds
do not germinate until the next wet season, usually the following spring
[<a href="#38">38</a>].  Viability is not reduced after 2 years in storage [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Germination rates are generally high (50-90%) [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Germination
rates in excess of 90 percent occur when temperatures are between 68 and
86 degrees Fahrenheit (20 and 30 deg C), but rates drop considerably at
lower temperatures.  Germination occurs equally well in light and dark
conditions [<a href="#18">18</a>].  The germination rate after scarification with coarse
sandpaper for 2 minutes was 77 percent, higher than the unscarified
control seeds at 55 percent [<a href="#42">42</a>].

Seedlings are not dependent on soil cover for establishment, but highest
emergence (73%) and 60-day height growth [8.2 inches (20.8 cm)]
occurred when seeds were covered with 0.4 inch (1 cm) of soil.  Soil
depths of 0.8 to 2.8 inches (2-7 cm) did not severely restrict emergence
and height growth [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Texas persimmon grows slowly; it reaches 2.0 to 3.6 feet (0.6-1.1 m) in
height after 5 years [<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Texas persimmon occurs on semiarid sites including rocky north slopes,
arroyos, ravines, and upper floodplain terraces [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  In drier
regions, it is confined to canyon sites [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Texas persimmon grows on
a variety of soil types including calcareous soils [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>], clays, and
fine sandy loams [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].  It occurs from 1,100 to 5,700 feet (300-1,700 m)
elevation [<a href="#30">30</a>].

The climate in southern Texas and northern Mexico is subtropical with
warm winters and hot humid summers.  Rainfall is bimodal, peaking in the
spring and fall [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Texas persimmon is shade tolerant [<a href="#38">38</a>].  It is an important species in
mature woodlands [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Seedlings grow as well in 50 percent shade as in
full sunlight [<a href="#38">38</a>].  There are 150 to 700 Texas persimmon per hectare in
decidous and evergreen woodlands in the southeastern portion of the
Edwards Plateau.  About 80 percent are between 0.4 and 2.0 inches (1-5
cm) in diameter at ground level, indicating recent recruitment into the
population or suppressed growth [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].

During the past century brush has invaded the savannas and grasslands of
Texas; woody cover increased an estimated 16 to 36 percent between 1941
and 1983.  Honey mesquite generally invades first, then serves as a
focus for wildlife which disseminate the seeds of other woody species.
Clusters of brush develop and stabilize.  Texas persimmon attains 50
percent frequency in brush clusters that are 86 to 118 square feet (8-11
sq m) about 30 to 40 years after the initial honey mesquite invasion.
Texas persimmon occurs frequently in brush clusters that contain at
least four to six woody species [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Texas persimmon flowers from February to June [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Fruits mature in
August and September [<a href="#38">38</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Diospyros texana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
It is likely that Texas persimmon cannot persist in communities with
high fire frequency.  However, the sprouting ability of Texas persimmon
enables it to survive occasional fire.

Texas persimmon historically occurred in areas such as lowlands,
floodplains, and arroyos, which did not experience fire as frequently as
the upland prairies.  As fire frequency in the prairies was reduced
during the past century, Texas persimmon expanded into the uplands with
other woody species.  Drought, overgrazing, and seed dispersal by
livestock which range further into uplands due to artificial watering
holes also enhanced the spread of woody species onto grasslands.
However, the reduced frequency of prairie fires played a major role in
upsetting the equilibrium between grass and brush [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Diospyros texana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire top-kills mature Texas persimmon.  A greater fuel load results in
more top-kill, especially in individuals less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) basal
diameter [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Fire may completely kill Texas persimmon, especially
smaller individuals [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Texas persimmon sprouts from the root crown when top-killed by fire
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  One year after fire in a chaparral-mixed grass community in the
Welder Wildlife Refuge, surviving Texas persimmon had sprouted and was
growing vigorously [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Managers use fire in combination with mechanical methods to control and
remove brush from grasslands.  On a loam prairie site in Goliad County,
Texas persimmon decreased as much as 68 percent with mechanical
treatment combinations followed by 2 consecutive years of August fires.
Treatment combinations included roller chopping followed by 2
consecutive years of shredding, and roller chopping, shredding, and
herbicide spraying while shredding [<a href="#15">15</a>].

On the Welder Wildlife Refuge in southern Texas, mechanical brush
removal treatments followed by fall fire 2 years later was applied to a
chaparral-bristlegrass community.  Fires were more effective at brush
control if the area had been pretreated with mechanical brush removal.
Plots with mechanical removal (chopped, scalped with a bulldozer, or
shredded with a rotary mower) burned uniformly because of available
fuel.  In plots with no mechanical pretreatment, fire carried in the
grass and into small brush clumps, but large brush mottes remained
unburned.  On burned plots, 10 percent of Texas persimmon, mostly small
plants, were completely killed; the remainder were top-killed but
sprouted from the root crown.  At postfire year 1, Texas persimmon
average percent frequency for unburned (but mechanically treated) plots
was 19 percent and for pretreated burned plots was 10 percent [<a href="#8">8</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Diospyros texana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>CASE NAME : </b>
Welder Wildlife Refuge fire temperature study


<b>REFERENCE : </b>
White, R. S. 1969 [<a href="#46">46</a>]

<b>SEASON/SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION : </b>
Spring/variable severity


<b>STUDY LOCATION : </b>
The study was conducted on the Welder Wildlife Refuge in San Patricio
County, Texas, about 20 miles (32 km) north of Corpus Christi.


<b>PREFIRE VEGETATIVE COMMUNITY : </b>
Two plant communities are present in the study area:
chaparral-bristlegrass (Setaria spp.) and honey mesquite (Prosopis
glandulosa var. glandulosa)-buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides).
Collectively, these communities are dominated by leguminous shrubs
interspersed with grasses.  Honey mesquite and huisache (Acacia
farnesiana) dominate the shrub layer, and seacoast bluestem
(Schizachyrium scoparium var. littoralis) is the most abundant
graminoid.


<b>TARGET SPECIES PHENOLOGICAL STATE : </b>
At the time of the fire, Texas persimmon (Diospyros persimmon) was
semidormant.  A few old leaves were present on some plants.  Two weeks
after the fire, leaf buds began to open on unburned plots.


<b>SITE DESCRIPTION : </b>
The study is located on the Gulf Coastal Plain so presumably the
topography is flat or rolling.  The soil is a clay in the Vertisols
order.  The climate is subtropical; rainfall averages 30 inches (760 mm)
a year.



<b>FIRE DESCRIPTION : </b>
The 10-acre (4 ha) study site was divided into four subplots; one was
burned on March 8 and the remaining three on March 12.  Fire weather and
site conditions for the March 8 fire were as follows:  air temperature
60 degrees Fahrenheit (16 deg C), relative humidity 90 percent, wind
velocity 10 miles per hour (16 k/h), soil moisture 40 percent, and
herbaceous fuel moisture 9 percent.  Conditions for the March 12 fire
were as follows:  air temperature 55 degrees Fahrenheit (13 deg C),
relative humidity 45 percent, wind velocity 20 to 30 miles per hour
(32-48 k/h), soil moisture 37 percent, and herbaceous fuel moisture 7
percent.  Both fires were wind driven.  The March 12 fire was hotter
than the March 8 fire primarily because of lower humidity and higher
wind velocity.
 
Forty to fifty percent of the study site did not burn.  Fire carried
well through the tall seacoast bluestem but burned poorly in areas
dominated by shorter grasses.  Surface temperatures during the fires
were extremely variable.  Maximum surface temperatures ranged from 480
to 1,350 degrees Fahrenheit (249-732 deg C).  Temperature showed a weak
(P<0.10) correlation with fuel quantity.  Flame height was about 7 feet
(2.1 m) on March 8 and 8 feet (2.4 m) on March 12.


<b>FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES : </b>
Although 50 Texas persimmon plants were originally tagged for postfire
study, only 17 plants were analyzed because of incomplete burning.
Percent partial and complete top-kill of Texas persimmon at different
fuel loads follows:

           Fuel         Partial Top-kill	Complete Top-kill
        (lbs/acre)         (percent)                (percent)

          0-2,000              67                       33
        2,000-4,000            25                       75
          > 4,000               0                      100

Regardless of fuel load, no Texas persimmon was completely killed.

Fire damage to Texas persimmon was inversely related to its size when
fuel loads were less than 2,000 lbs per acre.  Of six individuals less
than 1 inch (2.5 cm) in basal diameter, three individuals were partially
top-killed and three were completely top-killed.  Of six individuals
greater than 1 inch (2.5 cm) in basal diameter, five were partially
top-killed and only one was completely top-killed.


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS : </b>
Spring fire was effective at top-killing Texas persimmon, but did not
result in mortality.  For useful brush control, fire must be applied a
number of times over a period of years.  To achieve maximum results,
fire should be prescribed when the plants are young and the fuel load is
high.
