<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Leadplant is a member of various climax grassland plant associations
described for the National Forests of Wyoming, Colorado, and the western
halves of South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas.  These include the
following series:  sand bluestem (Andropogon gerardii var. paucipilus),
prairie sandreed (Calamovilfa longifolia), big bluestem (Andropogon
gerardii var. gerardii), and needle-and-thread grass (Stipa comata)
[<a href="#21">21</a>].  In the Black Hills National Forest of South Dakota and Wyoming,
leadplant occurs as a member of two ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)
habitat types:  ponderosa pine/snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus) and
ponderosa pine/bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) [<a href="#19">19</a>].  There are no
described plant communities for the central and southern Great Plains,
but Weaver and Fitzpatrick [<a href="#38">38</a>] called leadplant "perhaps the most
conspicuous characteristic subdominant of upland, tallgrass prairie."

Leadplant is an important shrub in the southern Great Plains Cross
Timbers plant association.  Post oak (Q. stellata) and blackjack oak (Q.
marilandica) dominate.  Primary grasses are little bluestem
(Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem, indiangrass (Sorghasturm
nutans), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum).  Other important shrubs are
smoothleaf sumac (Rhus glabra) and wild plum (Prunus spp.).

Associated species in the central Great Plains are primarily little and
big bluestem, switchgrass, indiangrass, and prairie dropseed (Sporobolus
heterolepis); additional grass species in the Sandhills of Nebraska are
prairie sandreed and sand bluestem.  Important shrubs besides leadplant
include western snowberry (Symphoricarpos occidentalis), inland
ceanothus (Ceanothus ovatus), willow (Salix spp.), gooseberry (Ribes
spp.), and prairie rose (Rosa arkansana) [<a href="#40">40</a>].

Dominant grasses in the Northern Great Plains are thickspike wheatgrass
(Elymus lanceolatus), western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii), junegrass
(Koelaria macrantha), green needlegrass (Stipa viridula), western
porcupine grass (S. spartea var. curtiseta), Canada wildrye (Elymus
canadensis), sedges (Carex spp.), and little bluestem.  Leadplant,
fringed sagebrush (Artemisia frigida), western snowberry, russet
buffaloberry (Shepherdia canadensis), silverberry (Elaeagnus commutata),
and rose (Rosa spp.) are among the important shrubs present.  Plains
pricklypear (Opuntia polyacantha) is also a common associate [<a href="#40">40</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Leadplant tends to be an incidental or minor component of livestock and
wildlife diet throughout its range [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Livestock browse it sparingly
[<a href="#33">33</a>].  In some areas it is used only in the spring [<a href="#30">30</a>].  In the central
Black Hills, however, Uresk and Lowrey [<a href="#32">32</a>] reported a higher percentage
of leadplant in cattle diets in September (1.5%) than in July (0.1%).
In a study of palatability of Black Hills plants for white-tailed deer
[<a href="#18">18</a>], leadplant was rated as unpalatable during all months.  This may
have been due to the presence of many other more palatable species [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife species for leadplant
is rated as follows [<a href="#11">11</a>]:

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Leadplant is valuable for erosion control due to its deep, branching
woody root system, and is included in grass seeding mixtures because of
its nitrogen-fixing capability [<a href="#36">36</a>].

Treatment is probably not necessary for fall-sown seed; however, stored
seeds have impermeable seedcoats and a high percentage of dormant seed,
necessitating some type of treatment or scarification [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Hot water
soaks or cold stratification may reduce seedcoat impermeability and
enhance germination [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  Under laboratory conditions germination
tends to be variable; seeds generally germinate between 6 and 40 days
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Leadplant seed averages 165,000 seeds per pound, with 29
percent pure live seed, 98 percent purity, and 30 percent or better
germination [<a href="#37">37</a>], or about 22,000 usable plants per pound of commercial
seed [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Leadplant is a symbiotic nitrogen-fixing species and should
be innoculated with "sp.", the effectively symbiotic innoculant, to
ensure proper growth [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].

Several restoration studies suggest that leadplant has only fair
seedling vigor.  Although the plants appear to do well in the
greenhouse, they are too small and delicate to survive harsh conditions
in the field during the first year of growth.  However, 1-year-old
plants which were transplanted from a holding bed the following spring
had good survival rates.  Leadplant also showed a remarkable ability to
resprout after apparent mortality due to water loss [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Generally, leadplant grows very slowly compared with other legume
species [<a href="#36">36</a>] and must be protected from grazing [<a href="#34">34</a>].  This slow growth
may be the result of inadequate innoculation with the proper rhizobium
bacteria [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Competition may also contribute to poor seedling
establishment [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Transplanting leadplant from natural prairies can be difficult.  Good
transplant success has been obtained using ball and burlap, turf roll,
and peat pot methods [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Native Americans smoked the dried leaves of leadplant; they also used
leadplant to make tea [<a href="#30">30</a>].  It is used as an ornamental because of its
showy flowers.


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Leadplant decreases in response to grazing [<a href="#16">16</a>] and is rarely found in
overgrazed habitats [<a href="#36">36</a>].  This winter-hardy, drought-tolerant species
is difficult to establish.  Seedlings appear intolerant of competition.
Such competition can, however, be reduced by witholding grazing and
controlling weeds by mowing above the seedling height during
establishment.  Later, to improve production and cover, grazing regimes
should leave high stubble or periodically defer late summer defoliation
until fall dormancy [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Under the practice of annual mowing or
browsing which removes the top-growth each year, leadplant produces two
to five or more stems from the crown each spring [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Grasshoppers, leafhoppers, and small mammals may reduce stands of
leadplant.  Leafspots, rusts, downy mildew, and Cytospora amorphae have
been reported on plants but are not considered serious [<a href="#17">17</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Amorpha canescens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Leadplant is a native, perennial, rhizomotous shrub 1 to 3 feet (0.3-1
m) tall [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  It has erect stems and canescent leaves, topped by
spikelike racemes of purple flowers.  Each raceme contains dozens of
tiny flowers with a single petal wrapped around the stamens and style,
hence its name "Amorpha", a Greek word meaning deformed [<a href="#38">38</a>].  The fruit
is a legume with one or two smooth brown seeds (2.2 mm in length) in a
thin, soft, pubescent pod.

The deep, branched, woody root system extends to a depth of 6.5 to 16.5
feet (2.1-5.3 m), with few laterals in the upper 2 to 3 feet (0.6-0.9 m)
of soil [<a href="#38">38</a>].  This greatly minimizes competition with grasses for water
and nutrients [<a href="#38">38</a>].  The roots of leadplant have nitrogen-fixing nodules
throughout their length [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Leadplant regenerates through both seed and vegetative means [<a href="#29">29</a>].
Documentation of leadplant's ability to sprout is scant.  It is
described as "often rhizomatous" [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Stems can also regenerate from
the root crown after the top is removed, damaged, or killed [<a href="#37">37</a>].
Wright [<a href="#39">39</a>] listed leadplant as one of the prominent sprouters in the
central Great Plains, and Weaver [<a href="#37">37</a>] stated that stems use the stores
of food in the root crown and very deep taproot while sprouting.

Good seed crops are produced at least every 2 years, with some seeds
produced every year.  One or, rarely, two seeds occur in a thin, soft
pod that does not inhibit germination [<a href="#8">8</a>].  In a study on a tallgrass
prairie in Illinois, leadplant seeds were found in the upper 1.2 inches
(2 cm) of soil with 17 percent frequency [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Leadplant occurs in a variety of habitats including dry plains,
hillsides, prairies, open woodlands, shaded ravines, and roadsides.  It
occurs on the mesic portions of mixed-grass prairie in the Northern
Great Plains; on the tallgrass prairie of the central Great Plains,
including the Sandhills in western Nebraska and the Flint Hills of
Kansas; and in the mixed tallgrass-forest of the southern Great Plains
from central Texas and Oklahoma to their eastern edges [<a href="#40">40</a>].  It also
occurs on lower slopes and well-drained lowlands dominated by big
bluestem [<a href="#38">38</a>].

Leadplant is drought tolerant.  It is common where mean annual
precipitation (MAP) is over 15 inches (380 mm), occurs infrequently on
moisture compensation sites with as little as 12 inches (305 mm) MAP,
but is most productive in areas with 18 to over 20 inches (46-51 mm) MAP
[<a href="#36">36</a>].  Leadplant thrives in sandy to silt-textured soils, and is also
tolerant of weakly acid to moderately alkaline and weakly saline soils
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  Regional site information follows.

In the Cross Timbers regions, precipitation varies from 27 to 45 inches
(69-114 cm), and elevation from 500 to 1,000 feet (150-300 m).  Sandy
soils to deep sandy loam and silt loam soils are common [<a href="#40">40</a>].

In the central Great Plains tallgrass prairie, elevation varies from
1,000 to 2,000 feet (305-610 m), and annual precipitation averages from
23 inches (580 mm) in eastern Nebraska to 35 inches (890 mm) along the
eastern edge of the prairie; in the Sandhills, precipitation is as low
as 18 inches (460 mm).  Soils are of medium texture except in the
Sandhills of Nebraska and the Flint Hills of Kansas.

The more mesic portions of the northern Great Plains mixed-grass prairie
average 13 to 18 inches (330-460 mm) annual precipitation.  Elevation
ranges from 1,300 to 4,000 feet (400-1,300 m).  Soil textures are
primarily sand, sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, and loam, mostly
developed from glacial till.


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Climax Species

Leadplant is a climax species [<a href="#3">3</a>] present in several climax grassland
plant communities as well as in ponderosa pine and bur oak habitat types
[<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Weaver and Fitzpatrick [<a href="#38">38</a>] called this species the most
conspicuous subdominant of upland tallgrass prairie.  Leadplant is
shade tolerant and grows in partially shaded ravines and open woodlands
[<a href="#36">36</a>].  Seedlings are very tolerant of shade but not of competition from
grasses.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Vegetative growth begins in early May when buds open on the woody stems.
Plants begin to flower in late June and in July, and flowers persist for
several weeks.  Seeds mature in August to September and are dispersed in
the fall [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  In late July and August, especially if water is
lacking, plants may drop their lower leaves, but the remainder of the
leaves stay green until the first frost [<a href="#38">38</a>].  The plant usually dies
back almost to the ground nearly every winter [<a href="#8">8</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Amorpha canescens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Leadplant is generally favored by fire and is usually present in
increased numbers the spring following a fire [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  How
leadplant regenerates after fire, however, has not been documented.
Vegetative reproduction is highly probable because of its rhizomatous
nature [<a href="#16">16</a>] and because it sprouts prominently, mostly from the root
crown or root, after mowing [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  Leadplant also reproduces through
seed [<a href="#30">30</a>], and there is evidence that this species is present in the
seedbank [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Seeds are dispersed by animals [<a href="#8">8</a>], so off-site
colonization is also possible.  Seedling establishment may occur where
fire reduces the accumulation of litter [<a href="#22">22</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Amorpha canescens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Leadplant is generally resistant to fire mortality.  The aerial portion
of the plant is most likely damaged or killed by fire, but underground
parts survive.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Available fire effects information indicates that leadplant is well
adapted to disturbance by fire.  Postfire recovery is generally rapid.
Height, crown width, and cover have been shown to increase in response
to fire [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Leadplant most likely recovers following fire via
sprouting from rhizomes, the root crown, or roots.  Some seedling
establishment from seed stored on-site [<a href="#20">20</a>] or transported by animals is
also possible, particularly on sites where fire has removed the litter
and exposed bare mineral soil.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Several studies have compared prefire and postfire levels of leadplant.

A remnant tallgrass prairie in eastern South Dakota dominated by
Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) was burned in April and then again in
May of the following year.  Leadplant (listed as a forb on this site)
increased dramatically following the first fire and then decreased after
the second fire [<a href="#5">5</a>].

In the Black Hills of South Dakota, Gartner and Thompson [<a href="#15">15</a>] found that
although leadplant frequency on their control was higher than on the
burn plot before fire, frequency levels after the fire were nearly
equal:

                 PREFIRE                      POSTFIRE
              control  burn                control  burn
              (% frequency)                (% frequency)

               13.0    6.0                  45      44

Bock and Bock [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>] studied the effects of fire on ponderosa forests in
the southern Black Hills.  Leadplant increased significantly in density,
height, and crown width after spring and fall surface fires.  It also
increased dramatically after an intense crown fire in this type [See
Fire Case Study for details].

Lowland and upland tallgrass prairie sites in the Flint Hills of Kansas
were burned in mid- to late April.  Leadplant cover increased on the
lowland sites but remained unchanged on the upland sites.  The upland
soils were thin and well drained, while the lowland soils were deep,
thick, colluvial and alluvial deposits with better water storage
capabilities than the upland soils [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Site differences may have
contributed to the different responses.


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Late spring fires (aroung May 1) are recommended for increasing
leadplant [<a href="#2">2</a>].

        Class III (> 2-inch diameter twigs):  7.4% moisture content
        Cool ground fire
        Combustion of surface fuels nearly complete
 
The second ares was ignited at 10:30 a.m. on April 14, 1980.  Conditions
at the time of the fire were as follows:

        Air temperature:  57 degrees F (13.9 deg C)
        Relative humidity:  32%
        Wind speed:  4.8 mph (8 km/hr)
        Soil moisture:  27.8%

        Class III (twigs> 2 inch diameter):  36.0% moisture content
        Cool ground fire
        Combustion of surface fuels nearly complete


<b>FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES : </b>
Leadplant increased significantly in density as measured in May-June
following the burns.  Increased height and increased crown diameter were
also measured.

Percent cover for combined experimental (burned) plots and control plots
was as follows:

<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS : </b>
Results indicate that cool prescribed fires can be used in the Black
Hills as a management tool for reducing fuels in ponderosa pine forests
and temporarily improving them as wildlife habitat.  However, with the
exeception of Saskatoon serviceberry and leadplant, such fires will not
encourage shrub growth.
