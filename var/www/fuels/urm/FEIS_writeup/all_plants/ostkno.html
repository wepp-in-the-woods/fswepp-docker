<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ostrya knowltonii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Knowlton hophornbeam is found in southeastern Utah, northern Arizona,
southeastern New Mexico (in the Guadalupe and Sacramento mountains in
Eddy County), and northern Trans-Pecos Texas.  It is not a common tree
and its occurrence is sporadic even in these areas [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Knowlton hophornbeam is commonly found in oak (Quercus spp.) woodlands,
pinyon (Pinus spp.)-juniper (Juniperus spp.) woodlands, and lower
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest zones [<a href="#9">9</a>].  In Texas it is a
component of the gray oak (Quercus grisea)-true pinyon (Pinus
edulis)-alligator juniper (Juniperus deppeana) association at 5,000 to
7,000 feet (1,524-2,133 m) and the ponderosa pine-Douglas fir
(Pseudotsuga menziesii) association at 6,000 to 7,500 feet (1,828-2,286
m).  In Texas it is also associated with Texas madrone (Arbutus
texana), southwestern white pine (Pinus strobiformis), chinkapin oak (Q.
muehlenbergii), and bigtooth maple (Acer grandidentatum) [<a href="#18">18</a>].  In
deciduous canyon woodlands of Guadalupe Mountains National Park, Texas,
Knowlton hophornbeam will increasingly replace wavyleaf oak (Q.
undulata), alligator juniper, Riogrande cottonwood (Populus deltoides
ssp. wislizenii) and little walnut (Juglans microcarpa) as the moisture
gradient goes from xeric to mesic.  Knowlton hophornbeam is replaced by
bigtooth maple and chinkapin oak, especially on upper terraces, around
springs and in canyonheads [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Knowlton hophornbeam wood is thin, fine grained, hard, tough, and
durable [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  It is occasionally used for fuel or posts [<a href="#23">23</a>].
Because of its density the wood of hophornbeam (Ostrya spp.) can be used
for tool handles, mallet heads, and other hard wooden objects [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Several species of breeding birds use canyonland habitats where Knowlton
hophornbeam occurs [<a href="#12">12</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ostrya knowltonii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Knowlton hophornbeam is a native, deciduous, small tree 10 to 40 feet
(3-12 m) tall with a 6- to 18-inch (15.2-45.7 cm) trunk diameter [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].
The trunk is usually short and divided into a number of slender, crooked
branches to form a round-topped crown [<a href="#23">23</a>].  The leaves are 1 to 2.5
inches (2.5-6.3 cm) long and short-pointed or rounded at the apex
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  The twigs are slender, tomentose at first to glabrous and
lustrous later [l9,23].  The bark is 0.125 inch (0.31 cm) thick,
shallowly furrowed and breaking into loose, small scales 1 to 2 inches
(2.5-5 cm) long [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Male and female flowers are in catkins [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  The staminate catkins
form singly or in groups of two to three at the tips of the previous
year's branches.  They are slender, cylindrical, pendulous and 0.5 to
1.25 inch (1.3-3.2 cm) long [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  The pistillate catkins are about
0.25 inch (0.6 cm) long, generally with two flowers in the axil of each
bract [<a href="#23">23</a>].  The fruit is a compressed ovoid nutlet [<a href="#4">4</a>].  The nutlet is
about 0.25 inch (0.6 cm) long, solitary, and sessile [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Knowlton hophornbeam reproduces by seed.  The flowers are wind
pollinated and the fruit is wind dispersed [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Germination is epigeal
[<a href="#4">4</a>].  Unless seeds are sown soon after maturity or are stratified, they
will not germinate until the second year [<a href="#23">23</a>].  No specific information
was available on germination rates or viability of Knowlton hophornbeam
seeds; however, information is available on eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya
virginiana) [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Eastern hophornbeam seeds usually germinate in the
spring the year after they are shed.  Germination capacity of eastern
hophornbeam seed is 27 to 65 percent [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Eastern hophornbeam trees do not
produce seeds abundantly until they are about 25 years old [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Knowlton hophornbeam can be regenerated by grafting [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Other species
of hophornbeam will sprout from the stump if cut or burned; however, no
specific information was available regarding the ability of Knowlton
hophornbeam to do so [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Knowlton hophornbeam is commonly found on sunny, dry, well-drained sites
in mountains and canyons and at the bases of monoliths in sandstone
areas [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Knowlton hophornbeam commonly occurs between 4,200
and 7,000 feet (1,280-2,133 m) in elevation [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Specific information regarding Knowlton hophornbeam's successional
status was not available in the literature.  Eastern hophornbeam
typically occurs in late seral to climax forests.  It is shade tolerant
and will reproduce well under full shade [<a href="#11">11</a>].  How closely this applies
to Knowlton hophornbeam is unknown.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Knowlton hophornbeam flowers are produced from March through May before
or with the leaves [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  The fruit of hophornbeam species matures
and is dispersed during the same season as pollination.  In most
hophornbeam species, the staminate catkins are produced the growing
season before anthesis and are exposed during the winter.  The
pistillate catkins develop in the spring with the new shoots, with
anthesis occurring as the leaves are forming [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Specific information is not available regarding the fire ecology and
adaptations of Knowlton hophornbeam.  Knowlton hophornbeam may sprout
after top-kill by fire, as do other species of hophornbeam [<a href="#11">11</a>].
Knowlton hophornbeam probably also colonizes burned sites via
wind-dispersed seeds.  Pinyon-juniper communities where Knowlton
hophornbeam commonly occurs have historically burned every 10 to 30
years.  Where livestock grazing has reduced grass cover and accelerated
erosion, fire frequency has decreased [<a href="#25">25</a>].
