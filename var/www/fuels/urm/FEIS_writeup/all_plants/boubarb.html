<b>ABBREVIATION : </b>
BOUBARB
BOUBAR

<b>SYNONYMS : </b>
   Bouteloua barbata


<b>SCS PLANT CODE : </b>
   BOBA2


<b>COMMON NAMES : </b>
   sixweeks grama
   six-weeks grama
   six weeks grama


<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
Numerous floras list sixweeks grama as a distinct species, Bouteloua
barbata Lag. [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  However, a taxonomic revision of the genus
Bouteloua by Gould [<a href="#9">9</a>] treats sixweeks grama as a variety of Bouteloua
barbata.  Under Gould's treatment, the previously distinct species
Bouteloua barbata Lag., B. rothrockii Vasey, and B. sonorae Griffiths
are considered to be three varieties of a single species.  Gould's
treatment is presented below:

  Bouteloua barbata Lag. Varied. Ci.

    var. barbata (sixweeks grama)

    var. sonorae (Griffiths) Gould, comb. Nov. (Sonoran grama)

    var. rothrockii (Vasey) Gould, comb. Nov. (Rothrock grama) 

This paper follows Gould's taxonomic treatment.  Discussion is limited
to sixweeks grama.  

It is interesting to note that sixweeks grama is a short-lived annual,
while the other two varieties are perennial.

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Bouteloua barbata var. barbata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Sixweeks grama is poor livestock forage.  Plants are small and produce
little forage, are green for only a short time, are nutritionally
deficient after maturity, and the roots often pull up when grazed
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Its abundance and, therefore, availability to livestock is
irregular from year to year.

The seeds of grama grasses (Bouteloua spp.) are eaten by numerous
species of song birds and small mammals [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Rabbits and wild
ungulates eat grama grasses [<a href="#19">19</a>].  The banner-tailed kangaroo rat,
Merriam's kangaroo rat, and white-throated woodrat store sixweeks grama
seeds in their dens [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Sixweeks grama is of low palatability to livestock.


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Sixweeks grama is fairly nutritious when green [<a href="#26">26</a>], but its nutritional
value drops rapidly after maturity, and plants become "practically
worthless" [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Data from a winter nutritional analysis of sixweeks
grama are presented below [<a href="#22">22</a>]:

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Because of its small stature, sixweeks grama presumably provides cover
for only small wildlife species.


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Sixweeks grama is highly resistant to grazing and is classified as an
invader [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Rangelands with an abundance of annual grasses, including
sixweeks grama, are only productive for a couple of months following
summer rains, and can be heavily stocked at this time before the grasses
deteriorate [<a href="#5">5</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Bouteloua barbata var. barbata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sixweeks grama is a small, native, warm-season, annual bunchgrass which
grows up to about 1 foot (0.3 m) in height [<a href="#26">26</a>].  The slender, hollow,
tufted culms are usually prostrate but sometimes somewhat erect [<a href="#3">3</a>].
Plants are generally light green when growing, but cure to a straw color
[<a href="#11">11</a>].  Leaves are 0.4 to 2.4 inch (1-6 cm) long and 0.04 to 0.06 inch
(1-1.5 mm) wide and occur sparingly along the culms [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  The
inflorescence consists of three to seven persistent, comblike spikes per
culm.  The spikes are smaller than those of perennial gramas.  Each is
0.4 to 0.8 inch (1-2 cm) long [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

Robust, erect sixweeks grama plants are sometimes mistaken for Rothrock
grama, a closely related short-lived perennial.  In general, sixweeks
grama has shorter awns and the stems are more branched [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Several
floras allow proper identification [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Therophyte
   Burned or Clipped State:  Therophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sixweeks grama is a summer annual.  Seeds stored in the soil germinate
after summer rains; plants grow quickly and set seed in the fall before
they die.  In Joshua Tree National Monument at elevations below 1,000
feet (304 m), sixweeks grama grew and produced seeds within 4 weeks of
germination, but above 1,000 feet (304 m) plants took 6 weeks to
complete their life cycle [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Germination:  For germination to occur under natural conditions, two
requirements must be met:  (1) a single large rainfall of 0.6 to 1 inch
(1.5-2.5 cm) [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>] and (2) warm daytime and nighttime soil
temperatures, which normally occur only during the summer or fall
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Generally a heavy rainfall which saturates the soil
surrounding sixweeks grama seeds is needed for germination.  However,
following light rains, seeds sometimes germinate along washes or in
depressions [<a href="#28">28</a>].  In laboratory experiments, sixweeks grama exhibited
good germination under a temperature regime of warm days (80 degrees F
[27 C] for 8 hours) and warm nights (78 degrees F [26 C] for 16 hours)
but poor germination under a temperature regime of warm days (80 degrees
F [27 C]) and cool nights (55 degrees F [13 C]) [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Another study
showed that large numbers of sixweeks grama seeds germinated when
daytime soil temperatures were 86 degrees F (30 C), small to moderate
numbers germinated when daytime soil temperatures were between 62 and 72
degrees F (17 and 23 C), and no seeds germinated when daytime soil
temperatures were 50 degrees F (10 C) [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Seed dormancy:  Information concerning the length of time seeds will
remain viable is lacking.  However, considering that numerous authors
have observed that germination of sixweeks grama occurs only during
infrequent years at particular locations [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>], seeds must remain
viable for a number of years.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sixweeks grama occupies dry to moist sites [<a href="#27">27</a>].  In desert areas, it is
found on open, rocky or sandy slopes, gravelly flats, bajadas, and
disturbed areas with bare soil [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  It also occupies washes and
intermittent water courses.  Sixweeks grama is most often found in
desert shrub, semidesert grassland and pinyon-juniper vegetation types
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Its density is extremely variable from year to year because
of its dependence on summertime precipitation for germination.  On the
Jornada Expermintal Range in New Mexico, sixweeks grama is found in
grasslands dominated by black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda), tobosa grass
(Hilaria mutica), and burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolius) [<a href="#6">6</a>].  In
desert areas it is often associated with other summer annuals which
germinate at the same time.  Common associates in the Mojave Desert
include prickly pears (Opuntia spp.) and numerous summer annuals such as
needle grama (Bouteloua aristidoides), cinchweed fetidmarigold (Pectis
papposa), pigweed (Amaranthus fimbriatus), euphorbia (Euphorbia
micromera), and spiderling (Boerhaavia spicata) [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].

The elevational range for sixweeks grama in several western states is
presented below:

from 2,800 to 6,000 feet (850-1,820 m)       UT                [<a href="#27">27</a>]


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Sixweeks grama is an early seral species.  It often occupies disturbed
areas with much bare ground or areas where other vegetation is scarce
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].  


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Sixweeks grama grows only during the summer or fall.  Following rains of
sufficient quantity to induce germination, plants grow rapidly, set seed
within about 6 weeks, and then die [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  The phenological
development of sixweeks grama in southern New Mexico is presented below
[<a href="#17">17</a>]:

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Bouteloua barbata var. barbata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Sixweeks grama often occupies desert sites where vegetation is too
scarce to carry fire [<a href="#12">12</a>].  However, in some years rainfall is
sufficient in deserts to produce an abundance of summer annuals which
can easily carry fire.  Sixweeks grama also occurs in semidesert
grasslands dominated by black grama, tobosa grass, or other perennial
grasses of the Southwest.  These grasslands readily carry fire.

Sixweeks grama seeds appear to be long-lived, and large numbers may be
stored in the soil [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  The relatively low temperatures produced by
grassland fires probably do not harm sixweeks grama seeds [<a href="#16">16</a>].
Following fire, surviving seeds remain dormant until germination
requirements are met.

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>

<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Because seeds survive burning, fire has little effect on sixweeks grama.
When favorable conditions for germination occur (warm temperatures and
moist soil), surviving seeds germinate.  Thus precipitation during the
summer following burning largely determines the response of summer
annuals in the Southwest [<a href="#30">30</a>].
