<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The scientific name of Stansbury cliffrose is Purshia mexicana (D. Don)
Welsh. var. stansburiana (Torr.) Welsh [<a href="#97">97</a>].  Mexican cliffrose, P.
mexicana var. mexicana, occurs primarily in Mexico and is discussed very
little in this report.

Stansbury cliffrose hybridizes with antelope bitterbrush (P.
tridentata) [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>], desert bitterbrush (P. glandulosa) [8,42,62),
and rarely with Apache plume (Fallugia paradora) [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Hybrid swarms of
P. mexicana var. stansburiana X P. tridentata are common in Utah
[<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>], and hybrid swarms of P. mexicana var. stansburiana X P.
glandulosa are common in Utah, Nevada, and southern California [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>].

</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Stansbury cliffrose is an important browse species for mule deer
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>], elk [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>], pronghorn [<a href="#80">80</a>], desert bighorn sheep
[<a href="#73">73</a>], livestock [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>], game birds, and songbirds [<a href="#63">63</a>].  Wild
ungulates and livestock use it heavily in winter; it is the principle
winter browse species on the Kaibab Plateau [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>].  Livestock may
use it only lightly in spring and summer if deciduous browse species are
available [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>].  Rodents eat Stansbury cliffrose seeds [<a href="#102">102</a>].

Elk and other large ungulates use Stansbury cliffrose for bedding cover
[<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Although somewhat bitter, Stansbury cliffrose is generally palatable to
large ungulates.  Mule deer in Utah browse it preferentially [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].
Using tame animals, White and Welch [<a href="#98">98</a>] found significant (p=0.05) mule
deer preference for Stansbury cliffrose.  It ranked third in preference
out of 10 common Utah browse species.  Apparently there are ecotypic or
site differences in palatability, however.  In another palatability test
using captive mule deer in Utah, Smith [<a href="#78">78</a>] reported that Stansbury
cliffrose ranked only fifteenth in preference out of 32 browse species.
Blauer and others [<a href="#8">8</a>] noted that Stansbury cliffrose was unpalatable in
southern Arizona.

The palatability of Stansbury cliffrose has been rated as follows
[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>]:

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
In-vitro digestibility of Stansbury cliffrose for mule deer on New
Mexico pinyon-juniper winter range was 37.6 percent [<a href="#88">88</a>].  Average
percent composition of Stansbury cliffrose in Utah was as follows [<a href="#79">79</a>]:

protein          8.4
N-free extract  52.6
crude fiber     23.0
ether extract   10.8


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The degree to which Stansbury cliffrose provides cover for wildlife
species in Utah has been rated as follows [<a href="#24">24</a>]:

Pronghorn             Good 
Elk                   Fair
Mule deer             Good
Small mammals         Good
Small nongame birds   Good
Upland game birds     Good
Waterfowl             Poor


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Stansbury cliffrose is recommended for wildlife [<a href="#55">55</a>], roadside,
construction, and mine spoils [<a href="#35">35</a>] plantings; and for restoring
pinyon-juniper woodland [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>], mountain brushland, basin big sagebrush
(Artemisia tridentata ssp. tridentata)-grassland [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>], black
sagebrush (A. nova), and black greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus)
communities [<a href="#64">64</a>].  It can be established on disturbed seedbeds by
broadcast seeding, drill seeding, or transplanting.  Fall or winter
seeding is recommended [<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>].  Seeding treatment and planting density
recommendations are available [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>], as are nursery and
transplanting recommendations for seedlings [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Case examples:  On degraded pinyon-juniper and basin big sagebrush range
in central Utah, Stansbury cliffrose production on plots seeded with
Stansbury cliffrose and other species was 1.4 pounds per acre vs. 0.4
pound per acre on unseeded plots [<a href="#18">18</a>].  

Near Manti, Utah, former pinyon-juniper woodland that had converted to a
dense cheatgrass stand was scalped, and scalps were seeded with
Stansbury cliffrose.  Stansbury cliffrose survivorship was substantially
improved with wider scalps.  Survivorship according to scalp width was
[<a href="#29">29</a>]:

                                     Scalp Width
                ___________________________________________________________
                4 in (10 cm)   8 in (20 cm)   16 in (41 cm)   24 in (61 cm)
# of cliffrose    
  surviving          5              13              19              59

Stansbury cliffrose production after 5 years ranged from 3,188 to 15,659
grams per 100 linear feet, depending upon scalp width.  Average number
of plants per 100 linear feet ranged from 25 to 150 [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Stansbury cliffrose germination/survivorship in a drill-seeded mixture
in silverscale saltbush (Atriplex argentea)-grassland in northwestern
Colorado was "relatively poor" [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Triterpenoids extracted from Stansbury cliffrose have been shown to have
inhibitory effects on HIV and Epstein-Barr virus [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  

Native Americans used the inner bark for making clothing and ropes, and
the branches for making arrows [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Hopi used Stansbury cliffrose as
an emetic and a wash for wounds.

Stansbury cliffrose is used in ornamental landscaping [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Stansbury cliffrose is moderately browse tolerant [<a href="#65">65</a>].  Plant form
tends to be more branched with moderate browsing than without browsing
[<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Older Stansbury cliffrose plants that grow out of reach of
browsing animals can be a wildlife and livestock management problem [<a href="#39">39</a>].
Pruning out-of-reach branches can increase plant branching and
accessibilty to browsers [<a href="#10">10</a>].  In a 3-year study of Stansbury cliffrose
response to mule deer browsing on the Kaibab Plateau, Julander [<a href="#39">39</a>]
found that plants declined with over 80 percent utilization.  Seventy to
eighty percent utilization maintained plants but did not permit growth
or seed production; 70 to 75 percent utilization allowed some growth and
seed production; and plants utilized 45 to 65 percent showed good growth
and seed production.  Techniques to estimate percentage utilization of
Stansbury cliffrose are presented and evaluated in Jensen and Urness [<a href="#38">38</a>].

Stansbury cliffrose sometimes aids in fixing nitrogen [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].
Stansbury cliffrose is easily inoculated with nitrogen-fixing bacteria
in the laboratory, but root infection by nitrogen-fixing bacteria does
not always occur naturally [<a href="#71">71</a>].  Nelson [<a href="#60">60</a>] found that in the field,
the number of nodule clusters on roots differed from plant to plant,
site to site, and year to year.

Poor Stansbury cliffrose seedling establishment in the Great Basin,
especially central and northern Utah where Stansbury cliffrose is at the
edge of its range, has been noted since the late 1940's.  Factors cited
as possibly contributing to decline include climate change,
overbrowsing, succession, and poor ability of Stansbury cliffrose
seedlings to compete against cheatgrass seedlings for water [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>]

Dozing, chaining, or cutting may kill older Stansbury cliffrose,
especially single-stemmed individuals.  Young, multistemmed individuals
are more likely to sprout after these treatments [<a href="#95">95</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Purshia mexicana var. stansburiana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Stansbury cliffrose is a drought-resistant native shrub or tree.  It
usually grows from 1 to 6 feet (0.3-1.8 m) in height but may reach 25
feet (7.5 m) on favorable sites [<a href="#93">93</a>].  Plants in northern populations
are rarely over 12 feet (3.6 m) tall [<a href="#10">10</a>].  The simple, evergreen leaves
are small and alternate to clustered.  Leaves, flowers, and twigs are
glandular.  Twig and branch bark is shreddy.  The flowers are bisexual;
rarely, some are staminate.  The fruit is an achene with a persisent
style.  At one-half inch to 2 inches (1-3.5 cm), the style is several
times longer than the fruit [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>].

Stansbury cliffrose has a taproot and much-branched, widely spreading
lateral roots.  Where not restricted by bedrock, the taproot grows
moderately deep.  In the Wasatch Mountains of Utah, Cline [<a href="#19">19</a>] excavated
roots of a 30-year-old individual that reached 8.8 feet (2.4 m) below
ground.  Roots may have nodules with nitrogen-fixing bacteria [<a href="#60">60</a>].

This is apparently a moderately long-lived shrub. Brotherson and others
[<a href="#12">12</a>] and Price and Brotherson [<a href="#66">66</a>] reported that the oldest living
Stansbury cliffrose in a population on the Wasatch Range of Utah was 69
years; 40 to 45 years was the modal age class.  Similarly, Cline [<a href="#19">19</a>]
found no individuals older than 69 years on a Wasatch Range site in Utah
County.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Reproduction is by seed and, rarely, sprouting.  Stansbury cliffrose is
self-incompatible [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Plants first produce seed at about age 5 and
produce a good seed crop about every 2 years.  There is often more than
one seed set per season [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>].  Heavily browsed plants usually do not
produce seed except on branches above browseline [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Seed readily
disperses when wind catches the long, plumose style.  Animals also
disperse seed [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  Seed requires overwinter stratification (or 1-2
months cold stratification in the laboratory) and germinates in spring
[<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>].  Rodents cache Stansbury cliffrose seed, and seedling
clusters resulting from germination of uncomsumed seed are common
[Jensen and Stapley in (1),102].  Soil-stored seed remains viable for 5
[<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>] to 16 years [<a href="#75">75</a>].  There is no light requirement for germination
[<a href="#94">94</a>], and seeds germinate under a wide range of temperatures [<a href="#101">101</a>].
Fifteen to 100 percent germination has been reported in the laboratory
depending upon treatment and, probably, seed source [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>].  Field
germination probably rarely exceeds 60 percent even under optimal
conditions [<a href="#101">101</a>].  Germination rates are usually higher in seed produced
early in the season than in later-maturing seed [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>], and seed on
current-year growth may fail to mature [<a href="#39">39</a>].  

Price and Brotherson [<a href="#66">66</a>] found that seedling establishment was highest
in years of below-average precipitation in central Utah.  Still,
mortality from desiccation is high in germinants.  Early growth is
mainly below ground; seedlings have a high root:shoot ratio [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Dense
stands of exotic annual grasses may competitively exclude Stansbury
cliffrose seedlings [<a href="#66">66</a>].

Variable sprouting ability is reported for Stansbury cliffrose, and it
is uncertain whether the variation is due to genetics, degree of damage
to the root crown, or a combination of both.  Stansbury cliffrose is
anecdotally reported as nonsprouting in California [<a href="#73">73</a>], nonsprouting to
weakly sprouting in Arizona and New Mexico [<a href="#74">74</a>], and sprouting in
western Nevada [Klebenow and Bruner in (61)].  Multistemmed individuals
have a greater tendancy to sprout than single-stemmed individuals [<a href="#95">95</a>].
McCulloch [<a href="#53">53</a>] reported that on the Kaibab Plateau, plants bulldozed to
the root crown did not sprout, while those sustaining only top-crown
damage sprouted from the root crown.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
True to its name, Stansbury cliffrose occurs on cliffs and other
exposed, dry sites such as mesas and foothills [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  Aspect is
usually south or west [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].  Limestone is the most common substrate
parent material, but Stansbury cliffrose also occurs on other
sedimentary substrates and also on igenous formations [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].
Soils are acidic to alkaline [<a href="#10">10</a>], well-drained [<a href="#51">51</a>], and have a coarse
sandy, gravelly, or rocky texture [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>].  Stansbury cliffrose can
survive on sites receiving less than 12 inches (305 mm) of annual
precipitation [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Elevational range by state is:

            feet           meters          state
        3,000-8,000       914-2,438      AZ [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>]
        3,630-7,500     1,100-2,500      CA [<a href="#33">33</a>]
        2,525-8,235       975-2,745      UT [<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>]


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Stansbury cliffrose seedlings colonize open, disturbed sites [<a href="#61">61</a>].  As
adults, plants are "fairly" shade tolerant [<a href="#95">95</a>].  Stansbury cliffrose
occurs in understories of open coniferous forests [14,31,48,] but is
probably shaded out with canopy closure.  In desert shrublands,
Stansbury cliffrose may persist for 60 years or more, although
individuals over 69 years of age have not been found [<a href="#66">66</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Flowers first appear from early May to late June, with blooming
continuing until first autumn frost.  Seeds from the earliest flowers
mature and disperse from mid-July to August in Utah, with later-produced
seed ripening and dispersing through October [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Arizona and
California plants flower from April to September [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>], with seed

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
The sagebrush, salt desert, and creosotebush (Larrea tridentata)
shrublands in which Stansbury cliffrose occurs have historically had low
fuel loads and long periods between fires.  Prior to invasion of exotic
cheatgrass, big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) communities burned at
30- to 70-year intervals [<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].  Cheatgrass invasion in big sagebrush
communities of northern Nevada and Utah has increased fuel loads and
shortened fire-free periods to an average of 5.5 years [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Effects of
this fire interval change on Stansbury cliffrose are not documented but
have probably been detrimental.

Intervals between fire in the other two desert shrubland types where
Stansbury cliffrose occurs are very long and have not been quantified.
Vegetation is usually sparse.  Both saltbush (Atriplex spp.) and
creosotebush communities have been characterized as "essentially
nonflammable" [<a href="#37">37</a>] due to the open, infrequent distribution of dominant
shrubs and paucity of herbaceous associates [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Rare fires may
provide bare, disturbed seedbeds where Stansbury cliffrose can establish
from seed transported on-site.

Fire plays a more visible role in the other plant communities in which
Stansbury cliffrose occurs.  Open, dry-site ponderosa and Arizona pine
types within Stansbury cliffrose's distribution historically had periods
between low-severity surface fires averaging 1 to 13 years [<a href="#2">2</a>].
Frequent, low-severity fires probably maintained Stansbury cliffrose as
a low, bushy understory plant.

The mountain shrub and Arizona chaparral types are dominated by
sprouting shrubs and typically experienced fire every 3 to 60 years.
When these communities do not burn within 15 to 20 years, succeeding
fires are severe and likely to consume much of the existing vegetation
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].  Relatively long-return interval (40+ years), intense
fires, which kill a larger proportion of sprouting shrubs than do
shorter-interval fires [<a href="#42">42</a>], may have provided opportunities for
Stansbury cliffrose seedling establishment by reducing competition and
providing a bare, disturbed seedbed.

Fire autecology:  The majority of the literature indicates that
Stansbury cliffrose is usually killed by fire [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].
Some sources cite a variable or weak ability to sprout after fire
[<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].  

Since Stansbury cliffrose is a colonizer [<a href="#61">61</a>], it probably establishes
from wind- and animal-dispersed seed on fire-disturbed seedbeds, but
documentation of postfire seedling establishment is lacking.

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Purshia mexicana var. stansburiana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
There are conflicting reports on fire's effect on Stansbury cliffrose.
One source [<a href="#100">100</a>] classifies Stansbury cliffrose as a strong sprouter
after fire; others [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>] classify it as strictly nonsprouting.  Other
reports conclude that fire effects are variable:  Fire may kill or
severely damaging plants [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].  Western Nevada populations have
been described as "quite sensistive" to burning [<a href="#89">89</a>].  When mortality
occurs, it is most likely in single-stemmed and/or old individuals
[<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].  Late-season fire also increases risk of mortality [<a href="#100">100</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Stansbury cliffrose appears to be a weak sprouter that is generally
killed by severe fire.  Some populations, however, are very sensitive to
fire and the majority of individuals may not sprout after even
low-severity fire [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].  Sprouting ability may be genetically
fixed, with the proportion of individuals able to sprout varying between
populations [<a href="#107">107</a>].

Field managers report that Stansbury cliffrose is usually killed by
prescribed fire [<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>].  Mortality is greatest in large, decadent
plants [<a href="#104">104</a>].  Cool fires promote some resprouting, especially if green
foliage remains.  Spring burning with high fuel moisture and soil
moisture conditions increase the likelihood of sprouting.  Top-killed
Stansbury cliffrose may take 5 years or more to sprout [<a href="#105">105</a>].

Thirteen to fifteen years after a crown fire in pinyon-juniper in Grand
Canyon National Park, Stansbury cliffrose was observed in unburned
areas, but few plants were present in burned areas.  Densitities of
Stansbury cliffrose greater than 2 feet (0.6 m) in height averaged 5
plants per acre (burned) and 44 plants per acre (unburned).  For
Stansbury cliffrose less than 2 feet tall, densities averaged 8 plants
per acre (burned) and 314 per acre (unburned) [<a href="#54">54</a>].

In Death Valley National Monument, Stansbury cliffrose density following
a lightning-ignited fire in creosotebush ranged from five to eight
plants per square meter.  Frequency was 20 percent [<a href="#49">49</a>].

Prescribed fire used before the 1960's to remove blackbrush (Colegyne
ramosissima) from Nevada rangelands generally removed the blackbrush,
which was replaced by Stansbury cliffrose, Nevada ephedra, and several
other desert shrubs [Jensen and others in (5)].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Since Stansbury cliffrose's sprouting ability is apparently variable,
fire probably should not be used on this species unless postfire
sprouting ability of the population under consideration has been
confirmed.  Fire used on sprouting Stansbury cliffrose should be low
severity surface fire since the dormant buds of Stansbury cliffrose root
crowns are apparently killed by severe, and possibly moderate-severity,
fire.  Prescribed fires may burn around Stansbury cliffrose growing on
rocky outcrops [<a href="#106">106</a>].
