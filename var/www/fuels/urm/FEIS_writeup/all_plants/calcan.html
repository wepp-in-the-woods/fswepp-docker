<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Bluejoint reedgrass furnishes a large amount of forage for many big game
species and livestock [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  Occasionally it occupies considerable
areas to the exclusion of other native grasses [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Under such
conditions it yields a large amount of quality hay for livestock [<a href="#26">26</a>].
This grass is important forage for livestock in Alaska and is an
important component in the diet of bison herds in the Slave River
lowland, Northwest Territories, Canada [<a href="#20">20</a>].  It is grazed lightly by
deer but makes up a major part of the diet of elk in the winter [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Bluejoint reedgrass is most palatable when young and succulent. Since it
often grows in wet habitats, use by livestock is often limited until
late in the season when the grass is tough [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].

The relish and degree of use shown by wildlife species for bluejoint
reedgrass in several western states has been rated as follows [<a href="#8">8</a>]:

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Bluejoint reedgrass has been rated as fair in energy value and poor in
protein value [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  In July of 1974, nutrient and mineral composition
of this grass on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula were as follows [<a href="#29">29</a>]:

The degree to which bluejoint reedgrass provides environmental
protection during one or more seasons for wildlife species has been
rated as follows [<a href="#8">8</a>]:

                         MT      ND      UT      WY

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
The rhizomatous nature of bluejoint reedgrass helps provide streambank
stability.  This is particularly important on higher gradient streams
where scouring by seasonal flooding is possible [<a href="#4">4</a>].  This grass is a
vigorous invader of oil spill sites in the Northwest Territories,
Canada, and recovers rapidly after spills [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Bluejoint reedgrass was
evaluated for revegetation in tundra and northern boreal forest sites.
It established slowly, but by the end of the growing season, cover and
biomass production equaled or exceeded those of commercial varieties.
Seed of bluejoint reedgrass has been collected for revegetation trials
in Alberta [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Grazing:  Bluejoint reedgrass is sensitive to overgrazing.  Yields
decreased by 15 to 20 percent when bluejoint reedgrass was cut two to
four times during the growing the season, by 35 to 45 percent when cut
five to six times, and about 70 percent when cut seven times, when
compared to plots cut once at the end of the growing season [<a href="#16">16</a>].
Grazing should be restricted when soils are moist, especially along
streams where bank sloughing can occur [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Livestock use should be
timed according to both the drying of soil surface and the maturation of
the seedheads.  Livestock should be removed when 40 percent or less
utilization of herbaceous forage is obtained [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Insect and disease:  Some bluejoint strains are susceptible to white
top.  This condition is caused by insect or fungal damage of the lower
culms.  Bluejoint, in general, is not susceptible to snow mold [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Site competitor:  Bluejoint reedgrass is a serious competitor of
regeneration of conifer seedlings on disturbed moist sites.  Bluejoint
reedgrass often produces a thick, "mulch" of litter which insulates the
soil surface, causing the soil temperature to decrease.  Cold soils
could partially explain the poor growth of conifer seedlings that often
occurs after planting in bluejoint-reedgrass-dominated sites [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Control:  Bluejoint reedgrass can be controlled with glyphosate applied
after flowering and about the same time as aboveground senescence begins
[<a href="#5">5</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Calamagrostis canadensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bluejoint reedgrass is a sod-forming, native, perennial, cool-season
grass [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  Its blades are numerous and generally obtain a
height of 2 to 4 feet (60-120 cm) [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  In Alaska, this grass has
been known to reach heights of up to 6.5 feet (200 cm) within 6 weeks
[<a href="#16">16</a>].  This grass is long-lived.  Well-developed fields may persist for
as long as 100 years [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Creeping underground rhizomes are extensive
and fiberous roots are shallow [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual Reproduction:  Bluejoint reedgrass flowers are wind pollinated.
Prolific flowering, however, occurs only in wetlands and recently
disturbed sites [<a href="#28">28</a>].  The winged seeds are very lightweight and easily
wind-borne [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Seed yields are low, but seed can remain viable in
the soil for up to 5 years [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Seeds collected near Inuvik,
Northwest Territories, had a germination rate of 90 percent at 68
degrees Fahrenheit (20 deg C).  Seedling vigor was rated as moderate
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].

Vegetative Reproduction:  Bluejoint reedgrass can also reproduce
vegetatively by rhizomes [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  This grass is capable of
producing an extensive network of rhizomes during a single growing
season.  Small sections (two or more internodes) of several rhizomes can
produce shoots and establish new clones [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bluejoint reedgrass occurs in a wide range of habitats from lowland wet
sites, semishaded woodlands, to windswept alpine ridges [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>]. It
extends from sea level in the north and northwest to elevations of over
12,000 feet (3,658 m) near the southern limit of its range in New Mexico
[<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  It prefers moist sites but can survive in a wide range of
moisture regimes [<a href="#16">16</a>].  This grass, however, cannot germinate under
drought conditions, although it is very drought resistant once
established [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Soils:  Bluejoint reedgrass occupies sites with imperfectly to
moderately well-drained soils.  It is found on both peat and mineral
soils, but most often on peat, and is adapted to a wide range of soil
textures.  This grass is tolerant of extremely acidic soils, with pH
values as low as 3.5, and is moderately tolerant of saline soils
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].

Plant associates:  Bluejoint reedgrass is commonly associated with the
following species:  Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis), fireweed
(Epilobium angustifolium), beaked sedge (Carex rostrata), tufted
hairgrass (Deschampsia caespitosa), Geyer willow (Salix geyeriana),
booth willow (Salix boothii), wolf's willow (Salix wolfii), subalpine
fir (Abies lasiocarpa), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and Engelmann
spruce (Picea engelmannii) [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Bluejoint reedgrass is a common constituent in a number of seral and
climax communities.  A combination of sexual and vegetative reproduction
allows this grass to persist throughout the successional continuum [<a href="#4">4</a>].
It is an aggressive ground residual colonizer and initial off-site
colonizer in early seral communities.  Once established, a very dense
stand of bluejoint reedgrass may persist almost indefinitely, severely
limiting the invasion of woody species [<a href="#5">5</a>].  In some mid-seral to climax
wetland forest communities and forest communities having high water
tables, bluejoint reedgrass occurs as a dominant or codominant
understory species [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
In general, bluejoint reedgrass leaf and culm production occurs from
early May to mid-June followed by significant vegetative growth of shoot
biomass [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  By mid-June flowering heads begin to emerge and by late
June to early July flowering begins [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Flowering peaks from late
June to mid-July.  Aboveground senescence begins mid to late August
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].

Fire will kill aboveground vegetation of bluejoint reedgrass [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].
Severe fires will also kill belowground rhizomes [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
Under droughty conditions dead shoots of bluejoint reedgrass exhibit low
moisture content [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  In small experimental fires in Inuvik,
Northwest Territories, dead litter sustained combustion, but the fire
merely burned around the live material [<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Following low-severity fires, bluejoint reedgrass will typically sprout
from on-site surviving rhizomes.  Buried or wind-dispersed seeds may be
the primary source of plant establishment on severly burned sites
[<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Light surface burning tends to increase the abundance of bluejoint
reedgrass [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Following a low-severity burn in a trembling aspen
(Populus tremuloides) woodland in southern Ontario, this species'
frequency was twice as high on burned areas.  The abundance of bluejoint
reedgrass 4 months after the fires in 1973 was four times greater than
in the control areas and two times greater than in areas burned in 1972
[<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
When grazing pressure is light, litter accumulates rapidly [<a href="#37">37</a>].
Low-intensity fires can be used to remove this litter and improve forage
quality [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Because of wet conditions in the spring and summer,
successful burning of these communities is limited to the drier fall
period [<a href="#4">4</a>].
