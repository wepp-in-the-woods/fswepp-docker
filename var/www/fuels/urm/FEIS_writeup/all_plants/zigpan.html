<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>

at all times of the year [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>

<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Rangeland:  Foothill deathcamas is one of the first plants to produce
growth in spring.  Livestock poisonings usually occur when animals are
put on the range in early spring before more palatable plant species are
available [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Sheep are most commonly poisoned:  336 grams of
foothill deathcamas (dry weight) was lethal to experimentally fed ewes
(weight of the ewes averaged 51 kilograms) [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Foothill deathcamas is
an increaser under heavy grazing; an abundance of foothill deathcamas
indicates a need for rangeland improvement practices [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Control:  Foothill deathcamas can be controlled by 2 successive years of
spraying with 2,4-D before flowering, when plants are in the three-leaf
stage [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].

Other:  Humans are occasionally poisoned after consuming foothill
deathcamas bulbs.  The bulbs are sometimes mistaken for edible bulbs of
wild onion (Allium spp.), hyacinth (Brodiaea spp.), or camas (Camassia
spp.) [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Zigadenus paniculatus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Foothill deathcamas is a native, cool-season, perennial forb.  Its
peduncle is from 8 to 21 inches (20-60 cm) long; acaulescent leaves are
from 12 to 20 inches (30-50 cm) long [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  The roots are fibrous,
growing from the base of a "deep-set" underground bulb [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  The
inflorescense is a raceme of polygamous flowers.  The fruit is a capsule
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Foothill deathcamas reproduces from seed, with pollination effected by
syrphid flies and solitary bees [<a href="#16">16</a>].  It reproduces vegetatively by
bulb offsets [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Foothill deathcamas grows in dry, loamy to gravelly soils.  It is found
at 4,000 to 7,500 feet (1,300-2,600 m) in elevation throughout its range
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].

Species named as foothill deathcamas associates in the big sagebrush
(Artemisia tridentata) plant community include cheatgrass (Bromus
tectorum), Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda), and low larkspur
(Delphinium bicolor) [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Associates in the true pinyon-Utah juniper
(Pinus edulis-Juniperus osteosperma) community include Utah serviceberry
(Amelanchier utahensis), banana yucca (Yucca baccata), rubber
rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus nauseosus), Fendler bluegrass (Poa
fendleriana), bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides), and hairy
telegraphplant (Heterotheca villosa) [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Foothill deathcamas begins growth in early spring and flowers from May
to June [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Zigadenus paniculatus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Information on the fire adaptations of foothill deathcamas is lacking in
the literature.  It probably survives most fires because its bulb and
growing points are located below ground.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Geophyte, growing points deep in soil

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Zigadenus paniculatus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Late spring, summer, or fall fire probably top-kills foothill
deathcamas.  Early spring fire that completely consumes aboveground
portions of the plant may kill foothill deathcamas [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Foothill deathcamas recovery following fire has not been documented in
the literature.  Late spring, summer, or fall fire probably does no
lasting damage to deathcamas.  It has been listed as one the of the
plant species that is undamaged by fire in the big sagebrush plant
community [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Early spring fire, however, is probably harmful to this
cool-season plant.  It has been experimentally demonstrated that
foothill deathcamas cannot produce a new set of leaves following
defoliation, which could occur during early spring fire.  Springtime
fire may kill some plants.  Tepedino [<a href="#17">17</a>] stated that following
defoliation in early spring, foothill deathcamas may perish because
photosynthate reserves are insufficient to support growth the following
spring.  Flowering is also affected by defoliation.  In Cache County,
Utah, 60 percent of plants defoliated prior to the flowering period
produced no flowers, as opposed to only 17 percent of control plants.
Defoliated plants that did bloom produced fewer flowers per raceme than
did intact plants.  Tepedino has hypothesized that flowering may be
delayed for 1 to several years after defoliation.
