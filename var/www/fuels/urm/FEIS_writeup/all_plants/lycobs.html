<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lycopodium obscurum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Ground-pine contains poisonous alkaloids and livestock should be kept
away from sites where it is common [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
There is low evaporation from soils with a good Lycopodium cover, so it
may provide a good microclimate for other seedlings to develop [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Clubmosses can make attractive ground covers, but they do not transplant
well.  Many Lycopodium species have been collected for commercial
purposes and are subsequently becoming rare.  They are best left
undisturbed in the wild [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Rare populations should be located and potential threats, such as
trampling by human visitors, should be determined [<a href="#15">15</a>].  In general, if
temperatures become warmer and the forest becomes drier, this species
would be expected to decrease.  However, in one case, the species
increased shortly after logging [<a href="#20">20</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lycopodium obscurum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Ground-pine is a native, perennial, evergreen clubmoss.  It has long
rhizomes which give rise to scattered aerial stems.  Branches may grow
1 to 8 inches (2-20 cm) long.  Leaves are 2.5 to 5 mm long and up to 1 mm
wide [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Hemicryptophyte
   Burned or Clipped State:  Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Ground-pine reproduces primarily vegetatively by sprouting from
rhizomes.  It also produces spores and a subterranean, mycorrhizal
gametophyte [<a href="#9">9</a>].  The main colonization period is June through September
[<a href="#7">7</a>], but it tends to decrease toward the drier part of the season [<a href="#20">20</a>].
Spores are produced in August [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Ground-pine grows mainly on moist forest floors, often with
maple-basswood (Acer spp.-Tilia spp.) or mixed pine-hardwoods.  It grows
at cool temperatures, will tolerate low nutrients, and can withstand a
wide range of light conditions [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  It grows on well-drained organic
soils, often on sandy loams [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  In Kentucky, the species was
found only in the vicinity of the highest peaks, which were as high as
2,800 feet (854 m) [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Ground-pine can comprise a significant part of the understory.  More
commonly, it accounts for less than one percent ground cover.  It may
grow in small groups or patches [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].

Species commonly associated with ground-pine include blueberry
(Vaccinium spp.), raspberry (Rubus spp.), oakferns (Dryopteris spp.),
bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum), bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), and
glacier lily (Erythronium grandiflorum) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Ground-pine is considered a mid-seral species.  It occurs in forest
stands 10 to 30 years old [<a href="#17">17</a>] and will decline in very old stands [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lycopodium obscurum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Ground-pine regenerates by sprouting from rhizomes [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Rhizomes
present in the litter layer are likely to be damaged by fire.  However,
if underground rhizomes survive, the plant may recover after a burn [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving rhizomes

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lycopodium obscurum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
The aboveground portion of ground-pine is killed by fire.  Rhizomes
present in the litter layer are also killed, but deeper rhizomes will
survive [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Ground-pine sprouts from rhizomes following fire [<a href="#3">3</a>].  In one case, it
was observed in the fifth growing month after a burn, which was actually
about a year later.  The fire was categorized as one of low severity;
soil was moist, but fine fuels were dry enough to burn.  The area was
sprinkled after burning to prevent burning of organic matter in the
rhizome and root zone [<a href="#7">7</a>].  The presence of ground-pine has been
recorded in stands 10 to 30 years after fire [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Since ground-pine declines in very old forest stands, it may be
advisable to maintain stands where it is found at a younger stage.  In
areas where the species is very rare, reestablishment after a fire may
be difficult.
