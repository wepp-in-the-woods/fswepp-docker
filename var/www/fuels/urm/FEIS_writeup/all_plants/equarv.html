<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The accepted scientific name for field horsetail is Equisetum arvense L.
Fernald [<a href="#19">19</a>] listed E. a. var. boreale (Bong.) Ledeb., a northern
variety.  There are a number of named forms that are not accepted by
most authors as true forms; they may be growth variants that depend on
environmental conditions and are not sufficiently distinct to warrant
taxonomic recognition [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].

Field horsetail and water horsetail (E. fluviatale) will hybridize de
novo where they occur together.  The product, E. x litorale Kuhlewein is
sterile, but vegetatively vigorous and persistent [<a href="#23">23</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Field horsetail is abundant in many spruce communities, including white
spruce (Picea glauca), black spruce (P. mariana), blue spruce (P.
pungens), and Engelmann spruce (P. engelmannii).  In Alberta and British
Columbia, other common understory species in the white spruce
communities in which field horsetail is abundant include prickly rose
(Rosa acicularis), honeysuckle (Lonicera involucrata), bunchberry
(Cornus canadensis), twinflower (Linnea borealis), naked miterwort
(Mitella nuda), and mountain fern moss (Hylocomium splendens) [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Field horsetail is a common indicator or herbaceous layer dominant for
mesic, hygric, and subhygric sites [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  It occurs or is an
herbaceous layer dominant in a number of riparian associations, with
overstories of spruce, cottonwood (Populus spp.), willow (Salix spp.),
paper birch (Betula papyrifera), or alder (Alnus spp.) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

Field horsetail occasionally dominates sites lacking a woody overstory;
such sites are usually adjacent to a forest or shrub community [<a href="#27">27</a>].  In
Alberta field horsetail dominates low shores of channels and lakes with
water horsetail, water sedge (Carex aquatilis), and pendent grass
(Artophila fulva) [<a href="#47">47</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Field horsetail is a common food item consumed by grizzly bears [<a href="#37">37</a>].
On average, field horsetail formed 2.4 to 5.2 percent by volume of the
grizzly bear summer diet in Yellowstone National Park and was ranked
10th out of 32 food items in amount of consumption [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Field
horsetail occurs in the wet meadows, marshes and moist cirque basins
most often visited by grizzly bears in spring [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Field horsetail is a
minor to important component in the spring and early summer diet of
black bears [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  It is of low nutritive value [<a href="#49">49</a>].

Field horsetail is not an important range forage for livestock, and
excessive amounts (more than 20 percent) in hay can cause scours,
paralysis, and death in horses [<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Field horsetail is low in palatability to livestock, deer, and elk [<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The nutritive value of the sterile shoots of field horsetail, as
percentage of dry weight, is as follows [<a href="#49">49</a>]:

protein                  15
nitrogen-free extract    40.6

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Native Americans and early settlers used tea made from field horsetail
as a diuretic.  Field horsetail was used as a cough medicine for horses.
Dyes for clothing, lodges, and porcupine quills were made from field
horsetail.  It was used for scouring and polishing objects.  The young
shoots were eaten either cooked or raw [<a href="#40">40</a>].

Silica extracted from field horsetail is utilized for manufacture of
remineralizing and diuretic medicinal products.  Other potential uses of
biogenic silica include industrial applications (abrasives, toothpaste,
protective cloth, optical fibers, thickeners for paint, etc.),
detergents, and cleaners.  Leaf-odor constituents were used widely in th
1970's in perfumes but are little used now.  These constituents can be
used as food flavors and flavor enhancers, and as animal repellants
[<a href="#63">63</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Field horsetail is a weed in more than 25 crops of the world but is
seldom the worst offender.  It is probably toxic to surrounding
vegetation due to high levels of alkaloids [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Field horsetail
increases after soil cultivation with or without the application of
herbicides [<a href="#8">8</a>].  It may be at least partially controlled by some
herbicides [<a href="#51">51</a>].

Field horsetail is sensitive to moisture stress; drought conditions
result in a reduction in the production of new shoots [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Repeated cultivation by hoeing reduces the number of mature shoots per
acre [<a href="#8">8</a>].  It is recommended that agricultural land infested with field
horsetail be deep-plowed each season to prevent deep rhizome
development; however, this will probably not be successful if the
rhizomes have already penetrated below plow-depth [<a href="#33">33</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Equisetum arvense
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Field horsetail is a native, perennial, rhizomatous cryptogam.  The
sporophyte is dimorphic with unbranched, fertile (stroboliferous),
spore-producing stems and branched, sterile stems.  The spores germinate
to produce a distinct gametophytic generation.  The prothallus
(gametophyte) is tiny, from 0.002 to 0.008 inch (0.5-2.0 mm) in height
(occasionally up to 0.016 inch [4 mm] in the center) and irregularly
lobed or branched [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].

The sterile stems are jointed, hollow, usually erect, and bear up to 20
whorls of slender branches [<a href="#9">9</a>].  They are usually from 2 to 24 inches
(5-60 cm) tall, rarely to 40 inches (1 m) tall [<a href="#25">25</a>].  The inconspicuous,
scalelike leaves occur in whorls at the nodes and are connected at their
bases.  The fertile stems are nonchlorophyllous and generally are from 2
to 12 inches (5-30 cm) tall [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  The strobili are from 0.4 to 1.4
inches (1-3.5 cm) long, peduncled, and blunt.  The epidermis of both
types of stems has regularly arranged, silicified projections [<a href="#23">23</a>].

The rhizomes of field horsetail are branched and creeping.  They are
similar to the aerial stems except that they are not hollow [<a href="#9">9</a>].
Storage tubers are produced on the rhizomes [<a href="#19">19</a>].  The rhizomes extend
to a depth of 40 inches (100 cm) or more; 50 percent of the total
rhizome weight is in the top 10 inches (25 cm) of soil, 23 percent in
the next 9.2 inches (23 cm), and the rest deeper [<a href="#65">65</a>].  Successive,
layered horizontal rhizome systems occur at about 12-inch (30 cm)
intervals.  Golub and Wetmore [<a href="#24">24</a>] found five such layers by digging to
a 6.6 foot (2 m) depth, noting that the system extended even deeper.
Root development takes place at the bases of lateral branch buds, both
on rhizomes and erect shoots [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
The main mode of reproduction of field horsetail is asexual; conditions
for the production of gametophytes from spores are limited and
relatively rare [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].

Asexual reproduction:  Field horsetail spreads from extensive rhizomes.
Even short segments of broken rhizomes (1.2 inches [3 cm]) will sprout
[<a href="#8">8</a>].  Overwintering buds develop at the nodes of the rhizomes [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Sexual reproduction:  The spores of field horsetail are equipped with
elaters, which are long appendages that expand and contract with changes
in humidity.  Elaters function to dig the spore into the soil surface
and to tangle spores together, thereby creating a larger propagule and
increasing the probability that prothalli will be close enough to ensure
fertilization.  Elaters may also aid in wind dissemination.  Spores
released by the strobiliferous stems are dispersed by wind or water.
The spores are thin-walled, short-lived, and quickly germinate under
moist conditions [<a href="#31">31</a>].  The spores germinate to form prothalli:  tiny
plants only a few cell layers thick that are usually either male or
female, producing only antheridia or archegonia, respectively.  Swimming
sperm are released by the antheridia and require water for transport to
the egg-containing archegonia.  After fertilization takes place, the
sporophytic generation (the identifiable large plant) develops in situ,
growing out of the prothallus.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Field horsetail is a facultative wetland species [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Field horsetail
occurs in woods, fields, meadows and swamps, and moist soils alongside
streams, rivers, and lakes, and in disturbed areas [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Field
horsetail usually occurs on moist sites but can also be found on dry and
barren sites such as roadsides, borrow pits, and railway embankments
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Under suitably moist climatic conditions, gametophytes occur on
newly deposited mud flats and gravel banks of rivers and lakes [<a href="#14">14</a>].

In the Adirondack Mountains of New York, field horsetail occurs from 210
to 2,100 feet (64-640 m) in elevation [<a href="#42">42</a>].  In Alaska, field horsetail
is widely distributed from sea level to alpine communities.  On alpine
sites it is found on heaths, moist meadows, and rocky slopes [<a href="#56">56</a>].
Field horsetail is found at a wide range of elevations.  Elevational
distributions from selected western states are as follows [<a href="#13">13</a>]:

Utah          4,700 to  8,000 feet (1,400-2,400 m)
Colorado      5,100 to 10,800 feet (1,500-3,290 m)
Wyoming       4,900 to  9,700 feet (1,500-3,000 m)
Montana       2,900 to  4,600 feet (  880-1,400 m)


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Field horsetail is present in both seral and climax communities; its
presence is largely dictated by edaphic conditions rather than shade or
other factors.  Field horsetail is an early colonizer on floodplain
deposits.  These communities are often destroyed by flooding before
beingcan stabilized by willow establishment [<a href="#62">62</a>].  Field horsetail
continues to be present through succession, occurring under more
developed willow-alder communities, as an herbaceous layer dominant with
meadow horsetail (Equisetum pratense) under open balsam poplar (Populus
balsamifera)/thinleaf alder (Alnus tenuifolia) stands, and in the
herbaceous layer of closed balsam poplar/white spruce communities [<a href="#62">62</a>].

Field horsetail is an early colonizer of moist, primary successional
sites created by glacial retreat [<a href="#59">59</a>].  It is among the most common and
abundant sprouter in areas disturbed by debris from drilling activity in
northern Alaska.  In most of these areas, field horsetail sprouted from
rhizomes already present under the debris [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Logging or logging and
burning may either maintain or increase field horsetail cover, depending
on pretreatment levels and forest cover type [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Strobiliferous shoot buds are initiated in July, August and into
September.  Vegetative buds are initiated in October and November.
Strobiliferous buds elongate early in spring (March to May, depending on
latitude), usually before the vegetative stems elongate [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Emergence
is earliest in dry sandy places, later in wet or clay soils [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Spores
are shed in early May in the Adirondack Mountains of New York [<a href="#42">42</a>].  The
strobiliferous shoots die after the spores are shed [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Sterile stems
emerge in May, producing branches after they are 3 to 5 inches (8-12 cm)
in height [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].

Stems are killed by hard frost but may live into winter in areas where
they are protected [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Gametophytes are killed by frost; they do not
live longer than one growing season [<a href="#14">14</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Equisetum arvense
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Field horsetail usually occurs in moist habitats that do not undergo
frequent fire.  For example, in Idaho and Montana, it occurs in Fire
Group 11 stands (as described by Bradley and others), which have a
fire-return interval of 325 to 335 years (plus or minus 50 years).  When
fires do occur, however, they are often severe due to high fuel loads.
Field horsetail is adapted to survive such fires; it has deep rhizomes
that are not killed by even very hot fires [<a href="#52">52</a>].  Field horsetail also
colonizes disturbed areas or new sites by wind-disseminated propagules,
although this is probably rare [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil
   Geophyte, growing points deep in soil
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Equisetum arvense
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Field horsetail is top-killed by most fires.  The rhizomes are
particularly resistant to fire because they are buried deep in the
mineral soil [<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Field horsetail regenerates rapidly after a fire [<a href="#40">40</a>].  The frequency of
occurrence of field horsetail is usually unchanged or increased after
fire.  Gameteophyte establishment requires the presence of moist,
exposed mineral soils (as well as a source of spores) [<a href="#7">7</a>].

In the first summer following a late May, 1983, wildfire in white spruce
stands, a number of herbaceous species established from seed.  These
included Bicknell gernaium (Geranium bicknelli), Corydalis sempervirens,
false dragonhead (Dracocephalum parviflorum), and fireweed.  By 1985,
they were replaced by more persistent species including field horsetail
and bluejoint reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis) [<a href="#61">61</a>].

In newly burned white spruce sites, field horsetail occurred in most
stands within weeks of the fire and gradually increased through postfire
succession.  Field horsetail is dominant in the herbaceous layer by 46
to 150 years after fire and persists into the climax stage (300 or more
years) [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].
