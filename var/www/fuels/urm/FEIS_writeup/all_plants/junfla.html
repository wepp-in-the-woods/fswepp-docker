<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juniperus flaccida
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Drooping juniper occurs in the United States only in Big Bend National
Park, Brewster County, Texas [<a href="#13">13</a>].  The major portion of its range is in
Mexico and extends from Chihuahua and northeastern Sonora south to
Oaxaca and Guatemala [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  It is the most common juniper in Mexico [<a href="#10">10</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
In the United States, drooping juniper is scattered in grassland or
scrub communities. It is also scattered in woodlands with other tree
species including Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Mexican pinyon
(Pinus cembroides), Grave's oak (Quercus gravesii), gray oak (Q.
grisea), and alligator juniper (Juniperus deppeana) [<a href="#19">19</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juniperus flaccida
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Drooping juniper is a native small tree or large shrub.  Height at
maturity usually ranges from 25 to 30 feet (7.6-9.1 m) [<a href="#13">13</a>].  The
national champion is 55 feet (16.7 m) tall with a crown spread of 35
feet (10.6 m) and a circumference of 8.5 feet (2.5 m) [<a href="#10">10</a>].  The most
conspicuous character of drooping juniper is its pendant branchlets.
Young drooping juniper trees usually have a narrow rounded crown.  The
bark is deeply furrowed and shreds into long strips.  The globose,
berrylike cone is dull black and leathery.  The cone takes 2 years to
mature [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Each cone contains from 4 to 12 seeds [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Drooping juniper is usually slow growing and is long lived [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Large seed crops are produced every 2 to 3 years, with light crops
produced in intervening years [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Seeds are disseminated by birds and
mammals.  The widespread distribution of drooping juniper in Mexico is
probably partly due to the number of seeds per cone, which is large when
compared to other junipers [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Drooping juniper occurs on dry, rocky or sandy, igneous soils in
canyons, benches, hillsides, and ridges.  It usually occurs above 5,000
feet (1,524 m) elevation [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Drooping juniper cones mature in September of their second year and are
persistent [<a href="#17">17</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juniperus flaccida
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fire is a common occurrence in the Chisos Mountains in which drooping
juniper occurs.  Dick-Peddie and Alberico [<a href="#2">2</a>] reported that lightning
fires are probably highly localized, and are often confined to single
trees.  Downed woody fuels are usually scarce and continuous fine fuels
consist of grasses and herbs.

Specific information on the fire ecology of drooping juniper is lacking.
Other junipers (Juniperus spp.) are highly vulnerable to fire, and
usually occur in large numbers only in fire refugia.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tree without adventitious-bud root crown

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Specific information on the relationship of fire severity and damage
to drooping juniper is lacking.   Drooping juniper has shreddy bark and
volatile leaf oils which probably render it highly flammable.  It is
probably easily killed by fire.
