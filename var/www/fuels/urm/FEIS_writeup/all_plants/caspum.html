<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name for Allegheny chinkapin is
Castanea pumila (L.) Mill. (Fagaceae) [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  This highly variable
species has a number of infrataxa which have sometimes been given
separate species status [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Johnson [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>] and Tucker
[<a href="#33">33</a>] agree that most, and probably all, chinkapins should be treated as
a single species.  Currently accepted varieties include the following:

Castanea pumila var. pumila
C. pumila var. ashei Sudw. [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>]                  coastal chinkapin
C. pumila var. ozarkensis (Ashe) Tucker [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>]  Ozark chinkapin

Allegheny chinkapin and American chestnut (Castanea dentata) hybridize
to form C. xneglecta Dode [<a href="#16">16</a>].

<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
The range of Allegheny chinkapin extends from New Jersey and
Pennsylvania south to Florida and west to eastern Texas, eastern
Oklahoma, and southern Ohio [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Ozark chinkapin is limited to the
Ozark highlands of Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma, and has been
extirpated from most of Alabama by chestnut blight [<a href="#10">10</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Allegheny chinkapin is locally abundant as a low, clonal shrub on
longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)-scrub oak (Quercus spp.) sand ridges and
hills that are burned frequently, and in open stands of planted pine on
ridges and hills.  It is less frequent in sand pine (P. clausa)-oak
scrub [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Ozark chinkapin is often associated with chinkapin oak
(Quercus muehlenbergii) in white oak (Q. alba)-black oak (Q.
velutina)-northern red oak (Q. rubra) cover types [<a href="#26">26</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Castanea pumila
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Allegheny chinkapin wood is light, hard, close-grained, and durable.  It
is used largely for fenceposts and fuel.  It is not exploited for
commercial timber because of its small stature and scattered occurrence
[<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Allegheny chinkapin nuts are excellent wildlife food and are consumed by
squirrels, chipmunks, opossums, white-tailed deer, bluejays, pileated
woodpeckers [<a href="#31">31</a>], red-headed woodpeckers [<a href="#34">34</a>], and many other birds
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Allegheny chinkapin is usually not a primary wildlife food due
to its scattered occurrence [<a href="#35">35</a>].  It is, however, listed as an
important species in the diet of southeastern fox squirrels (including
five subspecies) [<a href="#17">17</a>].  White-tailed deer browse the foliage of
Allegheny chinkapin [<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
In North Carolina, Allegheny chinkapin had a high utilization rate (81%
browsed) by white-tailed deer, even though it occurred in relatively low
abundance [<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Chestnut (Castanea spp.) meats were reported to contain 2.9 percent
protein (fresh weight), 41 percent N-free extract, and 1.1 percent crude
fiber [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Allegheny chinkapin (cultivar 'golden') has good potential for use in
revegetation of disturbed sites, particularly because of its wildlife
value and adaptability to harsh sites [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].  It is likely that many
planners hesitate to use it because of the threat of chestnut blight
infection.


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Allegheny chinkapin nuts are sweet and palatable, considered better
tasting than those of American chestnut (Castanea dentata), and have
been bartered and sold commercially [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Allegheny chinkapin may be of
value for breeding blight-resistant chestnuts with good-tasting nuts [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Allegheny chinkapin has been variously reported as very susceptible to
chestnut blight [<a href="#34">34</a>], moderately resistant to chestnut blight [<a href="#28">28</a>], and
almost completely resistant to chestnut blight [<a href="#35">35</a>].  The disease has
been blamed for the extirpation of Allegheny chinkapin from most of
Alabama, and as having severely reduced populations in the Ozarks.  It
is considered a threat to Allegheny chinkapin in Texas [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Campbell
and others [<a href="#3">3</a>] placed Allegheny chinkapin on a list of species which are
rare in Appalachian Kentucky, because there are fewer than 10 records of
Allegheny chinkapin for the region.  They speculated that Allegheny
chinkapin has decreased in abundance because of fire suppression and
chestnut blight [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Roedner and others [<a href="#24">24</a>] included Ozark chinkapin
in a checklist of rare plants of the Ozark Plateau, Missouri, and
reported it as endangered due to chestnut blight.  It has been
considered for inclusion in the Federal Register [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Allegheny chinkapin is a host to oak wilt [<a href="#25">25</a>].

In central Louisiana, an all-aged loblolly pine (Pinus taeda)-shortleaf
pine (P. echinata) stand was selectively harvested in 1958 for pines,
and in 1959 and early 1960 for hardwoods.  The stand had not
experienced any fires since the early 1940's.  Allegheny chinkapin was
listed with a group of species whose importance value increased after
overstory removal, from 1960 to 1970 [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Allegheny chinkapin is listed as susceptible to the following
herbicides:  2,4,5-T, bromacil, dicamba, picloram, and silvex.  It may
resprout after herbicide treatment [<a href="#1">1</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Castanea pumila
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Allegheny chinkapin is a native, deciduous, rhizomatous large shrub or
small tree [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Mature heights range from 6 to 65 feet (2-20 m)
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  The bark of trunks is smooth with shallow furrows [<a href="#35">35</a>].
The stems of young shoots are pubescent to densely tomentose.  The
flowers are axillary catkins [<a href="#8">8</a>].  The involucre is a spiny bur 1 to 1.4
inches (2.5-3.5 cm) long, containing a nut which is 0.28 to 0.8 inch
(7-20 mm) long [<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Allegheny chinkapin reproduces readily from seed.  It is monoecious,
self-incompatible, and wind pollinated [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].  Allegheny chinkapin
cultivar 'golden' seedlings may produce nuts as early as the second or
third growing season.  Nut crops are not large until the fourth or fifth
year.  Six-year-old plants produced 1,200 to 1,500 nuts per plant.
Seeds planted in the fall show good germination (> 90%); seeds stored
over the winter tend to dry out and germinate at much reduced rates
(< 50%) [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Allegheny chinkapin sprouts vigorously from the stump after top-kill
[<a href="#28">28</a>].  It spreads from the rhizomes, forming thickets or colonies [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Allgeheny chinkapin occurs in xeric to mesic, thin or open mixed woods
on dry, rocky, sandy, or loamy soils [<a href="#4">4</a>].  It is typically found on
well-drained stream terraces, dry pinelands and sandhills, and disturbed
sites such as railroad rights-of-way, powerline clearings, fence and
hedgerows, pine plantations, and old fields [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Ozark
chinkapin is typically found on dry uplands in deciduous or mixed
woodlands, but also on cliff margins, talus slopes, and rocky ridges.
Allegheny chinkapin grows well on almost all soil textures except heavy
clay soils [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Allegheny chinkapin ranges in elevation from sea level to about 4,455
(1350 m) in the southern Appalachians [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Allegheny chinkapin is not highly shade tolerant, and occurs in open
woods and disturbed areas [<a href="#8">8</a>].  It is not competitive where overstory
trees begin to form a closed canopy; it is easily replaced by more
shade-tolerant species [<a href="#10">10</a>].  In Florida, it is a member of the
mid-successional pine (Pinus spp.)-oak (Quercus spp.)-hickory (Carya
spp.) type.  It is also a member of communities that remain seral
because of disturbances such as fire [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Allegheny chinkapin flowers from April to July, depending on latitude
[<a href="#4">4</a>].  The ripened nuts are available from September through November [<a href="#31">31</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Castanea pumila
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Allegheny chinkapin forms extensive clones where it has been burned over
annually or at short intervals.  It occurs in burned-over longleaf
pine-oak scrub and sand pine-oak scrub, and other disturbed sites [<a href="#8">8</a>].
Fire benefits Allegheny chinkapin by removing or reducing shade-tolerant
competitors and opening the overstory [<a href="#10">10</a>].

The bear oak (Quercus ilicifolia) type is a disturbance maintained type
in which Allegheny chinkapin is listed as an associate.  It is
restricted to poor, dry sites which have been disturbed in the recent
past mainly by heavy cutting, fire, or both.  It is favored by
disturbance at frequent but not necessarily regular intervals [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous shrub, rhizome in soil
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Castanea pumila
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Allegheny chinkapin is probably easily top-killed by most fires.
Allegheny chinkapin was a member of the understory of a cut-over
pine-hardwood stand that was prescribed burned to control hardwoods.
While no specific figures on Allegheny chinkapin mortality were given,
the author stated that two fires top-killed 90 percent of the hardwood
stems under 1 inch (2.54 cm) in diameter, and set back hardwood
succession.  Larger stems (1 to 5 inches in diameter [2.54-12 cm])
experienced much lower mortality: 27 to 36 percent top-kill [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Allegheny chinkapin sprouts vigorously following top-kill by fire [<a href="#12">12</a>].
