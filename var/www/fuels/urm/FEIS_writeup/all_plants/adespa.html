<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of red shank is Adenostoma
sparsifolium Torr. [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Red shank and chamise (A. fasciculatum) are
the only two species in the genus.  These congeners do not naturally
hybridize because their flowering periods do not overlap [<a href="#15">15</a>].  There
are no recognized subspecies, varieties, or forms of red shank.

<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Adenostoma sparsifolium
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Red shank occurs in discrete, disjunct populations in southern
California and Baja California Norte.  It is distributed along the South
Coast and Transverse ranges from south-central San Louis Obispo County
to Los Angeles County, where distribution shifts inland to interior
regions of the Peninsular Ranges and the Sierra San Pedro Matir
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  The southern edge of red shank's distribution is
about 150 miles (240 km) beyond the Alta-Baja California border.  The
total range of the species is approximately 300 miles (480 km) in extent
(latitude 30 deg 30 min N. to latitude 35 deg 30 min N; longitude 115
deg 40 min W. to longitude 120 deg 30 min W.) [<a href="#30">30</a>].  The largest red
shank populations are in the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa mountains and
in interior valleys of Riverside and San Diego counties [<a href="#17">17</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Red shank is a dominant species in chamise, mixed, redshank, and desert
chaparral, coastal sage scrub, and singleleaf pinyon-Utah juniper (Pinus
monophylla-Juniperus osteosperma) woodland [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Red shank chaparral
primarily occurs in the San Jacinto and Santa Monica mountains, where it
often forms open, nearly pure stands [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Because it grows as
tall as 18 feet (5.5 m), it dominates chaparral overstories [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  It
is a common associate in chamise chaparral [<a href="#30">30</a>], and red shank and
chamise codominate on some sites [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Red shank-populated chaparral
merges with desert vegetation on its eastern edges and with coastal sage
scrub and annual grassland on other margins [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Associated overstory species of red shank include Eastwood manzanita
(Arctostaphylos glandulosa), desert ceanothus (Ceanothus greggii),
bigpod ceanothus (C. megacarpus), spiny ceanothus (C. spinosus),
hoaryleaf ceanothus (C. crassifolius), hairy ceanothus (C. oliganthus),
birchleaf mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus betuloides), California
buckwheat (Erigonum fasciculatum), California scrub oak (Quercus
dumosa), laurel sumac (Malosma laurina), and chaparral yucca (Yucca
whipplei) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  Herbaceous associates include slender oat (Avena
barbata), foxtail brome (Bromus rubens), twining brodiaea (Brodiaea
pulchella), showy penstemon (Penstemon spectabilis), and phacelia
(Phacelia brachyloba) [<a href="#31">31</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Small mammals browse red shank sprouts.  Twenty-seven percent of sprouts
tagged following prescribed fire at the University of San Diego's Sky
Oaks Research Station were browsed by chaparral rodents and lagomorphs
during postfire year 1.  The animals browsed 42 percent of tagged
sprouts in postfire year 2 [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Brush rabbit have been observed
browsing red shank sprouts [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Bullock and Sosa [<a href="#6">6</a>] reported that range cattle in the Sierra de Juarez
of Baja California were the primary consumers of red shank sprouts after
a wildfire there.

Following fire, Coast Range western fence lizard use charred red shank
branches as basking sites [<a href="#34">34</a>].

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Red shank aids in stabilizing watersheds.  It is recommended on shallow,
well-drained soils [<a href="#21">21</a>].  A large quantity of fresh seed must be
collected directly from parent plants and germinated immediately,
because seed viability is low and of short duration.  Plants are
established by direct seeding or by planting bareroot shrubs 1 to 3
years of age.  Transplants in the Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden,
California, showed over 47 percent survival after 11 years.  Nine years
after transplanting, they were 13 feet (4 m) tall and had a 10-foot
(3-m) canopy spread [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Seedlings planted in the San Dimas
Experimental Forest in the Santa Monica Mountains showed 100 percent
survival after 4 years, and were 4 to 6 feet (1.2-1.8 m) tall at that
time [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Native Americans used an infusion of red shank bark and leaves to treat
syphilis.  The plant oils were used to relieve skin infections [<a href="#43">43</a>].

Spanish Californians used red shank as a remedy for colds, snakebite,
and tetanus [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Only 2.5 percent of California's chaparral formation is dominated by red
shank.  Total area occupied by red shank communities is 291,700 acres
(116,680 ha) [<a href="#30">30</a>].

The oak (Quercus spp.)-infesting mistletoe Phoradendron villosum ssp.
villosum also parasitizes red shank [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Pinto and Velten [<a href="#37">37</a>] provide
a list of plant bugs (Miridae in the order Hemiptera) associated with
red shank.

Control:  Spring aerosol application of glyphosate top-kills red shank
[<a href="#40">40</a>].  Follow-up spraying is indicated for long-term control of sprouts.
A study of red shank and chamise response to glyphosate showed that a
single application killed chamise's lignotubers but not red shank's
[<a href="#20">20</a>].  Spraying red shank with 2,4-D or 2,4,5-T is ineffective [<a href="#20">20</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Adenostoma sparsifolium
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Red shank is a native arborescent shrub growing from 6 to 18 feet (2-6
m) tall [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  It has a rounded growth form with thick multiple
branches that ascend several feet without foliage before multiple
smaller branches display leaves [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Red shank is classified as a
broad-leaved sclerophyll [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Its leaves are covered with a sticky
resin that may serve to reflect excess radiation [<a href="#39">39</a>].  The bark
exfoliates freely, peeling off in long strips [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Red shank has
a large lignotuber; the lignotuber of one individual in the Santa Monica
Mountains measured 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter.  The root system has
not been well studied but appears to be predominatly lateral with masses
of small roots.  Two plants excavated in the Santa Monica Mountains had
thick, woody, multiple roots rapidly branching into succulent fibrous
roots at 1 to 4 feet (0.3-1.2 m) below the soil surface.  A few roots
were found below 6 feet (1.8 m) [<a href="#15">15</a>].  The inflorescence is an open
panicle; the fruit is an achene [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Red shank may live over 100
years [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Red shank primarily reproduces vegetatively.  The roots and lignotuber
store carbohydrates and other nutrients necessary for sprout development
from adventitious buds of the lignotuber [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Sprouting continues
throughout the life of the plant until senescence, but die-off of young
stems appears to be great.  Growth-ring analysis of red shank in the
Palomar Mountains of San Diego County revealed that most stems were
either less than 5 years of age or greater than 30 years of age, with
few in between [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Sprout viability may be enhanced in the first few
years following top-kill by fire or other means because of lack of
competition from older stems.

Seedling recruitment is rare.  Limited research suggests that this is
due to three factors:  low seed set, low seed viability, and rapid loss
of viability in seed that is sound when fresh.  Microscopic examination
of red shank seed collected over the range of red shank's distribution
showed that much of the seed was unfilled.  Heat treatment and
subsequent sowing of the seed resulted in 0 percent germination [<a href="#15">15</a>].
Red shank's congener chamise produces two physiologically distinct types
of seed.  One type has a hard seedcoat that requires heat scarification
prior to germination.  This seed can remain viable in the seedbank for
decades before fire breaks dormancy.  The other type is nondormant and
loses viability rapidly [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Although red shank has been reported as
producing hardcoated, dormant seed [<a href="#21">21</a>], it probably does not.  One
investigation indicated that red shank produces only one of the two
chamise seed types:  nondormant, short-lived seed.  Seed crops are
usually scant.  Hanes [<a href="#15">15</a>] searched for red shank seedlings in or near
mature red shank stands from San Luis Obispo County to Baja California.
He found only one site, in the Santa Monica Mountains, that supported
seedlings.  This site was not a burn but had been bulldozed the year
prior to seedling recruitment.  The year following establishment, 50
percent of seedlings died during summer drought.  Hanes suggested that
lack of seedling recruitment accounts for red shank's limited
distribution.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Red shank grows on dry, well-drained slopes and mesas at elevations from
1,000 to 7,000 feet (305-2,134 m), with most populations found from
1,500 to 5,000 feet (457-1,524 m) elevation [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  It may occur on any
aspect [<a href="#15">15</a>], but shows definite slope association in some locations.  In
the Santa Monica Mountains, red shank occurs primarily on north-facing
slopes [<a href="#3">3</a>], while in San Diego County, red shank is found on southern
aspects [<a href="#29">29</a>].  All red shank populations except one in the Santa Monica
Mountains occur more than 50 miles (80 km) inland [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Soils supporting red shank are typically shallow.  They may be coarse in
texture [<a href="#15">15</a>], but red shank's shallow, succulent roots are best adapted
to fine-textured soils because of the superior water-retaining capacity
of such soils [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Red shank grows in soils derived from granite or
loosely-cemented Miocene sandstone [<a href="#15">15</a>].  A soil pH of 6.6 was reported
beneath red shank stands in the Los Padres National Forest, Santa
Barbara County [<a href="#9">9</a>], and of 6.3 beneath stands in the Palomar Mountains,
San Diego County.  Where coexisting with chamise, red shank occupies the
more mesic and fertile sites [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Soil moisture, organic matter,
sulfate, and ammonium levels are significantly higher (p<0.01, 0.01,
0.05, and 0.05, respectively) on red shank-occupied soil than on
chamise-occupied soil.  Magnesium levels, percent coarse fraction, and
soil pH are significantly lower (p<0.05 in all cases) on red
shank-occupied soil [<a href="#3">3</a>].

The climate in which red shank grows is Mediterranean, characterized by
wet, mild winters and hot, dry summers [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Santa Ana foehn winds may
occur at any time of year, but are most common in fall [<a href="#32">32</a>].



<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Red shank is a survivor in disturbed communities, establishing from
sprouts following top-kill.  It is usually not replaced by other species
at any stage of chaparral succession.  Red shank is shade intolerant
[<a href="#15">15</a>].

Development of new red shank communities during secondary succession is
rare.  When this does occur, seedlings establish during the first few
postdisturbance years, competing with the herbaceous species which also
establish at this time.  Herbs diminish in number as the community
matures, occupying spaces between red shank [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Red shank stands
attain maximum canopy coverage at about postdisturbance year 25 [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Red shank growth begins in February.  The period of most active growth
is from June to mid-August [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Flowering occurs in late August and
continues through September [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  Stem die-off and abscission
occurs during summer and fall drought.  Plants on the Murphy Ranch in
the Santa Monica Mountains dropped 32.5 percent of randomly tagged stems
during the dry season of a year of normal precipitation [<a href="#15">15</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Adenostoma sparsifolium
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Plant Adaptations:  Red shank sprouts from the lignotuber following
burning of aboveground portions of the plant [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].

Fire Ecology:  Red shank communities generally have less total
aboveground biomass than chamise communities because they are more open,
but have more standing dead fuel per plant and deeper litter.  A
comparison of the two species on the Los Padres National Forest showed
that red shank averaged 44 percent dead biomass versus 38 percent for
chamise [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Red shank litter accumulates rapidly because of continuous
shedding of bark and abscission of stems during summer drought, and
because rate of litter decay is slow in southern California chaparral
[<a href="#17">17</a>].  Red shank litter in mature stands varies from 0.5 to 2.0 inches
(1.3-5.1 cm) in depth [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Litter accumulation on the Los Padres
National Forest is 1.2 tons per acre per year (1.2 t/ha/yr).  Average
aboveground biomass in the 25-year-old red shank community was 12 tons
per acre (30 t/ha) [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Red shank leaves are covered by a sticky resin comprising 10 to 15
percent of their dry weight.  Flammable compounds found in red shank
leaves and exuded resin include flavonoids and phenolic acids.  Some of
the compounds within these chemical families have been extracted from
leaves and resin and identified [<a href="#39">39</a>].

Historical documents show that prior to fire suppression, southern
California chaparral usually burned in summer.  Fires typically crept
down slopes by means of falling brands and coals, and only occasionally
formed the hot runs on steep slopes that are typical of today's fires.
Large fuels often smoldered for months.  This fire behavior resulted in
a mosaic of numerous small burns throughout the landscape.  This pattern
is still evident in northern Baja California, where fire suppression is
not practiced.  In contrast, most fires in southern California now occur
in fall during Santa Ana winds and consume large patches of chaparral.
The size of individual burns increases abruptly north of the
international border.  Fire suppression has reduced the number of fires,
but because of the increase in burn size, total acreage burned is
approximately the same on either side of the border [<a href="#32">32</a>].

Southern California chaparral fires typically crown out, burning all or
most of the aboveground portions of shrubs [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Fire frequency varies
from a few years to as long as 60, although shrubs cannot survive many
short-interval fires [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Chaparral stands become extremely flammable
within 30 to 60 years after fire, depending on topography and stand
productivity [<a href="#38">38</a>].

<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>

<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Red shank sprouts vigorously following fire [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Nearly 100 percent of
red shank on the Sky Oaks Field Station, San Diego County, sprouted
following prescribed winter fire [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Red shank dees not establish well
from seed after fire [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].

A prescribed December fire in Chihuahua Valley, San Diego County,
top-killed red shank, but did little damage to red shank lignotubers and
fine root hairs.  Mean surface soil temperature was 662 degrees
Fahrenheit (350 deg C).  Red shank fine root hair density in the burn
site was higher at postfire year 1 than on an adjacent unburned area.
Sprouts grew an average length of 4.8 inches (12 cm) per month in the
first postfire growing season.  Die-back of fine root hairs occurred
with the onset of summer drought, but sprouts continued to grow through
fall [<a href="#28">28</a>].

A study on red shank community structure in the long-term absence of
fire, conducted in Chiuahua Valley, San Diego County, showed that basal
coverage of red shank was 29.22 square feet per acre (6.79 sq m/ha) and
density was 368 plants per acre (920/ha) at postfire year 66 [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>] .


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Soil under red shank plants in red shank-chamise chaparral showed a
significant decrease in soil organic matter following prescribed
February fire.  Postfire changes in nutrient levels of soil under red
shank were detailed [<a href="#4">4</a>].

The caloric content of red shank leaves and stems is high, but not as
high as chamise.  Caloric content of red shank foliage by fuel diameter
class size is available [<a href="#46">46</a>].

Elements of consideration when developing a fire prescription for
southern California chaparral are available in the literature [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].
