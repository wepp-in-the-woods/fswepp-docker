<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Fendlera rupicola
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Fendlerbush is found from the Sabinal River to the Pecos River in
scattered locations in Texas.  It is common in the higher mountains of
the Trans-Pecos region.  It also occurs in the Davis, Chisos, and
Guadalupe mountains; northward and westward into New Mexico, Colorado,
Utah, and Arizona; and southward into Mexico [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Sickle-leaf
fendlerbush is distributed through New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and
sparsely in Texas in the Trans-Pecos mountains.  Wright fendlerbush is
distributed through west Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and Chihuahua,
Mexico [<a href="#22">22</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Fendlerbush is often found in desert shrub, pinyon-juniper
(Pinus-Juniperus spp.)/mountain shrub and blue grama (Bouteloua
gracilis) communities throughout its range [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].

Fendlerbush is often found associated with oneseed juniper (Juniperus
monosperma), alligator juniper (J. deppeana), true pinyon (Pinus
edulis), wavyleaf oak (Quercus undulata), skunkbush sumac (Rhus
trilobata), mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus breviflorus), and antelope
bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Fendlerbush is browsed by goats, deer, bighorn sheep, and cattle [<a href="#12">12</a>].
In the San Cayetano Mountains, Arizona, fendlerbush made up 11 percent
of the white-tailed deer diet during the hot, dry season (April- June);
this season appears to be the most critical period of the year for deer
herds in the desert southwest [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Fendlerbush palatability is high for goats in New Mexico.  It is closely
grazed by cattle in central Arizona [<a href="#21">21</a>], and is a frequent diet item of
white-tailed deer in the San Cayetano Mountains, Arizona [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>].

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Fendlerbush is grown as an ornamental.  It is suitable for rock gardens
in well-drained, sunny situations, and has been grown as far north as
New England [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fendlerbush decreases in response to grazing [<a href="#25">25</a>].

Fendlerbush has vesicular-arbuscular endomycorrhizal associations
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  These fungi increase fendlerbush growth by increasing
phosphorus absorption [<a href="#26">26</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Fendlera rupicola
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Fendlerbush is a native, deciduous, widely-branched shrub [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].
It grows 3 to 9 feet (1-3 m) high [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  The leaves are thick,
twisted, 0.2 to 1.6 inches (5-40 mm) long and 0.08 to 0.28 inches (2-7
mm) wide [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  The flowers are solitary or two to three together at
the ends of short branches [<a href="#24">24</a>].  The fruit is a four-celled capsule
which remains on the plant all year [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  Fendlerbush bark is
shreddy [<a href="#11">11</a>].  It generally has deep roots [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Fendlerbush can endure
intense heat and considerable drought [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Fendlerbush reproduces by seed [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Commercial production is
accomplished through seed that is stratified at 41 degrees Fahrenheit (5
deg C) for 60 to 90 days [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Fendlerbush can also reproduce via branch
cuttings [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Fendlerbush is commonly found on rocky ledges and steep slopes of cliffs
and canyons at elevations of 3,000 to 7,000 feet (914-2,133 m)
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Fendlerbush thrives on very dry, well-drained, poor soils
that may be rocky and/or alkaline [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Less than 15 inches (38.1 cm)
of annual precipitation have been measured in its natural habitat [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Fendlerbush occurs in nearly all stages of succession.  It is most
common in mid- to late-seral communities.  In Mesa Verde National Park,
fendlerbush maximum cover and frequency was not reached until 80 years
after a fire in a pinyon-juniper community.  In an adjacent 400-year-old
climax pinyon-juniper stand, fendlerbush cover was only 2 percent;
frequency was 8 percent [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Fendlerbush generally flowers from March through June, depending on the
location [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  In the Trans-Pecos, Texas, fendlerbush sometimes
flowers through August [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Fendlerbush fruits mature in July and
August [<a href="#22">22</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Fendlera rupicola

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Little information is available regarding fendlerbush fire ecology and
adaptations.  Erdman [<a href="#7">7</a>] suggested that fendlerbush probably recovers
after fire by sprouting from the root crown.  Pinyon-juniper communities
where fendlerbush is commonly found historically burned every 10 to 30
years, which favored dominance by grasses.  However, for the last 70
years, heavy livestock grazing has reduced grass competition and fuel,
and shrub cover has increased.  This has decreased fire occurrence and
lowered the intensity of fires that do occur [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  On 23 grazed
transects in desert shrub communities where fendlerbush occurs in the
Guadelupe Mountains, New Mexico, shrubs had only 6.4 to 6.6 percent
cover.  Bare ground cover was 33.8 to 42.4 percent, and litter cover was
6.1 to 12 percent [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Small shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Information was not available regarding the immediate effects of fire on
fendlerbush.  Fendlerbush is probably top-killed or killed by most fires.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
In Mesa Verde National Park, 4 years after a July/August, 1959 natural
fire in a pinyon-juniper community, fendlerbush had no significant
cover.  Fendlerbush frequency was 2 percent.  Twenty-nine years
following a July fire in a nearby pinyon-juniper community, fendlerbush
made up 1 percent of the cover and had 6 percent frequency.  Fendlerbush
maximum cover and frequency was not reached until almost 80 years after
a pinyon-juniper fire in Mesa Verde National Park.  At this time
fendlerbush made up 14 percent of the cover and had 48 percent frequency
[<a href="#7">7</a>].
