<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of red-osier dogwood is Cornus
sericea L.  Although the name "Cornus stolonifera Michx." is in wide
current use [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>] and the merits of both names have been debated
[<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>], a recent, extensive review of work with the genus gives the
correct name as C. sericea [<a href="#34">34</a>].

The discussion of how closely related forms in the Cornaceae should be
segregated has gone on for years and is summarized by Eyde [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>] and
Ferguson [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  Two main groups within Cornus are red-line dogwoods,
with showy bracts below the flowers and red fruit, and blue-line
dogwoods, without bracts and blue or white fruit [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Other authors
have placed the bractless dogwoods, including red-osier dogwood, in a
separate genus called Thleycrania, Ossea, or Svida (originally Swjda,
also spelled Swida and Suida) [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  Red-osier dogwood is very
widespread and variable; thus similar populations have been considered
variously as separate but interbreeding species, subspecies, and
varieties [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].

Recognized subspecies of Cornus sericea are as follows [<a href="#69">69</a>]:
  
     ssp.  occidentalis
     ssp.  sericea

The two subspecies interbreed quite freely and C. X californica is the
name given resultant plants.  C. X acadiensis is a hybrid of C. sericea
and C. alternifolia [<a href="#112">112</a>].  C. X slavini is a hybrid of C. sericea and
C. rugosa [<a href="#143">143</a>].  There are relatively slight differences between the
two subspecies and this paper considers the entire complex as red-osier
dogwood.

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cornus sericea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Red-osier dogwood occurs from Alaska and the Yukon Territory east to
Labrador and Newfoundland.  It extends south to Virginia in the East, to
Kansas in the Great Plains, to northern Mexico in the Rocky Mountains,
and through California on the West Coast [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].  In the
northeastern and midwestern United States it is common in previously
glaciated areas; south of these areas it occurs locally where site
conditions are favorable [<a href="#142">142</a>].

</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Red-osier dogwood is used for food and cover by white-tailed deer, mule
deer, elk, moose, mountain goats, cottontail rabbits, snowshoe hares,
and numerous birds, including the bobwhite, ring-necked pheasant, wild
turkey, and grouse [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#138">138</a>,<a href="#155">155</a>].  Red-osier dogwood fruit
is low in sugar so it is initially less attractive to wildlife and less
inclined to rot than other fruits.  Consequently, the fruit stays on the
plant through the winter and is availabile when fruits of other plants
are gone [<a href="#133">133</a>].  In the northern Rockies, its fruit is a key grizzly
[<a href="#156">156</a>] and black bear food [<a href="#115">115</a>].  Fruit of red-osier dogwood is also
eaten by songbirds, grouse, quail, partridge, cutthroat trout, ducks,
crows, mice and other mammals [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>].  Deer mice, meadow voles, and
other small rodents feed on the young stems and bark [<a href="#104">104</a>].  Beavers use
it for food and to build dams and lodges [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>].

Red-osier dogwood is particularly important to moose in the winter; it
is also used in the summer and in the fall when leaves that have escaped
frost are particularly favored [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#135">135</a>].  In a Minnesota study, moose
used some red-osier dogwood during the summer, but primary use was in
the fall after the stems had reddened [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>].  Although it remained
important, it was not used as much in the winter, possibly because some
plants were covered by deep snow [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>].  Red-osier dogwood is
valuable winter forage for elk [43,82.  In Minnesota, white-tailed deer
browse it in April and May [<a href="#65">65</a>].  In the western United States and
Canada, mule deer use is heavy in the summer and moderate in the fall
and winter [<a href="#83">83</a>].  Livestock eat it, but it is not a preferred species
[<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>].  A 2-year study of summer cattle use of a riparian zone in
Oregon found use of red-osier dogwood was relatively heavy the first
year and light the second year [<a href="#114">114</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Leaves of red-osier dogwood are relatively unpalatable to livestock, but
the young sprouts are palatable to livestock and deer [<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>].  A study
of foliage use by captive mule deer found red-osier dogwood to be second
only to Scouler willow (Salix scouleriana) in palability, with the
highest use from August through September [<a href="#124">124</a>].  In Montana, mule deer
apparently prefer red-osier dogwood, since its occurrence in the diet
exceeds its abundance [<a href="#30">30</a>].  It is palatable to elk in northern Idaho,
although not abundant in the area [<a href="#89">89</a>].  For white-tailed deer in the
Black Hills palatability varies by season [<a href="#59">59</a>]:

                                Palatability
January to March                   high
April to June                       low
July to September                  high
October to December              medium

Red-osier dogwood is a preferred moose browse in central and eastern
North America [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#155">155</a>].  In the Intermountain West, it is highly
palatable to moose [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>].  In Quebec, red-osier dogwood, willows
(Salix spp.), and mountain ash (Sorbus scopulina) are given the highest
palatability ratings for moose [<a href="#105">105</a>], and in Manitoba it is a preferred
browse species [<a href="#156">156</a>].

The palatability of red-osier dogwood for wildlife in several western
states is rated as follows [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>]:

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Red-osier dogwood has been rated fair in energy value and poor in
protein value in some western states [<a href="#28">28</a>].  The fruit is low in lipids
and sugars and classified as "low quality" [<a href="#132">132</a>].  Tannins in the leaves
appear to inhibit protein availability, but there appears to be little
or no inhibition of protein availability in the stems browsed in the
winter [<a href="#114">114</a>].  The following crude protein content and digestibilities
were found in red-osier leaves fed to mule deer [<a href="#114">114</a>]:

     Crude protein content     Apparent protein      Digestible protein

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Red-osier dogwood provides valuable cover for birds and other small
animals, especially where it grows in thickets [<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#149">149</a>].  In Arizona
red-osier dogwood, along with willows, blueberry elder (Sambucus
cerulea), Rocky Mountain maple (Acer glabrum), and thin-leaf alder
(Alnus incana ssp. tenuifolia), provides nesting habitat for the dusky
flycatcher, MacGillivary warbler, orange-crowned warbler, broad-tailed
hummingbird, white-crowned sparrow, and Lincoln sparrow [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Red-osier
dogwood provides cover and shade that cools water temperatures in
streams for trout [<a href="#124">124</a>].  In the Pacific Northwest, red-osier dogwood
and other riparian species provide good mule deer fawning and
fawn-rearing areas in addition to good year-round security and thermal
cover [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>].

The degree to which red-osier dogwood provides environmental protection
during one or more seasons for wildlife species is as follows [<a href="#28">28</a>]:

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Red-osier dogwood is recommended for rehabilitating moist sites within
its range.  It is well adapted to disturbed sites, excellent at
stabilizing soil, easy to establish, and grows rapidly [<a href="#130">130</a>,<a href="#158">158</a>].  It
need fresh, aerated water to establish and may be particularly useful in
stabilizing eroding streambanks [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].  Its high tolerance for oil
could make it useful on oil-damaged sites [<a href="#148">148</a>].  Rooted cuttings or
nursery-grown seedlings are easily established on moist, well-drained
soils and grows rapidly [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>].  Seed production and handling are
described as "very good" [<a href="#158">158</a>].  On Intermountain sites, it is
moderately easy to establish from seed and spreads from seed at a
moderate rate; it also establishes readily from transplants and spreads
rapidly [<a href="#158">158</a>]].  Based on reports from Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and
North Dakota, red-osier dogwood's growth is best on gentle slopes [<a href="#28">28</a>].
Its establishment requirements are moderate to high, and its potential
biomass production is moderate.  It has moderate potential for use in
erosion control and greater potential for long-term revegetation than
for short-term revegetation [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Studies of rehabilitation along a Columbia River impoundment in
Washington found 5-year-old plantings of red-osier dogwood to be very
successful based on survival, growth, and use by wildlife for forage or
cover [<a href="#12">12</a>].  In the Tahoe Basin, establishment was fair to good and
long-term survival was good; red-osier dogwood did best on moist sites
with better soils [<a href="#123">123</a>].  On northwestern Montana roadcuts, red-osier
dogwood's survival and growth was good.  Although plants on drier
south-facing slopes did not develop as well as those on moister sites,
they grew and survived much better than expected [<a href="#64">64</a>].

Cuttings of red-osier dogwood root easily without treatment and can be
directly planted providing sufficient moisture is available [<a href="#29">29</a>].  One
hundred percent of cuttings taken in early August were rooted in 5 weeks
and 90 percent of those taken in mid-April were rooted in 8 weeks [<a href="#29">29</a>].
Red-osier dogwood also readily layers [<a href="#126">126</a>].  Rooted stock was
recommended for a Utah forest where land managers had difficulty
stabilizing areas damaged by mudslides and flooding [<a href="#146">146</a>].  Rooting of
red-osier dogwood cuttings was slowed slightly by endomycorrhizal
infection in one study, but overall rooting was not affected [<a href="#95">95</a>].
Grasses decrease red-osier dogwood growth in containers by as much as 72
percent [<a href="#145">145</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Red-osier dogwood is an attractive landscaping plant [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>].  In the
winter its deep red stems and twigs provide color, in the spring it
produces many creamy white flowers followed by attractive white fruits,
and in the fall its leaves turn a spectacular maroon [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Once
established, it is drought tolerant [<a href="#7">7</a>] and, for gardeners in rural
areas, it is less palatable to white-tailed deer and mule deer than many
other ornamental shrubs [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].

The long slim stems were used by Indians for basket weaving and are
still used by present-day crafters [<a href="#72">72</a>].  Indians and early settlers
smoked the inner bark, stem scrapings, and leaves, which have a slightly
narcotic effect [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>].  In Southern California the inner green cambium
layers were peeled, dried, and smoked ceremonially [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Indians also
used an extract from red-osier dogwood as an emetic for treating fevers
and coughs and obtained dyes from the bark and roots [<a href="#93">93</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Red-osier dogwood is especially valuable for protecting and stabilizing
streambanks because of its thick, extensive root system [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>].
This is particularly important to management of higher gradient stream
channels where scouring by seasonal flooding occurs.

In a Lake States study, red-osier dogwood did not hold up under heavy
use but did well with light clipping [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Other studies indicate that
red-osier dogwood may increase with some browsing [<a href="#107">107</a>].  Following 61
percent leader use by cattle in Oregon, red-osier dogwood responded with
exceptional growth the following year when it had light use, and should
continue to do well with alternating years of moderate and light use
[<a href="#114">114</a>].  However, heavy and prolonged grazing in Montana ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa) or cottonwood (Populus spp.) and red-osier dogwood
riparian communities may eliminate the dogwood and convert the area to a
Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) understory [<a href="#54">54</a>]. Heavy grazing by
Wisconsin dairy cows eliminated red-osier dogwood from streambanks
[<a href="#149">149</a>].  In southwestern Montana, after moose hedging of red-osier
dogwood increased 80 to 100 percent in 2 years, forage production and
plant vigor became very low [<a href="#132">132</a>].  Moose browsing on Isle Royale has
reduced red-osier dogwood abundance and height [<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>].

Red-osier dogwood is most valuable to beaver in its early growth stages
when it is resprouting after fire or other disturbance [<a href="#152">152</a>].  Managers
find that marsh sites are excellent for beaver production but that the
beaver impoundments raise the water level to a point where red-osier
dogwood and other food plants are killed.  The problem is solved
naturally when the beaver abandon the site and the plants regenerate,
but to hasten succession and provide suitable beaver habitat, red-osier
dogwood cuttings can be planted near the new pond edge [<a href="#103">103</a>].

Herbicides designed to weed ornamental crops also injured up to 20
percent of the tissue of red-osier dogwood plants [<a href="#145">145</a>].  Red-osier
dogwood can be controlled by spraying with mixtures of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T
or dicamba and either 2,4-D or 2,3,4-T [<a href="#125">125</a>].  Treatment with 2,4-D or
paraquat causes chlorosis and necrosis of leaves and stems and delays
spring growth [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Plants treated with 2,4-D and paraquat were
affected much less when they were treated after vegetative maturity (the
stage of dormancy preceding visible leaf senescence) than when treated
earlier in the year [<a href="#25">25</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cornus sericea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Red-osier dogwood is a deciduous, many-stemmed shrub which varies in
height from 3 to 19 feet (1-6 m) [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>].  The young stems and twigs
are dark red, gradually fading to gray-green, and becoming red again in
the fall and winter [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>].  The leaves are opposite with prominent
lateral veins that curve toward the tip and smooth edges [<a href="#93">93</a>].  Many,
small white flowers are borne in a flat-topped cyme and, unlike many
dogwoods, there are no large, showy bracts.  The flowers are followed by
berrylike fruits that are white or lead colored at maturity [<a href="#126">126</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>].

Red-osier dogwood's wide range and ability to tolerate extremely cold
temperatures (laboratory temperatures as low as -320 degrees F [-196
degrees C]) [<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>] have prompted a number of studies of its physiology
and cold acclimation [14,15,16,17,42,56,63,74,75,76,90,91,102,119,
120,139].  Red-osier dogwood avoids freezing injury caused by ice
forming within living protoplasm by having freezable water frozen
extracellularly [<a href="#96">96</a>].  The factors that seem to affect cold acclimation
the most are low temperatures, short days, water stress, and the
developmental stage of the plant [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>].  Key points in the
developmental cycle, chilling requirements, and temperature effects have
been described and modeled [<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>].  Far red light,
characteristic of the long twilights at high latitudes, and short day
length promote cold acclimation [<a href="#90">90</a>].  Water-stressed plants have an
increased tolerance of freezing and increase their freezing point [<a href="#16">16</a>].
In plants exposed to short days, tissue changes occur that reduce the
plant's ability to take up water and simultaneously increase water loss
so that the plant partially dehydrates even when water is plentiful
[<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>].

A study of different geographic races found that stem pubescence and
leaf size and form vary, and plant form can vary from very upright to
decumbent between races, although there are no clear patterns [<a href="#126">126</a>].
Growth rates of more northern races are slower under shorter
photoperiods than those of southern races growing in their own
geographic areas.  Total growth of northern races was reduced because
they stopped growth and started cold acclimation earlier than more
southern races [<a href="#126">126</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Natural regeneration of red-osier dogwood is both sexual and asexual
[<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>].  The flowers of red-osier dogwood are self-sterile and
outcrossing is obligate [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  This is controlled by a single,
multiallelic gene that inhibits full pollen tube growth in the style of
the plant [<a href="#62">62</a>].  Pollinators include the honey bee, bumble bee, solitary
bee [<a href="#47">47</a>] and possibly beetles, flies, and butterflies [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Seeds are
dispersed primarily by songbirds, although other animals including
bears, mice, grouse, quail, partridges, and even ducks and cutthroat
trout may eat the fruit and disperse seeds [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>].  The seeds may
be stored in seedbanks [<a href="#117">117</a>].  Individual plants generally first bear
fruit at 3 to 4 years of age, but older plants are more prolific [<a href="#125">125</a>].

Red-osier dogwood seeds have dormant embryos and need cold
stratification for 1 to 3 months [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>].  Sometimes hard seed coats
are also present and scarification is then necessary [<a href="#125">125</a>].  Germination
rates increased after passage through a black bear's digestive tract
[<a href="#115">115</a>] but were inconsistant after passage through a pheasant's digestive
tract [<a href="#80">80</a>].  The seeds will remain viable in cold storage for 4 to 8
years [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Details of seed collection and nursery germination can be
found in several studies [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>].

On good sites red-osier dogwood can form dense thickets through
vegetative reproduction [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Red-osier dogwood spreads by layering
when the lower stems touch or lie along the ground and root at the nodes
[<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  In the northeastern United States, production of new plants
from stolons is most likely for plants in very moist situations and wet
meadows [<a href="#125">125</a>].  Plants may also produce new shoots from the roots and
new branches from the bases of dying branches [<a href="#125">125</a>].  If 27 percent or
more of the stem is girdled by small rodents, the stem will die back to
the injury, and new growth begins below that point on the stem [<a href="#104">104</a>].
Red-osier dogwood resprouted promptly from the roots in riparian zones
in the airfall area and more slowly in the devastated zone following the
eruption of Mount St. Helens [<a href="#92">92</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Red-osier dogwood is a characteristic species of swamps, low meadows,
and riparian zones; it is also found in forest openings, open forest
understories, and along forest margins [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>].  It is a facultative
wetland plant [<a href="#111">111</a>].  It is found on warmer, more productive sites in
the taiga [<a href="#141">141</a>], in rich swamps [<a href="#57">57</a>], and generally on very rich, very
moist sites [<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>].

Red-osier dogwood's southern limits appear to be determined by high
temperatures [<a href="#125">125</a>].  Near its southern limit in New Mexico, it is only a
riparian species [<a href="#27">27</a>], and in other southwestern states and the southern
Great Plains, it is primarily a riparian species [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>].  In
the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California, it grows just above the
tidal zone and on hummocks and higher areas of marsh in oxbows and
overflow basins [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>].  In bluestem (Andropogon spp.) prairie in
Minnesota, red-osier dogwood grows in sedge (Carex spp.) dominated
swales that are inundated during the spring [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Although red-osier dogwood grows on a variety of soils, it prefers rich,
moist soils [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>].  Ratings in several western states give
growth on gravel as fair to poor; growth on sand, sandy-loam, and loam
as good; growth on clay-loam growth as fair to good; and growth on clay
or dense clay as poor [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Opinions differ on its pH preference which
is given as 5.5 to 7.5 [<a href="#149">149</a>] or 7.0 to 8.0 [<a href="#138">138</a>].  It needs high levels
of mineral nutrients for vigorous growth [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#149">149</a>].  Growth on acidic
soils is rated as fair in Montana and Wyoming but poor in Colorado [<a href="#28">28</a>].
Growth on organic soils, saline soils, sodic soils, and sodic-saline
soils in Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado is rated as poor, and optimum
soil depth is given as over 20 inches (51 cm) [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Soil temperatures
can change root morphology and the mineral content of the stem and
leaves of red-osier dogwood [<a href="#6">6</a>].  The best root growth occurs at lower
soil temperatures than the best shoot growth [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Red-osier dogwood can tolerate flooding and, consequently, is found on
floodplains and wetlands and is often one of the first shrubs to invade
wet meadows [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>].  Its seeds germinate above water level, but
after several years growth, the plants can live with the roots submerged
in water for most of the growing season [<a href="#129">129</a>].  Plants on such wet sites
are found in mineral rich swamps or fens and not in ombrotrophic,
sphagnum bogs [<a href="#57">57</a>].

Elevation:  Elevational ranges in several western states are as follows
[<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]:

                            Minimum              Maximum
                         feet     meters      feet     meters

Colorado                 4,500     1,372     10,000     3,048
Montana                  3,400     1,036      6,600     2,012

Wyoming                  5,500     1,676      8,300     2,530

Associates:  The plants most closely associated with red-osier dogwood
are willows and alders (Alnus spp.).  Other plants frequently found with
red-osier dogwood include cottonwoods, aspen (Populus tremuloides),
birch (Betula spp.), Wood's rose (Rosa woodsii), gooseberries (Ribes
spp.), hawthorne (Crataegus spp.), horsetails (Equisetum spp.), thistle
(Cirsium spp.), and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis).


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Red-osier dogwood is an early to mid seral species [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#140">140</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>] that is
supressed in shade and is not normally found in the understory of closed
canopy forests [<a href="#125">125</a>].  It is found in the understory of mixed open
forests [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Red-osier dogwood needs moderate to full sunlight [<a href="#11">11</a>].
A shade-frame study found that red-osier dogwood grew best in 75 percent
of full light intensity.  Its natural occurrence in full sunlight may be
facilitated by its growth in wet situations where it encounters no water
stress [<a href="#122">122</a>].

Red-osier dogwood is a dominant understory shrub in the early
successional willow and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) communities
that follow oxbow lakes in Alberta, and it has 60 to 75 percent canopy
cover in these communities [<a href="#140">140</a>].  It is also the most important species
in the seral shrub-carrs of Wisconsin that succeed wet prairies, fens,
or sedge meadows and are followed by lowland forest or conifer swamp
[<a href="#148">148</a>].  Red-osier dogwood is not a primary invader in these areas.  It
enters the stand later in succession and is least common in greatly
disturbed stands [<a href="#148">148</a>].  Red-osier dogwood is also a successional
species in this area following fire or when a bog basin is partially
drained by stream downcutting [<a href="#21">21</a>].

In Ontario sugar maple-beech (Acer saccharum-Fagus grandifolia) and
eastern hemlock-yellow birch (Tsuga canadensis-Betula lutea) forests,
red-osier dogwood is a pioneer in open and disturbed areas [<a href="#11">11</a>].  In New
York wetland forest gaps caused by American elm (Ulmus americana)
mortality, red-osier dogwood is frequent and abundant in multiple-tree
gaps but rare beneath the closed canopy and in single-tree gaps [<a href="#160">160</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
One consequence of red-osier dogwood's wide geographic range has been
the development of geographic races with different seasonal responses.
A comparison of 21 clones from different areas grown together in a
Minnesota plot found that spring events, such as bud break, flowering,
and greening of the bark are, determined by temperature, and all of the
clones responded to the same temperature [<a href="#126">126</a>].  In contrast fall bud
set, red bark color, leaf abscission, and cold acclimation were
determined by photoperiod, and the geographic races responded to
different photoperiods [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>].  This indicated genetic control and
genetic differences between the races.  Not all the races were able to
acclimate in time to avoid winter cold injury in Minnesota, but once
cold acclimated, all the races were able to withstand -130 degrees F
(-90 degrees C) without injury.  Another study [<a href="#8">8</a>], however, indicates
that clones from Montana, Oregon, and Idaho have different hardiness
levels than clones from North Dakota and Washington.

Comparisons of the timing of fall events between different climatic
races of red-osier dogwood growing at the same location in Minnesota are
as follows (Onset of rest is the point in the growth cycle beyond which
plants or cuttings moved into a favorable environment will not grow)
[<a href="#127">127</a>]:

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Red-osier dogwood is able to sprout from surviving roots or stolons and
from the base of aerial stems following fire [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#149">149</a>].  It can be
killed by severe fires which cause extended heating of the upper soil
[<a href="#38">38</a>].

Red-osier dogwood is considered to be a semi-fire-tolerant, seed-banking
species [<a href="#117">117</a>]. Light fires which partially remove the duff stimulate
germination of buried seed [<a href="#48">48</a>].  In a northern Idaho grand fir (Abies
grandis) forest seed bank study, red-osier dogwood seed was found in the
top 2 inches (5 cm) of soil; however, viability was low (4%) [<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Aboveground foliage of red-osier dogwood is usually killed by fire.
However, the roots will survive all but the most severe fires which
remove the duff and heat the upper soil for extended periods [<a href="#38">38</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Red-osier dogwood generally increases following fire [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>], and
it may invade a recently burned area from adjacent unburned areas [<a href="#38">38</a>].
It may take some time before resprouting red-osier dogwood regains its
former cover and volume.  A Montana study in aspen found that 2 years
after prescribed burning red-osier dogwood resprouts had attained 72
percent of their prefire cover and 54 percent of their prefire volume,
while density was back to prefire levels [<a href="#161">161</a>].

In moist forests of British Columbia, red-osier dogwood appears to
increase in abundance following logging and burning [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  It
established in a logged and burned Manitoba black spruce (Picea mariana)
stand by the fifth postfire year [<a href="#18">18</a>].  On Minnesota black spruce sites
most fires stimulate sprouting of red-osier dogwood, although severe
fires favor tree seedlings [<a href="#1">1</a>].  A study in the cedar-hemlock (Thuja
spp.-Tsuga spp.) zone of northern Idaho found no red-osier dogwood in
closed stands.  It established with very slight frequency (1%) in logged
stands without fire; somewhat higher frequency (5%) in areas with both
single and multiple broadcast burns; and highest frequency (12%) in
areas that were piled and burned [<a href="#94">94</a>].  In a northwestern Montana
subalpine fir/queencup beadlily (Abies lasiocarpa/Clintonia uniflora)
habitat type, red-osier dogwood cover was highest (15%) in stands that
had burned 35 to 70 years ago and very low in clearcuts (0-1.4%) whether
dozer piled or not [<a href="#156">156</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>].

In Wisconsin shrub-carrs (wet ground tall-shrub communities) light to
medium fires cause resprouting in red-osier dogwood and serve to
maintain the shrub-carr [<a href="#149">149</a>].  Following prescribed burning in central
Wisconsin shrub-invaded sedge meadows, red-osier dogwood resprouted and
was favored over other shrubs [<a href="#162">162</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In the northern Rockies red-osier dogwood is a common member of the
seral brushfields which occur following fire and compete with tree
seedlings [<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>].  In order to reduce brushfields on sites that are
away from streams and floodplains, the use of logging methods which
cause a relatively high amount of site disturbance followed by a fire
which removes most of the soil organic horizons is recommended [<a href="#109">109</a>].
In northwestern Montana, clearcutting alone apparantly dislodged enough
roots of red-osier dogwood so that few plants were able to sprout
[<a href="#156">156</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>].

Postfire sprouts in the early stages of growth are the most valuable for
beaver [<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#152">152</a>].  Following fire in Minnesota, red-osier dogwood became
more important to moose and white-tailed deer, even though it grew only
near streams and was not abundant within the burn [<a href="#65">65</a>].
