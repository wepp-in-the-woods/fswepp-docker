<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Cascara is predominately a shrub component on forested sites in the
Pacific Northwest.  No information was found listing cascara as an
understory dominant or site indicator.  Cascara was listed, however, as
a member of a prairie community occupying a floodplain in the Willamette
Valley, Oregon.  It was also listed as a representative species in a vine 
maple (Acer circinatum) plant association on a lava flow near Santiam Pass,
Oregon [<a href="#9">9</a>].  In southern Oregon, cascara was found as a component in many 
plant associations in the white fir (Abies concolor), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
menziesii), and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) series [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Plant associations (pas) in southern Oregon where cascara is listed as a

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rhamnus purshiana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Cascara is a wide-spread but not abundant shrub found primarily in
forested mountains [<a href="#27">27</a>].  It has been listed as a browse species for
mule deer in Oregon [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>] and for elk in northern Idaho [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Cascara
was found to be a winter browse species for mule deer in northwestern
Oregon.  Sixty-eight percent of available cascara shrubs were browsed
during the winter.  In summer, however, cascara was less desirable; only
27 percent of available cascara shrubs were browsed [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Other mammals
that browse cascara include the Olympic black bear, Oregon gray fox,
racoon, and ring-tailed cat [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Cascara drupes are eaten by five
species of birds including the Oregon ruffed grouse and band-tailed
pigeon.  Cascara is of no value as forage for livestock [<a href="#30">30</a>].  How the
purgative characteristics of cascara bark and drupes affect wildlife are
not known [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Although utilized by wildlife, cascara is not very palatable.  Cascara
is browsed very lightly by sheep and to some extent by mule deer, but
for all practical purposes its forage value is negligible [<a href="#27">27</a>].
Palatability of cascara leaves to elk on the Selway Game Preserve, Idaho
was poor [<a href="#30">30</a>].

The relish and degree of use shown by wildlife species for cascara in
British Columbia are as follows [<a href="#4">4</a>]:

     Specie            Palatability
-----------------      ------------
bighorn sheep             poor
elk                       fair
moose                     poor
mule deer                 poor
white-tailed deer         poor
caribou                   poor
coast deer                good


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The nutritive value of cascara is poorly understood.  Cascara was found
to be nitrogen-rich in one southern British Columbia study [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Cascara often forms brushy stands capable of providing abundant thermal
and hiding cover [<a href="#2">2</a>].  The shrubby form may prove a more valuable cover
species than the treelike northern form [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The greatest known value of cascara is its purgative properties.  In a
single year, five million pounds of dried cascara bark from the Pacific
Northwest was processed by pharmaceutical companies in the manufacture
of laxatives [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

The Kootenai and Flathead tribes of western Montana used cascara as a
laxative, consuming it in the form of a tea brewed from the bark.  These
Indians believed that it would be a purgative when the bark was stripped
downward.  If stripped upward, the drug would act as an emetic.  Cascara
bark contains anthraquinare derivatives, tannin, resins, starch,
glucose, and other compounds [<a href="#11">11</a>].  When the bark is chewed, it tastes 
extremely bitter, and may temporarily numb the taste buds [<a href="#1">1</a>].  

The flesh of some animals which have consumed the drupes is said to
retain some of the purgative properties.  The juice pressed from the
berries is used to prepare a 'syrup of cascara'.  The bark and dried
berries have been used as a source of yellow- and saffron-colored dyes.
The berry juice. when combined with alum, produces a green dye once used
by artists [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Apparently, if cascara is handled for a long time, the laxatative
effects can even be transferred through the skin [<a href="#1">1</a>].  For maximum
effectiveness, bark collection is recommended from mid-April to the end
of August, and bark should be stored as long as possible before being
used [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Disease:  Cascara has been found to be susceptible to laboratory
exposures of crown rusts [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Herbicides:  Garlon 4 and Tordon 101 applied during early foliar
development top-killed 95 percent of cascara 3 years after treatment
[<a href="#19">19</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rhamnus purshiana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Cascara is a deciduous, erect, tall shrub or small tree.  It can attain
a height up to 33 feet (10 m) at maturity, but becomes smaller in size
and bushier along its southern distribution [<a href="#29">29</a>].  West of the Cascades,
it develops a single trunk 8 to 12 inches (20-30 cm) thick, 20 to 35
feet (6-10.7 m) tall.  It has greenish-yellow flower petals
approximately 0.12 to 0.16 inch (3-4 mm) long [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Cascara has a
purplish-black drupe about 0.3 inch (7.5 mm) in diameter, containing
several seeds [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  Cascara is very tolerant of shade [<a href="#1">1</a>].  The
leaves are oblong, 3 to 5 inches (7.5-12.5 cm) long, and have 10 to 12
pairs of prominent parallel veins arising directly opposite each other
on the midrib.  The leaf buds have no scales [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Cascara usually reproduces by seed.  It can also spread by layering and
can sometimes be propagated by cuttings.  Cascara will coppice after
being stripped of bark and cut down [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].

Seeds:  Cascara generally produces 20 pounds (18 kg) of seeds per 100
pounds (90 kg) of fruit.  Cleaned seeds range from 5,000 to 19,000 seeds
per pound (4,500-17,100 kg), with an average of 12,300.  Recommended
sowing depth is 1 inch, with seedbed shading [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Birds are the
predominant distributors of cascara seeds [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Morphological characteristics of cascara fruit from Rainbow Creek
Research Natural Area, southeast Washington are as follows [<a href="#24">24</a>]:

                                      Mean
                                     ------

Fresh Seed Mass per Fruit (mg)       165.20
Fresh Pulp Mass (mg)                   3.80


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Cascara generally grows on lower mountain slopes [<a href="#1">1</a>].  It may also
inhabit moist canyons on the east slope of the Cascades.  In Oregon,
cascara is generally a moist-site indicator [<a href="#2">2</a>].  It is commonly found
with red alder (Alnus rubra) on moist bottomlands but is rarely abundant
[<a href="#1">1</a>].

Site characteristics from southern Oregon Cascade Mountain Province
where cascara is found as a forest nominal component are as follows [<a href="#2">2</a>]:

Rock (%):                    0.4 -  6.1
Bedrock (%):                 0.0 -  3.8



<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Cascara has not been cited as a dominant species in any forest habitat
type described for the Pacific Northwest.  Being shade tolerant, it is
often found in the understory of second-growth forests [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Therefore,
its primary role seems to be that of a long-lived invader species.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Major phenological activities of cascara in northern Idaho are as
follows [<a href="#22">22</a>]:

3.  All cascara's aboveground parts were completely killed by the fire.

<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fire intervals on southern Oregon sites where cascara occurs range from
30 to 60 years, to longer intervals of 100 to 320 years.  These
understories are generally free from heavy fuels, giving rise to
low-intensity fires.  In some plant associations that include cascara,
however, high-intensity, stand-replacing fires occur approximately every
60 to 150 years [<a href="#2">2</a>].
