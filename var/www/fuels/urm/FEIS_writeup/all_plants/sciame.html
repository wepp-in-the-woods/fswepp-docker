<b>COMMON NAMES : </b>
   Olney threesquare

<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of Olney threesquare is Scirpus
americanus Pers. [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  It is a member of the sedge family,
Cyperaceae.

The taxonomy of Olney threesquare is somewhat confusing because of the
consistent misapplication of scientific names within the genus for many
years.  Until about 1975, Olney threesquare and a closely related
bulrush were treated as follows:

   S. olneyi Gray = Olney threesquare or Olney bulrush
   S. americanus Pers. = common threesquare or American bulrush

However, Schuyler [<a href="#24">24</a>] pointed out that the application of these names
is incorrect because the type speciman of plants usually treated as S.
americanus is conspecific with plants treated as S. olneyi, and the type
of S. pungens is conspecific with plants treated as S. americanus.
Therefore, the correct taxonomy is:  plants usually treated as S. onleyi
= S. americanus Pers., and plants usually treated as S. americanus = S.
pungens Vahl.

Although these changes are incorporated into recently published floras,
the names are still misapplied in much of the scientific literature.
Readers of scientific literature need to be cautious when encountering
the latin name S. americanus because of its inconsistent usage.

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Olney threesquare forms nearly monodominant stands in some marshes.  In
coastal areas it is most abundant in brackish marshes and is commonly
associated with seashore saltgrass (Distichlis spicata var. spicata),
marshhay cordgrass (Spartina patens), big cordgrass (S. cynosuroides),
smooth cordgrass (S. alterniflora), and saltmarsh bulrush (Scirpus
robustus) [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  In desert regions of the West, Olney threesquare
often dominates or codominates slightly to moderately saline marshes
bordering lakes or springs.  Codominants of western marshes include
creeping spikerush (Eleocharis palustris), Nebraska sedge (Carex
nebraskensis), inland saltgrass (Distichlis spicata var. stricta),
berula (Berula erecta), and marsh yellowcress (Rorippa islandica)
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].

Olney threesquare dominated communities are described in the following
publications:

Aquatic and semiaquatic vegetation of Utah Lake and its bays [<a href="#3">3</a>]

Plant ecology of spring-fed salt marshes in western Utah [<a href="#2">2</a>]

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Scirpus americanus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Olney threesquare rhizomes are a preferred food of muskrat, and Canada
and snow goose [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  It is sometimes an important nutria food
source.  Olney threesquare stands serve as primary wintering grounds for
the snow goose, where this plant makes up about 90 percent of the
goose's diet.  Where geese or muskrat populations are high, use by these
animals can be so great that they cause "eat outs"; that is, they
destroy large areas of Olney threesquare vegetation by consuming all the
rootstocks and rhizomes [<a href="#28">28</a>].

The seeds are eaten by wintering ducks in the South but generally make
up only a small part of the diet [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Deer regularly feed on species of Scirpus.  In terms of volume consumed,
Olney threesquare ranked second among 50 plant species fed to captive
deer in Louisiana [<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Olney threesquare rhizomes are highly palatable to the muskrat, nutria,
Canada goose, and snow goose [<a href="#28">28</a>].  In the South, Olney threesquare is
moderately palatable to cattle.  Tender, young shoots are most
attractive [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Palatability was rated as follows in Utah:  poor for sheep, horses, elk,
mule deer, and pronghorn; fair for cattle, upland game birds, and small
nongame birds; and good for waterfowl and small mammals [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Olney threesquare regularly provides good nesting habitat for many
species of rails [<a href="#28">28</a>].  In Utah, cover value has been rated as fair for
upland game birds and good for waterfowl, small nongame birds, and small
mammals [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Olney threesquare is used in saltmarsh revegetation programs.  The best
place to initiate new stands is probably in brackish areas where
salinities range from 5 to 10 parts per thousand and water depths range
from 0 to 4 inches (0-10 cm) [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Stands are best established by
planting rootstocks 4 to 6 inches (10-15 cm) below the soil surface in
winter at a spacing of about 6 by 6 feet (1.8 by 1.8 m).  Water depths
need to be maintained at 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm) above the soil surface
for 3 to 4 weeks after planting but can fluctuate thereafter.  Muskrat
and nutria need to be controlled on planted areas because they can
severely reduce planting stock.  For a detailed discussion on site
preparation and planting techniques see Sipple [<a href="#28">28</a>] and Ross and
Chabreck [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Management and maintenance of Olney threesquare stands depends primarily
on maintenance of water levels and secondarily on salinity levels.
Maximum survival and growth in coastal areas occur where average minimum
yearly water levels do not fall below 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm) above the
soil surface [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Olney threesquare increases under light to moderate cattle grazing.
Under heavy grazing, however, it is replaced by less palatable species
such as seashore saltgrass, black rush (Juncus roemerianus), and
seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum) [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Scirpus americanus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Olney threesquare is a coarse, rhizomatous, perennial sedge.  It has
erect, sharply triangular and deeply concave-sided culms growing up to 5
feet in height (1.5 m) [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  It generally bears only a few short
leaves up to about 4 inches long (10 cm) which arise from the lower part
of the culm.  The inflorescence consists of a cluster of 5 to 12
sessile, crowded spikelets [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Rhizomes are located within 6 inches
(15 cm) of the soil surface [<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte
   Helophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction:  Olney threesquare seed production has been
variously reported as very poor to heavy, with seed yields ranging from
0 to 24 pounds per acre (0-27 kg/ha) [<a href="#28">28</a>].  The seeds undergo a long
period of afterripening, often requiring 18 months or more before
germination can occur.  The seeds remain dormant as long as they are
submerged in water and thus become a component of the marsh seed bank.
Germination and seedling establishment potentially occur on exposed
mudflats following marsh drawdown, yet seedling establishment under
these natural conditions appears to be rare [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Under laboratory
conditions, maximum germination of only 25 percent was achieved in
distilled water under fluctuating temperatures between 68 and 95 degrees
Fahrenheit (20-35 deg C) [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Germination decreased with increasing
salinity with a 50 percent reduction at 4 parts per thousand (ppt) and
no germination at above 13 ppt [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Vegetative regeneration:  Olney threesquare perennates and spreads by
rhizomes, which is primarily responsible for the maintenance and
expansion of stands.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
In coastal regions, Olney threesquare grows primarily on peat in
brackish tidal marshes, where soil salinities range from 2 to 17 ppt,
and water levels range from -2 to +4 inches (-5 to +10 cm) [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].
Inland, it primarily grows in marshes, wet meadows, and playas that are
somewhat alkaline, but also grows in fresh water [<a href="#6">6</a>].  In an alkali
meadow in Utah, Olney threesquare dominated the area surrounding the
water source (a spring), but became rarer farther away from the spring,
and was replaced by inland saltgrass and creeping spikerush as water
depth decreased and salinity increased [<a href="#26">26</a>].  At this Utah meadow, soils
under Olney threesquare stands had higher levels of organic matter and
phosphorus than other marsh plant communities.


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species (Gulf Coast)
Obligate Climax Species (Atlantic Coast and western U.S.)

The successional status of Olney threesquare varies regionally.  Along
the Gulf coast, it is a seral species, and gives way to seashore
saltgrass and marshhay cordgrass in the absence of periodic (every few
years) burning or other disturbance.

In Utah, Olney threesquare is considered climax.  Referring to Olney
threesquare stands at Fish Springs, Utah, Bolen [<a href="#2">2</a>] stated "Scirpus
olneyi stands contain no other marsh species of comparable status and
are considered to represent closed stands of vegetation.  It is
completely successful in its niche and competition from other
communities and/or species was not observed."  

Along the East Coast, Olney threesquare forms climax stands that are
apparently maintained more by the slowly rising sea level than by fire
[<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
In Louisiana, Olney threesquare begins spring growth in March when soil
temperatures 4 inches (10 cm) below the soil surface reach 60 degrees
Fahrenheit (16 deg C) [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Culms grow at a uniform rate until
August, but by October, nearly all the culms are dead.  A small
percentage of the culms remain green throughout the winter [<a href="#19">19</a>].

In Utah, spring growth began on March 27 in marshes near warm springs,
and on April 14 in marshes far-removed from warm water [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Flowering and fruit production dates are as follows:

Delaware - flowers from early June to September [<a href="#28">28</a>]
New England - flowers from July 20 to August 8 [<a href="#25">25</a>]
Louisiana - flowering begins in late March and is finished by late May.
            Seeds are ripe by the end of June.  Seedfall begins in
            mid-July [<a href="#19">19</a>].
North and South Carolina - flowers from June to September [<a href="#21">21</a>]
Utah - flowers in early May [<a href="#2">2</a>]

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Scirpus americanus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Olney threesquare's rhizomes are sufficiently buried in soil, sometimes
up to 6 inches (15 cm), and are thus well protected from the heat of
fire.  Additionally, the plants often grow in shallow water which
further insulates the underground regenerative structures.

Olney threesquare seedling establishment after fire has not been
reported.  However, field studies show that Olney threesquare seeds
stored in the soil are not injured by marsh fires.  Palmisano [<a href="#19">19</a>] found
that seeds subjected to marsh fires, whether placed on a moist, but
unsaturated soil surface or buried 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the soil
surface had slightly higher germination rates than seeds not subjected
to fire.

<pre>
<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Scirpus americanus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Only aboveground (or abovewater) plant parts of Olney threesquare are
removed by fire when water levels are aboveground or only slightly below
the soil surface.  Thus the plant survives most fires because
perrenating underground organs are not harmed.  However, under severe
drought conditions, fire can burn deep into peat layers and kill Olney
threesquare by charring or consuming the rhizomes .


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
In comparison with marshhay cordgrass, Olney threesquare's rhizomes are
more deeply buried in the soil.  If burned when marsh soils are dry,
Olney threesquare typically suffers much lower rates of mortality where
these plants grow in mixed stands [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Olney threesquare often sprouts within a week of burning [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  In
Louisiana, Olney threesquare culm density reached or exceeded preburn
density within 4 weeks of burning whether burned in October, December,
or February [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Another study in Louisiana similarly found that
burning during different seasons had no effect on Olney threesquare culm
density [<a href="#11">11</a>].  In this study, plants quickly sprouted whether burned in
fall, winter, or spring as long as water levels were even with or
slightly above the soil surface at the time of burning.  However,
maximum leaf growth occurred in March and April when soil temperatures
rose above 60 degrees Fahrenheit (16 C), no matter what time of year
plants were burned.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Marshhay cordgrass outcompetes and replaces Olney threesquare in Gulf
Coast brackish marshes that remain unburned for a few to several years.
In a Louisiana brackish marsh, Olney threesquare was "weeded out" by
marshhay cordgrass after just 3 years of fire protection [<a href="#28">28</a>].
Prescribed burning every 2 or 3 years, however, maintains subclimax
stands of Olney threesquare [<a href="#12">12</a>].  For Louisiana coastal marshes, O'Neil
[<a href="#18">18</a>] recommended burning Olney threesquare stands anytime from October
10 to January 1 when water levels are between 0 and 2 inches (0-5 cm)
above the soil surface.
