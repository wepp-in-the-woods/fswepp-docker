<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Danthonia compressa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Mountain oatgrass occurs in the eastern United States and southeastern
Canada.  It occurs from extreme southeastern Ontario east through
southern Quebec to Nova Scotia and south through New England and the
Appalachian Mountain region to northern Georgia.  In the southeastern
United States, mountain oatgrass is restricted to the Appalachian
Mountains [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Mountain oatgrass occurs in forest openings, open woods, and mountain
meadows.

Mountain oatgrass is dominant in grassy balds of the southern
Appalachian Mountains.  Other herbaceous plants occurring in grassy
balds include redtop (Agrostis alba), timothy (Phleum pratense), Canada
bluegrass (Poa compressa), Kentucky bluegrass (P. pratense), red fescue
(Festuca rubra), five-fingers (Potentilla canadensis), and sheep sorrel
(Rumex acetosella) [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>]

On the Allegheny Plateau in Pennsylvania, deciduous forests which failed
to regenerate after logging support a dense groundcover of mountain
oatgrass, rough goldenrod (Solidago rugosa), tall flat-topped white
aster (Aster umbellatus), and bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum) [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Mountain oatgrass is listed as a dominant species in the following
publication:

Vegetation of the Great Smoky Mountains [<a href="#27">27</a>]

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Mountain oatgrass is not considered a regionally important forage
species [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>], although it is an important pasture grass in the
Appalachian highlands [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>].

<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
The dense growth habit and competitive nature of mountain oatgrass
restricts tree seedling establishment [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Where tree establishment is
desired, herbicides easily control existing mountain oatgrass.
Glyphosate does not impede germination of residual dormant seeds, but
Bromacil delays germination for more than 1 year [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Mountain oatgrass is host to the systemic parasitic fungus Atkinsonella
hypoxylon [<a href="#6">6</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Danthonia compressa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Mountain oatgrass is a native, perennial bunchgrass.  The culms are
slender, compressed, sometimes decumbent, and 12 to 32 inches (30-80 cm)
tall.  The leaves are mostly at or near the base and up to 8 to 10
inches (20-25 cm) long.  The inflorescence is a panicle; slender
branches bear two or three spikelets.  The awn is bent and 0.2 to 0.3
inches (0.6-0.8 cm) long [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Mountain oatgrass reproduces by seed.  Large amounts of seed are
produced annually, some of which remain dormant in the litter for at
least several years [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Mountain oatgrass also sprouts from
perennating buds at the base of the culms.

In two populations in North Carolina, mountain oatgrass produced an
average of 50 percent cleistogamous flowers [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
In the southern Appalachians, mountain oatgrass is a frequent species on
grassy balds which occupy well-drained sites on ridges, broad slopes,
and dome-shaped summits between 5,000 and 6,000 feet (1,500-1,800 m) in
elevation.  Grassy balds occur on slopes of all aspects but are most
commonly found on south, southwest, and west aspects.  Mountain oatgrass
grows on dry sites but is susceptible to drought [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  On wetter
areas of grassy balds, mountain oatgrass dominance gives way to sedges
(Carex spp.) [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Mountain oatgrass grows in full sun and in open woods.  It does not
persist under closed canopies [<a href="#4">4</a>].  It establishes on disturbed sites
including recently logged and burned areas [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].

Grassy balds are persistent successional communities.  The origin of
grassy balds is not fully understood, but former forests may have died
from ice storms, blow downs, fire, or climate change.  Woody species
establishment is often delayed on these sites by dense herbaceous
cover, harsh environment, fire, and/or grazing [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].

Grassy balds in the Appalachian Mountains are succeeded by Rhododendron
spp. thickets, American green alder (Alnus viridis ssp. crispa)
thickets, or spruce (Picea spp.)-fir (Abies spp.) forests.  A dense
carpet of moss (Polytrichum commune) advances into the grassy bald at
the edge of the spruce-fir forest and suppresses mountain oatgrass [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Mountain oatgrass generally flowers from June to August [<a href="#20">20</a>].  In North
Carolina, mountain oatgrass flowers from mid-June to early July [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Danthonia compressa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Mountain oatgrass occurs in oak (Quercus spp.) woods and grassy mountain
meadows which occasionally experience either lightning or human-caused
fire.  Lightning commonly strikes the peaks and ridges of the southern
Appalachian Mountains from April through August [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Grassy balds in
the Pisgah National Forest of North Carolina respond favorably to fire,
becoming thick and lush.  The low-severity fires burn very little of the
surface detritus [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Mountain oatgrass basal buds and dormant seeds
probably survive low-severity fire.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tussock graminoid
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Danthonia compressa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire probably kills the culms and leaves of mountain oatgrass.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Dormant seeds in the soil or litter germinate after fire.  Mountain
oatgrass seedlings began growing 1 week after a spring fire on Gregory
Bald in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Poverty grass, a
close relative of mountain oatgrass, regenerated from a seedbank after
fire on an upland site in Michigan [<a href="#22">22</a>].



<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Prescribed fire is used to maintain grassy balds in the southern
Appalachian Mountains.  Woody species are invading many grassy balds
because of fire suppression and decreased grazing [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Prescribed
burning was as effective as mowing in preventing woody species
establishment in Big Meadows, Shenandoah National Park, Virginia.
Biomass in the area prescribed burned in April was equal to the unburned
control by the end of the summer [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Grassy balds respond well to fall fires.  The fuel is less compact and
favorable weather conditions last longer in the fall than in the spring
[<a href="#18">18</a>].
