<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
California sagebrush is the most important member of the coastal sage
scrub community [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>].  Coastal sage scrub is primarily
composed of uneven-aged stands of low, nonsclerophyllous subshrubs.  The
community has been geographically subdivided into several distinct
floristic associations which are described in the literature [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].
California sagebrush is dominant or codominant in most of these
associations, providing from 25 to 100 percent cover [<a href="#4">4</a>].  The most
commonly occurring codominants are white, black, or purple sage (Salvia
apiana, S. mellifera, S. leucophylla), California encelia (Encelia
californica), and California buckwheat (Erigonium fasciculatum)
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>].

Coastal sage scrub is part of a landscape mosaic that also comprises
several other communities which may include chaparral, annual grassland,
oak (Quercus spp.) woodland, pinyon-juniper (Pinus spp.-Juniperus spp.)
woodland, and various coniferous forests (see Value and Use:  Site
Characteristics).  California sagebrush is a frequent associate in each
of these other communities.  Coastal sage scrub patches average
approximately 0.25 acres (0.1 ha), but the extent of the community
varies widely depending on site characteristics and fire history [<a href="#14">14</a>].
Coastal sage scrub also interfaces with urban and agricultural areas
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].

ssp. compactum) is an associate of insular populations [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Chaparral associates include chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum), bigpod
ceanothus (Ceanothus megacarpus), hoaryleaf ceanothus (C. crassifolius),
California scrub oak (Quercus dumosa), curlleaf mountain-mahogany
(Cercocarpus ledifolius), and hollyleaf cherry (Prunus ilicifolia)
[<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>].

Associates at the coastal sage scrub-desert interface include big
saltbush (Atriplex lentiformis), fathen saltbush (A. patula), California
seablite (Sueda californica), Europe swampfire (Salifornia europaea),

adjacent to coast sage scrub include bigcone Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
macrocarpa), Monterey pine (Pinus radiata), bishop pine (P. muricata),
singleleaf pinyon (P. monophylla), California juniper (Juniperus
californica), and Tecate cypress (Cupressus forbesii) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>] (also

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Artemisia californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Little information concerning animal consumption or preferrence for
California sagebrush browse has been published.  Sampson and Jesperson
[<a href="#73">73</a>] reported it as "limitedly" browsed by black-tailed deer and rarely,
if at all, browsed by livestock.  Spurlock and others (in [<a href="#64">64</a>]),
however, reported it as highly preferred by goats year-round.  Feral
sheep and goats on the Channel Islands browse California sagebrush
heavily [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
California sagebrush foliage is stronger in aroma and more bitter in
taste than other sagebrush species, which may tend to repel some
browsing animals [<a href="#73">73</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The percent crude protein (oven-dry basis) of California sagebrush
browse is as follows [<a href="#3">3</a>]:

     March      13.1
     May        12.6
     July       10.4
     September   8.8
     October    10.7

The leaves contain 3.1 percent nitrogen and 0.25 percent phosphorus (Mooney
and Chu, in [<a href="#59">59</a>]).


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
As a dominant species and one of the tallest subshrubs in the coastal
sage scrub community, California sagebrush provides thermal and escape
cover for small birds and mammals.  Many species of birds utilize it for
roosting and nesting cover, including the California knatcatcher [<a href="#93">93</a>].
The orange-throated whiptail lizard, another threatened species,
habituates openings between California sagebrush and other coastal sage
scrub shrubs [<a href="#76">76</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
California sagebrush is commonly selected for rehabilitation of degraded
coastal sage scrub and watershed, and for improvement of wildlife
habitat.  A natural colonizer, it is easily established from
commercially available seed.  It also transplants well [<a href="#7">7</a>].
Hydroseeding is the common method of seed application.  One such seeding
involved the replanting of a coastal sage scrub community following
construction of the Point Pederrales Pipeline in Santa Barbara County.
In the first year, average frequency of seedlings was 33 percent, and
average seedling density in 100-meter-square plots was 50.7 [<a href="#12">12</a>].
Project leaders working at other sites have reported similar success in
establishing California sagebrush by hydroseeding [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Hillyard
and Black [<a href="#35">35</a>] provide a list of coastal sage scrub species suggested
for coplanting and the ratio of seed of each species included in various
seed mixes.

California sagebrush seedlings outplanted in an old field in the
Sepulveda Wildlife Reserve near Van Nuys showed 75 percent survival in
the first year [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].  Transplantings on other project site have also
been successful [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Chumash Indians used California sagebrush for windbreaks.  Branches were
used as firesticks and arrow foreshafts.  Poultices or hairwashes were
applied for treating headaches.  The shrubs were also used for ritual
purification, especially in ceremonies relating to death.  Plants were
soaked in water used for ceremonial bathing or sprinkling, or were
burned.  Bundles of California sagebrush were erected along paths to
shrines [<a href="#79">79</a>].

Spanish settlers regarded California sagebrush as a panacea for most
ailments.  They drank tea made from the shrub to treat bronchial
problems and used it externally as a wash for wounds and swellings [<a href="#11">11</a>].
Early miners put California sagebrush sprays in their beds to repel
fleas [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Coastal sage scrub occupies about 2 percent of the state's total area:
about one-fourth of the total area of chaparral.  Because it occurs at
low elevation, coastal sage scrub not under the public domain has been
greatly reduced in size due to agricultural and urban development [<a href="#75">75</a>].
  
Rangeland:  A bare zone often develops around California sagebrush,
particularly on coastal sage scrub-annual grassland ecotones.  Causes of
this bare zone are complex and are at least partially attributable to
climate, herbivory, and allelopathic inhibition [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].  Halligan
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>] found that ecotonal bare zones were revegetated in one growing
season where small animal exclosures were constructed.  In a later study
[<a href="#28">28</a>], he found that California sagebrush leaf leachate inhibited growth
of some herbaceous species, especially exotic annuals, while growth of
other herbaceous species was not affected.

Establishment and survival of coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia)
seedlings were significantly greater (p<0.4) under California sagebrush
than in adjacent open areas [<a href="#8">8</a>].

California sagebrush populations have greatly decreased in numbers on
Santa Catalina and Santa Cruz Islands under heavy browsing by feral
sheep and goats.  On portions of these islands where livestock has been
excluded, California sagebrush has rapidly colonized denuded areas
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].

Control:  California sagebrush is sensitive to aerosol application of
2,4-D and sensitive to intermediate to such application of 2,4,5-T [<a href="#66">66</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Artemisia californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
California sagebrush is a native subshrub with multiple stems arising
from the root crown.  It grows from 2 to 5 feet (0.6-1.5 m) in height
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>].  The lower branches are woody and usually do not exceed
0.2 inch (50 mm) in diameter.  Ring counts of large lower branches show
ages of 15 to 25 years [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Leaves are seasonally dimorphic.  Slightly
larger leaves attached to main branches or stems appear early.  Most of
these leaves remain on the stem through the dry season, although they
may wilt [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>].  Side-shoots develop from the leaf axils of
larger leaves on lower branches.  These side-shoots develop smaller,
persistent leaves [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  The smaller leaves can remain wilted for
long periods of time under water stress and rehydrate within hours of
rainfall [<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>].  Both types of leaves are highly aromatic due to the
presence of terpenes [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>].  The inflorescense is a dense panicle
[<a href="#63">63</a>].  The fruit is a small <a href="../../../glossary.html#CYPSELA:">cypsela</a> with a minute pappus [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Roots are
shallow [<a href="#54">54</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  The light seeds of California sagebrush are wind dispersed and
may travel for long distances before addition to the seedbank [<a href="#56">56</a>].
Burkhart [<a href="#7">7</a>] reported the seeds as nondormant.  Keeley [<a href="#41">41</a>], however,
found that under laboratory conditions, seeds buried near the soil
surface readily germinated in moist soil without special treatment, but
that seeds buried below the level of light penetration failed to
germinate until exposed to charred wood leachate.  California sagebrush
is rated as moderate to high in rate of seed germination during
fire-free intervals [<a href="#90">90</a>].  Because of steady germination of soil-stored
seeds, California sagebrush often fails to develop a seedbank adequate
for recruitment of large numbers of seedlings during the first
postdisturbance growing season [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Seedling density usually increases
after growth and flowering of young plants.  Seedling establishment is
poor in mature coastal sage scrub communities; mature California
sagebrush may allelopathically inhibit growth of its seedlings [<a href="#61">61</a>].

Vegetative:  California sagebrush sprouts from the root crown following
damage to aboveground portions of the plant unless adventitious buds of
the root crown have been damaged by heat [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].  Shrubs often develop
adventitious roots where basal portions of stems are covered with soil
[<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
California sagebrush attains greatest development on the coastal side of
mountains [<a href="#31">31</a>].  In the outer Coast Ranges, it generally occupies
low-elevation sites (< 2,000 feet [610 m]) beneath chaparral
[<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].  It may, however, occupy higher elevations where soils
are shallow [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Outer Coast Range populations typically occur on all
aspects [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Inner Coast Range populations occur on shallow or
droughty soils within a narrow margin between chaparral and desert or
chaparral and semiarid annual grassland.  Aspect is usually south or
west [<a href="#72">72</a>].  Channel Island populations are typically found on south or
east-facing slopes with shallow soil [<a href="#57">57</a>].  California sagebrush
tolerates a wide range in degree of slope, but slopes are most
frequently steep [<a href="#45">45</a>].  It does not occur at elevations above 2,500 feet
(762 m) [<a href="#62">62</a>].

Soil textures supporting California sagebrush include sand, sandy loam,
clay, and gravelly clay-loam [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].  It also grows in
unconsolidated soils that occur in gravel washes, tallus slopes, and
colluvial deposits [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  Soil parent materials include granite,
andesite, shale, sandstone, and mudstone [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].

Climate is generally Mediterranean with a strong maritime influence
[<a href="#13">13</a>].  The climate of insular populations is maritime [<a href="#69">69</a>].  Ninety
percent of annual precipitation falls between November and April.
Climatic stations in coastal sage scrub receive between 1 to 18 inches
(250-450 mm) of precipitation per annum [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Northeasterly Santa Ana
foehn winds occur in the Transverse Ranges from mid-fall to December and
prevailing westerly winds are common in spring, summer, and early fall [<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

California sagebrush is a pioneer in primary and secondary succession
and persists as a dominant species through climax in coast sage scrub
communities [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>].  Its persistence in other communities varies from
early to late seral stages, but California sagebrush is rare in climax
communities other than coastal sage scrub [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].

Various successional progressions have been suggested for lower
elevation regions of southwestern California.  The community boundaries
are dynamic, with successional patterns influenced by intervals between
fire or other disturbance, the relative success of different species at
establishing seed in the seedbank, and competitive interactions
following disturbance [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Hanes [<a href="#31">31</a>] suggests that California
sagebrush and other coastal sage scrub species invade chaparral after
fire or other disturbance but are gradually replaced by chaparral
species in the absence of disturbance.  Keeley and Keeley [<a href="#42">42</a>] also
support this hypothesis, stating that frequent disturbance of coastal
sage scrub results in further successional regression to annual
grassland.  Horton [<a href="#37">37</a>], however, has suggested that coastal sage scrub
is replaced by coast live oak in the absence of disturbance.
Investigations of postfire succession in the Santa Monica and San
Gabriel mountains showed that California sagebrush readily established
in burned areas previously occupied by either coastal sage scrub or
chaparral, but was eventually outcompeted by chamise or bigpod ceanothus
in areas previously occupied by chaparral [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Stem growth is initiated in winter.  New leaf growth begins in February,
and leaf production is continuous until late summer.  Old leaves are
shed after 30 to 50 days.  Side-shoots of lower branches begin growth in
May.  The period of maximum stem elongation begins in March and ends in
summer, when drought dormancy begins.  Die-back of upper stems occurs in
late summer or early fall under water stress [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Various times
of flowering have been reported, including periods from August through
December [<a href="#62">62</a>], November thorough mid-May [<a href="#59">59</a>], and year-round [<a href="#11">11</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Artemisia californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fire Ecology:  Historical documentation of fire in coast sage scrub is
too sparse to allow for estimation of natural fire intervals of that
community.  The intervals vary widely.  Total area burned strongly
correlates with precipitation during the previous winter, with heaviest
burning occurring after wet years.  Fire is rare following drought [<a href="#58">58</a>].
Vogl [<a href="#81">81</a>] estimated an average fire interval of 20 years for
lightning-ignited fire in chaparral adjacent to coastal sage scrub.
Fire intensity is generally higher in coastal sage scrub than in seral
chaparral due to higher litter loading and the higher percentage of
terpenes in coastal sage scrub vegetation [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Fire intensity is
higher, however, in chaparral that has not burned for over 20 years
[<a href="#58">58</a>]. Average litterfall per annum in coastal sage scrub is 0.6 ounces
per square foot (194.1 g/sq m) [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Decomposition of the litter layer
is extrememly slow [<a href="#74">74</a>].  Fuel loadings vary from 3 to 10 tons per acre
(7-22 t/ha), 70 to 85 percent of which is typically consumed [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].

California sagebrush leaves are 15.6 percent ether extractives (ovendry
mass) [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Dead attached stems account for about 19 percent of total
aboveground biomass of mature shrubs [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Plant Adaptations:  California sagebrush establishes by seed and by
sprouting in postfire communities [<a href="#89">89</a>].  The breaking of dormancy of
more deeply-buried seeds by charred wood leachate is probably an
adaptation to fire [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Field studies of this germination response,
however, are lacking.  California sagebrush is classified as a weak
sprouter following burning of aboveground portions of the plant [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Small shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Artemisia californica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Light-severity fire top-kills California sagebrush; severe fire causes
plant mortality [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].  The effect of moderate-severity fire is not
well documented.  Shallowly buried seed is often killed by fire [<a href="#50">50</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Because California sagebrush seeds are fire sensitive and their seedbank
numbers moderate, seedling density may by low in the first postfire year
[<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  California sagebrush seedling density following a wildfire in
chamise chaparral near Pasedena was 0.25 per square foot (2.69/sq m),
while density in adjacent unburned chaparral was 0.34 per square foot
(3.67/sq m) [<a href="#83">83</a>].

Seedling recruitment is usually good after the first postfire year.
Population buildup is most rapid when fires are not severe and
top-killed plants consequently sprout.  Sprouts usually flower at
postfire year 1, although flowering is sometimes delayed until postfire
year 2 [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].  Seed resulting from sprout flowering, in addition to
windblown seed disseminated to burn areas, results in favorable seedling
establishment beginning at postfire year 2 or 3.  Sauer [<a href="#74">74</a>] reported a
California sagebrush seedling frequency of 12 percent in Big Sycamore
Canyon 3 years following the Mugu Fire in the Santa Monica Mountains.
He also reported a frequency of 12 percent for seedlings 3 years after
the nearby Topanga-Tuna Canyon Fire.  Crown density recovers to preburn
levels by postfire year 10 in coastal sage scrub unless the site is poor
or severe soil erosion occurs [<a href="#38">38</a>].

In a study comparing adjacent coastal sage scrub and bigpod
ceanothus-dominated chaparral communities at postfire year 26, Gray [<a href="#20">20</a>]
found that 33 percent of California sagebrush in coastal sage scrub
appeared to have resulted from crown sprouting, while 10 percent of
California sagebrush in chaparral appeared to have done so.  All
California sagebrush plants in the chaparral community were dead.
Density of California sagebrush in coastal sage scrub was 0.012 plants
per square foot (0.13/sq m).


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
California sagebrush seedlings may sprout when aboveground portions of
seedlings are damaged.  Coastal sage srub and chaparral communities
rarely burn in consecutive years, but unusual circumstances may trigger
this plant response. Germination of California sagebrush seed following
an arsonist-set fire on August 1979 on Otay Mountain, San Diego County,
resulted in a seedling density of 0.24 plants per square foot (2.62/sq
m) at postfire year 1.  In July 1980, another arsonist-set fire occurred
at the same site.  Fifteen percent of California sagebrush seedlings
established after the 1979 fire sprouted following the 1980 fire [<a href="#92">92</a>].


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fire suppression in coastal sage scrub has been generally successful
during summer months but not during extreme conditions of high
temperature accompanied by Santa Ana winds in fall.  In areas where fire
suppression has been successful yearround, delayed burning has resulted
in the burning of abnormally large areas during the abovementioned
weather conditions [<a href="#49">49</a>].  In other areas, fire intervals have increased
due to human-caused fires.  Because coastal sage scrub is generally
closer to developed areas than is chaparral, it is more vulnerable to
accidentally- and arsonist-set fire.  Analysis of the fire history of
coastal sage scrub on Burton Mesa near Lompoc revealed that all of the
27 fires occurring between 1938 and 1986 were started by humans.  Only
eight of these fires were prescribed.  The wildfires occurred in fall
and spread in the direction of southwesterly-blown Santa Ana winds.
These wildfires were arrested or extinguished at roads, fields, or
firebreaks [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Zedler [<a href="#89">89</a>] stated that the current high fire
frequencies of some coastal sage scrub communities may not be natural
and that some suppression may be neccessary in these areas to restore
presettlement ecological conditions.

The long-term effect of fire suppression on California sagebrush and
other coastal sage scrub species is unclear.  Some authorities suggest
that coastal sage scrub under the public domain is expanding in size by
invasion into adjacent communities.  Epling and Lewis [<a href="#15">15</a>] state that
California sagebrush and other coastal sage scrub species are
successfully invading chaparral dominated by sprouting species because
unusually hot, stand-replacing fires occurring as a result of fuel
buildup have killed such sprouting species.  Thomas [<a href="#77">77</a>] reported that
California sagebrush in coastal sage scrub of the Santa Monica Mountains
National Recreational Area is invading adjacent valley oak (Quercus
lobabta) woodland.  A computer model, however, indicates that the
shortened fire frequencies common to many coastal sage scrub areas will
result in the disappearance of California sagebrush and other weakly
sprouting, nonobligate seeders from that community.  This model suggests
that given a fire interval of 30 years or less, California sagebrush
will be absent from coastal sage scrub after 100 years.  There is
therefore some concern that California sagebrush may be declining in
numbers [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Field studies comparing area of expansion and decline of
coastal sage scrub because of fire are lacking.  Modern fire regimes may
result in no net loss of coastal sage scrub or California sagebrush.
Managers practicing prescribed burning should be aware, however, that
California sagebrush populations may require longer fire intervals than
have been proposed for hazard reduction [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Because of the less
intense heat generated by spring burning of coastal sage scrub and
chaparral [<a href="#22">22</a>], it may be the most favorable season in which to burn
California sagebrush if consequent sprouting is desired.  Special
measures such as seeding may eventually be neccessary following burning
during other seasons in order to insure continuance of California
sagebrush populations.

Firebreaks and fuelbreaks are easily constructed in coastal sage scrub,
and are easily maintained by mechanical, herbicide or other treatment
[<a href="#49">49</a>].  In a 4-year study, Green and Newall [<a href="#24">24</a>] successfully used goats
to control growth of California sagebrush and other plants on fuelbreaks
on the Los Padres National Forest.  Considerations for development of a
fire prescription in coastal sage scrub and chaparral communities are
available in the literature [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].
