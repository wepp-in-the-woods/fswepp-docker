<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Plains muhly plants have good forage value, but stands are often
scattered [<a href="#26">26</a>].  This species occurs primarily on range in good or
excellent condition.  Relative abundance of plains muhly decreases with
continued cattle grazing [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Elk and mule deer generally use sites dominated by warm-season grasses,
such as plains muhly.  The results of a study at Wind Cave National
Park, South Dakota, however, showed that this species was not a
significant part of their diet [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability of plains muhly to livestock and wildlife species in
several western states has been rated as follows [<a href="#5">5</a>]:

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Compared with other grasses, plains muhly is rated fair in energy and
protein value [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
In North Dakota, the degree to which plains muhly provides environmental
protection during one or more seasons has been rated as poor for
pronghorn and white-tailed deer but fair for mule deer [<a href="#5">5</a>].

revegetation work was rated as follows [<a href="#5">5</a>]:

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Muhlenbergia cuspidata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Plains muhly is a densely tufted, warm-season, native bunchgrass arising
from thickened culm bases.  Plants reach 16 inches (42 cm) in height.
They have tillers and are nonrhizomatous.  Roots reach a maximum depth
of 15 to 20 inches (40-50 cm) [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].

A study of the growth and morphological response to irradiance on an
open prairie in Linn County near Hiattville, Kansas, showed that plains
muhly can adjust morphologically to shaded environments.  Plants
produced more biomass at higher photosynthetic photo flux densities in
shaded areas [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Plains muhly regenerates by tillering and seeds.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Plains muhly grows on uplands and hillsides.  In Nebraska it is
particularly abundant on lime uplands and thin loess range sites.  It is
commonly intermixed with little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) and
sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula).  Plains muhly occurs throughout
mesic Midwestern prairies [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].

Elevational ranges vary as follows [<a href="#2">2</a>]:

    from 5,000 to 9,100 feet (1,500-2,800 m) in CO
         3,500 to 3,900 feet (1,100-1,200 m) in MT
         4,000 to 6,000 feet (1,200-1,800 m) in WY

Growth of plains muhly on various soil textures is rated as follows [<a href="#5">5</a>]:

               CO      MT      ND      WY
Gravel        Fair    Fair    Fair    Good
Sand          Poor    Good    Fair    Fair
Sandy loam    Good    Good    Good    Good
Loam          Good    Good    Good    Good

Clay          Poor    Fair    Fair    Fair
Dense clay    Poor    Poor    Poor    Poor


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

For the most part plains muhly occurs only occasionally in climax
vegetation [<a href="#3">3</a>].  At Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota, plains muhly
is part of the bluestem (bunch-grass) subclimax with little bluestem and
big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii var. gerardii) [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Plains muhly usually begins growth during the first 2 weeks of April.
Flowering occurs from the end of June to July.  Seeds ripen from early
August to October [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Like other warm-season grasses, plains muhly is generally favored by
early spring or winter burns.  In the northern Great Plains mixed
prairie, spring burning results in an increase in herbage production of
warm-season grasses.  Thus, forage resources on cool-season northern
mixed prairie ranges can be supplemented with warm-season grasses.  The
effects of burning may be enhanced or negated by the interactive effects
of grazing following burning [[<a href="#15">15</a>].

After a hot, late May wildfire in a mesic prairie in the northern Great
Plains, the frequency of plains muhly plants remained the same or
increased [<a href="#23">23</a>].  A different study in the mixed-grass prairie of the
northern Great Plains also showed that the frequency of plains muhly
remained unchanged or increased after spring burning.  In the tallgrass
prairie of the northern Great Plains, muhly species were usually harmed
by fire, although some data showed either no change or an increase in
plant vigor after fires [<a href="#16">16</a>].

A spring fire in a snowberry (Symphoricarpos occidentalis) shrub
community in central Alberta resulted in grass coverage remaining high 3
years after burning [<a href="#1">1</a>].  In Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota,
plains muhly increased after a winter burn.  This may have been due to a
decrease in competition from cool-season grasses [<a href="#15">15</a>].  However, in a
semidesert grass-shrub type, plains muhly appeared to be seriously
harmed by fire [<a href="#20">20</a>].
