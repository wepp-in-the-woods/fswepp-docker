<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix lasiandra
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Pacific willow is distributed from the interior of Alaska and the Yukon
Territory southeast to Saskatchewan and the Black Hills, southward along
the coast to southern California, and south through the Rocky Mountains
to New Mexico [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  It is mostly absent from the dry interior country
of eastern Washington, Oregon, southern Idaho, Nevada, and Utah [<a href="#36">36</a>].
Variety lasiandra grows mostly west of the Cascades but also occurs in
moist parts of eastern Washington, northern Idaho, and northwestern
Montana.  Variety caudata grows east of the Cascades, especially in the
Rocky Mountains [<a href="#8">8</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Pacific willow typically occurs in early seral communities along river
banks or on moist alluvium [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  In the Rocky Mountains these
riparian communities are often adjacent to zones of big sagebrush
(Artemisia tridentata), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), or
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  In California it occurs in
riparian forests as a codominant with red alder (Alnus rubra), black
cottonwood, and Oregon ash (Fraxinus latifolia) [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Published
classification schemes listing Pacific willow as an indicator or
dominant in community types (cts), habitat types (hts), riparian site
types (rst), or dominance types (dts) are presented below:

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix lasiandra
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>



<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Pacific willow provides food and cover for many wildlife species [<a href="#17">17</a>].
Willows (Salix spp.) in general are a preferred food of moose, and
Pacific willow occurs in riparian and floodplain habitats which these
animals frequent [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  It is a fairly important browse for mule deer
[<a href="#43">43</a>].  In Oregon, it is consumed heavily by beaver in the winter [<a href="#20">20</a>].
Although cattle will eat it, stands provide limited value for livestock
overall, as forage production of grasses and shrubs is often low due to
frequent flooding [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
In the West, willows are generally considered to be more palatable to
sheep than to cattle, but cattle may make greater use of willow because
they tend to frequent riparian areas [<a href="#41">41</a>].  The palatability of Pacific
willow to livestock and wildlife species in California and Oregon has
been rated as follows [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>]:

                CA    OR
Cattle         poor  ----
Sheep          poor  ----
Horses         poor  ----
Deer           fair  ----
Beaver         ----  good


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Pacific willow provides cover for numerous wildlife species [<a href="#3">3</a>].  It is
especially important for deer and nongame birds [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>].  In California,
nests of the endangered Least Bell's Vireo are commonly found in Pacific
willow branches [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Pacific willow's ability to rapidly colonize disturbed sites makes it
very useful for streambank stabilization projects.  Cuttings are used
for revegetating disturbed riparian areas.  Unrooted willow stem
cuttings (slips) should be planted on sites that provide sufficient
moisture to start and maintain growth through the growing season [<a href="#44">44</a>].
Slips should be obtained from local native stands.  Since willows are
sensitive to competition and shading, dense tall grasses will reduce
transplant survival [<a href="#33">33</a>] and may need to be removed by cutting or by
herbicide application [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Although harder to plant, rooted stock is
recommended for use because it has higher survival rates [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].
Cuttings should should be planted to a depth of 12 inches (30 cm), with
8 inches (20 cm) left above ground [<a href="#33">33</a>].  This deep planting allows for
more rooting surface to extract soil moisture, and higher amounts of
carbohydrates as stored food reserves [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Pacific willow cuttings
root along the entire length of the stem, with roots appearing in about
10 days [<a href="#33">33</a>].  If streambank erosion has created a nearly vertical cut
bank, slope reshaping may be needed to enhance success of transplants.
Reshaping is not necessary if, through protective measures, existing
vegetation is able to stabilize the site [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  High density willow
plantings (cuttings planted on 18 inch [45 cm] centers) used to
stabilize eroded stream banks in the Pacific Northwest cost about
$6,000/acre ($14,800/ha) in 1979 [<a href="#24">24</a>].  This was a considerable savings
compared to a 20-foot (6 m) high rock riprap at about $40,000/acre
($98,800/ha).  Under any method of revegetation, sites should be fenced
to protect them from grazing and trampling.

The Alaska Plant Materials Center has released the cultivar 'Roland' for
revegetation and landscape projects [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
All willows produce salicin, which chemically is closely related to
acetylsalicylic acid, commonly known as aspirin.  This is probably why
Native Americans used various preparations from willows to treat
toothache, stomach ache, diarrhea, dysentery, and dandruff [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Native
Americans also used the stems for basketry and bow making, and the bark
for tea and fabric making [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Pacific willow is excellent for use in
screening, windbreaks, and landscaping [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In Montana, overuse by livestock causes Pacific willow to lose vigor and
causes soil compaction problems.  Loss of vigor is indicated by uneven
stem age distribution, highlining, clumped appearance, or dead clumps.
With continued overuse, plants may be replaced by Woods rose (Rosa
woodsii) and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis).  Bare ground resulting
from livestock overuse may be vulnerable to erosion during flooding
[<a href="#18">18</a>].  Pacific willow stands helps stabilize streambanks and protect
them from erosion and therefore should be maintained.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix lasiandra
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Pacific willow is larger than most other willows, reaching 20 to 60 feet
(6-18 m) in height at maturity [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Main stems reach 2.5 to 7.5 inches
(10-30 cm) in diameter [<a href="#8">8</a>], with very brittle wood [<a href="#2">2</a>].  In Montana and
Idaho Pacific willow reaches tree size at lower elevations but is found
as a short, several-stemmed shrub at higher elevations [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].
Staminate and pistillate flowers occur on separate plants in catkins.
Staminate and pistillate catkin lengths vary greatly, ranging from
0.6-2.7 inches (1.5-7 cm) for staminate catkins, and 0.8-2.7 inches (2-7
cm) for pistillate catkins [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  The fruit is a glabrous capsule
0.15-0.3 inch (4-8 mm) long and turn from green to yellowish at maturity
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].

Due to their morphological similarities, Pacific willow may be mistaken
or confused with peachleaf willow (Salix amygdaloides).  Differences in
their bud scales may be used to distinguish them [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Pacific willow
has bud scales without free overlapping margins and are rounded at the
tip, while peachleaf willow has bud scales with free overlapping
margins, and are pointed at the tip.  

Characteristics used to distinguish varieties include [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>]:

var. caudata - leaves nonglaucous beneath
var. lancifolia - leaves glaucous beneath, branchlets densely pubescent
var. lasiandra - leaves glaucous beneath, branchlets glabrous
var. recomponens - leaves green beneath, branchlets pubescent


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Mesophanerophyte
   Undisturbed State:  Microphanerophyte
   Undisturbed State:  Nanophanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
The dispersal of thousands of small windblown seeds is Pacific willow's
primary mode of reproduction.  It can also reproduce vegetatively.
Broken pieces of stem are transported and deposited on moist alluvium by
floodwaters, and later sprout [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Pacific willow has very brittle
branches, making this form of reproduction important in initial
colonization of some disturbed areas, but seeding still seems to be more
important [<a href="#47">47</a>].  Pacific willow is unable to produce sucker shoots from
lateral roots but will probably resprout from its root crown or stem
base following fire or cutting [2,16,47.

Plants are dioecious.  After fertilization, a capsule develops which
eventually splits open during spring or summer, dispersing numerous tiny
seeds [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Seeds are transported by wind and water.  The seeds are not
dormant and germinate rapidly, usually within 12 to 24 hours of
dispersal if a moist seedbed is reached [<a href="#10">10</a>].  The seeds contain
significant amounts of chlorophyll, and photosynthesis generally occurs
as soon as the seed is moistened.  Germination rates increase with
increased amounts of light [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Pacific willow is typically found at low to mid elevations and
immediately adjacent to a stream's or river's edge [8,17,18,].  Sites
typically have a high water table year-round.

Soils:  Soils are normally coarse-textured alluvial deposits of sand or
gravel [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>] but textures range from sandy to clayey.

Associates:  In the Rocky Mountains Pacific willow is commonly found
with black cottonwood, yellow willow (Salix lutea), sandbar willow (S.
exugua), Woods rose, and redosier dogwood (Cornus sericea) at lower
elevations [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  At middle elevations it is commonly found with Booth
willow (Salix boothii), Drummond willow (S. drummondiana), and thinleaf
alder (Alnus incana ssp. tenuifolia) [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].

Elevation:  Elevational ranges for several western states are given
below [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]:
 
        below 8,000 feet (2,438 m) in CA
        below 6,500 feet (1,980 m) in east central ID
        from 3,000 to 5,400 feet (914-1,646 m) in sw MT
        from 5,000 to 7,000 feet (1,525-2,650 m) in UT 
        from 4,500 to 8,500 feet (1,372-2,590 m) in WY


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Pacific willow is a pioneer or early seral species commonly found on
fresh alluvium [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Repeated flooding allows stands to persist [<a href="#18">18</a>].
Stands help stabilize the sand or gravel deposit, and in the absence of
disturbance other communities of cottonwoods (Populus spp.) and willows
establish and eventually replace it [<a href="#18">18</a>].  In California Pacific willow
was a pioneer on mine spoils deposited along dredged streams [<a href="#146">146</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Pacific willow is a deciduous tree.  Flowers in the spring appear with
the leaves.  After fruits ripen, seeds are dispersed from spring to
early summer [<a href="#7">7</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix lasiandra
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Most willows in all stages of vigor resprout from the root crown or stem
base following fire [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  However, the specific sprouting
capabilities of Pacific willow are not known [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Its numerous wind
dispersed seeds are important in revegetating areas following fire
[<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].

Fires usually occur infrequently in the streamside habitats occupied by
Pacific willow [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by wind; postfire years one and two
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by animals or water; postfire yr 1&2

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix lasiandra
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Severe fires can completely remove organic soil layers leaving willow
roots exposed and charred, thus eliminating basal sprouting [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].
However, severe fires probably occur infrequently in the moist habitats
occupied by Pacific willow.  Specific information regarding the effects
of fire on Pacific willow is lacking.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
The postfire sprouting capabilities of Pacific willow are not known
[<a href="#17">17</a>].  However, most willows sprout following fire [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Pacific willow
is a prolific seeder, and off-site plants are important as a seed source
for revegetating burned areas [<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Vegetatative sampling following three summer wildfires in the North
Cascades National Park complex showed that Pacific willow frequency and
cover increased dramatically due to the establishment of numerous
seedlings.  Values were as follows [<a href="#28">28</a>]:

           Postfire year 1     Postfire year 2     Postfire year 4
           % Freq  % Cover     % Freq  % Cover     % Freq  % Cover

Burn #1       0       0         44       trace       92      2.8
Burn #2       0       0         34.8       .4        86.9    5.1
Burn #3       0       0         97        8.9        97      16.2

Maximum height of these Pacific willow seedlings was 18 inches (45 cm)
during postfire year 2, 49 inches (125 cm) during postfire year 3, and
79 inches (200 cm) during postfire year 4 [<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Pacific willow usually occurs along streambanks which frequently act as
natural firebreaks [<a href="#9">9</a>].
