The currently accepted scientific name of bull thistle is <i>Cirsium vulgare</i>
(Savi) Tenore (Asteraceae)
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#136">136</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#160">160</a>,<a href="#161">161</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>,<a href="#166">166</a>].



<p>Bull thistle exhibits variation in several morphological characteristics that
have been described as subspecies by some authors; however, the Flora Europaea
does not recognize these taxa because they lack sufficient morphological or
geographical delimitation [<a href="#50">50</a>]. Several hybrids of bull
thistle have been described in Europe, and 1 suggested in California. See
reviews by Klinkhamer and deJong [<a href="#80">80</a>] and Forcella and Randall [<a href="#50">50</a>] for more
information.</p>

At the time of this writing (2002), bull thistle is classified as a noxious,
restricted, or prohibited weed or weed seed in&nbsp;10 states in the United States
and&nbsp;2 Canadian provinces [<a href="#154">154</a>].

GENERAL DISTRIBUTION:</a>
</span>
<br />


The origin, distribution and spread of bull thistle are reviewed by
Beck [<a href="#15">15</a>], Mitich [<a href="#106">106</a>] and Forcella and Randall [<a href="#50">50</a>]. The following is a summary from these
reviews. Bull thistle is native to Europe, from Britain and Iberia northward
to Scandinavia, eastward to western Asia, and southward to northern Africa [<a href="#50">50</a>].
It is
found on every continent except Antarctica, although its distribution is confined mostly to the northern and southern temperate
zones. Bull thistle is not
native to North America. It is thought to have been introduced to eastern North
America during colonial times, and to western North America in scattered locations in
the late 1800s and early 1900s. Bull thistle is now common throughout the
Pacific States, and it
is the most common and widespread of pasture and rangeland thistles in western North America. The <a href="https://plants.usda.gov/">Plants</a>
database provides a distribution map of bull thistle in the United States.

<p> Although
bull thistle has been reported in all 50 states and most Canadian provinces [<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>], it usually is not
considered as problematic as musk thistle (<i>Carduus nutans</i>) or Scotch
thistle (<i>Onopordum acanthium</i>) [<a href="#15">15</a>].&nbsp;Bull thistle is most troublesome in recently or
repeatedly disturbed areas such as pastures, overgrazed rangelands, forest
clearcuts, and waste places; and along roads, ditches, and fences. It is also a problem in some
natural areas such as Yosemite National Park, California [<a href="#50">50</a>].</p>


<p>
 The following lists reflect ecosystems and cover types in which bull thistle
 may be invasive. Because it is so widespread and has broad ecological
 tolerances, it is difficult to exclude many ecosystems as potential hosts of
 bull thistle plants or populations.</p>

Bull thistle is widespread and occurs in many types of plant communities in
North America. A comprehensive treatment of plant communities in which it occurs
is not available. The following discussion provides examples of plant
communities associated with bull thistle that have been mentioned in the
literature.

<p> In the Pacific Northwest, bull thistle occurs on foothills and in dry
meadows [<a href="#69">69</a>]. It occurs in riparian areas, clearcuts, and alder (<i>Alnus</i> spp.) flats
in the western hemlock-Sitka spruce (<i>Tsuga heterophylla-Picea
sitchensis</i>) zones on Olympic Peninsula in Washington [<a href="#35">35</a>].
Bull thistle also occurs in riparian areas and in ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>)
communities on preserves in northeastern Oregon [<a href="#129">129</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Intermountain region, bull thistle occurs primarily in disturbed
habitats and in seepage areas or along streams [<a href="#28">28</a>]. It often establishes after disturbance (logging with and without
burning) in grand fir (<i>Abies grandis</i>), Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga
menziesii</i>), and ponderosa pine forests in Idaho [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>], Oregon [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>], and Montana [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].&nbsp;Bull thistle often establishes after timber harvest with
and without burning in western hemlock, western redcedar (<i>Thuja plicata</i>), and grand fir
forests in northern Idaho [<a href="#72">72</a>]; and in grand fir and subalpine fir (<i>Abies lasiocarpa</i>) forests in western Montana [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. Bull thistle is also invasive
in grasslands on Thousand Springs Preserve in Idaho [<a href="#129">129</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bull thistle is found on tallgrass prairie sites on preserves in South Dakota
[<a href="#129">129</a>]. In Michigan, bull thistle may establish after logging in oak-hickory (<i>Quercus-Carya</i> spp.)
and maple (<i>Acer</i> spp.)-oak forests [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>]. Here it may also establish after fire or
ground disturbance such as bulldozing, and can also invade natural communities adjacent to disturbed habitats
[<a href="#157">157</a>]. In Minnesota, bull thistle established after
full-tree logging&nbsp; in a balsam fir-paper birch (<i>Abies balsamea</i>-<i>Betula
papyrifera</i>) community [<a href="#113">113</a>].</p>

Bull thistle often establishes in Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forests after clearcutting
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>]. It is also an important understory species in tanoak (<i>Lithocarpus
densiflorus</i>) forests in California and Oregon [<a href="#149">149</a>].

The following description is based on reviews by Beck [<a href="#15">15</a>], Klinkhamer and de Jong
[<a href="#80">80</a>]
and Forcella and Randall [<a href="#50">50</a>]. It presents characteristics
of bull thistle that may be relevant to fire ecology,
and is not meant to be used for identification. Keys for identifying bull
thistle are available (e.g. [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#161">161</a>]). A detailed description of the
biology of bull thistle is
given by Klinkhamer and de Jong [<a href="#80">80</a>].

<p>Bull thistle is a
biennial, and sometimes annual or monocarpic perennial, forb. In the juvenile phase,
individual bull thistle plants form a single
rosette with a taproot up to 28 inches (70 cm) long. Rosettes may develop up to 3.3 feet (1 m) in diameter. The taproot does not 
spread, but develops several smaller lateral
roots. Stems have
spiny wings and grow 1 to 6.6 feet (0.3 to 2 m) tall, with many spreading branches,
and sometimes a single stem. Bull thistle stem leaves are more or less lance-shaped and 3 to
12 inches (7.6-30 cm) long, prickly hairy on the top and very hairy underneath.
Lobes on leaves are
tipped with stout spines. Bull thistle flowerheads are 1.5 to 2 inches (3.8 to 5 cm) in
diameter, 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) long, usually solitary, and more or less
clustered at the ends of shoots and branches. Flowers are subtended by narrow,
spine-tipped bracts. Bull thistle fruits are achenes, 1/16th-inch (0.15 cm) long, with a long,
hairy plume that is easily
detached.</p>

<p>The litter of <i> Cirsium</i> species is said to inhibit the growth of other
plants. In bull thistle, this is probably a result of the
immobilization of nutrients during the process of litter breakdown [<a href="#80">80</a>]. Descriptions of mycorrhizal associations in bull thistle
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>] and their positive effects on its growth [<a href="#163">163</a>] are available.</p>

A detailed description of reproductive and vegetative biology of bull thistle in
New Zealand is provided by Michaux [<a href="#103">103</a>].

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Breeding system:</b></font>  
Bull thistle reproduces and spreads entirely from
seeds [<a href="#80">80</a>]. Bull thistle flowers are bisexual [<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>]. While there is some evidence of self-pollination,
selfing may result only
in hollow seeds; therefore, bull thistle may require cross-pollination to set
fertile seed. Only those plants that flower during the
main flowering
period, or where plants are growing in sufficient density, will contribute
substantially to the following generation [<a href="#103">103</a>]. Klinkhamer and de Jong [<a href="#80">80</a>] report that self-pollinated plants produce a smaller
number of large seeds than do cross-pollinated individuals. A review by Forcella and Randall
[<a href="#50">50</a>], however,
indicates that heavy seeds may be produced through self-pollination, and that these
seeds can establish at high rates and enable isolated plants to begin new
populations.

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Pollination:</b></font>
Bull thistle flowers produce abundant nectar
[<a href="#122">122</a>] and require pollinators for effective pollination
[<a href="#103">103</a>]. A wide variety of insects pollinate
bull thistle [<a href="#106">106</a>]. Pollinators of bull thistle in New Zealand include
honey bees, bumble bees, flower flies and various other adult Lepidoptera,
Thysanoptera, and Hymenoptera [<a href="#103">103</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed production:</font></b>  
Bull thistle plants produce about 100 to 300 or
more seeds per flowerhead under favorable
conditions, and anywhere from 1 to over 400 flowerheads per plant [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>]. Variability in production of seeds per
flowerhead and flowerheads per plant yields a wide range in number of seeds
produced per plant. Bull thistle seed production can also vary considerably among years
and
within populations [<a href="#79">79</a>]. Size of mature bull thistle plants, timing of flowering and
environmental conditions can influence seed production.</p>

<p>The number of viable seeds produced by a bull thistle plant varies with its overall
size [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>], which is, in turn, influenced by
competition, site conditions, and herbivory [<a href="#50">50</a>]. Seed production and seedling establishment are
often enhanced
under disturbed conditions, which create open, habitable sites for invasive
species [<a href="#15">15</a>]. A comparison of bull thistle demography in grazed and
ungrazed pastures in Australia found that plants produced nearly 3 times as much
seed on average in heavily grazed pasture (33 flowerheads per plant and 198
seeds per flowerhead) compared to ungrazed pasture (19 flowerheads per plant and
149 seeds per flowerhead) when averaged over 3 years [<a href="#49">49</a>].
Bull thistle seed production on Dutch coastal dunes was much lower
than that recorded in an experimental garden, and was positively correlated
with July rainfall. Seed and
stem predation contributed to losses of 95% to over 99% in seed production on coastal
dunes [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].</p>

<p>Time of flowering also affects total seed production in bull thistle. Seed production is highest
in flowerheads that bloom during the peak of flowering at a particular location.
At this time, more flowers are available for cross-pollination, and
pollinators are most active [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>]. Forcella and Randall
[<a href="#50">50</a>] suggest that a&nbsp;lack of sufficient photosynthate and nutrients during aging
can
decrease seed production substantially.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed dispersal:</b></font>   
Bull thistle seeds are equipped with a feathery
pappus that is suited to wind dispersal, although it is unclear how effective this
dispersal mechanism is. Several researchers (e.g. [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>]) cite instances where bull thistle
established after disturbance, possibly from wind-dispersed seed, unless bull
thistle plants established from
seed carried by animals or human activities or from seed stored in soil (see &quot;Seed banking&quot; section below).</p> 

<p>
Michaux [<a href="#103">103</a>] notes that the pappus readily detaches from bull thistle seed at maturity, so
a majority of
seeds (91%) fall within a distance of 1.5 times the height of the parent plant. This
explains the dense pattern of seedlings near the parent plant often observed in the field
[<a href="#103">103</a>].&nbsp;On coastal dunes in the Netherlands,
seeds landing within 3, 7, and 106 feet (1, 2, and 32 m) of
parent plants represented 50, 66, and 90% of those observed. The remaining 10%
reached higher air levels and dispersed to unknown distances greater than 106
feet (32 m) [<a href="#79">79</a>]. Based on weight, size,
shape, fall speed, and lateral movement of bull thistle achenes in still air, the estimated lateral
dispersal
distance in a 6-mile-per-hour (10 km/hour) breeze is 38 feet (11.6 m) [<a href="#94">94</a>]. These studies suggest that wind dispersal is an
inefficient mechanism for the majority of bull thistle seed, even under ideal
conditions. However, up to 10% of seeds produced may travel
distances of more than 90 feet (27 m), even on days with little wind [<a href="#122">122</a>],
thus providing opportunities for establishment of new populations.</p> 

<p>Rapid migration of bull
thistle across large geographical regions is probably the result of human
activities including movement of livestock, vehicles, farm machines, and
plant products (such as
seed and hay) [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>]. Reviews by Mitich [<a href="#106">106</a>] and Beck [<a href="#15">15</a>] also suggest that bull thistle seeds may be carried by water
and animals.</p> 

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Seed banking: </font></b>
Evidence for seed banking in bull thistle varies.
Numerous examples of bull thistle establishment following disturbance suggest
either long-distance seed dispersal or seed stored in the soil.&nbsp;Reviews by Doucet and Cavers
[<a href="#41">41</a>], Michaux [<a href="#103">103</a>],
and Forcella and Randall [<a href="#50">50</a>] indicate that bull thistle is characterized as
having either a transient or a very small persistent seed bank. Doucet and Cavers
[<a href="#41">41</a>]
note that studies concluding that bull thistle has a short-lived seed
bank (e.g. [<a href="#79">79</a>]) only consider seeds located on or near the soil surface, and that seeds buried at least 6 inches (15 cm)
may have over 50%
viability 3 years after burial. Bull thistle seeds at or near the soil surface either germinate or are
destroyed by rodents, insects, or microbes [<a href="#79">79</a>]. Those buried at greater depths appear to
experience an induced dormancy, and decay
more slowly with increasing depth [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>]. A seed bank at
6 inches (15 cm) or
deeper will not maintain a bull thistle population from year to year, but it could provide seeds that would re-establish the population after
major physical disturbance of the soil [<a href="#41">41</a>]. In noncultivated areas, however, bull thistle
seeds are not usually buried to great depths.</p>

<p> To form a persistent seed bank,
bull thistle seeds would have to exhibit some form of dormancy that would enable
them to remain viable at or near the surface of the soil without germinating [<a href="#41">41</a>]. Klinkhamer and de Jong
[<a href="#80">80</a>] state that maintaining bull thistle
seeds in an imbibed state in darkness induces dormancy. This suggests that in densely vegetated
habitats it is possible that bull thistle seeds may become dormant and remain viable without
germinating.&nbsp; </p>

<p> Bull thistle seeds from 2 populations in Ontario established a persistent seed bank when
buried 6 inches (15 cm). After storage on the soil
surface or at 1-inch (3 cm) depth, bull thistle seeds in sandy soil on an open site did not persist beyond 6
months. In contrast, 2 to 14% of bull thistle seeds stored in shaded conditions in a clay loam soil
maintained viability for 30 months at the surface and at 1 inch below the
surface, with no decline
in the number of viable seeds over time, suggesting an induced dormancy [<a href="#41">41</a>]. Induced dormancy
might also explain why, although bull thistle was not present in the vegetation
of 40- to 60-year-old,
closed canopy forest understories in
low-elevation forest on the Olympic Peninsula, it germinated from both litter and soil
samples when placed in a greenhouse. This result suggests that bull thistle will
establish on these sites following overstory removal [<a href="#61">61</a>]. </p>

<p>Evidence provided by Doucet
and Cavers [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>], and by greenhouse studies in which bull thistle emerged from
litter and soil samples from forested sites with little to no bull thistle cover
[<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#146">146</a>], supports
the possibility of a small persistent seed bank in bull thistle. There are also
numerous examples of bull thistle's early seral
dominance after disturbances such as harvesting [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>],
burning [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>], or both [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>], although it is not clear
from these studies whether bull thistle
established from buried seed or from seed dispersed from an off-site source. </p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Germination: </b></font>
Bull thistle seed viability is
generally high, and may vary between 60 and 90%
[<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>] or more [<a href="#122">122</a>]. Reviews by Michaux [<a href="#103">103</a>] and Klinkhamer
and de Jong [<a href="#80">80</a>] indicate that bull thistle seeds have little innate dormancy and germinate rapidly after
imbibition, while a review by Beck [<a href="#15">15</a>] indicates that 60 to 75% of bull thistle
seeds may be dormant at maturity, but up to 90% may germinate within a year.&nbsp;A
review by Forcella and Randall [<a href="#50">50</a>] indicates that the
timing of emergence of bull thistle seedlings results from the interaction of
dormancy mechanisms, soil temperature, and rainfall patterns and will, therefore,
vary by site and regional characteristics. Cavers and others [<a href="#24">24</a>] discuss the pattern of
germination in bull thistle over time. Germination of bull thistle seeds is affected by moisture,
light availability, gap size, and temperature.</p> 


<p> Germination of bull thistle
seeds typically occurs in spring
or fall in response to adequate soil moisture [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>]. Bull thistle seed germination is less sensitive
to low water potential than that of several other thistle species. The
relative germination of bull thistle seeds decreased linearly from 100% at 0 MPa to 10% at -0.75
MPa
[<a href="#58">58</a>]. In Dutch sand dunes the number
of emerging seedlings in spring was related to both soil
moisture and soil nitrate levels, implying that, combined with
temperature, these 2 factors help to regulate seed germination [<a href="#33">33</a>]. Downs and
Cavers [<a href="#43">43</a>] found that germination rate in bull thistle was
reduced after exposure to 2 or more cycles of wetting and drying, and that total
percent germination was reduced after exposure to 8 cycles of wetting and
drying. This evidence supports the idea that bull thistle seeds may acquire an
induced dormancy through exposure to cycles of wetting and drying such as can be experienced in the uppermost layers of
soil.&nbsp;</p> 


<p> Germination rate of bull thistle seeds tends to decrease as light decreases
[<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>]. Doucet and Cavers [<a href="#42">42</a>] report that fresh bull thistle seeds are capable of germinating in either
alternating light and dark or constant dark conditions under favorable diurnal temperatures of
77/50 degrees Fahrenheit (25/10 ï¿½C). In a laboratory study, seeds were stored
over winter at 41 degrees Fahrenheit (5 ï¿½C) in either alternating light and dark, or
in constant darkness. Seeds treated with alternating
light and dark did
not require light for germination when placed under optimal temperatures,
whereas seeds
treated with constant
darkness did require additional light for germination. In the field, seeds that do not germinate in the fall and then spend the winter in darkness (e.g.
in deep shade, under leaves, or buried by ants, earthworms or other animals) can acquire
this induced
dormancy and be prevented from germinating. Such seeds have the potential of forming a persistent seed bank
[<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>]. Light requirement for germination of bull thistle seeds is also evidenced by
higher germination rates in large (4-8 inches (10-20 cm)) gaps than in smaller gaps (Silvertown and Smith 1989, as cited by
[<a href="#80">80</a>]). Bull thistle is dependent on canopy gaps for seedling emergence and
establishment [<a href="#20">20</a>].</p> 


<p>Bull thistle seeds germinate well over a wide range of temperatures [<a href="#50">50</a>].
Germination of bull thistle seeds is reduced if the temperature is
outside the range of 50 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (10-30 ï¿½C). Fresh seeds have higher optimum temperature
for germination than stored
seeds [<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seedling establishment/growth:</b></font>  
Bull thistle seedling establishment is
favored by soil disturbance and seedling growth is favored by vegetation
disturbance. The absolute growth of bull thistle seedlings is very low for 2 months after sowing, even under ideal
conditions [<a href="#50">50</a>]. Transition from seedlings to
rosettes is when the greatest attrition in bull thistle populations typically
occurs [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>]. Bull thistle seedlings have higher survival rates under
high nutrient conditions [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].</p>

<p>Bull thistle establishes
better in grazed versus ungrazed pasture. About 15% and 10% of seeds from grazed and ungrazed pastures, respectively,
produced seedlings, and the average survival of seedlings in grazed and ungrazed
pastures was 1% and 0.2% respectively. Fifty percent of rosettes in both pasture
types survived and grew into adults [<a href="#49">49</a>]. An annual census of 2 bull thistle-infested meadows in
Yosemite National Park found that seedlings accounted for about 85% of deaths observed,
13% of mortality was rosettes, and less than 2% of mortality was due to individuals that died
after flowering [<a href="#121">121</a>]. On Dutch coastal dunes, bull thistle seedling
mortality is related to soil moisture content and tends to be high, with only
23 to 47% of seedlings surviving from spring
to autumn. Yearly death of rosettes varies between 10 and
69%, with the chance of dying inversely
related to rosette size [<a href="#80">80</a>].&nbsp;Bull thistle rosettes
that are top-killed under dry or cold stress in the 1st season can grow again from the
root crown during late
winter or spring [<a href="#106">106</a>].</p>

Bull thistle is a very
widespread weed that can grow in a wide range of environments but is most troublesome in recently or repeatedly disturbed areas
such as pastures, overgrazed rangelands, recently burned forests and forest
clearcuts, and along roads, ditches, and fences. Even small-scale disturbances
such as gopher mounds promote bull thistle establishment and survival [<a href="#122">122</a>], and
density tends to increase as grazing intensity
increases. Bull thistle is seldom found in
ungrazed prairies and pastures [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>]. Similarly, in
Yosemite
National Park bull thistle germination was promoted by removal of vegetation and further
promoted by soil disturbance [<a href="#120">120</a>]. Bull thistle can
also colonize areas in relatively undisturbed grasslands, meadows and forest
openings [<a href="#122">122</a>].&nbsp;<p>The distribution
of bull thistle in Eurasia is closely linked to that of cultivated land. In the
U.S., bull thistle is common in regions with intensive cattle commerce. In Canada, it is
present in agricultural areas but absent from prairies [<a href="#80">80</a>]. In California, bull thistle is widespread and most common in coastal grasslands, along edges of fresh
and
brackish marshes, in meadows, and in mesic forest openings in the mountains [<a href="#122">122</a>]. Landscape patch types where bull thistle was found on the Olympic Peninsula
in Washington include riparian cobble bars, riparian shrub communities, and
clearcuts [<a href="#35">35</a>].

<p>Bull thistle is found on dry and wet soils, but is most common on soils with intermediate moisture [<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>].
It is largely absent from deeply
shaded and waterlogged habitats.&nbsp;Bull thistle tolerates a wide range of pH values,
though it is rare on soils
of pH &lt;4.8-5.0 [<a href="#80">80</a>]. It proliferates in pastures subject to
nitrogen fertilization [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>], but has no apparent
relationship with potassium or phosphorus content. Bull thistle is less common in sand
and on soils of &gt;30% humus content, and almost absent from pure clay [<a href="#80">80</a>].</p>

<p> Bull thistle is found as far north as
67ï¿½50' N latitude in Scandinavia.&nbsp;In shade, bull thistle is
restricted to south-facing slopes. In dry habitats such as coastal dunes it
is confined to north-facing slopes [<a href="#80">80</a>].&nbsp;It has been suggested that bull thistle plants are not very
invasive in the southern part of its North American range. This has been attributed to a peculiarity in their dispersal
biology, where the achenes remain enclosed
inside the seedheads after they are fully mature and are released only at the
end of the season when the whole plant eventually falls over. Numerous achenes
then germinate in situ in a cluster, but apparently only 1 of them survives to
maturity [<a href="#112">112</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infestations of bull thistle in North America have been reported as high as
9,200 feet (2,800 m) [<a href="#37">37</a>]. Bull thistle was found on alpine sites in Utah [<a href="#65">65</a>], and on a subalpine riparian site in Montana [<a href="#91">91</a>]. The following table provides some elevational ranges for
bull thistle by state:</p>

Bull thistle is an early successional species that establishes well in open,
disturbed sites, and is an important weed in clearcuts
and conifer plantations in the western U.S. [<a href="#128">128</a>]. Examples where bull thistle is reported as an early successional component and
sometimes
dominant after timber harvest (with and without burning) include studies in California
[<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>], Oregon [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>], Idaho
[<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>], Montana [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>], and Michigan
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].
Bull thistle is 1 of several species of Asteraceae that often become prolific
immediately after fire in southern Tasmania, Australia [<a href="#10">10</a>], and was a
common component in study plots following wildfire and suppression efforts in
Glacier National Park in the fall of 1988 [<a href="#16">16</a>]. Bull thistle
was also among the pioneering species in primary
successional habitats on Mount St. Helens following the eruption in 1980 [<a href="#150">150</a>].
It is a common component on repeatedly disturbed sites such as roadsides [<a href="#114">114</a>] and grazed pastures. In
Australia bull thistle populations persisted for 4 years
in grazed pasture but declined in ungrazed pasture, suggesting that grazing
allowed bull thistle populations to thrive [<a href="#49">49</a>].


<p>Populations of
bull thistle tend to be short lived, establishing after disturbance, dominating for a few years, and then
declining as other vegetation recovers [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#155">155</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>]. Few
bull thistle plants can be found in
undisturbed clearcuts and plantations older than 8 years [<a href="#128">128</a>],
although some plants may remain for longer periods. After clearcutting of subalpine fir in western Montana, bull
thistle cover peaked after 3 years, was still present after 17 years, but was not present
on undisturbed
sites or 1-year-old cuts [<a href="#92">92</a>]. Bull
thistle was present 7 to 16 years after clearcutting in grand fir in western
Montana, but absent from adjacent uncut forest [<a href="#2">2</a>]. Bull thistle was the most frequent
species observed 6 to 9 years after clearcutting in Sierra Nevada mixed conifer [<a href="#1">1</a>].&nbsp;The&nbsp; peak distribution of bull thistle in German
old fields
is 3 to 4 years following disturbance [<a href="#80">80</a>].&nbsp;Specific patterns of succession are described for
Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine forests in California and Oregon [<a href="#98">98</a>] and for
burned Douglas-fir clearcuts in the Coast range of western Oregon, where bull thistle
is the dominant species the 2nd year after clearcutting [<a href="#131">131</a>].</p>

<p>
True biennials are uncommon or absent in late successional plant communities because they
often need abundant light for establishment [<a href="#50">50</a>]. Doucet and Cavers [<a href="#41">41</a>] note
that bull
thistle is absent from densely shaded areas. A review
by Klinkhamer and de Jong [<a href="#80">80</a>] indicates that bull thistle is almost absent if light is
reduced to less than 40% of full sunlight. Bull thistle
invasion is enhanced in pastures with decreased vegetative cover [<a href="#49">49</a>].&nbsp;In a greenhouse experiment, bull thistle germination was not suppressed by
sedge (<i>Carex</i> spp.) cover, but subsequent survival of seedlings was
reduced and the percentage of seeds that germinated and
survived decreased exponentially with increasing cover [<a href="#121">121</a>].&nbsp;In Dutch
coastal dunes, however, bull thistle was more restricted to shaded sites [<a href="#34">34</a>].</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT">
SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Bull thistle plants usually release seed in late summer and early autumn.
Germination may occur
shortly after the onset of autumn rains or in spring when soil temperatures
rise. An individual bull thistle plant produces a small rosette of spiny leaves
and a fleshy taproot by the end of its
1st year, and generally overwinters in this form. In its 2nd growing season the
rosette typically enlarges rapidly, bolts, and produces a flowering stalk.
Flowering occurs from mid to late summer, but inflorescences can be
seen until the 1st frost or snowfall in autumn [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>]. Outer
florets mature first, and the innermost last [<a href="#103">103</a>]. The
time interval between bolting and seed maturation
decreases as temperature increases [<a href="#50">50</a>].

<p>Seed dispersal immediately follows maturation [<a href="#49">49</a>]. Individual flowers last for only a few days before the floral tissue
wilts and the involucre bracts turn brown and open out -- the time taken depends on
relative humidity. The pappus is thus exposed to air currents, and the innermost seeds are dispersed 1st
as the receptacle arches upwards. A single plant may remain in a flowering state anywhere
from 1 to 6
weeks, depending on the number of flowers. A population of bull thistle in New
Zealand flowered for a total of 5 months [<a href="#103">103</a>]. Bull thistle plants are monocarpic, dying after they set seed
[<a href="#50">50</a>]. Dead plants can remain standing for 1 or 2 years.</p>

<p> Bull thistle requires a <a href="../../../glossary.html#VERNALIZATION:">vernalization</a>  period before bolting. 
There is no size requirement for vernalization; however, plants need to attain a certain size
after vernalization to bolt and flower. Some plants (about 1%) may flower
without vernalization, and this may vary with location [<a href="#80">80</a>]. At Yosemite
National Park, 2 individuals less than a year old flowered in
September [<a href="#121">121</a>].&nbsp;Evidence presented by Wesselingh and others [<a href="#162">162</a>] suggests a geographical variation in
the vernalization requirement among European populations of bull thistle, based
on observations of a latitudinal gradient in vernalization
requirement in other biennials. In a common garden experiment,
bull thistle plants from southern Europe tended to exhibit an annual habit,
bolting and flowering without vernalization. Those from northern
populations acted as biennials, flowering after vernalization in their 2nd year. It is
unknown if these plants exhibit annual or biennial life cycles at their place of origin. Klinkhamer
and others [<a href="#79">79</a>] indicate that bull thistle plants may behave
as winter annuals if they germinate in fall, are vernalized over winter, and
grow luxuriantly in early spring. Plants behave as monocarpic
perennials when growth was stunted because of conditions such as infertile soils and
inclement weather [<a href="#50">50</a>].</p>

<br />

Bull thistle reproduces by abundant seed, some of which may disperse over
moderate distances by wind and some of which may remain dormant in the soil for
several years (research thus far suggests up to 5) . Fire creates conditions that are
favorable for establishment (i.e. open canopy, reduced competition, areas of bare soil), so if
bull thistle seeds are present and competition minimal, bull thistle may be favored in
the postfire community. This is supported by several examples of bull thistles
establishment within a few years after fire [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. More research
is needed regarding adaptations of bull thistle to fire.<p>Bull thistle is the most common and widespread thistle of pastures and rangelands
in western North America, so it occurs in a large number of ecosystems with
different fire regimes. 
Introduced species can alter the rate of fire spread, the probability of fire occurrence, and the intensity of fire in an ecosystem [<a href="#30">30</a>]. It is unclear how the 
presence of bull thistle alters
the fire regime of a given site, and it is unclear how a historical fire regime
might affect the presence or abundance of bull thistle at a given site. Dominant
species of forest communities in which bull thistle has been noted as a primary or secondary
colonizer after disturbance are described in the 
<a href="distribution_and_occurrence.html#habitat types and plant communities">Habitat Types and Plant Communities</a> 
section of this report. Bull thistle also occurs
in tallgrass prairie ecosystems, where fire can stimulate flowering of native
grasses [<a href="#31">31</a>]. In Kansas,
frequent burning of tallgrass prairie is said to be effective in keeping out exotic
plants on sites where prairie grasses are vigorous [<a href="#70">70</a>]. Bull thistle did not occur in
any of these communities at the time in which
historic fire
regimes were functioning, but has established since fire exclusion began. It is
unclear how the presence of bull thistle might affect fire regimes in these
communities.</p>

<p> Because
it is so widespread and has broad ecological
 tolerances, it is difficult to exclude many ecosystems as potential hosts of
 bull thistle plants or populations. The following table provides fire regime intervals for
several plant communities in which bull thistle may be found.</p>

IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT:</a>
</span>
<br />

More research is needed to determine the immediate effects of fire on bull
thistle plants and seeds. Bull thistle may or may not be killed by fire. In south-central Idaho
on a Douglas-fir site where bull
thistle was present before prescribed burning, bull thistle frequency declined immediately
following burning, then increased 3 years after the burn [<a href="#90">90</a>].&nbsp;Musk thistle, a biennial thistle with a similar life
history, may be killed by high-severity fires that kill the root crown, but
may survive low-severity fires (see <a href="../carnut/index.html">musk thistle</a> in FEIS). 
It has been suggested that combustion would only 
readily take place on mature thistle plants,
from which seed would have already dispersed [<a href="#116">116</a>].

<p> It is also unclear what effects fire has on bull thistle seeds
in the soil. Incidents of rapid colonization after fire [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>] suggest that either bull thistle seeds were
present in the soil at the time of the fire and
survived to germinate after the overstory was removed, or that bull thistle
seeds were dispersed after fire from off-site seed sources. However, when
experimental heat treatments including 6 combinations of temperature,
duration, and soil moisture were applied to bull thistle seeds from an old-growth Douglas-fir forest seed
bank, researchers concluded that even low-severity
fire could kill bull thistle seeds. Seed survival was lower in wet soil than in
dry soil. In wet soil, 35% of the bull thistle seeds tested
survived 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 ï¿½C) for 60 minutes, and 0 seeds survived 167
degrees Fahrenheit (75 ï¿½C) or 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 ï¿½C) for 15 minutes.
In dry soil,
44% survived 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 ï¿½C) for 60 minutes, 32% survived 167 degrees
Fahrenheit (75 ï¿½C) for 15 minutes, and 6% survived 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 ï¿½C) for
15 minutes [<a href="#25">25</a>].</p>

Bull thistle colonization may be enhanced [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>] or depressed
[<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>] by fire. Observations at preserves in northeastern Oregon
suggest that bull thistle establishment is encouraged by wildfire [<a href="#129">129</a>].
Conversely, prescribed burning on tallgrass prairie sites in South Dakota discourages bull
thistle and encourages native plants [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]


<p>Fire creates conditions that are
favorable to the establishment of bull thistle (i.e. open canopy, reduced competition, areas of bare soil), so if
bull thistle seeds are present and competition is minimal, bull thistle may be favored in
the postfire community. Bull thistle densities increased dramatically after a prescribed burn in
 Yosemite
Valley, leading managers to believe that burning promotes thistle populations. It
is unclear, however, whether prescribed burning alone caused the increase in
bull thistle cover [<a href="#121">121</a>].</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE">DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Response of bull thistle to fire depends on the conditions of the fire such as
fire severity, time of burning, prior and subsequent weather conditions
[<a href="#30">30</a>], site conditions (e.g. soil moisture content) and composition of the preburn community and seedbank.&nbsp;


<p>Observations in tallgrass prairie sites in South Dakota indicate
that late spring prescribed burning on a
4- to 5-year rotation encourages the growth of
native plants and discourages the growth of Canada thistle (<i>Cirsium arvense</i>),
musk thistle, and bull thistle [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>].
Additionally, Hulbert [<a href="#70">70</a>] suggests that late spring burning in these ecosystems results in fewer forbs
but greater grass production than fall or early spring burning.</p>


<p>A spring prescribed fire following clearcutting in 1968 on Miller Creek in western Montana (when the
lower half of the duff was still wet from snowmelt and rain)
left a continuous, intact duff mantle as a seedbed and killed the aerial
portions of understory herbs and shrubs. Forest succession then began with regrowth
of heartleaf arnica (<i>Arnica cordifolia</i>) and beargrass (<i>Xerophyllum
tenax</i>) and establishment of the offsite colonizers fireweed (<i>Epilobium
angustifolium</i>) and bull thistle. Other sites in the area that were
harvested during the same time period but either unburned or burned in summer or
fall
did not have bull thistle in the postdisturbance plant community [<a href="#137">137</a>].</p>

<p>More
research is needed on short- and long-term secondary effects of fire on bull thistle. See &quot;Postfire
colonization potential&quot; below for more details.

<br />

<b>

Fire as a control agent</b>: Research is needed regarding the potential of
prescribed burning to control bull thistle. Observations in tallgrass prairie sites in South Dakota indicate
that a program of prescribed burning designed to simulate the historic fire
regime encourages the growth of
native plants and discourages the growth of invasive thistles
[<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. However, poorly timed grazing (i.e. early in the growing season)
can potentially negate beneficial effects of prescribed fire on these sites
[<a href="#31">31</a>]. 

<p>
<b>
Postfire colonization potentia</b>l:&nbsp;General precautions should be followed
to prevent bull thistle establishment after fire. The USDA Forest Service's &quot;Guide to
noxious weed prevention practices&quot; [<a href="#152">152</a>]
provides several fire management considerations for weed prevention in general
that can be applied to bull thistle. Fire managers might consider including
weed prevention education and providing weed identification aids during fire
training; avoiding known weed infestations when locating firelines, monitoring
camps, staging areas, and helibases to be sure they are kept weed free;
taking care that equipment is weed free; incorporating cost of weed prevention
and management into fire
rehabilitation plans; and acquiring restoration funding [<a href="#152">152</a>]. Careful postfire vigilance
to identify and record the establishment of new populations is critical. About 1 month after
fire, survey for signs of new or resprouting weeds. Repeated surveys will be
needed, with the frequency and intensity guided by local conditions [<a href="#9">9</a>].</p>

Potential weed
problems must be addressed during prefire planning of prescribed burns, and following both
wild and prescribed fires. When planning a prescribed burn, preinventory the project area and evaluate
cover and phenology of any bull thistle present on or adjacent to the site,
and evaluate the
potential for increased bull thistle populations in the area [<a href="#9">9</a>]. Avoid ignition and burning in areas at high risk for
weed establishment or spread, and/or plan for follow-up treatments in succeeding
years. Avoid creating soil conditions that promote weed
germination and establishment. Discuss weed status and risks in burn
rehabilitation plans [<a href="#152">152</a>].
To prevent infestations, re-establish vegetation on bare ground as soon after
fire as possible, using either natural recovery or artificial techniques as
appropriate to site conditions and objectives. When reseeding after wildfires
and prescribed burns, use only certified weed-free seed. Monitor the burn site
and associated disturbed areas after the fire and the following spring for
emergence of bull thistle, and treat to eradicate any emergent bull thistle plants. Regulate human, pack animal, and livestock entry into burned
areas at risk for weed invasion until desirable site vegetation has recovered
sufficiently to resist weed invasion. Additional guidelines and specific
recommendations and requirements are available [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#152">152</a>].

</span>
<br />

Bull thistle is usually avoided by grazing animals because of its spines, and thus
its proliferation is encouraged by heavy gazing on rangeland and in pastures.
Additionally, rosettes that were damaged during heavy grazing on a pasture in
New Zealand were stimulated by the damage to regrow [<a href="#103">103</a>]. Domestic goats and sheep
eat bull thistle
seedlings [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].&nbsp;Pasture
grazing by domestic sheep can reduce competition from neighboring plants and increase
growth, flowering, and seed production, and promote survival of bull thistle seedlings
[<a href="#49">49</a>]. This may be an
issue of timing: spring grazing may encourage bull thistle, while later in
the season, sheep may eat bull thistle seedlings or small rosettes [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].&nbsp;<p>Studies in the Netherlands indicate that rabbits eat bull
thistle leaves, especially in winter and early spring. The flowering stem
may be attacked by a variety of herbivores, which can result in a reduced seed
output. If the main stem is severed or damaged by herbivores, secondary
flowering stems can form. Recovery of bull thistle after herbivore damage
is dependent on moisture availability. Bull thistle seeds are eaten by mice and
voles. Birds sometimes eat
seeds in the Dutch coastal dune area [<a href="#80">80</a>]. Goldfinches eat bull thistle seeds and use the thistledown to build their
nests [<a href="#106">106</a>].&nbsp;Bull thistle is included in a list of known grizzly bear food plants
[<a href="#32">32</a>]. Bull thistle is eaten by Mazama pocket gophers in south-central Oregon
[<a href="#22">22</a>], and high bull thistle densities were observed in Yosemite
National Park in sites of
intense pocket gopher digging. Pocket gophers consume taproots from below, and their digging provides sites for further
thistle establishment, so that they are effectively &quot;farming&quot; thistles
[<a href="#121">121</a>]. Bull thistle flower nectar is a favorite of bees and butterflies [<a href="#84">84</a>].

OTHER USES:</a>
</span>
<br />

The thistles have long been associated with humans [<a href="#106">106</a>]. &quot;Thistles
have been used medicinally as well as for food. However, they are also
notoriously associated with unkempt agricultural land. While this may be true of
invasive thistles that are not native to North America, the vast majority of
native thistles fill specific ecological niches and have traits useful to humans&quot;
[<a href="#15">15</a>].&nbsp;The
young stems and roots of bull thistle are edible [<a href="#46">46</a>]. Native North Americans used the roots and
young leaves and newly bolted stems of <i>Cirsium</i> species for food. <i> Cirsium</i> roots have been sold
commercially for use as rabbit bait in Australia [<a href="#106">106</a>].&nbsp;In a review
by Klinkhamer and de Jong [<a href="#80">80</a>], it is suggested that bull thistle may be easily
processed for rubber using standard equipment.

<br><br>

<span class="subframeName">
<a name="IMPACTS AND CONTROL">
IMPACTS AND CONTROL:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Impacts:</b></font>    
Bull thistle is a problem in
pastures because it competes with and decreases desirable forage and has no
significant nutritive value for livestock [<a href="#106">106</a>]. Sharp spines
deter livestock, and presumably wildlife, from grazing. One adult bull thistle
plant per square yard decreased spring or summer live weight gains of sheep by
about 3.8 lb (1.7 kg) per animal in New Zealand pastures [<a href="#64">64</a>]. Bull thistle is a range weed
in 20 countries and is more frequent in grazed than in ungrazed pastures. It is
regarded as a serious pest in protected areas and parks such as Yosemite,
Yellowstone, Teton and Glacier National Parks [<a href="#50">50</a>]. Bull thistle&nbsp;may also interfere with
growth of Douglas-fir transplants in the Oregon Coast Range
as indicated by results presented by Gourley and others [<a href="#55">55</a>], where tree growth was
improved by control of various weeds, including but not limited to bull thistle.

<p> Bull thistle often dominates recently clearcut forest areas in the Sierra
Nevada of California, and infestations may limit growth of replanted tree seedlings.
Work in a replanted Sierra clearcut forest indicated that stem growth of
ponderosa pine saplings was negatively correlated with density of thistles within about 7 feet (2 m) of pines
[<a href="#123">123</a>]. Bull thistle also colonizes and maintains high
population densities for up to 6 years in clearcuts in redwood and mixed
evergreen forests in northwestern California [<a href="#122">122</a>].&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Control:</b></font>
Bull thistle should be accurately identified before attempting any control measures, since several
native species of thistles have a similar appearance. See Klinkhamer and de Jong [<a href="#80">80</a>] and the 
<a href="botanical_and_ecological_characteristics.html#General Botanical Characteristics">General Botanical Characteristics</a> 
section of this summary for information on proper identification.</p>

<p>The key to successful management
of bull thistle is to prevent seed production. Combining control methods into an
integrated management system will result in the best long-term population
decreases. Control data suggest that viable seed production by
biennial thistles must be eliminated to achieve long-term population decreases, although
zero seed production may not be a realistic goal. The transition from seedling to rosette in
bull thistle may be the most precarious stage in its life cycle. Seedling and
rosette growth stages are the most logical to target for control efforts in biennial thistles.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Desirable plant competition to deter
establishment of bull thistle seedlings is a critical part of any biennial thistle management strategy.
Recovery of infested areas should not be considered complete
until a diverse population of&nbsp; desirable plants has replaced invasive
biennial thistles, and bull thistles are a minor to nonexistent component of the plant
community. Always monitor and evaluate weed management programs to determine
whether and when to repeat and/or modify control treatments [<a href="#15">15</a>].
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Prevention:</font> 
Prevention is the most
effective method for managing invasive species, including bull thistle [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>]. Preventing or
dramatically reducing seed production will help decrease the spread of
infestations. This is accomplished by cleaning
mowers, vehicles, and tillage equipment after operation in an infested area.
When seeding is necessary, use clean, certified weed-free seed and mulch to ensure that
bull thistle or other weeds are not being sown.
Preventing the establishment of weeds in natural areas is achieved by
maintaining healthy natural communities and by conducting aggressive monitoring
several times each year. Monitoring
efforts are best concentrated on the most disturbed areas in a site,
particularly along roadsides, parking lots, fencelines, and waterways. When an
infestation is found, the location can be recorded and the surrounding area
surveyed to determine the size and extent of the infestation, so these sites can
be revisited on follow-up surveys.
For more on monitoring see Johnson [<a href="#74">74</a>]. Place a priority on controlling small infestations so they do
not expand [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].</p>

<p>Good grazing management will stimulate grass growth and keep pastures and
rangelands healthy. Healthy pastures and rangeland may be more
resistant to biennial thistle invasion. Bare spots caused by overgrazing are
prime habitable sites for biennial thistles. In many instances, grazing lands
will have to be rested from grazing for grasses to recover. This should be
coupled with precipitation cycles, so adequate soil moisture will be available to
stimulate grass growth. Grazed pastures that are managed carefully may
enhance grass competition and deter thistle survival from seedlings to rosettes
[<a href="#15">15</a>].
</p>

<p>Weed prevention and control can be incorporated into all types of management
plans, including logging and site preparation, management of grazing allotments,
recreation management, research projects, road building and maintenance, and
fire management [<a href="#152">152</a>].
See the &quot;Guide to noxious weed prevention practices&quot; [<a href="#152">152</a>]
for specific guidelines in preventing the spread of weed seeds and propagules
under different management conditions.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Integrated management:</font>   
The goal of any management plan should be not only controlling
invasive plants, but also improving the affected community, maximizing forage quality and quantity
and/or preserving ecosystem integrity, and preventing
reinvasion or invasion by other invasive species, in a way that is
complementary to the ecology and economics of the site [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>]. Effective long-term control requires
that invasive plants be removed and replaced
by more desirable and weed-resistant plant communities [<a href="#73">73</a>]. Once the desired plant
community has been determined, an integrated weed management strategy can be
developed to direct succession toward that plant community by identifying key
mechanisms and processes directing plant community dynamics (site availability,
species availability, and species performance) and predicting plant community
response to control measures [<a href="#138">138</a>]. This requires a long-term
integrated management plan [<a href="#15">15</a>].
</p>

<p>
Most often, a single method is not effective for controlling an invasive
plant, and
many possible combinations of methods can achieve the desired objectives. Methods selected for removal or control of
bull thistle on a specific site will be
determined by land use objectives, desired plant community, extent
and nature of the infestation(s), environmental factors (nontarget vegetation,
soil types, climatic conditions, important water resources), economics, and
effectiveness and limitations of available control techniques [<a href="#126">126</a>].   Killing thistles and decreasing weed
populations must be followed by the establishment of desirable vegetation in the
newly opened niches; herbicide applications in spring followed by dormant
seeding of competitive perennial grasses in the fall is an example of an
effective management system for biennial thistles in the western U.S.
Similarly, integrating herbicides and biological control agents is likely to be more
effective than insects alone [<a href="#15">15</a>] (see &quot;Biological control&quot; below, for
more information). For information
on integrated weed management without herbicides, see the Bio-Integral
Resource Center (<a href="https://www.keyed.com/birc/index.html">BIRC</a>)
 website.
</p>

<p>Some examples of combined approaches and considerations for managing bull
thistle infestations are presented within
the following sections. Managers are encouraged to use combinations of
control techniques in a manner that is appropriate to the site objectives,
desired plant community, available resources, and timing of applications.
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Physical/mechanical: </font>
Any mechanical or physical method that severs
the root below the soil surface will kill bull thistle plants. However, it is essential to
re-vegetate the site with desirable plants to
compete with bull thistle that may reinvade from seeds left in
the soil. Tillage,
hoeing, and hand pulling may provide effective control, providing these
operations are done before the reproductive growth stages to prevent seed
production. Mowing
alone is not an effective control measure for biennial thistles, because some seed
will still be produced. Mechanical methods may not be practical on rangeland
and
natural areas, but could be useful in improved pastures or roadsides [<a href="#15">15</a>].
The long duration of flowering in bull thistle increases the
importance of timely control operations and may make repeated treatments necessary
[<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>].
</p>

<p> A single mowing will not control a bull or musk thistle
infestation, because infestations often consist of plants of various ages, and
stands therefore have nonuniform development and flowering. Bull
thistle plants mowed just before seed dispersal do not produce seed or recover well
[<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>]. If mowed too early,
bull thistle plants resprout and flower. About 4% of bull thistles cut 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm) above
the soil surface a month before flowering resprout [<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>].</p>

<p> Bull thistle will not withstand cultivation; however, tillage is not appropriate in wildlands and
rangelands since it can damage important desirable species, increase erosion,
alter soil structure, and expose the soil for rapid reinfestation by bull thistle
and other invasive species [<a href="#88">88</a>]. Slicing off the root crown of bull
thistle plants is time consuming, but very effective [<a href="#129">129</a>]. At Yosemite National
Park, less than 5% of adult bull thistles cut at the soil surface resprouted, while
over 80% of adult bull thistles in control plots survived and flowered
[<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>]. Of the bull thistle plants that resprouted, mean height and number of inflorescences were lower
(25 inches or 63 cm and 3.7 flowerheads ) than for adults in control plots (33 inches or 85 cm and 15.8
flowerheads) [<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>].&nbsp;
Plants that were cut at the root crown a few days after their 1st flowers
appeared and then laid on the ground produced abundant viable seed, so removing cut stems from areas being cleared may
be important [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>].
</p>

<p>Even if bull thistle plants resprout after mechanical
control,&nbsp;populations may be reduced by limiting seed production [<a href="#122">122</a>].
Removal of adult bull thistle plants must be repeated annually for 4 years or
more, since some plants will stay in the rosette form for up to 5 years [<a href="#121">121</a>].
Mechanical control may be<i> </i>labor intensive; however, sometimes volunteer groups are
available. The Salmon River Restoration Council (<a href="https://www.srrc.org/">SRRC</a>)
provides an example of watershed-scale weed control using primarily mechanical
control methods.

Biological control of invasive species has a long history,
and there are many important considerations to be made before the implementation
of a biological control program. The reader is referred to other sources
[<a href="#126">126</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>] and the <a href="https://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/handbook.html">Weed

 websites offer information on biological control.
</p>

<p> In its native range, number of viable seeds produced by bull thistle plants can be greatly reduced by insects feeding on the
stem, flowerheads, or seeds [<a href="#80">80</a>]. Several agents have been considered and tested for bull thistle control, and
those in the following table have been introduced in North America:

<p><i>Rhinocyllus conicus</i>  was introduced from Europe to Montana and
Virginia in 1969 to control musk thistle, but it also uses bull thistle. <i>Rhinocyllus conicus</i>
 will use <i>Carduus</i>, <i>Cirsium</i>, <i>Silybum</i>, and <i>Onopordum</i>
 genera as hosts but prefers the musk thistle  group [<a href="#127">127</a>].
In areas where the plant and insect life cycles are synchronized, <i>R. conicus</i>
is extremely effective in reducing seed production in musk thistle [<a href="#125">125</a>]. It is
unclear if it is as effective on bull thistle. Several strains of <i> R. conicus</i> have been identified and they vary in their
utilization of various thistle species. At least 1 of these strains does
attack some native <i> Cirsium</i> species [<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>], and
reviews by Randall [<a href="#122">122</a>], Beck [<a href="#15">15</a>] and Wilson and McCaffrey [<a href="#164">164</a>] indicate that it is known to
attack native and rare thistles. Therefore, before releasing insects in a new
area containing native <i> Cirsium</i> species, investigate whether any of the local
species may be attacked [<a href="#125">125</a>]. A detailed discussion of the biology of
<i> R. conicus</i>
is given by Harris and Shorthouse [<a href="#63">63</a>].</p>

<p><i>Urophora
stylata</i> feeds on developing seeds in bull thistle flowerheads and decreases
seed production up to 60% [<a href="#26">26</a>]. <i>Trichosirocalus horridus</i>  was introduced to the U.S. in
1974. This weevil uses thistles of the subtribe Carduinae, including bull thistle,
musk thistle, plumeless
thistle (<i>Carduus acanthoides</i>), Italian thistle (<i>C. pycnocephalus</i>),
Canada thistle, and
Scotch thistle. Reports of
suppression vary from slight to great. <i>Trichosirocalus horridus</i> is more
effective when used in conjunction with <i> R. conicus</i>    [<a href="#125">125</a>]. In areas of Missouri
where <i>R. conicus </i> and <i>T. horridus </i> have been
present for over 15 years, an 80 to 90% reduction in thistle populations has
occurred [<a href="#142">142</a>].
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Chemical:</font>
Herbicides are effective in gaining initial control of a new
invasion or a severe infestation, but are rarely a complete
or long-term solution to weed management [<a href="#23">23</a>]. Herbicides are more effective on large infestations when 
incorporated into long-term management plans that include
replacement of weeds with desirable species, careful land use management, and
prevention of new infestations.
Control with herbicides is temporary, as it does not change conditions that
allow infestations to occur [<a href="#169">169</a>].
See the <a href="https://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/handbook.html">Weed Control Methods
Handbook</a> for considerations on the use of herbicides in natural areas and
detailed information on specific chemicals.&nbsp;
</p>

<p> Chemical control of bull thistle is
reviewed by Beck [<a href="#15">15</a>], Forcella and Randall [<a href="#50">50</a>], and Randall [<a href="#122">122</a>]. Clopyralid, dicamba, MCPA, picloram, 2,4-D, metsulfuron, and chlorsulfuron
will all kill bull and musk thistles. Timing of application is important. Autumn
is a good time to control biennial
thistles with herbicides because all live plants will be seedlings or rosettes,
and plants are easiest to control in the seedling and rosette stages. Plants
are, however, more difficult to locate at this stage, and cold weather may decrease the effectiveness of some chemicals. Herbicide
choice and rates are influenced by growth stage, stand density, and
environmental conditions (e.g. drought or cold temperatures). Check with state or county weed specialists for appropriate local use rates
and timing. Bull thistle is less aggressive and easier to control than other
biennial thistles [<a href="#14">14</a>].
</p>

<p>In pastures and range containing appreciable quantities of broadleaf forage species,
application of any of the herbicides listed above may damage
valuable plants and reduce forage production and livestock weight gain as much
as that caused by thistle interference [<a href="#64">64</a>], so it is important to prevent these
and other non-target effects of chemical control.
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Cultural:</font> 
Bull thistle germination and establishment is
favored in open areas and by disturbance [<a href="#15">15</a>]. No matter what method is used to kill
weeds, reestablishment of competitive, desirable plant cover is imperative for
long-term control.
Fertilization and reseeding with competitive, adapted species is often necessary
in areas without a residual understory of desirable plants [<a href="#126">126</a>].&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
Revegetation with aggressive desirable species has been shown to inhibit
reinvasion of bull thistle,
especially with the help of effective biological control agents and carefully
prescribed grazing practices. Promoting desirable competitors is important both after weed control and before weed establishment. 
Choice of species to sow will depend
upon climate, location, and management objectives. The Natural Resource Conservation
Service and land grant
universities are good sources of information about appropriate perennial grass
species for a particular locale. Management that allows grasses
to grow taller in spring to shade bull thistle seedlings may decrease seedling establishment and growth [<a href="#15">15</a>].&nbsp;
</p>

At Thousand Springs Preserve in Idaho, bull thistle invades native grasslands.
Where healthy native grasses have re-established, they outcompete bull
thistle and their litter prevents bull thistle seeds from reaching
the ground and germinating [<a href="#129">129</a>]. On a reclaimed parking lot in Illinois that was planted by broadcast seeding
and seedling transplants, then burned 5 years later and on an annual basis
thereafter, bull thistle decreased over time and was virtually absent by year 7
[<a href="#78">78</a>].
