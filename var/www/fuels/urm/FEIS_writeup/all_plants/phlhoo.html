<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Hood's phlox occurs in many plant communities within its wide geographic
range.  It is a prominent member of short- and mixed-grass prairie,
desert scrub, and pinyon (Pinus spp.)-juniper (Juniperus spp.)
communities.  Typically, it is the first or second most abundant forb in
most of these communities [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  In climax blue grama (Bouteloua
gracilis)-needle-and-thread (Stipa comata)-wheatgrass (Agropyron spp.)
shortgrass prairie in Alberta, for example, it provides approximately 5
percent of total plant cover [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Hood's phlox does not normally
attain dominant status in any plant community, and is not listed as
indicator of habitat types.  Classifications of the plant communities of
Alaska and Yukon Territory in which it occurs were not found.

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Hood's phlox is difficult for cattle to graze due to its short height
[<a href="#7">7</a>].  It is generally unpalatable to all classes of livestock [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>],
although sheep will graze it lightly [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  It is also lightly grazed
by pronghorn and deer.  In south-central Saskatchewan, it provides 1
percent of the summer diet of pronghorn [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability of Hood's phlox is several western states has been
rated as follows [<a href="#17">17</a>]:

                            CO     MT     ND     UT     WY

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Hood's phlox is poor in energy and protein value [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Hood's phlox provides poor cover for waterfowl and small nongame birds
and mammals [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
The low, creeping growth form of Hood's phlox aids in protection of
eroding soils [<a href="#12">12</a>].  It is not planted on disturbed rangelands, however,
due to low palatability.


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Hood's phlox is sometimes described as an increaser during drought and
under regimes of moderate to heavy grazing [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Severe overgrazing
of shortgrass prairie in southeastern Alberta has regressed some
communities to seral stages codominated by Hood's phlox, fringed
sagewort (Artemesia frigida), plains pricklypear (Opuntia polycantha),
and broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae) [<a href="#10">10</a>].  In Sweetwater County,
Wyoming, percentage frequency of Hood's phlox varied from 54 percent in
a relict big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata)-mutton bluegrass (Poa
fendleriana) community inaccessible to livestock to 76 percent in
adjacent grazed rangeland [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Grazing response of Hood's phlox,
however, is difficult to typify.  Mueggler and Stewart [<a href="#36">36</a>] found its
response was widely inconsistent on Montana rangelands.  Additionally,
response varies accoring to management regime.  Laycock [<a href="#33">33</a>] found that
Hood's phlox increased in Idaho under moderate levels of both continuous
and spring grazing by sheep but decreased with heavy fall grazing.  In
southeastern Alberta, it increased with light rotational cattle grazing
but decreased under light continuous grazing [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Recovering rangelands usually exhibit a temporary increase of Hood's
phlox as a normal course of plant succession.  Thirty years following
relief from grazing, populations were doubled on a severely overgrazed
northern Nevada rangeland [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Similarly, Hood's phlox increased over
a 5-year period in Meagher County, Montana, when a former sheep range
was protected from grazing [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Hood's phlox also increases on
rangelands undergoing active rehabilitation.  An overgrazed
pinyon-juniper woodland near Ephriam, Utah, with an understory dominated
by cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), was planted with crested wheatgrass
(Agropyron cristatum), intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium
ssp. intermedium), and orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata).  Hood's phlox
increased from average densities of 31 plants per plot to 37 plants per
plot 2 years following grass seeding [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Recovery rate of the
degraded rangeland depends upon the degree of degradation and the
ecosystem involved, but populations of Hood's phlox will eventually
decline as rangeland trend moves upward.  In southeastern Idaho a big
sagebrush-bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides) rangeland in poor
condition showed a gradual decline in Hood's phlox over a 10-year study
period when left ungrazed [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Pitting treatment may result in rapid lowering of populations.  A
degraded needle-and-thread community in northern Montana underwent a
reduction in Hood's phlox the first year following pitting [<a href="#42">42</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Phlox hoodii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Hood's phlox is a compact, pulvinate to cespitose, perennial native forb
growing from 0.8 to 3.1 inches (2-8 cm) tall [<a href="#22">22</a>].  The seeds are
miniscule (0.08 to 0.12 inch [2-3 mm] long) [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Taproots branch from
a pluricipital caudex and are from 12 to 37 inches (30-95 cm) deep.
Roots near the surface are woody, and vary from 0.4 to 2.0 inches (1-5
cm) in diameter [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Hood's phlox reproduces from seed.  Lepidoptera are the principal
pollinators of the small flowers [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Studies of seed germination
requirements and viability are scant.  One study [<a href="#18">18</a>] conducted in a
singleleaf pinyon (Pinus monophylla)-Utah juniper (Juniperus
osteosperma) community in Utah showed that germinants were unable to
establish in heavy duff.

Hood's phlox will sprout from spreading rootstocks following damage to
aboveground portions of the plant [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Hood's phlox occurs on xeric sites.  In the more mesic locations, it is
found on dry microsites such as south slopes and windward exposures
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].  Climates vary but are characterized by seasonal periods of low
precipitation and extremes of temperature [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Soils are moderately
acidic to moderately alkaline [<a href="#26">26</a>].  In North Park, Colorado, soil pH at
sites where Hood's phlox occurred ranged from 6.2 to 8.1 [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Structure
and texture of soils vary.  In southwestern Saskatchewan, Hood's phlox
is found in many types of soil but is most common in heavy clay [<a href="#26">26</a>].
Hood's phlox also grows in a variety of soils in the Great Basin but is
most common in loamy-skeletal and silty-coarse soils [<a href="#38">38</a>].

Elevational ranges of Hood's phlox in several western states are as
follows:

                       feet             meters
     California   4,000 -  8,000     1,219 - 2,438 [<a href="#37">37</a>]
     Colorado     5,000 -  9,000     1,524 - 2,743 [<a href="#25">25</a>]
     Utah         4,672 - 10,448     1,460 - 3,265 [<a href="#46">46</a>]

In Arizona, Hood's phlox has a very limited distribution and occurs at
approximately the 4,000-foot (1,219 m) level [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Associated overstory species not listed in Distribution and Occurrence
include Utah juniper, California juniper (Juniperus californica), true
pinyon (Pinus edulis), singleleaf pinyon (P. monophylla), Mormon-tea
(Ephedra viridis), gray rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus nauseosus), low
rabbitbrush (C. viscidiflorus), silver sagebrush (Artemisia cana),
shadscale (A. confertifolia), and winterfat (Ceratoides lanata)
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Some associated groundcover species are bluebunch
wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata), thickspike wheatgrass (Elymus
lanceolatus), Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda), mutton bluegrass (P.
fendleriana), needle-and-thread (Stipa comata), stonyhills muhly
(Muhlenbergia cuspidata), junegrass (Koeleria cristata), needleleaf
sedge (Carex eleocharis), threadleaf sedge (C. filifolia), oblongleaf
bluebell (Mertensia oblongifolia), Hooker balsamroot (Balsamorhiza
hookeri var. hispiduala), pulse poison vetch (Astragalus tenellus),
stemless goldenweed (Haplopappus acaulis), fringed sagebrush (Artemisia
frigida), pussytoes (Antennaria spp.), plains pricklypear, and clubmoss
(Selaginella densa) [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Series

Hood's phlox is a seral species, generally most frequent in early seral
stages but persisting through climax [<a href="#15">15</a>].  It is abundant, for example,
in seral stages of wheatgrass-muhly mixed grass prairie communities in
Saskatchewan [<a href="#12">12</a>].  A study of plant community composition in a true
pinyon-Utah juniper community in northeastern Utah showed that Hood's
phlox populations were greatly reduced from previous levels in the
climax woodland [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
In Saskatchewan and Alberta, growth begins in early April.  Plants
flower in late April and again in August if soil moisture is sufficient.
Seeds resulting from the first flowering ripen in mid-June [<a href="#12">12</a>].  The
period of seed maturation following the second flowering is unreported.

Hood's phlox flowers from May to July in California [<a href="#37">37</a>], depending
upon elevation.

<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
In comparison to prefire levels, Hood's phlox cover may be slightly
decreased, increased, or stable at postfire year 1.  From approximately
postfire years 2 to 4, cover increases.  Following a prescribed fire in
Laidlaw Park, Idaho, Hood's phlox frequency in a big sagebrush-bluebunch
wheatgrass community decreased at postfire year 1 and increased to
slightly above prebrun frequency at postfire year 2 [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Similar
results were obtained following experimental prescribed burning on
grazed and ungrazed plots in big sagebrush-dominated rangeland in
Wyoming.  Hood's phlox cover increased above prefire levels by postfire
year 2, with frequencies on grazed plots higher than those of ungrazed
plots [<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Hood's phlox appears to be sensitive to hot, spring fires.  Forb
frequencies, including that of Hood's phlox, were reduced for several
years following a hot, late-May wildfire on mesic mixed-grass prairie in
North Dakota.  A fall prescribed fire in an adjacent area had no effect
on Hood's phlox frequency [<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Prescribed fire alone is not effective in reducing Hood's phlox cover on
degraded rangelands.  Burning followed by reseeding with forage species
has, however, proven effective in reducing Hood's phlox in the Canyon
Mountains of central Utah.  Two July wildfires burned through separate
areas of a big sagebrush community in that area.  In the fall, plots
were established on the two burn areas.  The plots were selectively
chained or drilled, followed by aerial reseeding with desirable
herbaceous species.  At postfire year 3, Hood's phlox was sparse in the
plots of one burn (0.4 percent total cover) and absent from the other
burn.  Drilling resulted in better establishment of planted seeds than
did chaining treatment [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Information on prescribed burning regimes
to increase forage production in big sagebrush communities is available
[<a href="#43">43</a>].
