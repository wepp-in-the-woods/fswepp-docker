<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Nevada ephedra is reportedly the most important forage species of all
North American ephedra (Ephedra spp.) [<a href="#26">26</a>].  It provides valuable browse
for mule deer, mountain sheep, and pronghorn [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Nevada ephedra
may be heavily utilized on mule deer winter ranges, particularly during
times of food shortages, but is often largely ignored during the summer
months [<a href="#26">26</a>].  However, in Utah, Smith and Beale [<a href="#21">21</a>] observed that
pronghorns consumed significant amounts during brief periods of the
summer.  Quail, cottontail rabbits, mule deer, and mountain sheep often
feed on Nevada ephedra during critical drought periods [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Nevada ephedra provides food for all classes of domestic livestock.  It
is, however, considered poor quality forage for horses [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Throughout
much of the Great Basin, this shrub is an important winter food source
for sheep, goats, and cattle [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Nevada ephedra browse is at least moderately palatable to mule deer and
to all classes of domestic livestock.  Young stems are preferred over
older, tougher foliage [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Seeds are palatable to a wide variety of
small birds and mammals.  Overall palatability of Nevada ephedra in Utah
has been rated as follows [<a href="#6">6</a>]:

Cattle                    fair
Sheep                     fair
Horses                    fair
Pronghorn                 fair 
Elk                       poor 
Mule deer                 fair 
White-tailed deer         ---- 
Small mammals             good
Small nongame birds       fair 
Upland game birds         fair
Waterfowl                 poor


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Nevada ephedra browse is low in sodium and phosphorus.  Specific
nutrient content varies according to plant part, phenological
development, and site characteristics [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Food value has been
examined in detail [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Selected values are as follows [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>]:

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Cover value of Nevada ephedra has been rated as follows in Utah
(Dittberner and Olson 1983):


Pronghorn             fair
Elk                   poor

Waterfowl             poor


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Nevada ephedra commonly forms dense, slowly spreading colonies [J. A.
Young, pers. comm. 1987].  Growth and establishment characteristics make
this shrub valuable for use on disturbed sites where it can aid in soil
stabilization [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Plants establish readily from direct seeding,
transplants, or cuttings [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Seedlings emerge in late winter or
early spring following fall or winter plantings [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Nevada ephedra is well adapted to many basin big sagebrush (Artemisia
tridentata ssp. tridentata), Wyoming sagebrush (A. tridentata ssp.
wyomingensis), black sagebrush (A. nova), gray low sagebrush (A.
arbuscula), northern desert shrub, pinyon-juniper, and salt desert
communities [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Seedlings have been successfully planted onto
semiarid reclaimed strip mines in southwestern Wyoming and elsewhere,
with survival rates ranging from 12 percent to 94 percent [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].
Nevada ephedra seedlings are tolerant of extreme drought but may take 5
to 10 years to grow 2 feet (0.61 m) in height [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Nevada ephedra is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Many
species of ephedra have historically been used to make beverages and as
a remedy for coughs, headaches, cold, fever, and other ailments.  Native
Americans traditionally roasted and ate the seeds or added them to
breads [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Radiation:  Studies conducted at the Nevada test site indicate that
exposure of Nevada ephedra to radiation results in reduced growth,
much-decreased fruit production, and poor germination [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Browse:  Utilization of Nevada ephedra can be difficult to detect due to
the manner in which the stems break off at joints [<a href="#18">18</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ephedra nevadensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Nevada ephedra is a coarse, erect, opposite-branched evergreen shrub
which grows from 0.82 to 4.1 feet (0.25-1.25 m) in height [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].  Stout,
spreading branches are olive to brownish green and nearly leafless [<a href="#26">26</a>].
Young stems are pale green and nearly smooth, whereas old stems, which
may exceed 0.16 inch (4 mm) in thickness, are yellowish to gray with
fissured bark [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Roots are typically deep and fibrous [<a href="#22">22</a>].
Individual plants are often connected by underground "stolons" which are
produced as branches become covered with wind-blown sand or silt [<a href="#27">27</a>].
The leaves of Nevada ephedra have been reduced to small scales, and most
photosynthesis takes place in the stems [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Nevada ephedra is primarily dioecious with small greenish-yellow flowers
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Ellipsoid staminate cones and single light-brown to
yellowish-green ovulate cones are borne at the nodes of young branches
[<a href="#4">4</a>].  Smooth brown seeds or "nutlets" of Nevada ephedra occur singly or
in pairs [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Seed:  Nevada ephedra produces large quantities of small, smooth brown
seeds at erratic intervals [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  An abundance of seed is produced in
some years but very little in others [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Germination occurs over a
wide range of temperatures [<a href="#31">31</a>].  In laboratory tests, good germination
was achieved at constant temperatures of 41 to 68 degrees F (5-20
degrees C), and at alternating exposure of 16 hours at 68 degrees F (20
degrees C) followed by 2 hours at 77 degrees F (25 degrees C) [<a href="#31">31</a>].
Germination is rapid under favorable conditions and can begin within 2
days.  In laboratory tests, germination was 68 percent completed within
10 days after initial plantings [<a href="#31">31</a>].  However, at 41 degrees (5 degrees
C), germination did not begin until the 7th day after planting and was
only 36 percent complete after 14 days [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Seed has remained viable
for up to 5 years in storage [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  However, germination may be
significantly reduced in seeds stored for only 1 year [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Seeds
commonly germinate from the underground caches of rodents such as ground
squirrels [R. Hunter, pers. comm. 1981].

Vegetative regeneration:  Nevada ephedra sprouts from roots or woody
crowns after fire and other disturbances [<a href="#30">30</a>].  New plants commonly
develop from the roots or "stolons" of older clones in the absence of
disturbance [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Seedling establishment:  Seedlings are very tolerant of drought and
generally establish well following fall or winter plantings [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].



<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Nevada ephedra is adapted to range of environmental conditions [<a href="#3">3</a>] but
typically grows on arid hills and plains [<a href="#27">27</a>].  It occurs on dry, open
slopes, ridges, breaks with southern exposures, canyons, floodplains,
arroyos, and in dry watercourses [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Nevada ephedra grows well on
gravelly or rocky, often alkaline soils and is tolerant of salt
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Most sites are well drained or subirrigated [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Nevada ephedra typically reaches greatest abundance at the edge of the
salt desert zone [J. A. Young, pers. comm. 1987] but also occurs in
basin big sagebrush, Wyoming sagebrush, gray low sagebrush, and black
sagebrush communities.  It generally grows as scattered plants or in
small clumps but also occurs in isolated, large, pure stands [<a href="#22">22</a>].
Plants commonly growing with Nevada ephedra include grama (Bouteloua
spp.), mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus spp.), saltbush (Atriplex spp.),
juniper (Juniperus spp.), creosotebush (Larrea spp.), and cholla
(Opuntia spp.) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].

Nevada ephedra typically grows below the elevational range of the
closely related green ephedra (Ephedra viridis) [J. A. Young, pers.
comm. 1987].  In Utah, it grows from 4,000 to 6,000 feet (1,220-1,830 m)
[<a href="#6">6</a>].

<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Plants generally flower from April to June, and fruit ripens in July
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  However, significant annual variation in phenological
development has been observed [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Flowering and fruiting dates were
documented as follows in a 9-year study in southern Nevada [<a href="#25">25</a>]:

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Nevada ephedra generally sprouts from the root or crown after fire
damages or destroys aboveground vegetation [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  However, under
certain circumstances, regenerative structures may be eliminated by hot
fires [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Nevada ephedra may also reoccupy disturbed sites through
seed.  Under laboratory conditions, seed has remained viable for up to 5
years [<a href="#18">18</a>], and postfire germination of on-site seed is possible.  Small
birds and mammals may transport some seed to burned areas.

Fires may not carry on some Nevada ephedra sites due to insufficient
fuels.  Periods of above normal precipitation can contribute to
increased stand flammability by promoting the growth of annuals [<a href="#14">14</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ephedra nevadensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Underground regenerative structures commonly survive when aboveground
vegetation is consumed by fire [<a href="#28">28</a>].  However, under certain
circumstances, plants may be killed [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  The effects of fire on
Nevada ephedra varies according to fire intensity and severity, and
season of burn.  Following a hot June wildfire, aboveground foliage was
killed on 84 percent of Nevada ephedra at this site.  Approximately 76
percent of all plants were completely killed [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Nevada ephedra often sprouts vigorously from the roots after aboveground
vegetation is killed or damaged by fire [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Recovery is generally
rapid when plants sprout prolifically.  In a central Utah study,
significant amounts of Nevada ephedra were present within 1 year after
fire [<a href="#28">28</a>].  However, response may vary according to the timing,
intensity, and severity of burn.  Only 9 percent of all top-killed
plants sprouted after a hot June wildfire in the Sonoran Desert of
Arizona [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Nevada ephedra can sometimes reoccupy a site through seed, but recovery
may be relatively slow.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Nevada ephedra sprouted readily after a mid-summer wildfire in central
Utah.  Coverage values and biomass was documented as follows [<a href="#28">28</a>]:
