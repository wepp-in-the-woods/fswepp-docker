<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Centipede grass is a low-maintenance grass used for limited wear areas
such as industrial sites, roadsides, and other utility areas in the
southeastern United States [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Centipede grass is hardy in response to high temperatures such as those
experienced in the southeastern United States during summer months [<a href="#14">14</a>].
It is commonly used in sunny, dry locations [<a href="#27">27</a>].  It recuperates only
moderately well after damage [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Centipede grass requires less
fertilizer and grows more slowly than most other turf grasses [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>];
it requires about 2 years to provide a solid turf cover [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Culture:  Centipede grass grows best when planted in May or June [<a href="#23">23</a>],
though it can be planted from April through July [<a href="#34">34</a>].  April plantings
are more susceptible to infestation.  July plantings require more water
and are susceptible to winter injury [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Centipede grass requires a
minimum of 6 inches (15 cm) of soil to support growth [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Centipede grass can be established by seeding and with sprigs or plugs.
Water application is usually needed for establishment.  Centipede grass
generally grows well without any fertilizer, although fertilization
after new growth appears may increase cover [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>]. Overfertilization
can cause injury or increase susceptibility to frost damage [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

After first establishment centipede grass stems can be divided
frequently and replanted over a wider area [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Winter hardiness:  If properly maintained centipede grass will grow well
as far north as Atlanta, Georgia.  Centipede grass grown further north
is prone to winter injury [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Drought tolerance:  Centipede grass has been considered drought tolerant
[<a href="#17">17</a>] to drought intolerant [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  It was among the lowest water users
of nine warm-season grasses compared in south-central Georgia.  In
another study of 11 turf grasses under drought conditions, centipede
grass was intermediate in its use of water [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Centipede grass is
less drought tolerant than bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.), zoysia (Zoysia
spp.), or St. Augustine grass (Stenotaphrum secundatum) [<a href="#3">3</a>].  It is
suitable for infrequently watered areas in the Southern Coastal Plain
where rainless periods of up to 40 days are followed by moderate
rainfall [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Competition:  Presence of weeds such as bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon)
and nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus) may decrease centipede grass during the
first 2 years after establishement; oats (Avena sativa) planted as
companion grass does not [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Use of mulch and herbicides to control
competition is described [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Eremochloa ophiuroides
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Centipede grass is an introduced warm-season, turf-forming, perennial
grass with prostrate growth form [<a href="#14">14</a>].  It creeps by thick, short-noded,
leafy stolons [<a href="#16">16</a>].  It has compressed racemes [<a href="#13">13</a>] 1.2 to 2 inches (3-5
cm) long.  Spikelets are flat, two-flowered [<a href="#6">6</a>], and awnless [<a href="#13">13</a>].  The
fruit is a caryopsis [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Centipede grass has greater root mass in the
top 4 inches (10 cm) of soil than do some other warm-season turf
grasses.  It also has high root density, length, and mass at all depths
to which its roots grow [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Centipede grass sprouts from stolons and reproduces by seed [<a href="#34">34</a>].
Raceme production is prolific throughout the Southeast from summer to
fall [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Seed set in an experimental setting was 59 to 90 percent
with open-pollination, 45 to 66 percent with cross-pollination, and 0 to
58 percent with self-pollination [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Centipede grass has low seed
yield compared to many other turf grasses [<a href="#25">25</a>].  The caryopsis is
enclosed in a wax coating which is a physical barrier to germination.
Centipede grass apparently requires alternating temperature regimes for
optimum germination.  In laboratory studies, maximum germination of
centipede grass occurred when warm temperatures (80 to 95 degrees
Fahrenheit [27-35 deg C]) with 8 to 12 hours of light were alternated
with lower temperatures (59 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit [15-20 deg C]) and
darkness [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].

Centipede grass produces new stolons each growing season.  These runners
replace the live growth of the previous year.  They grow over the top of
the latter, developing a thick, spongy thatch.  Centipede grass does
not produce rhizomes [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Centipede grass grows under cultivation [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>] and also occurs on sandy
roadsides in the Carolinas [<a href="#28">28</a>]; it is found on disturbed sites in
central Florida [<a href="#35">35</a>] and is naturalized in coastal hammocks in the
Florida panhandle [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Typically, centipede grass grows on the sandy acid soils of the
southeastern United States [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Centipede grass does not thrive on
soils with high levels of phosphorus or high pH [<a href="#34">34</a>]. However, studies
in Texas have shown that satisfactory turfs can be grown with soil pH up
to 8.4 [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Centipede grass in north-central Florida grew best when
planted in soil of pH 5.8; inoculation with vesicular-arbuscular
mycorrhizae (VAM) did not improve topgrowth at that pH.  At soil pH 7.3,
VAM infection increased topgrowth 1.8 times over the uninoculated
treatment [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Centipede grass does not grow well on poorly drained
soil [<a href="#34">34</a>] but is adapted to low fertility soils [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Centipede grass grows on sandy and silty loams in Macon County, Alabama
[<a href="#25">25</a>], and on fine sand in southeastern Florida [<a href="#5">5</a>].  In southeastern
Louisiana it grows on silty loam with pH 6.7 [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Although most of the range to which centipede grass is adapted is humid,
with 30 to 59 inches (750-1,500 mm) of rain annually, drought conditions
occur during most growing seasons [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Centipede grass is a tropical grass that has no natural winter rest
period.  If temperatures drop fairly slowly and steadily, the grass
adjusts and tolerates temperatures well below freezing before it dies
[<a href="#26">26</a>].  In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, lethal temperatures ranged from about
17.6 to 19.4 degrees Fahrenheit (-7 to -8 deg C) in February and March
during active growth to 15.8 degrees Fahrenheit (-9 deg C) in December
and January [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Centipede grass has survived 12 degrees Fahrenheit
(-11.1 deg C) in Mississippi [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Centipede grass grows well in full sun, but it may also tolerate shade
[<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  A centipede grass cultivar and three other lawn grasses were
tested for shade tolerance in southeastern Louisiana.  The experimental
conditrions simulated those under Gulf Coast deciduous shade trees.
Centipede grass was the species most tolerant of reduced light (47-63%
shade) [<a href="#1">1</a>].  In another study in northeastern Texas, seven centipede
grass cultivars were tested at 15 percent full sunlight under tree
canopy.  No cultivar produced acceptable turf under these conditions.
Vegetative spread was minimal or absent [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Information on centipede
grass successional status in naturalized conditions was unavailable.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Centipede grass seed usually requires 21 to 28 days to germinate [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Centipede grass blooms in August and September in the Carolinas [<a href="#28">28</a>].
It blooms from summer to fall in the Florida panhandle [<a href="#6">6</a>] and central
Florida [<a href="#35">35</a>].

Centipede grass seeds are mature at the end of October in southeastern
Alabama [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Centipede grass seed is produced in north Florida and
south Georgia from mid-June until late October [<a href="#2">2</a>].
