Purple needlegrass occurs in grasslands, oak and
pine woodlands, mixed evergreen forests, chaparral, and coastal scrub. It is most prominent in the vegetation type known as the California
prairie or valley grassland. This community is similar to the palouse prairie of Washington
and Oregon in that Idaho fescue (<i>Festuca idahoensis</i>), prairie Junegrass (<i>Koeleria
macrantha</i>), Sandberg bluegrass (<i>Poa secunda</i>) and bottlebrush squirreltail (<i>Elymus
elymoides</i>)
are present, but purple needlegrass is dominant
in place of bluebunch wheatgrass (<i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i>) [<a href="#34">34</a>]. Other
important
perennial associates in California prairie are California oatgrass (<i>Danthonia
californica</i>), California fescue (<i>Festuca californica</i>), tussockgrass (<i>Nassella lepida</i>),
beardless wildrye (<i>Leymus triticoides</i>),
and melicgrass (<i>Melica</i> spp.). Mediterranean annuals such as wild oat (<i>Avena fatua</i>),
slender oat (<i>A. barbata</i>), ripgut brome (<i>Bromus diandrus</i>), soft chess (<i>B.
</i><i>hordeaceus</i>),
mouse barley (<i>Hordeum murinem</i>), and rattail fescue (<i>Vulpia myuros</i>) have replaced
native perennial grasses in some areas (see <a href="botanical_and_ecological_characteristics.html#SUCCESSIONAL STATUS">Successional Status</a>).
Forbs present include fiddleneck (<i>Amsinckia</i> spp.), shooting star (<i>Dodecatheon</i> spp.),
goldenpoppy (<i>Escholzia</i>
spp.), lupine (<i>Lupinus</i> spp.), malacothrix (<i>Malacothrix</i>  spp.), phacelia (<i>Phacelia</i> spp.), and sage (<i>Salvia</i> spp.) [<a href="#46">46</a>].

<p>Purple needlegrass is dominant in northern coastal prairie,
and present in coastal areas from San Francisco Bay north to the Oregon border.
Associated grasses include Pacific reedgrass (<i>Calamagrostis nutkaensis</i>),
Idaho fescue, red fescue (<i>F. rubra</i>), and California oatgrass; forbs
present are rockcress (<i>Arabis</i>  spp.), Mariposa lily (<i>Calochortus </i>spp.),
hairy goldenaster (<i>Heterotheca villosa</i>), congested snakelily (<i>Dicholstemma
congestum</i>), hairy gumweed (<i>Grindelia hirsutula</i>), Douglas iris (<i>Iris
douglasiana</i>), lupine, and pineforest woodrush (<i>Luzula subsessilis</i>) [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>]. Mediterranean
annuals are also prominent in this prairie type, especially on nonserpentine
soils [<a href="#35">35</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coastal prairie occurs in association with northern coastal scrub; here purple needlegrass cover is lower or more intermittent. This vegetation type is
present from southern Oregon south to San Mateo County. Associated species include San
Diego bush monkeyflower (<i>Diplacus</i> <i>auranticus</i>), Monterey Indian
paintbrush (<i>Castilleja</i> <i>latifolia</i>), Pacific dewberry (<i>Rubus</i>
<i>vitifolius</i>), open lupine (<i>Lupinus</i> <i>varicolor</i>), cow parsnip (<i>Heracleum</i>
<i>lanatum</i>), seaside woollysunflower (<i>Eriophyllum</i> <i>staechadifolium</i>),
salal (<i>Gaultheria</i> <i>shallon</i>), western pearlyeverlasting (<i>Anaphalis</i>
<i>margaritacea</i>), coastal wormwood (<i>Artemisia</i> <i>suksdorfi</i>), and
seaside fleabane (<i>Erigeron glaucus</i>) [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].</p>

<p>Coastal sage scrub occurs on slopes in the Coast Ranges;
purple needlegrass, tussockgrass, and giant wildrye (<i>Leymus condensatus</i>)
are present in areas of lower shrub density. Associated shrubs include California sagebrush (<i>Artemisia californica</i>), white
sage (<i>Salvia apiana</i>), black sage (<i>S. mellifera</i>), purple sage (<i>S.
leucophylla</i>), coyote bush (<i>Baccharis pilularis</i>), eastern Mojave
buckwheat (<i>Eriogonum fasciculatum</i>), lemonade sumac (<i>Rhus integrifolia</i>),
and California brittlebrush (<i>Encelia californica</i>) [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>]. Purple needlegrass is slightly less
common in chaparral. Chaparral shrubs include&nbsp;chamise (<i>Adenostoma
fasciculatum</i>), toyon (<i>Heteromeles arbutifolia</i>), California
coffeeberry (<i>Rhamnus californica</i>), Nuttall's scrub oak (<i>Quercus dumosa</i>),
birchleaf mountain-mahogany (<i>Cercocarpus</i> <i>betuloides</i>), Our Lord's
candle (<i>Yucca</i> <i>whipplei</i>), California flannelbush (<i>Fremontodendron</i>
<i>californicum</i>), hollyleaf cherry (<i>Prunus ilicifolia</i>), ceanothus (<i>Ceanothus</i>
spp.), manzanita (<i>Arctostaphylos</i> spp.), and chaparral pea (<i>Pickeringia</i>
<i>montana</i>) [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].</p>

Purple needlegrass is a caespitose perennial native grass [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>]. Culms are 24 to 39 inches (60-100 cm) tall, producing an
open, nodding panicle 4 to 8 inches (10-20 cm) long [<a href="#51">51</a>]. Leaves are 0.031 to 0.14 inch (0.8-3.5 mm) wide
[<a href="#36">36</a>]. The species expands vegetatively when tussocks are fragmented. Stands with fire and
grazing exclusion are likely to be low density with larger individuals and more
litter accumulation. With fragmenting disturbance, stands are higher
density with smaller size tussocks and less litter accumulation, at least in the
short term [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. Bunches are roughly circular when undisturbed and more
irregular with fragmenting disturbance [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. Purple needlegrass is
apparently long lived: 1 study found mortality of mature individuals was 2 to
6% annually over a 7-year period [<a href="#20">20</a>]. Purple needlegrass is arbuscular mycorrhizal and has a rooting depth of at
least 25 inches (64 cm) on deep soils.&nbsp;

<b><font face="Bell MT">Breeding system:</font></b> 
Purple needlegrass is monoecious [<a href="#51">51</a>].

<p><b>
<font face="Bell MT">Pollination:</font></b>  
Purple needlegrass is pollinated by wind.</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Seed production:</font></b>
Purple needlegrass produces large quantities of viable
seed. Under favorable conditions 2-year-old plants are able to produce seed. In dense
healthy stands seed production may be up to 227 pounds per acre (200 kg/ha). Defoliation during
periods of rapid growth or flowering may decrease seed production [<a href="#6">6</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed dispersal:</b></font>  
Purple needlegrass seeds have a twisting
awn and pointed seed, which increases self-burial [<a href="#6">6</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed banking:</b></font>   
Seed banking of purple needlegrass is relatively low compared to that of
associated nonnative annual grasses [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Germination:</font></b>  
Reported germination
rates are varied. Gulmon [<a href="#31">31</a>] reported germination rates from 80 to 93.7% on leached
litter, fresh litter, and
topsoil. Ahmed [<a href="#1">1</a>] found mean germination rates of 30 to 75% for seed collected
in summer and germinated in petri dishes in October. Germination is reduced and
slower in the presence of annual competitors [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>]. This further
reduces competitive ability in the presence of nonnative annuals [<a href="#9">9</a>]. Fire may increase germination and emergence in the 1st
postfire growing season [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seedling establishment/growth:</font></b>
Seedling success
is influenced by climate, competition from annuals, grazing intensity and
duration, and fire. One study found
a 94% decrease in abundance between the 1- and 2-tillered seedling stages,
and a 26% decrease between the 2- and 3-tillered seedling stages [<a href="#45">45</a>]. Another
study found &lt;1% survival of purple needlegrass following 20% germination of
&quot;precision planted&quot; seed [<a href="#20">20</a>]. Dyer and others [<a href="#22">22</a>] found 0.01% 4-year survival, with various grazing and
prescribed fire treatments improving survival only during the 1st year. The
authors noted that survival to this age &quot;appeared to be more strongly
influenced by factors not manipulated or monitored in this study,&quot; such as
climatic variation. Generally individuals greater than 0.8 inch (2 cm) in
diameter are able to survive summer drought [<a href="#2">2</a>].
Early spring drought is more detrimental to nonnative annual grass
seedlings than to purple needlegrass seedlings. Purple needlegrass seedling growth in shade is
poor; in
field plots experimental removal of nonnative annuals increased seedling density
by 88% and increased biomass by 90% [<a href="#32">32</a>]. Annual seedlings' roots grow faster than
those of purple needlegrass; 1 study found soft chess root elongation rates under
controlled conditions were 50 to 100% greater than purple needlegrass [<a href="#1">1</a>]. Rapid
growth of annual grass roots causes rapid water depletion in surface soil and interacts with shading to
cause high purple needlegrass seedling mortality in spring [<a href="#9">9</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Asexual regeneration:</b></font>    
Purple needlegrass regenerates by tillering
and fragmentation of bunches. Fragmentation is an important form of
regeneration for purple needlegrass; it is an adaptation that allows recovery
from defoliation by high-intensity, short-duration grazing and/or fire
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SITE CHARACTERISTICS">
SITE CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Purple needlegrass habitats occur in areas with a Mediterranean
climate of mild, moderately wet winters and warm to hot summers with drought. The
growing season is 7 to 11 months long with 205 to 325 frost-free days. Mean
annual precipitation ranges from 5.9 to 19.7 inches (150-500 mm), with peaks from October
through March and from late April to early May [<a href="#15">15</a>].

<p>Purple needlegrass occurs on a variety of soil types but is
well adapted to
those with high clay content. Robinson [<a href="#58">58</a>] reports purple needlegrass dominant on sites in Monterey
County, California with high
clay content, and a &quot;sudden and dramatic&quot; change in vegetation to
nonnative annuals where clay content decreases. Stromberg and Griffin [<a href="#63">63</a>]
also found clay content in soils supporting native perennial grasses (purple needlegrass and Sandberg bluegrass)
higher than on sites supporting nonnative annual grasses. Purple
needlegrass often grows in mound topography wherein a claypan exists
approximately 7.9 inches (20 cm) below intermounds and 25.6 inches (65 cm) below mounds. Deeper soil on mounds often gives purple needlegrass an
advantage over annual&nbsp; grasses [<a href="#20">20</a>].</p>

<p>Purple needlegrass grows well where nonnative annuals are suppressed and, for
this reason, is generally more dominant on serpentine-derived soils than on
other soil types [<a href="#14">14</a>]. In northern coastal prairie, pure stands
often occur on serpentine ridges [<a href="#35">35</a>]. A vegetation survey at Jasper Ridge Experimental Area
on the San Francisco
peninsula found purple
needlegrass more dominant on serpentine than on sandstone areas; on sandstone
soils it was best developed on drier sites with lower aboveground standing crop.
Conversely, it had highest cover on wetter serpentine areas [<a href="#48">48</a>]. These patterns are generally consistent throughout the
species' range [<a href="#8">8</a>].</p>

<p>Purple needlegrass occurs from sea level to 5,000 feet (1,500 m) [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SUCCESSIONAL STATUS">
SUCCESSIONAL STATUS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Purple needlegrass is difficult to classify as a climax or seral species. Many
researchers, following Kuchler [<a href="#44">44</a>], have described the species as a climax that was
historically dominant with other perennial grasses throughout the valley and
coastal grassland and was displaced by nonnative annual grasses with overgrazing
in the mid-1800s [<a href="#7">7</a>]. More recently the former extent of purple
needlegrass has been debated, primarily because of limited physical
evidence of the composition of presettlement grasslands. Stromberg and others
[<a href="#62">62</a>]
state classification of purple needlegrass as a climax species is not supported
by long-term studies or critical review of existing evidence. This group and
others argue that large areas of the interior valley grassland
may have been occupied by native annual forbs that were quickly replaced by
nonnative annual forbs and grasses [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>]. Holstein [<a href="#39">39</a>] has also criticized the
climax classification of purple needlegrass, noting that in the valley and
foothill grasslands there are &quot;at least an order of magnitude&quot; more
prairie remnants dominated by rhizomatous beardless wildrye than by native
bunchgrasses. He suggests that beardless wildrye was more dominant on heavier soils,
while sandy areas were dominated by purple needlegrass. Keeley [<a href="#43">43</a>] has
stated purple needlegrass was historically more abundant and widespread, but in southern
California it was likely in isolated patches in dry areas similar to its
current habit.

<p>There are several possible origins of nonnative annual communities. Some current annual grasslands, both native and
nonnative, were created sometime prior to about 1920 when prescribed fire was
used to remove shrubs and improve forage production in chaparral
or coastal scrub [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>]. Additionally, some nonnative annual grasslands
are likely the results of overgrazing of native annual grasslands [<a href="#15">15</a>]. While early vegetation will not be known, it is apparent that the
assumption that all nonnative annual grasslands were dominated by perennial
bunchgrasses has led to many failed restoration attempts [<a href="#39">39</a>].</p>

<p>Despite disagreement about the former extent of purple
needlegrass, there is agreement that it is now suppressed by competition with nonnnative annuals. Invasion
by nonnative grasses and forbs has
been less complete on serpentine soils; these soils frequently support vigorous
stands of purple needlegrass [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>]. Dyer and Rice [<a href="#23">23</a>] observed competition effects by weeding nonnatives,
planting purple
needlegrass at different densities, and measuring growth and flowering for 3
years. Competition from nonnative annuals
restricted growth and flowering of purple needlegrass more than intraspecific
competition; intraspecific competition decreased productivity only in the
absence of nonnative annuals. Both inter- and intraspecific competition affected
flowering culm production more than vegetative production.</p>

<p>
Purple needlegrass response to disturbance is unique. It is seldom present on
formerly cultivated sites regardless of grazing history; these sites are
commonly occupied by relatively stable communities of native and nonnative
annuals [<a href="#63">63</a>]. Purple needlegrass and other native
bunchgrasses are well adapted to light grazing and defoliation by fire but not to high-intensity continuous grazing,
particularly under drought conditions [<a href="#6">6</a>].&nbsp;Pocket gophers occur
in high density (10 to 50 per acre (26-125/ha)) in some valley grasslands,
sometimes
disturbing up to 30% of the soil surface annually. This disturbance has
important implications for nitrogen cycling and generally favors annual grasses
over native perennials [<a href="#63">63</a>].</p>

<p>Where purple needlegrass occurs in mesic grasslands or in the understory of
woodlands, chaparral and coastal scrub, shrubs may gradually exclude herbaceous
vegetation in the absence of periodic disturbance (See the 'Fire Ecology'
section of this species summary). In a wide-ranging survey of northern
California, very few purple needlegrass individuals were found in areas with
more than 50% cover of woody species [<a href="#9">9</a>]. </p>

Summer drought and cold temperatures in winter induce dormancy. Vegetative growth
of purple needlegrass is greatest from March through late May or early June,
depending on onset of drought. Vegetative growth increases with
precipitation in the fall, which occurs in September or October. Freezing
temperatures in December generally stop growth [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>]. Flowers begin to
develop in early May, and seed is mature and dispersed by late July. The length
of time from flowering to seed ripening in purple needlegrass is similar to that
of nonnative annual grasses, but those species begin flowering approximately 1
month earlier [<a href="#40">40</a>].

FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS:</a>

<br />

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font>
After fire, cover, density, and
seedling establishment of purple needlegrass often increase as a result of increased soil temperature, light intensity,
and nutrient release, and decreased standing litter
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. Regeneration occurs
from tillers at the soil surface, fragmentation of bunches, and/or by seedling establishment. Stands that experience severe fire have larger decreases in
individuals'
basal area and foliage height in the 1st postfire year but are more likely to
increase by fragmentation. These patterns are more pronounced with short-duration
grazing, particularly in early spring [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. Annual grasses have larger seeds
than purple needlegrass and are better adapted to establishing in litter layers.
For this reason, fire can increase purple needlegrass seedling establishment,
particularly in old stands where litter accumulation is highest [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. Adult
individuals are also benefited by reduction of competition from annual grasses.
Even though fire during periods of rapid growth can be detrimental to purple
needlegrass, it is generally more damaging to nonnative annuals [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>]. Some studies,
however, have found fire and/or grazing effects on cover, density, or seedling
establishment of purple needlegrass were highly variable or insignificant,
suggesting a large influence of climate
on purple needlegrass' response to fire [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font>   
There is little
direct physical evidence of the historical extent of purple needlegrass, and less
about historic fire frequencies in the communities where it occurs. Most agree, however, that
purple needle grass' abundance was
historically greater, and fire exclusion has been a factor in its decline
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. In the coastal scrub, chaparral, and woodland fire frequency declined
in the early 1900s with restrictions against burning; in grasslands
fire frequency declined in the 1840s when heavy grazing and intermittent drought
reduced fuels [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>]. Before Spanish settlement, California prairie was used by tule elk,
pronghorn, and mule deer, but grazing was intermittent enough to
allow dominant grasses to regrow and support fire [<a href="#15">15</a>].
In many areas where purple needlegrass and nonnative annuals now coexist, purple needlegrass and native annuals were
historically mixed. Here, the
interaction of fire and grazing likely reduced competition from annual grasses,
reduced woody species encroachment, and improved purple needlegrass regeneration
[<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].</p>

<p>One study of vegetation dynamics in coastal sage scrub, chaparral, and coast
live oak
woodland near Santa Barbara found that without fire or livestock grazing, coastal
sage scrub was replaced by oak woodland at a rate of 0.3% annually. Grassland to
coastal sage scrub transition occurred at a rate of 0.69% per year, and oak
woodland reverted to grassland at a rate of 0.08% per year. On burned areas
without livestock grazing or on unburned sites with livestock grazing, rates of
transition of grassland to coastal scrub and coastal scrub to oak woodland were
lower. On areas burned without grazing or grazed without burning the rate of oak
woodland reversion to grassland was higher than on areas with neither burning
nor grazing [<a href="#16">16</a>].</p>

<p>In chaparral and coastal scrub, early postfire vegetation is dominated by
native and nonnative annuals. Herbaceous vegetation is greatest in areas where
fire eliminates nonsprouting shrubs [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>]. Purple needlegrass and other perennial grasses are more
abundant after
fire in coastal scrub than in chaparral. Fire repeated in less than
approximately 3-year intervals often causes the herbaceous sere to persist [<a href="#42">42</a>]. Conversion of purple needlegrass
grassland to coyote bush/ripgut brome communities has been observed with 24 years
of fire exclusion [<a href="#45">45</a>].</p>

<p>Purple needlegrass is present in oak and pine woodlands and in the early seral stages
of mixed evergreen forests, redwood and coast Douglas-fir forests.
Generally, purple needlegrass and other herbaceous species are present in later
successional oak
woodlands only in intercanopy areas. Closed stands have up to 5 inches (12.7 cm) of oak
litter that essentially eliminates grass growth [<a href="#55">55</a>]. Generally tree establishment is better after some shrubs have
established in grasslands excluded from fire or grazing. In these cases,
transition from grassland/coastal scrub mosaic to
mixed evergreen forest can occur in 50 years. In other cases, however, fire exclusion does not result in type conversion but rather
maintenance of a system wherein reversion and succession allow both
vegetation types to persist [<a href="#16">16</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Fire return intervals:</font> 
Greenlee and Langenheim [<a href="#30">30</a>] described fire regimes in purple
needlegrass associated communities in the Monterey Bay area
between aboriginal time and present. Their results, presented below, show the
large decline in fire frequency in coastal sage, chaparral, and forests, and
savannas in the recent era (1929 was chosen to
demarcate the recent fire regime because of restrictions that were put in place
against burning in the Santa Cruz area). &quot;Probable mean fire interval&quot;
refers to estimates of fire intervals that are derived from historical or very
limited physical evidence. Estimates of presettlement fire return intervals in
coastal terrace grasslands are similar to those reported below for prairie [<a href="#62">62</a>].</p>

IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Factors that influence
immediate severity of damage and subsequent recovery of purple needlegrass include fuel loading,
landscape position, fire seasonality, grazing, and abundance of annual grasses.
Older, decadent individuals, and/or those growing on mounds with litter accumulation, support more severe fire with more immediate damage [<a href="#21">21</a>].
Burned material senesces soon after fire but bunches often retain some green foliage in the
center and at culm bases until fall rain allows new growth. Carbohydrate
reserves decrease with burning, particularly with fire during periods of active growth [<a href="#45">45</a>].

PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:</a>
</span>
<br />

With rain after defoliation by fire, purple needlegrass grows new tillers from
meristems at the ground surface [<a href="#45">45</a>]. Often, growth the
fall after fire is limited because of carbohydrate loss, and increases in growth
rates (relative to unburned sites) are not observed until spring [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. Mowing treatments have produced
similar, though less pronounced effects, suggesting an important effect of
postfire nutrient release. One study comparing mowing and burning found that production of
purple needlegrass tillers
was increased 3- to 4-fold by burning and 2-fold by mowing [<a href="#1">1</a>].

<p>Recovery rate
depends on the type and extent of damage to purple needlegrass relative to the
reduction in competition from annuals. Where fire is relatively severe,
particularly in mound topography, individuals have an immediate reduction in
basal area and are likely to fragment [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. In such stands, increased density and
decreased basal area are noticeable for about 3 years after fire [<a href="#45">45</a>]. One study
found little effect of fire on density but a large
increase in basal area on sites with high density of nonnative annuals. This
was primarily because purple needlegrass competition with nonnative annuals had been severe before density
of annuals was greatly reduced by fire, allowing expansion of purple needlegrass
basal area via
increased tillering [<a href="#1">1</a>]. Mean foliage height (or mean maximum foliage
height) is often reduced for 1 year
after fire even if total productivity increases. This results because burned and
unburned plants initiate new growth from different heights: burned plants regrow
from basal meristems and unburned plants regrow from buds on culm bases in the
bunch interior.
Growth is also shorter on burned areas if fire burns the center of bunches where
the tallest growth originates [<a href="#45">45</a>].</p>

<p>Tussocks that are old and/or growing on mounds generally have higher litter
accumulations and greater immediate damage from fire than young and/or intermound plants. Fire temperatures are hottest
on mounds and may kill basal meristems in the centers of purple needlegrass bunches. This process creates
2 or more clones from 1 individual, which initiate tillers
on their exteriors. Postfire grazing greatly increases fragmentation. Many
researchers state that, prior to heavy continuous grazing by domestic livestock
in the 1800s, intermittent grazing and periodic fire interacted as important means of
purple needlegrass regeneration [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].</p>

<p>There is some debate about the effect of fire seasonality. Some have
cautioned against prescribed burning in spring because this causes greatest
carbohydrate loss and reduces purple needlegrass seed production by removing flowerstalks [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].
Fire in spring, however, also burns nonnative annuals in their period of rapid
growth and may therefore be a net benefit to purple needlegrass. One study
compared burning in June, August, and September and found each produced
significant (p&lt;0.05) increases in growth rates and basal area of purple
needlegrass with no significant effect of
fire seasonality [<a href="#1">1</a>].</p>

<p>Purple needlegrass density prior to fire influences postfire responses.
Ahmed [<a href="#1">1</a>] observed effects of fire in June,
August, and September on purple needlegrass when planted at low (40 individuals
per 96.8 square foot (9 m<sup>2</sup>) plot), medium (70 plants per plot), and high
(100 plants per plot) density.&nbsp; Fall growth was reduced by all fire
treatments; growth rates and basal area the following spring were higher than on
control plots. On plots with low density of purple needlegrass, spring growth increased
109%; on high density plots growth increased only 38% (percentages are based on
the aggregate data set from fires in June, August, and September). The
author concluded on low-density sites, reduction of competition from nonnatives
is more important than on high-density sites. These results could indicate
that fire regrowth is greater without conspecific competition [<a href="#1">1</a>].</p>

<p>Several researchers have noted short term increases in purple needlegrass seedling establishment
and seed viability following fire [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. Dyer and others [<a href="#22">22</a>] tested prescribed burning and
domestic sheep grazing effects on planted seedlings and natural seedling establishment.
Fire slightly increased purple needlegrass emergence for 1 year, but only 0.01% of seedlings
survived 4 years. No treatment had any significant effect on 4-year survival,
indicating that in some cases, establishment and survival to maturity may be influenced more by annual
climatic variation than by management practices.</p>

Prescribed fire has been used to reduce dominance of nonnative annuals and to
limit encroachment of woody species [<a href="#28">28</a>]. Prescribed fire also is used to limit coast Douglas-fir
invasion of oak woodlands, a process that reduces herbaceous diversity and
abundance [<a href="#14">14</a>].<br><br>

Most research regarding fire effects on purple needlegrass has pertained to its
recovery in inland habitats. Few have studied its response to fire in coastal
grasslands. Hatch and others [<a href="#33">33</a>] found that prescribed burning and grazing in purple needlegrass-dominated
coastal prairie had no significant effect on foliar cover or frequency of purple
needlegrass. The authors commented that fire and grazing differentially affected
California oatgrass, tussockgrass, and purple needlegrass, making restoration
efforts in coastal prairie difficult because treatments that improve 1 species'
status may be detrimental to other native species. They concluded that, in
contrast to inland habitats, fire and grazing manipulation are likely to be of
limited value in restoring oatgrass/needlegrass (<i>Nassella</i> spp.) coastal
prairie.

Purple needlegrass (<i>Nassella pulchra</i>) was the most prominent native grass; others included
saltgrass (<i>Distichlis spicata</i>), beardless wildrye (<i>Leymus triticoides</i>),
Lemmon's canarygrass (<i>Phalaris lemmonii</i>), and meadow barley (<i>Hordeum
brachyantherum</i>). Native forbs included common stickyseed (<i>Blennosperma</i>
<i>nanum</i>), triphysaria&nbsp; (<i>Triphysaria</i> <i>eriantha</i> ssp. <i>eriantha</i>),
and clover (<i>Trifolium</i> spp.). Nonnative grasses were all annuals; species
present were slender oat (<i>Avena barbata</i>), soft chess (<i>B. hordeaceus</i>),
ripgut brome (<i>B. diandrus</i>), mouse barley (<i>Hordeum murinum</i>), and
medusahead (<i>Taeniatherum caput-medusae</i>). Nonnative forbs present were filaree (<i>Erodium</i> spp.),
dovefoot geranium (<i>Geranium molle</i>), and smooth catsear (<i>Hypochoeris glabra</i>).

SITE DESCRIPTION:</a>
</span>
<br />


The site was characterized by mound topography with intermound areas having
poor drainage. Cover of native species was highest in intermound areas because
nonnative grasses' growth is limited by poor aeration in spring.&nbsp;

<p> Purple needlegrass individuals were marked on
mound and intermound sites and subjected to 6 treatments: prescribed fire or
fire exclusion in combination with short-duration domestic sheep grazing in early season, summer, and or excluded.
Early spring grazing consisted of 14 ewes
per plot for 2
to 4 days in late March or early April. Summer grazed plots had 15 ewes per plot
in late August. Grazing durations were determined by ocularly estimating when
herbaceous biomass was reduced to 570 pounds per acre (500 kg/ha) for the spring grazing treatment
and 1,360 pounds per acre (1,200 kg/ha) for the summer grazing treatment.
Grazing treatments were applied in seasons preceding and following fire.</p>

FIRE DESCRIPTION:</a>
</span>
<br />


Plots were burned at mid-day on September 1, 1988. Air temperature ranged from
75 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit (24-28 �C), and relative humidity ranged from 47 to 61%. Winds ranged from 6
to 16 miles per hour (10-25 km/h) with gusts of up to 25 miles per hour (40
km/h). Fuel loading was highest on ungrazed
mounds and lowest on summer grazed intermound areas.

<br />

Many burned plants senesced shortly after fire, but individuals retained some
green leaf material in bunch interiors and bases for the rest of the summer.
During the growing season burned plants grew from basal meristems at
the soil surface. Plants that were grazed but not burned grew from bunch
interiors and were therefore generally taller. Langsroth [<a href="#45">45</a>] observed changes
in average and
maximum foliage heights, live crown cover, fragmentation, basal area, seed
production, seedling establishment, and community composition for 2 years. Dyer
[<a href="#21">21</a>] commented on
general trends in the purple needlegrass population several years
thereafter.

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Foliage height:</b></font> 
Average and
maximum foliage heights were reduced by fire for 2 seasons. Fire
reduced December
1988 average foliage height 71% (p&lt;0.001), and maximum foliage height was
reduced
65% (p=0.013). Foliage height was most reduced by fire on mounds where the
highest fuel loading was present during fire. Grazing had no effect on burned
plant foliage heights. On unburned plots, summer and spring grazing both had
reduced foliage heights compared to ungrazed and unburned plots, but spring and
summer grazing were not significantly different from each other. By January 1990,
foliage heights were similar across all treatments.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Live crown cover:</b></font> 
Measured in December 1988, fire had no significant effect on
live crown cover of early-spring grazed intermound plants, while fire did
significantly (p=0.001) reduce live crown cover on summer grazed plots and
ungrazed plots. Plants
growing on mounds that were burned had reduced live crown cover, irrespective of
grazing treatment. Importantly, by January 1990, the immediate postfire effect
had reversed: burned plants had higher mean live crown cover (p=0.005) than unburned
plants (except on summer grazed intermounds and mounds (p=0.053)).</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Fragmentation: </b></font> 
Because of high litter accumulations and fire temperatures,
fragmentation was highest on mounds; grazing was important in causing
fragmentation in the 1st postfire year. Ungrazed plots that were burned showed
no fragmentation at all. Without fire, grazing did not increase fragmentation
significantly. The highest rate of fragmentation was on spring grazed, burned
plots, most likely because summer grazing lessened fire severity by removing
fuel.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Basal area:</b></font> 
Basal area of burned plants, measured in 1989, averaged 40% less
than unburned plants. Basal area of ungrazed or summer-grazed plants on mounds
was most
strongly (p=0.042) reduced by fire. Mean basal area of intermound plants
increased under all treatments.</p>

<p><b>Seed production:</b> 
One year after fire, burned plots had 32% fewer mature
reproductive tillers per plant (p=0.048). Early spring grazing also reduced
mature reproductive tiller numbers, particularly on intermound plants. Grazing
and burning had no significant (p&gt;0.05) effects on average number of seeds
per tiller. Fire reduced seed output but increased seed
mass.&nbsp;Fire caused a 45% reduction in mean number of seeds per plant
(p=0.01). Fire increased mean seed weight by 14% (p=0.002). Early spring grazed
plants had lower seed weights than summer grazed plants; this pattern was most
pronounced with grazing in combination with burning.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seedling establishment:</b></font> 
Seedling numbers (assessed in April following fire)
were variable, particularly for 2-tillered seedlings. On intermound areas,
ungrazed, unburned plots had higher seedling establishment (12.3 m<sup>2</sup>)
compared to early spring grazed (3.7 m<sup>2</sup>) or early spring burned plots
(3.1 m<sup>2</sup>). Intermound areas with other treatments had 5.8 to 8.1
seedlings per m<sup>2</sup>. Seedling establishment trends were reversed on
mounds: early spring grazed, burned plots had 13.1 seedlings per m<sup>2</sup>
compared to 1.9 m<sup>2</sup> on ungrazed, unburned plots.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Community composition:</b></font> 
On summer grazed plots, fire reduced total native
grass cover (p=0.048 for interaction of fire and grazing). With the
exception of purple needlegrass, native grasses individually had no significant (p&gt;0.05) trends in response to any treatments. For
nonnative annual grasses fire reduced total cover only on spring grazed or
ungrazed plots. Without fire, nonnative grasses' cover was most reduced by
spring grazing. Fire significantly (p=0.004) increased native forb frequency,
particularly on ungrazed plots where frequency increased 250%. Few native forbs
had significant individual responses to treatments. On plots with early spring
grazing or no grazing, fire increased exotic forb cover. In the absence of fire,
early spring grazed plots had higher exotic forb cover (grazing and fire
treatments were both significant, interaction term was not significant (p=0.09))
[<a href="#45">45</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Long-term responses:</b></font> 
Monitoring after 3 postfire years showed that many fire effects were
short lived, perhaps reflecting the sudden change in management from exclusion
of fire and grazing to introduction of both practices in the same year.
Increased fragmentation and decreased basal area of purple needlegrass because of burning and grazing
were no longer perceptible. After 3 years it was evident that while summer grazing reduced
purple
needlegrass more than spring grazing did, burned plots with summer grazing had
more native forb species [<a href="#21">21</a>].</p>

FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

This study highlights the value of prescribed fire and seasonal grazing for
improving purple needlegrass seedling establishment and competitive ability. One
notable result was the dramatic increase in purple needlegrass seedling establishment on burned
mounds, most likely because of reduction of competition from annual grasses. In
the absence of litter removal, nonnative grasses have a competitive advantage on
mounds because they, unlike purple needlegrass, are able to germinate in litter
and extend roots into soil. Seedling establishment and fragmentation of purple
needlegrass compensated
for short-term decreases in live crown cover, basal cover, and foliage height.
Also notable were the decreases in cover of native grass and forbs, indicating
that management to maximize purple needlegrass cover and minimize that of
nonnative annuals may be detrimental to other native species.

Purple needlegrass was an important source of food for herds of pronghorn, mule
deer, and Tule elk that were present in much of the California prairie; some
areas were intermittently occupied by herds of several hundred to 3,000
individuals. Purple needlegrass-dominated prairie was heavily used by livestock throughout
the 1800s, with cattle numbers peaking in about 1862 and domestic sheep numbers in about
1876. Jackrabbits, Beechey ground squirrels, kangaroo rats, and pocket gophers
are numerous throughout the valley grassland [<a href="#34">34</a>]. Purple needlegrass is an
important source of forage for livestock in California. Valley and foothill grasslands and savannas comprise only 15% of
California's land area but are now about 80% of the land used by livestock [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Palatability/nutritional value:</b></font>  Purple

Purple needlegrass is used in restoration projects and established by
transplants, drilled seed, or broadcasted seed [<a href="#65">65</a>]. Purple needlegrass has been used for competitive
reseeding after prescribed burning of grasslands invaded by yellow starthistle (<i>Centaurea
solstitialis</i>) and nonnative annual grasses [<a href="#47">47</a>]. One project in the Santa Monica Mountains used
seeded and transplanted purple needlegrass, tussockgrass,
California brome (<i>B. carinatus</i>), and smallflower melicgrass (<i>Melica</i>
<i> imperfecta</i>) for replacement of ripgut brome [<a href="#53">53</a>]. Irrigation has been
used to reduce purple needlegrass seedling mortality in summer [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Livestock grazing can increase purple needlegrass cover and reduce that of
nonnative annuals [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>]. One study noted a decrease in purple needlegrass cover from 65
to 10% with only several years of grazing exclusion. Large increases in cover
have been reported for winter and spring grazing on sites studied in southern
California. Grazing in spring may be more detrimental to mature individuals.
However, because nonnative annuals are better adapted to development under their
canopies than purple needlegrass, spring grazing generally increases purple
needlegrass seedling
establishment [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].<br><br>

Davis and
Sherman [<a href="#18">18</a>] studied the remaining population of Sonoma spineflower (<i> Chorizanthe
valida</i>), a plant listed by the state of California as endangered. The
population is located in Marin County. The authors state that though grazing maintains purple needlegrass and
reduces shrub invasion, it may be detrimental to Sonoma spineflower and other rare endemic
forbs.
