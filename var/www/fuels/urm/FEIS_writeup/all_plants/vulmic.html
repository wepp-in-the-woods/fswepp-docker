<b>COMMON NAMES : </b>
   small fescue
   Nutall's fescue


<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The fully documented scientific species name of small fescue is Vulpia
microstachys (Nutt.) Benth.  Many varieties are recognized [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>]:

      Vulpia microstachys var. microstachys
      Vulpia microstachys var. pauciflora (Beal) Lonard & Gould
      Vulpia microstachys var. ciliata (Beal) Lonard & Gould 
      Vulpia microstachys var. confusa (Piper) Lonard & Gould 
 
The annual fescues, described as only weakly distinguished from
perennial fescues, were previously placed in the subgenus Vulpia within
the genus Festuca.  Most American researchers now follow European
workers in giving the annual fescues generic status [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Most annual fescues have little forage value [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Small fescue is
relatively unpalatable and is increases in response to grazing [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Small fescue is relatively unpalatable to most species of wildlife and
livestock.


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Small fescue provides only minimal cover for most species of wildlife.


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Grazing results in a reduction of perennial grasses and an increase of
small fescue [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vulpia microstachys
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Small fescue is a weedy, native, annual, with erect or geniculate culms
growing from 5.9 to 13.8 inches in height (1.5 dm-3.5 dm) [<a href="#4">4</a>].  The
often purplish-tinged spikelets or branches of inflorescences are three-
to five-flowered, and glumes are glabrous [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>]. 


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Therophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Small fescue, an annual, reproduces by seed which drops to the ground at
maturity.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Small fescue occurs on dry to moderately moist, disturbed sites [<a href="#4">4</a>].  It
codominates with annual hairgrass (Deschampsia danthonioides) and hairy
brome (Bromus commutatus) on many Oregon bluegrass (Poa spp.) scabland
sites [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Vulpia microstachys var. pauciflora grows well on sandy,
disturbed sites, whereas V. m. var. microstachys occurs most commonly in
loose soil on open slopes, and along ditches and roadways [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Vulpia
microstachys var. ciliata grows on loose sandy soil of forest openings
[<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Although small fescue is present in several climax communities, it is
most abundant on early seral sites.  In threetip sagebrush, (Artemisia
tripartita)-Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis) communities of Washington
and Oregon, small fescue increases in response to disturbance along with
cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), and plantain (Plantago spp.), while
perennial grasses decrease [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Following disturbance in Washington
steppe communities, small fescue becomes increasingly abundant as
perennial grasses decline [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Small fescue begins growth in the spring and matures earlier than
associated perennial grasses.

<pre><center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vulpia microstachys
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
There is little specific information on the adaptations of small fescue
to fire; other annual fescues generally increase in abundance after fire
[<a href="#2">2</a>].  Small fescue reoccupies a site through seed.  In many areas,
annual fescues mature early and drop their seeds before most wildfires
occur [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Seeds are apparently undamaged by fire when buried in the
soil, and late season fires probably have very little effect on small
fescue.

Recovery is rapid where viable annual fescue seeds remain buried in the
soil, with an abundance of seedlings growing to maturity during the
first year after the burn [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Small fescue generally increases in
response to heavy grazing and other types of disturbance [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>], and it
is likely that fire creates an environment favorable to the germination
and growth of this species.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>

<pre><center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vulpia microstachys
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Little is known about the specific effects of fire on small fescue.  The
dry foliage of annual grasses is typically consumed and the plant killed
by fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Reestablishment of a site is through seed.  Seeds buried in the soil can
probably survive most fires.  Where seeds do survive fire, recovery is
rapid, with numerous seedlings germinating during the year after the
burn.  The relationship between fire intensity and severity, and seed
surviviorship has apparently not been examined.  Potential differences
in plant response according to season of burn are also unknown.

NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
NO-ENTRY
