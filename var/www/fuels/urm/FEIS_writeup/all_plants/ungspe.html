<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Wood of the Mexican buckeye is reddish-brown, soft, brittle, and close
grained [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Sapwood is lighter in color [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Plants can be cut back
regularly for firewood [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Mexican buckeye is seldom browsed by domestic livestock except during
periods of food scarcity [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Fruit and leaves contain the toxic
alkaloid saponin which is poisonous to livestock [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Mexican buckeye
may be responsible for occasional losses of cattle and goats in parts of
southern New Mexico [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Seeds are eaten by insects and some small mammals after they fall to the
ground [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Mexican buckeye browse is relatively unpalatable to domestic livestock.
The sweet-tasting seeds [<a href="#16">16</a>] are readily eaten by a variety of small
mammals [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Nutritional value of Mexican buckeye foliage has been documented as
follows [<a href="#8">8</a>]:

                (percentage composition - dry weight)

Protein  Ether    Crude  N-free  H2O   Ash  Potash  Lime  Magnesia  Phosphoric
         extract  fiber  extract                                    acid

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Mexican buckeye presumably provides cover for a variety of wildlife
species.  Trees may also produce shade for domestic livestock.


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Mexican buckeye can be planted as a shade tree or as an ornamental in
landscaping [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  It is attractive when either planted alone or
intermixed with other species [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Fragrant, showy flowers enhance its
attractiveness during the spring [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Mexican buckeye can be
trained as a hedge, planted onto berms of earth-covered homes, and used
as a "display thicket shrub" [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Flowers provide nectar for honey
bees, and it is considered a good honey plant [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Children of west Texas reportedly use the round seeds of Mexican buckeye
as playing marbles [<a href="#23">23</a>].  However, in view of its toxicity to rats in
laboratory studies, this use should probably be discouraged.


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Toxicity:  The sweet seeds of Mexican buckeye taste like pistachio nuts
and were formerly considered as a potential human food source [<a href="#19">19</a>].
Stanford [<a href="#19">19</a>] and his colleagues reportedly consumed up to 20 seeds
without suffering ill effects.  However, results of laboratory tests
with rats soon put an end to these culinary experiments.  Rats which had
ingested Mexican buckeye seeds soon exhibited numerous signs of both
neurological and organ damage and most died within 3 weeks [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Seeds
can cause dizziness, nausea, and abdominal discomfort in humans [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].

Spider infestations:  Fruit of Mexican buckeye is commonly infested with
spiders [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Where infestations occur, seeds may be "glued" to the
capsules by web-building activities and commonly remain on the tree
until the following spring.  On the average, approximately 10 percent of
all fruit is infested [<a href="#19">19</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ungnadia speciosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Mexican buckeye grows as an upright or spreading, multistemmed shrub or
small tree [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  It commonly reaches 4 to 15 feet (1.2-4.6 m) in
height but on favorable sites can grow to 30 feet (9.5 m) with trunk
diameters of 10 inches (25.4 cm) [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Bark is a mottled light
gray to brown, with shallow fissures developing on old trunks [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].
Slender brown to orange, pubescent twigs become reddish-brown and
glabrous with age [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Some roots grow horizontally along the rock or
soil surface while others extend deep into the vertical face of soft
rock cliffs [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Leaves of Mexican buckeye are deciduous, alternate, and odd-pinnately
compound [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  The three to seven ovate-lanceolate leaflets are
leathery with crenate-serrate margins [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  The upper surface is
dark green and glabrous, whereas the lower surface is paler and
pubescent to glandular [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Small fragrant flowers are rose to purplish-pink and are borne in
clusters on bare stems [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Fruit is a woody, reddish-brown,
three-lobed pod or capsule 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5-3.8 cm) in diameter
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  The shiny, dark brown to black, rounded seeds average
approximately 0.4 to 0.6 inch (1-1.5 cm) in diameter [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Seeds are
smooth, leathery and "buckeyelike" [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Each capsule generally
contains a single seed [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (nanophanerophyte)
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (microphanerophyte)
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (mesophanerophyte)
   Burned or Clipped State:  Chamaephyte
   Burned or Clipped State:  Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Mexican buckeye reproduces through seed or by vegetative means.  However,
seedlings are rarely observed under natural conditions [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Seed:  Mexican buckeye first flowers during the 3rd year when plants
have reached approximately 2 to 3.5 feet (0.6-1.1 m) in height [<a href="#19">19</a>].
Each plant produces an abundance of seed annually.  Some seed falls from
the plant when fruit first ripens in the fall.  However, some fruit may
persist on the tree through winter [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].

Seedlings grow well in full sun on warm, damp soil.  Those grown in even
partial shade may appear stunted and eventually die.  Conditions
necessary for seedling establishment, such as warm, but moist soil and
full sun, may be rare in the desert Southwest.  Seedling establishment
generally occurs only in years with unusually abundant late summer and
early fall rainfall.  During the course of an 8-year study, Stanford
[<a href="#19">19</a>] observed Mexican buckeye seedlings in only 1 year.  Under optimum
greenhouse conditions, germination rates can exceed 95 percent [<a href="#19">19</a>].
Seedling emergence by planting date has been documented as follows [<a href="#19">19</a>]:

date collected     date of     color              1st yr.
and planted        emergence   of seed            development

 8/31              9/18        fully brown        good

Vegetative regeneration:  Mexican buckeye coppices readily [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Plants
cut to ground level at 4- or 5-year intervals retain good vigor and
growth [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Mexican buckeye grows on lower mountain slopes and foothills, in
arroyos, and along streambanks in valley bottoms [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  It commonly
occurs on the exposed face or rim of chalk caprock cliffs and along
fractures or depressions in igneous or limestone outcrops [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].
Mexican buckeye is tolerant of full sun and thrives under drought
conditions [<a href="#19">19</a>].  It is commonly associated with deciduous riparian
woodlands, oak-juniper woodlands, and desert grassland communities
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].

Plant associates:  Common associates include Ashe juniper (Juniperus
ashei), netleaf hackberry (Celtis reticulata), live oak (Quercus
fusiformis), Lacey oak (Q. glaucoides), Texas persimmon (Diospyros
texana), black walnut (Juglans nigra), bumelia (Bumelia lanuginosa), and
black cherry (Prunus serotina) [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Soils:  Mexican buckeye typically grows on well-drained calcareous
soils [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

Elevation:  In Trans-Pecos Texas, Mexican buckeye grows from 1,000 to
6,500 feet (305-1,981 m) in elevation [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Mexican buckeye grows in a number of riparian woodland communities.
These woodlands generally represent climax or "postclimax" communities
[<a href="#4">4</a>].  Little is known about the successional role of Mexican buckeye in
oak-juniper woodlands or in desert grassland communities.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Mexican buckeye flowers approximately 10 days after buds first appear
[<a href="#19">19</a>].  In Trans-Pecos Texas, flowering occurs from March to June [<a href="#16">16</a>].
Leaves develop soon after the flowers [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Fruit ripens in July [<a href="#19">19</a>]
or as late as August or October [<a href="#23">23</a>]. Fruit turns dark brown in the fall
and unopened capsules may persist through the winter [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Plants
become dormant within 2 weeks of the first frost or at leaf fall [<a href="#19">19</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ungnadia speciosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Wright [<a href="#24">24</a>] notes that fires have historically been relatively
unimportant in the Chihuahuan Desert, which is dominated by shrubs
rather than grasses.  Mexican buckeye often occurs in deciduous riparian
woodlands, which burn infrequently.

It is not known whether Mexican buckeye possesses specific adaptations
to fire.  However, the majority of shrubs indigenous to southwestern
Texas sprout readily from the root crown after fire [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Mexican
buckeye coppices from the root crown after mechanical removal [<a href="#19">19</a>], and
postfire sprouting is possible.  Natural seedling establishment is
extremely rare [<a href="#19">19</a>], but limited seedling establishment from off-site
sources may occur in unusually moist years.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by animals or water; postfire yr 1&2

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ungnadia speciosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
The effects of fire on Mexican buckeye have not been well documented.
Aboveground portions of the plant are presumably killed by fire.
However, postfire survival of the root crown is possible, if not likely.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
The response of Mexican buckeye to fire is not well known.  Plants
coppice readily after mechanical removal [<a href="#19">19</a>], and a similar response is
possible after fire.  Establishment of some seed from off-site may occur
in years of unusually abundant summer and fall rainfall.  However,
seedling establishment is extremely rare under ordinary conditions [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Bock and Bock [<a href="#3">3</a>] report that prescribed fire is "difficult to manage
and potentially very destructive" in established riparian woodlands of
the Southwest.  These relatively rare and fragile areas provide
important food and cover for desert wildlife [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Because browse and
cover are often limited in these areas, burning is not generally
recommended [<a href="#25">25</a>].
