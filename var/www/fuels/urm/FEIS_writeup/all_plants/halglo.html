<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted name of halogeton is Halogeton glomeratus (M.
Bieb.) C. A. Meyer; it is a member of the goosefoot family
(Chenopodiaceae).  One author relegates halogeton to synonymy with the
European species, Halogeton sativus (L.) Moq. [<a href="#98">98</a>].  However, most
authors recognize halogeton as a separate and distinct species
[<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>].  There are no subspecies, varieties, or forms.

<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Halogeton is an introduced species from southeastern Russia and
northwestern China [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>].  In the United States, halogeton is found
in the Rocky Mountain and Great Basin regions and in two disjunct

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Halogeton is typical in disturbed sites in salt-desert shrubland and
surrounding big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) steppe types, and in
transition zones from shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia) to big
sagebrush [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>].  Where halogeton is the dominant forb, shadscale
is the dominant shrub in the salt-desert shrubland; halogeton may also
occur in various associations with other shrubs, such as winterfat
(Ceratoides lanata), bud sagebrush (Artemisia spinescens), greasewood
(Sarcobatus baileyi), and spiney hopsage (Atriplex spinosa) [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].
Infrequently, halogeton is a dominant understory forb in western juniper
(Juniperus osteosperma) communities.  Halogeton occurs as a dominant or
codominant with other annuals, such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and
tansymustards (Descurainia pinnata and D. sofia).

Publications that list halogeton as a dominant forb in habitat types in
Nevada are:

Vegetation and soils of the Crane Springs watershed [<a href="#12">12</a>],
Vegetation and soils of the Cow Creek watershed [<a href="#13">13</a>],
Vegetation and soils of the Duckwater watershed [<a href="#14">14</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Halogeton glomeratus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Halogeton is high in oxalates and is a serious health threat to grazing
animals, especially sheep [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>].  A sheep will be killed by
12 to 18 ounces [0.3-0.5 kg] of halogeton [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Symptoms of halogeton
poisoning have been described [<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>].  There is no treatment once an
animal is poisoned [<a href="#99">99</a>].

The amount of soluble oxalates in halogeton varies by season, locality,
and part of plant eaten [<a href="#55">55</a>].  As a halophyte, halogeton makes excessive
amounts of oxalic acid in response to excessive uptake of sodium ions
[<a href="#41">41</a>].  While halogeton is growing, oxalates are highly concentrated; 17
to 30 percent of dry plant weight is soluble oxalates [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  Sheep
can safely consume halogeton after the soluble oxalate concentrations
are reduced through leaf loss or leaching by rain or snow [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>].
Additionally, calcium-fortified pellets have been recommended as
supplements to sheep feeding in halogeton range, to compensate for the
calcium precipitation from the blood by oxalates [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>].  Van Dyne
[<a href="#103">103</a>] recommends against using halogeton as forage [<a href="#103">103</a>].  However,
other studies indicate that halogeton is useable when it is mixed in
small amounts with other forage [<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>].  Krueger and Sharp [<a href="#57">57</a>]
reported that sheep can adapt to halogeton if it is fed to them in
gradually increasing amounts.  Adapted sheep can detoxify 75 percent
more oxalate than nonadapted sheep [<a href="#57">57</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability is extremely low, and halogeton is seldom eaten by livestock
[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>].  The palatability of halogeton is listed as poor for ungulates
in Montana, Utah, and Wyoming [<a href="#28">28</a>].  In Utah and Wyoming, halogeton
palatability is fair for small mammals, good for game and nongame birds,
and poor for waterfowl [<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Halogeton provides poor environmental protection for ungulates, game
birds, and waterfowl in Utah and Wyoming [<a href="#28">28</a>].  In these states, it provides
fair protection for small mammals and nongame birds [<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Halogeton is a noxious weed that must be prevented from establishing on
denuded or disturbed soils in the semiarid shrublands of the western
United States.  Halogeton makes an area less favorable for revegetation
with other species; it is difficult to establish desirable plants where
halogeton occurs [<a href="#59">59</a>].  At mine reclamation sites, several studies have
measured changes in halogeton establishment or abundance over many years
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>].  One study examined leachate from three levels of halogeton
mulch.  They found significant soil alteration:  increases in pH,
exchangeable sodium, potassium, magnesium, electrical conductivity, and
decreases in water percolation [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  High salts inhibit
micro-organisms aiding nitrification, which depresses plant growth [<a href="#33">33</a>].
Halogeton does not form mycorrhizae and does well in mine spoils with
diluted or eliminated vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhize [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].  Goodman
[<a href="#42">42</a>] added nitrogen to enhance native plant production, and halogeton
biomass doubled compared to unfertilized controls.


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Halogeton readily invades and dominates rangeland depleted by persistent
and continuous overgrazing [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>].  Heavy sheep losses from
halogeton poisoning have occurred since 1940 on ranges in Idaho, Nevada,
and Utah [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].  The rapid spread of halogeton from 1935
through the 1940s, coupled with extensive livestock poisonings, resulted
in the Federal Halogeton Control Act [<a href="#63">63</a>].

The best defense against halogeton is a vigorous stand of perennial
range plants and variations in grazing patterns [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>].
Moderate range use only after the growing season is the wisest halogeton
strategy [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>].  Efforts must be taken to prevent vegetation
destruction by rodents and rabbits, road construction, surface mining,
or the use of off-road vehicles [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Three methods are used to control halogeton [<a href="#24">24</a>].

(1) Cultural control:  Introduced perennials, such as immigrant kochia
(Kochia prostrata), were planted with successful decrease in halogeton
cover [<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>].  Crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum and A.
desertorum) was seeded extensively in depleted winter rangeland to slow
halogeton growth [65,111,113 but see 64,76].  Crested wheatgrass does
not suffer from halogeton competition, but from the saline-alkaline site
conditions where it occurs [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Some hybrids (for example, A.
desertorum cv.  Hycrest) can tolerate saline conditions.  Asay and
Johnson [<a href="#3">3</a>] found that a heavy halogeton infestation was essentially
elimated by year 2 after seeding with Hycrest.

(2) Biological control:  A stem-boring moth (Coleophora porthenica) from
Pakistan was released for halogeton control [<a href="#77">77</a>].  However, it failed to
establish.  The search for a biological control agent continues in
Soviet central Asia [<a href="#77">77</a>].  A case-bearing moth (Coleophora
atriplecivora) has been found on halogeton [<a href="#69">69</a>].  It is not currently
known what effect it has on halogeton; however, Moore and Stevens [<a href="#69">69</a>]
found that the case-bearing moth reduced seed production and foliage in
fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens).

Altered grazing practices can slow halogeton spread.  Studies showed
that high intensity grazing in early spring (March and April) increased
halogeton cover significantly in Utah [<a href="#106">106</a>].  Heavy spring grazing
causes rapid rangeland deterioration [<a href="#60">60</a>].  Halogeton was reported to
decrease in Nevada under early (mid-April to mid-June) grazing at
moderate intensity [<a href="#85">85</a>].

(3) Chemical control:  Halogeton is susceptible in the preflowering
stage to 2,4-D at 2 pounds active ingredients per acre (2.2 kg ai/ha)
[<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].  Approximately 17 percent of the plants survive this rate
[<a href="#101">101</a>].  Higher 2,4-D rates of six pounds active ingredient per acre (6.7
kg ai/ha) are recommended to kill all halogeton; however, native plants
are severely impacted [<a href="#23">23</a>].  The application of 2,4-D must be repeated
annually for 6 to 10 years after the final halogeton seed crop [<a href="#99">99</a>].

Herbicide control is too expensive to be used on low-production ranges
on which halogeton occurs [<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>].  Widespread herbicide control of
halogeton was stopped because land managers did not have desirable
forage to replace halogeton, especially on saline-alkaline soils
[<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Halogeton glomeratus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Halogeton is an exotic succulent annual forb [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>].  It has a
generalized type of root system; the taproot can penetrate as deep as 20
inches (51 cm), with a radial spread of 18 inches (46 cm) [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Many
main stems branch from the base of the plant and are low spreading
before becoming erect [<a href="#107">107</a>].  Halogeton can be a few inches high in
dense stands to 2 feet [61 cm] high in widely spaced stands [<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>].
Leaves are small, fleshy, and spine tipped [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  Flowers are
inconspicuous in leaf axils and produce winged black and wingless brown
seeds [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Therophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Halogeton can produce 75 seeds per inch (35 seeds per cm) of stem, which
is 200 to 400 pounds of seeds per acre (222-449 kg/ha) [<a href="#25">25</a>].  It
produces two types of seeds which are important to its spread and
persistence.  The production of brown seed is controlled by long
photoperiods; black seeds are produced during short photoperiods [<a href="#114">114</a>].
Black seeds have no dormancy and are viable for 1 year [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>].
Late germinating and maturing plants only make black seeds [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>].
Brown seeds have a dormancy and can survive buried for up to 10 years
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>].  This allows halogeton to survive during extended drought
periods.  Brown seeds readily germinated under moist conditions after a
3-month cold (35 degrees Fahrenheit [5.4 deg C]) treatment [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>].

Halogeton has many agents of dissemination.  Halogeton seeds have a high
degree of viability after passing through the digestive tracts of sheep
and rabbits [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Animals are capable of spreading large amounts of
seed great distances; seeds pass with the feces [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>].
Halogeton seeds are rapidly spread along roads by road equipment,
especially road graders [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Local spread of halogeton is primarily by
the wind [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>].  Halogeton will break off at ground level when dry and
tumble with the wind, scattering mature seeds [<a href="#109">109</a>].  Whirlwinds or
dust-devils will transport dry stems with seeds up to 2 miles (3.2 km)
[<a href="#24">24</a>].  Western harvester ants collect seeds [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Brown seeds recovered
from anthills gave 5 to 20 percent germination [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Halogeton is adapted to alkaline soils and semiarid environments
[<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>].  Halogeton is found from 2,526 to 7,218 feet (770-2,200 m) in
elevation throughout its range [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  It occurs on soils that
are heavy clays, clay loams, sandy loams, and loamy sands [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].
Although halogeton can occur on many soil types, the sites usually are
saline [<a href="#63">63</a>].  Halogeton does best in soils where sodium chloride levels
are 5,800 p/m; increased salt does not increase the water requirements
of halogeton [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Soils may or may not have a prominent hardpan;
carbonates accumulate near the soil surface [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Soils are light
colored because little humus is present [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>].  The soil pH ranges
from 8.0 to 9.0 [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Typically, there are large fluctuations in
daily temperatures [<a href="#61">61</a>].  Mean annual temperature is 42 degrees
Fahrenheit (5.5 deg C).  The abundance of halogeton depends upon year to
year precipitation, so outbreaks may sporadically appear [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>].
Annual precipitation at most halogeton sites is from 5 to 13 inches
(127-330 mm) [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Approximately, 60 to 70 percent of precipitation
occurs as snow [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].

Halogeton has invaded open or disturbed ground such as dry lakebeds and
rodent workings [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>].  Halogeton infests domestic stock trails,
overgrazed rangeland, and livestock congregation areas [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].
Halogeton invaded the disturbed areas left after dryland farms,
townsites, and mining camps were abandoned in the 1930's [25,33,52,56,
109].  Halogeton occurs in railroad rights-of-way, along road shoulders,
airstrips, and gravel pits [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>].

Associated species, in addition to those previously mentioned (see
Habitat Types), are clasping pepperweed (Lepidium perfoliatum),
povertyweed (Iva axillaris), and bur buttercup (Ranunculus testiculatus)
[<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>].  Common grass associates are Indian ricegrass (Oryzopsis
hymenoides) and bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides) [<a href="#44">44</a>].
Halogeton occurs with Gardner saltbush (Atriplex gardneri) in Colorado
and Wyoming [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

Halogeton is a ruderal species that readily invades disturbed,
saline-alkaline ground where other species offer no or little
competition [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>].  Halogeton does not establish in
vigorous competing vegetation because it does not grow a large shoot or
root system early in the growing season [<a href="#32">32</a>].

In the alkaline valley soils where halogeton occurs, shadscale
vegetation is considered an edaphic climax [<a href="#115">115</a>].  Human use leads to
permanent changes in the flora of disturbed arid environments [<a href="#56">56</a>].
After 70 years of grazing on some sites in the Great Basin, halogeton
was dominant on moderately disturbed areas with cheatgrass and shadscale
[<a href="#56">56</a>].  Halogeton may permanently change soil surfaces via salt pumping
which impedes moisture infiltration and enhances evaporation [<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>].
In a comparison of plots on areas that were grazed or protected for 15
years, Branson [<a href="#17">17</a>] observed that no succession occurred or that it
occurred very slowly.

Cleared big sagebrush areas follow a succession pattern that currently
climaxes in cheatgrass. Nelson and others [<a href="#72">72</a>] state that the succession
through introduced annuals to a cheatgrass climax is maintained by fire.
The order of appearance of vegetation changes are Russian thistle
(Salsola kali), tumblemustard (Sisymbrium altissimum), pinnate
tansymustard (Descurainia pinnata), and cheatgrass [<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>].  Young and
others [<a href="#116">116</a>] added halogeton to this sequence as an initial invader.
Halogeton is also a part of another seral continuum that climaxes with
medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae) [<a href="#116">116</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Depending upon moisture, halogeton seedlings establish from February
through August, with a peak in April [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>].  Halogeton builds its
root system during the cool weather, and topgrows during warmer weather
[<a href="#54">54</a>].  Seedlings begin rapid vegetative growth in May [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>].  Growth
can continue through June; the best halogeton development occurs when
soil temperatures are between 60 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (15-27 deg C)
[<a href="#32">32</a>].  In Utah, halogeton biomass was 4.1 pounds per acre (4.7 kg/ha)
over 5 years [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Near the first part of July, the plants cease
vegetative growth and begin reproductive growth [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Plants flower
during July and August.  Seeds begin to mature late August to early
September and are mature in October [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>].  The frosts in October
and November will kill any plants not yet dried [<a href="#51">51</a>].  The majority of
black seeds are dropped by early November; however, brown seeds persist
and may remain on the plant until January or February [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Black seeds
may germinate after mid-December under favorable conditions [<a href="#24">24</a>].
Halogeton is a winter annual in the broad sense; plants may germinate in
the fall, winter, or spring, depending upon soil moisture [<a href="#92">92</a>].  Two
authors [<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>] state that halogeton is a warm-season plant; however,
since vegetative growth usually ceases at the end of June and seedling
establishment occurs predominantly in April, Parker [<a href="#74">74</a>] considers it a
cool-season plant.

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
After halogeton dries, it does not readily decompose, which increases
fuel loads [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Dried halogeton is capable of spreading fire; flaming,
wind-thrown plants may enter unburned areas.  Halogeton can tumble
across burned areas, spreading seed [<a href="#109">109</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Immediate effects of fire on halogeton were not found in the literature.
Halogeton is probably killed by fire; any seeds remaining on the plants
would also be killed.  Seeds present in the soil before fire are
probably destroyed.  Halogeton seeds are killed at 158 degrees
Fahrenheit (70 deg C), which is considerabley lower than soil surface
temperatures that may occur in sagebrush fires [<a href="#90">90</a>].  Mack [<a href="#63">63</a>],
however, reported that halogeton seed survives summer fires in steppe
communities.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Halogeton seeds are probably transported from off-site into burned areas
within 1 or 2 years postfire [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Two years after a fall burn in
central Idaho where perennial plants were not damaged, halogeton
appeared [<a href="#36">36</a>].  One year following an Idaho burn that destroyed all
aboveground vegetation, halogeton increased in abundance, and by
postfire year 2, it had significantly increased in biomass [<a href="#45">45</a>].
Halogeton increased in frequency each year for 3 years postfire in
another study [<a href="#90">90</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Prescribed burning will not control halogeton.  It colonizes from
off-site, readily invading bare or disturbed soils.
