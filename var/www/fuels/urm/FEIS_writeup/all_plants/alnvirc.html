<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
American green alder is a dominant or codominant in a variety of
habitats.  It may occur as an understory dominant in open conifer
forests with black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (P.  glauca),
lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and jack pine (P. banksiana)
overstories; and in open and closed deciduous forests with paper birch
(Betula papyrifera), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), balsam poplar
(P. balsamifera), and red alder (Alnus rubra) overstories.  American
green alder can dominate in shrub types (often with Salix spp.) and on
open, moist tundra [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].

The following publications classify American green alder as a dominant
shrub layer component:

<pre><center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Alnus viridis ssp. crispa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Alders (Alnus spp.) are used as a source of firewood in regions where
fuels are scarce [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Native Americans in Alaska consider alder a
prime fuel for smoking salmon [<a href="#39">39</a>].



<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
American green alder generally is of low value as browse for big game,
but it is consumed in small quantities by deer [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  In some areas,
however, it is utilized heavily by moose [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>] and caribou
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].

Although American green alder is a principal component in mountain goat
foraging areas, goats do not browse it.  The alder shrubs do, however,
provide ground cover that lessens snow accumulation, making lady fern
(Athyrium filix-femina) more accessible to mountain goats [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Muskrat, beaver, cottontail, and snowshoe hares feed on alder twigs and
foliage [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Many birds eat alder seeds, buds, and catkins [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].
American green alder is an important component of white-tailed ptarmigan
winter forage [<a href="#58">58</a>].
 
Alder can be an important secondary forage for livestock, especially
cattle [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability of alder to big game and livestock is generally low
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
American green alder often forms dense thickets which serve as cover for
many wildlife species.  Big game animals use alder for hiding and escape
cover.  Bird species use alder thickets for nesting, feeding, and
resting [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
The major value of American green alder in rehabilitation is its ability
to invade sterile soil and increase the organic matter content by
nitrogen fixation [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  American green alder can fix nitrogen at a
rate of 18 to 55 pounds per acre (20-62 kg/ha) per year [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Soil
fertility increases as the plant looses leaves and other parts and the
nitrogen-containing materials become available to decomposer species in
the soil [<a href="#51">51</a>].  The nitrogen content in soil after glaciation is at a
maximum when inhabited by mature alder, but is slowly depleted as spruce
(Picea spp.) takes over [<a href="#53">53</a>].
  
Alders contribute to the reduction of soil erosion [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>] and help
to stabilize alluvial deposits [<a href="#50">50</a>].

American green alder recovered well within 2 to 3 years after an oil
spill near Norman Wells, Northwest Territories [<a href="#59">59</a>].  It was also noted
for its ability to colonize tailings at the Discovery Mine, Northwest
Territories [<a href="#59">59</a>].
 


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Alder bark is very astringent and has been used medicinally by Native
Americans.  It has also been used in the tanning of leather and dying of
textiles [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
American green alder can be a major competitor of conifer seedlings
following timber harvest.  Dense thickets can prevent conifer
establishment over large areas [<a href="#24">24</a>].  However, due to its
nitrogen-fixing ability, alder can improve soil fertility [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  It
is also a nurse tree for conifers such as spruce (Picea spp.), pine
(Pinus spp.), and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) on
nitrogen-deficient soils [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Some suggest that conifers should be
established prior to the alder to ensure that conifer growth is not
hindered [<a href="#24">24</a>].

American green alder is a key indicator species of productive lodgepole
pine stands in subalpine regions in British Columbia [<a href="#26">26</a>].

When desired, alder stands can be established on cool, moist sites by
direct seeding or planting 2- and 3-year-old seedlings.  Nondormant
seeds should be sown in the spring and dormant seeds in the fall.
Unstratified alder seeds will germinate but at a slower rate than
stratified seeds [<a href="#59">59</a>].  Overmature thickets cut in the spring or winter
will rapidly regrow [<a href="#25">25</a>].

Control:  In the Caribou Forest Region of British Columbia, ripping
apart clumps of alder with V-shaped or straight-blade plows has been
successful at setting back the alder enough to establish a softwood crop
[<a href="#24">24</a>].  When applied as stump, basal, or foliage sprays, 2,4,5-T or 2,4-D
control alder effectively [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Alnus viridis ssp. crispa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
American green alder is a deciduous, ascending shrub usually reaching up
to 10 feet (3 m) in height [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  Occasionally, it may reach
heights of 20 to 30 feet (6-9 m) [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Growth rates vary with site
and location, but usually decrease at higher elevations [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].
American green alder often forms dense thickets [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  The bark is
yellowish-brown and twigs have sessile, pointed axillary buds [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].
Leaves are ovate or elliptic and glabrous above, but pubsecent below.
The margins are serrated with very fine teeth [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].

The roots of American green alder are shallow and have nodules
containing nitrogen-fixing microorganisms [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction:  American green alder is monoecious [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].
The female catkins turn woody and conelike at maturity.  The seeds are
winged nutlets [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>] that are dispersed by wind and water [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].
One study estimated American green alder seed to be 40 percent viable
[<a href="#61">61</a>].

Germination from seed on disturbed habitats is the primary form of
reproduction for American green alder [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  The seeds invade and
colonize bare mineral soil [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>] in areas such as avalanche tracks,
talus slopes, fresh alluvium, and soils left by retreating glaciers
[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  In interior Alaska, the frequency of occurrence of alder
species is three times greater on bare mineral soil than on organic
surfaces [<a href="#60">60</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  American green alder sprouts from the root
crown if damaged or cut.  Sprouting often occurs after mechanical site
preparation [<a href="#24">24</a>] and natural disturbances such as avalanches [<a href="#41">41</a>] and
fire [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
American green alder occurs at elevations from sea level to 6,600 feet
(2,000 m) [<a href="#21">21</a>] on steep to level terrain.  It occupies habitats ranging
from open tundra to open conifer forests [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>] but cannot withstand
a dense overstory [<a href="#24">24</a>].  It can occur singly or in thickets along
streams, lakeshores, coasts, bogs, or muskeg margins, and as an
understory component in conifer forests [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  American green alder
is usually associated with some source of moisture, but is adapted to
somewhat drier conditions than other alders [<a href="#21">21</a>].  The wetter sites are
more favorable for high nitrogen-fixing activity [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Its shallow
roots make it well adapted to the generally cold, harsh climate
characteristic of sites which it inhabits, where the soil may be only
shallowly thawed [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

Soil textures range from sandy to gravelly or rocky; green alder often
occurs on morainal soil left by retreating glaciers [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  Soils
supporting American green alder in deglaciated areas are generally
acidic (pH 5.0-6.5) [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

American green alder is semi-shade tolerant [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>] and is considered a
pioneer or seral species [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  It invades and inhabits terraces
above the floodplain which are subject to occasional flooding [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>],
and is a pioneer on alkaline glacial outwash [<a href="#59">59</a>].  After fire, American
green alder sprouts from the root crown and establishes by seed from
plants in adjacent unburned areas [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  The bare mineral soils
created by these disturbances are prime sites for American green alder.
These shrubs provide shade that reduce soil temperatures, allowing
spruce and other genera to establish [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>]. 


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
The pistillate catkins of American green alder emerge before or with the
leaves in spring; staminate catkins are produced during the previous
growing season [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  Flowering takes place from May to June,
with fruits maturing in July [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  Cones ripen from mid-September
to mid-November, depending on latitude and elevation, and seed dispersal
takes place immediately thereafter [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  The leaves do not turn
color, but remain green until they are dropped in the fall.

<pre><center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Alnus viridis ssp. crispa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
American green alder is considered a survivor species because it sprouts
from basal or underground parts following fire [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Additionally,
its wind-dispersed seeds quickly colonize bare mineral soils exposed by
fire.  Regeneration from sprouting and the establishment of seedlings
allow American green alder to reestablish at a fairly rapid rate
following fire [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  American green alder is very adaptable
and is successful regardless of length of the fire cycle [<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tall shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<pre><center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Alnus viridis ssp. crispa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
American green alder does not burn easily, and dense stands can
sometimes prevent fire spread [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  However, light- to
moderate-severity fires can kill aerial portions, and high-severity
fires can remove the organic layer and leave charred roots exposed,
eliminating sprouting from underground parts [<a href="#60">60</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
American green alder sprouts from the root crown following fire
[<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  The sprouting response is usually immediate and generally
results in an increased number of plants [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  American green
alder also reestablishes by seed dispersed from adjacent, unburned
areas.  Green alder is abundant in areas with a history of frequent
fires.  This nitrogen-fixing alder may be favored over other invading
species by severe fires that remove the surface organic matter [<a href="#42">42</a>].
Alder invasion and persistence are favored by fire, but total recovery
is slow [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  One study in central Alberta showed prefire
American green alder cover to be 36 percent, while 1 year later it was
only 4 percent [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Repeated fires near treeline and in wet sites can
result in thickets of American green alder [<a href="#23">23</a>].
