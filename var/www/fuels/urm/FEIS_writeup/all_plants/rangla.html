<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Sagebrush buttercup is common throughout many habitat types and plant
communities.  It is present in a number of ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>), 
fir-spruce (<i>Abies-Picea</i> spp.), Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesia</i>), and
pinyon-juniper (<i>Pinus-Juniperus</i> spp.) habitat types, as well as in sagebrush 
(<i>Artemisia</i> spp.), other shrubland, and grassland communities. The typical 
variety most commonly grows in lowland valleys in sagebrush and grasslands 
or in parks or open woodlands [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>].  Elliptical buttercup occurs on upper
sagebrush slopes and at higher elevations with juniper (<i>Juniperus</i> spp.), 
ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pine (<i>Pinus jeffreyi</i>), firs, and spruces [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="green"><b>SPECIES: Ranunculus glaberrimus
</b></font><hr size="3">
<pre><b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Wildlife species generally use sagebrush buttercup early in the
year because palatability decreases as the plant matures [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Deer and
elk feed on sagebrush buttercup in the early spring before other, more
preferred forage species become available [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Domestic livestock also utilize sagebrush buttercup during the early
spring, although the plant is usually gone before these animals reach
the range [<a href="#11">11</a>].  All species of <i>Ranunculus</i> have an "acrid
taste" and, depending on the species, plant part, and season, may
be toxic to cattle and horses [<a href="#11">11</a>].  The toxic substances are
volatile, however, and are dissipated during the drying process, which
renders them harmless in hay [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Due to its small stature, prostrate growth form, and patchy
distribution, sagebrush buttercup provides little cover for wildlife.


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability of sagebrush buttercup is highest in the early spring and
decreases until the plant disappears from the range in midsummer [<a href="#11">11</a>].
The palatability and degree of use by livestock and wildlife species for
elliptical buttercup in several western states has been
rated as follows [<a href="#3">3</a>]:

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Elliptical buttercup is rated fair in energy and protein value [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
No information is available on this topic.


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Sagebrush buttercup has low potential for erosion control and for long-
and short-term revegetation projects [<a href="#3">3</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="green"><b>SPECIES: Ranunculus glaberrimus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sagebrush buttercup is a native, cool-season annual or perennial forb
that grows from 2 to 6 inches (5.1-15 cm) in height [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  
The stem or stems are erect to prostrate, 2 to 8 inches (5-20 cm)
long, and simple or branched [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Sagebrush buttercup grows from a
cluster of fleshy roots [<a href="#6">6</a>]; broad basal leaves are rounded or ovate,
with margins indented to form few to many shallow lobes [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Elliptical 
buttercup has entire, elliptic to oblanceolate basal leaves, while
the typical variety has ovate to obovate, shallowly lobed
basal leaves [<a href="#6">6</a>].  The 5 sepals are most commonly purplish-tinged;
cuneate to flabellate petals also grow in groups of 5 and are yellow. 
The fruit is an achene [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sagebrush buttercup regenerates sexually through seeds and vegetatively 
through root sprouting [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].  From 
30 to 150 seeds are contained in each semiglobose cluster of achenes at the top 
of the flower stalk [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sagebrush buttercup is fairly widespread throughout its range and occurs
in a number of plant communities from sagebrush-grassland to higher
elevation montane sites.  The typical variety grows on drier sites and at
lower elevations than does elliptical buttercup [<a href="#2">2</a>].  

Sagebrush buttercup grows on sandy or loamy soils [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Growth
on clay is described as fair to good, and growth on gravel as fair to
poor [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Optimum soil depth is 20 inches (51 cm) or more [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Elevational ranges of both varieties are as follows [<a href="#3">3</a>]:

Elliptical buttercup:  from 5,000-10,000 feet (1,525-3,050 m) in CO
                       3,200-9,000 feet (976-2,745 m) in MT   
                       5,500-9,000 feet (1,678-2,745 m) in UT
                       6,600-11,600 feet (2,013-3,538 m) in WY
          
Typical variety:  from 3,200-5,000 feet (976-1,525 m) in MT
                       5,000-6,800 feet (1,525-2,074 m) in UT



<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Sagebrush buttercup is most often a constituent of early seral communities.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Sagebrush buttercup is a cool-season annual or perennial that flowers
very early [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  It is the 1st flower of spring throughout most of its 
range, and has flowered as early as January 5 in the vicinity of Reno, Nevada [<a href="#2">2</a>].  
Flowering dates are as follows [<a href="#3">3</a>]:

         Beginning of Flowering            End of Flowering
  CO            April                            June
  MT            April                            July
  ND            April                            May
  WY            April                            July
  UT            April                            July

Growth is generally completed by mid-summer [<a href="#11">11</a>].

<pre><center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="green"><b>SPECIES: Ranunculus glaberrimus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Little is known about the adaptations of sagebrush buttercup to fire.
It is known to reproduce vegetatively through root sprouting in response
to disturbance [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Sagebrush buttercup was present at postfire year 1
on burned plots in western Montana grasslands, although it was absent on
adjacent plots [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Caudex/herbaceous root crown, growing points in soil<br>   Geophyte, growing points deep in soil
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

</pre>

<pre><center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="green"><b>SPECIES: Ranunculus glaberrimus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Sagebrush buttercup flowers very early in the year and disappears before
mid-summer [<a href="#11">11</a>].  It therefore is in a dormant state during the time most
fires in the plant communities it inhabits occur.  Even when fires
consume the foliage, reestablishment may be fairly rapid through root
sprouting.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
No further information is available on this topic.


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Relatively little is known about the manner in which sagebrush buttercup
responds to fire.  Sagebrush buttercup is capable of reproducing
vegetatively when the foliage is consumed by fire [<a href="#3">3</a>], and evidence
suggests that reestablishment may be rapid.  In a western Montana study,
sagebrush buttercup was present on first-year burn plots in grassland
communities, although absent at adjacent unburned plots [<a href="#9">9</a>].
