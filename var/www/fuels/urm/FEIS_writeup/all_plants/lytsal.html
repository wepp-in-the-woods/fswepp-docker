 The currently accepted scientific name of purple loosestrife is <i>Lythrum salicaria</i>
L. (Lythraceae) [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">Purple loosestrife will hybridize with
European wand loosestrife (<i>Lythrum virgatum</i>) and winged loosestrife
(<i>Lythrum alatum</i>) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>]. A
number of different horticultural cultivars have been developed from purple
loosestrife and wand
loosestrife. Although some are purported to be sterile, crosses within and
between cultivars and wild <i>Lythrum</i> spp. are often compatible, and
identification of cultivars and crosses is problematic [<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>].

As of this writing (2002), purple loosestrife is listed as a noxious weed in 29
states in the U.S. and 2 Canadian provinces. See the <a href="https://invader.dbs.umt.edu/">Invaders</a>
or <a href="https://plants.usda.gov/">Plants</a> databases for
current information. The state of Minnesota has prohibited the sale of European wand
loosestrife and any cultivars from crosses between purple and European wand loosestrife
[<a href="#139">139</a>].

GENERAL DISTRIBUTION:</a>

<br />


Purple loosestrife occurs in all but 6 states of the continental United States
[<a href="#132">132</a>] (see <a href="distribution_and_occurrence.html#States"> STATES</a> below). It is found along the Atlantic coast from North Carolina to
Maine [<a href="#129">129</a>] and is scattered but
spreading in the western United States [<a href="#82">82</a>]. Purple loosestrife occurs most
commonly in the United
States in the Midwest and Northeast, corresponding closely with the
geographic extent of the Wisconsin glaciation [<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>]. It is distributed across the southernmost tier of Canadian
provinces from Newfoundland to British Columbia, with northern limits generally
around 51� N [<a href="#80">80</a>]. The greatest concentrations in Canada are in southwestern Quebec, southern
Ontario, southern Manitoba, and in British Columbia's lower Fraser Valley [<a href="#47">47</a>].
The <a href="https://plants.usda.gov?">Plants Database</a> provides a map to
purple loosestrife's distribution in the United States.

</p>


<p class="subframeContent">Considered native to Eurasia [<a href="#125">125</a>], purple loosestrife has a widespread circumpolar
distribution throughout the northern hemisphere, except in extremely cold and
arctic regions [<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. Although the precise origin of purple loosestrife colonization in North America
is unknown, it was well established by the 1830s within coastal wetlands along
the New England seaboard, having likely been introduced via ship ballast soil. Further
introductions are thought to have occurred intentionally by early American
horticulturalists. Initial spread of purple loosestrife into the interior of eastern
North America occurred primarily via routes of maritime commerce, such as
canals, rivers and the Great Lakes. Spread into the arid West appears to
be closely related to development of irrigation systems within that region [<a href="#129">129</a>].

</p>


<p class="subframeContent">
The following biogeographic classification systems are presented as a guide to
demonstrate where purple loosestrife could potentially be found based on reported occurrence
and on biological tolerance to factors likely to limit its distribution. For
instance, because purple loosestrife does not tolerate salt water,
classifications describing a variety of salt marsh habitats are excluded from
these lists. Additionally, many of these classifications are named for
predominantly upland habitats that nevertheless contain sometimes-substantial
wetland areas where purple loosestrife could potentially occur. Precise distribution
information is lacking because of gaps in the understanding of biological
and ecological characteristics of non-native species and because introduced
species may still be expanding their habitable range. Therefore these lists are speculative and may not be
complete.

Purple loosestrife is found across a variety of freshwater wetland
habitats in North America, and consequently is associated with a variety of
plant taxa, functional guilds and communities. Habitats where it is likely to be
found include: freshwater marshes [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>], streambanks or lakeshores

[<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>]. Purple loosestrife is listed by the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service Office of Biological Services as a typical broadleaf plant of
Palustrine Persistent Emergent Wetlands [<a href="#30">30</a>].

GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Purple loosestrife is a non-native, perennial wetland herb [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. Stems are erect,
1 to 8 feet
(0.3-2.4 m) tall, becoming woody with age and persisting through winter and up to 2
years [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>]. Mature, long-established plants are often
10 feet (3 m) tall and 5 feet (1.5 m) wide [<a href="#129">129</a>]. Plants may become increasingly bush-like by producing greater numbers
of
basal stems from the same rootstock each year [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>].
Plants begin producing multiple stems from a single rootstock as early as the
2nd growing season [<a href="#102">102</a>].
Anderson [<a href="#1">1</a>] recorded single genets with over 130 stems produced from a
single rootstock during a single season. He also estimated ages for individual
plants up to 22 years. Observations have been recorded
of particular rootstocks failing to generate shoots during a given year, but
producing aboveground growth during each prior and subsequent season&nbsp;
[<a href="#129">129</a>].


</p>


<p class="subframeContent">Leaves are 2 to 6 inches (5-14 cm) long and attached close to the stem [<a href="#14">14</a>]. Flower spikes vary in length from &gt; 40 inches (1 m) to
only a few inches, and only 2 to 3 inches (5.1-7.6 cm) of the spike typically display open flowers at any given
time [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>]. Fruits are capsules 2-3 mm in length [<a href="#57">57</a>]. Seeds measure approximately 400 x 200 microns, and weigh approximately
1.8 x 10<sup>-6</sup> 
ounces (50 �g) per
seed, which is comparatively quite small among North American temperate wetland
plants [<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>].


</p>


<p class="subframeContent"> Seedlings
quickly develop a thick, hardened taproot [<a href="#113">113</a>]. Mature plants subjected to persistent flooding respond by forming aerenchymous
(containing large intercellular air spaces) tissue, permitting oxygen flow to submerged roots [<a href="#118">118</a>].


</p>


<p class="subframeContent">The preceding description provides characteristics of
purple loosestrife that may be relevant to fire ecology and is not meant to be
used for identification. Keys for identifying purple loosestrife are available
in various floras (e.g. [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>]). Photos and descriptions of purple loosestrife
are also available online from <a href="https://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/esadocs/lythsali.html">The
Nature Conservancy's Wildlands Invasive Species Team</a> and <a href="https://www.seagrant.umn.edu/exotics/purpleid.html">Minnesota

<font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Breeding system:</b></font>  Purple loosestrife is a
tristylous species (3 different style lengths), usually in a 1:1:1 ratio,
indicating sexual reproduction is probably its most important means of
regeneration [<a href="#9">9</a>]. It is primarily an outcrosser, as self-pollination in purple loosestrife is rare, and has
been shown to reduce seed production [<a href="#113">113</a>]. 

</p>



<p class="subframeContent">

<font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Pollination:</b> </font>Purple loosestrife is insect pollinated. Most reports
indicate honeybees are the main pollinators [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>]. Others include bumblebees
[<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>], leaf-cutter bees and carpenter bees [<a href="#73">73</a>], as
well as a variety of butterflies [<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>]. Hummingbirds have been observed taking nectar from purple
loosestrife in British Columbia [<a href="#98">98</a>], although pollination by
hummingbirds is undocumented. 

</p>



<p class="subframeContent">

<font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Seed production:</b> </font>Purple loosestrife produces an immense number of
seeds. Estimates of seed production rates range from just over 100,000 seeds per
plant for young plants with single stems [<a href="#113">113</a>], to over
2.5 million seeds per plant for established plants with an average of 30 stems
per plant [<a href="#129">129</a>]. Although perennial, purple loosestrife is capable of
producing viable seed during its 1st growing season [<a href="#116">116</a>].



Seed output is largely a function of plant age,
size, and vigor [<a href="#129">129</a>]. Shoots growing in relatively dense stands tend to produce
fewer and smaller inflorescences than those growing in more open areas [<a href="#102">102</a>].
</p>



<p>
<font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Seed dispersal:</b></font>  Because seeds are small and light they are thought to be
dispersed, at least in part, by wind [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>]. However, Thompson and others
[<a href="#129">129</a>] report observations
that seedling densities decline sharply within a 33 foot (10 m) perimeter of the parent
plant and seedlings are often distributed downslope from the parent plant rather
than downwind, suggesting a limited role for wind dispersal. Dispersal via
moving water is also likely [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>]. Seeds and
cotyledon stage seedlings are reportedly buoyant [<a href="#9">9</a>], although there
are reports that purple loosestrife seeds don't float [<a href="#119">119</a>]. Floating seeds may disperse to suitable sites for
establishment. Seeds that sink may germinate while submerged, then rise to the
surface and drift to suitable sites for establishment [<a href="#129">129</a>].
Seeds may be transported in fur of
mammals, plumage of waterfowl, mud attached to footgear, vehicle treads or cooling systems of outboard motors [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. Thompson and others [<a href="#129">129</a>] also suggest
birds may deposit
ingested seeds in areas where wind or gravity-mediated dispersal seems
unlikely.
</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Seed banking:</b></font> Given its high seed output and ability to produce seed
in its 1st growing season, purple loosestrife can establish substantial soil
seed banks. Seeds may remain viable for at least 2
to 3 years [<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>],
although the long-term viability of seeds stored in the soil seed bank remains under
investigation [<a href="#139">139</a>]. Seeds may remain viable even when
subjected to saturating conditions.
Viability of seeds that were stored underwater was tested at 4-month
intervals under ideal germination conditions. Germination declined from an initial
rate of 99% to 93% after 1 year and 80% after 2 years [<a href="#102">102</a>].

</p>
<p> Purple loosestrife has the potential to dominate the soil seed bank where
it becomes well established. Soil samples taken from within purple loosestrife stands in emergent wetlands in
southeastern Minnesota
contained an average of 37,963 purple loosestrife seeds per ft<sup>2 </sup>(410,000
/m<sup>2</sup>) in the top 2 in (5 cm) of soil. Seeds were distributed within
this entire profile and seed density increased with proximity to the soil
surface. Under greenhouse conditions
chosen to promote germination, and using soil samples from the above source
spread 0.4 in (1 cm) deep, recruitment failed to exhaust the seed bank
[<a href="#138">138</a>,<a href="#140">140</a>]. From the same experiment, purple
loosestrife seedlings were found in 91% of untreated (no herbicide) 6.6 x 6.6
feet (2 x 2 m) quadrats, the most
frequently encountered species in the soil seed bank [<a href="#140">140</a>].<br><br>

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Germination:</b>

</font> Germination is greatest in unshaded, wet soils, with temperatures &gt;68
degrees Fahrenheit (20� C)
[<a href="#20">20</a>]. Shamsi and Whitehead [<a href="#113">113</a>]
demonstrated germination is constrained at low temperatures between about
50 to 59 degrees Fahrenheit (10�-15� C), and no germination occurred below 57
degrees Fahrenheit
(14� C). Experimental evidence indicates seed dormancy may be enforced by burial, with germination response
decreasing linearly (p = 0.001, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.89) from 90% at the soil
surface to 0% at 0.8 in (2 cm), even under conditions known to
promote germination in wetland plants [<a href="#138">138</a>]. Any disturbance
that redistributes seeds to within the upper 0.8 inch (2 cm) of soil is likely to promote germination. Although light exposure is a prerequisite for germination, length
of exposure does not appear important [<a href="#111">111</a>]. Purple loosestrife seeds are capable
of germinating underwater [<a href="#65">65</a>].

</p>
<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seedling establishment/growth:</b></font> Favorable recruitment conditions are largely a function of disturbance that
creates areas where little to no vegetation is present [<a href="#99">99</a>]. Estimates of maximum initial seedling
density vary greatly, from 926 to 1,852 foot<sup>-2</sup> (10,000-20,000 m<sup>-2</sup>) on bare open mudflats
[<a href="#102">102</a>] to 2.8 to 4.6 foot<sup>-2</sup> (30-50 m<sup>-2</sup>) in vegetated
semiflooded wetlands. In areas where large numbers of seeds are present in the
seed bank, small changes in area favorable for establishment can yield large
fluctuations in recruitment [<a href="#1">1</a>].</p>


<p> In order
to begin successful establishment, floating seeds or propagules must settle on
moist soil [<a href="#129">129</a>]. Purple
loosestrife can establish in soil beneath standing water [<a href="#65">65</a>].</p>


<p> Growth is limited by cold temperature and is
considerably slowed at around 46 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit (8-10� C) [<a href="#141">141</a>]. Light
availability can also limit growth and development. Under diminishing light
intensities, vegetative growth is slowed, the numbers of flowers, fruits, and
seeds per fruit are fewer, and the average dry weight of fruits declines, but
there is no change in average dry weight of individual seeds [<a href="#111">111</a>]. Growth is
also affected by day length. Shamsi and Whitehead [<a href="#111">111</a>] found leaf area
and plant dry weight were significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced when plants were
subjected to a 9-hour photoperiod compared with a 16-hour photoperiod. Plants in
the 9-hour treatment grew in a comparatively flattened, semi-prostrate
condition.</p>


<p class="subframeContent">

<font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Asexual regeneration:</b> </font> The rootstock is the main organ of perennation, and
unaided wide vegetative spread is unlikely. New shoots arise from buds at the top of the rootstock
[<a href="#113">113</a>]. Root
crowns expand annually to accommodate increasing numbers of shoots, but may
reach maximum growth at around 20 inches (0.5 m) in diameter [<a href="#129">129</a>].

</p>


<p class="subframeContent">

Purple loosestrife can consistently resprout in response to aboveground
 damage, often fairly rapidly. A greenhouse experiment showed 91% of clipped seedlings resprouted
within 42 days [<a href="#40">40</a>].

 Live
stems that are dislodged and buried can give
rise to new shoots via adventitious buds [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. 

</p>


<p class="subframeContent">
<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SITE CHARACTERISTICS">
SITE CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Throughout its global distribution purple loosestrife is strongly linked with
temperate climate and moist or saturated soils [<a href="#129">129</a>]. Unshaded, newly-exposed,
moist soil appears most favorable for seedling establishment. Riverine
habitats subjected to periodic but infrequent scouring, or lacustrine habitats
subject to periodic water level reduction such as drought-exposed lakeshore or
seasonal impoundment drawdown are good examples of habitats at risk of invasion.
Once purple loosestrife seedlings become established, adults are
quite flood tolerant [<a href="#118">118</a>]. Moisture is the most critical
factor for growth and reproduction, but well-established plants can persist at dry
sites for many years [<a href="#21">21</a>]. Keddy and Ellis [<a href="#65">65</a>] examined purple loosestrife
seedling recruitment along
a water level gradient, simulating conditions ranging from water levels 2 inches (5 cm) below
the soil surface to standing water up to 4 inches (10 cm) above the soil surface.
They found there
was no significant (p =
0.44) effect of water depth on
germination and early establishment of seedlings, indicating a broad tolerance
for water level in the recruitment phase of purple loosestrife life history. Stream corridors with steep elevational gradients may
be less susceptible to colonization by purple loosestrife due to gravitational
constraints on seed dispersal [<a href="#128">128</a>].

</p>

<p class="subframeContent"> Northern limits of purple loosestrife distribution may be strongly
influenced by low growing season temperature. Under controlled conditions,
growth was severely restricted at 46.4 degrees Fahrenheit (8 �C) compared with more
&quot;characteristic&quot; growth at 64.4 degrees Fahrenheit (18�C) [<a href="#112">112</a>].

</p>

<p class="subframeContent"> Purple loosestrife
is found on both calcareous and acidic soils [<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>] and tolerates low-nutrient soils
[<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>]. Typically found in open areas, purple loosestrife
will tolerate some shade, but growth, reproduction and survival may be substantially reduced under shaded
conditions [<a href="#110">110</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>].

</p>

<p class="subframeContent"> Several characteristics of wetland or riparian
habitats have been identified that may be predictive of invasibility by purple
loosestrife. Assuming dispersal is largely via floating propagules, isolated
wetland basins may be less susceptible to purple loosestrife colonization than
areas with interconnected waterways. Additionally, narrow streams with steep
gradients are probably less susceptible, because they are frequently scoured and
contain fewer areas of slack water, while slower, broader flows are more likely
to contain habitat suitable for colonization. Riparian areas that are mostly
shaded are also less susceptible because purple loosestrife seedlings require
relatively high light levels. Finally, the presence of one or more commonly
associated taxa, such as cattails (<i>Typha</i> spp.), reed canarygrass (<i>Phalaris
arundinacea</i>), sedges (<i>Carex</i>) spp., and rushes (<i>Juncus</i> spp.) may
indicate a habitat that is highly susceptible to invasion by purple loosestrife
[<a href="#129">129</a>].

<br />

The ways and extent to which purple loosestrife affects succession in wetland
plant communities are not altogether clear. It is evident that purple
loosestrife requires open, moist, bare substrate for establishment (see <a href="#Site Characteristics"> Site
Characteristics</a> and <a href="botanical_and_ecological_characteristics.html#Regeneration Processes"> Regeneration Processes</a> above). It is generally
agreed that purple loosestrife is a pioneer or gap-colonizing species that
quickly responds to site disturbance by recruiting often-substantial numbers of
new genets from a pre-existing seed bank [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>].

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">
Purple loosestrife displays many characteristics typical of pioneer species, such as rapid
maturity, high seed production, tolerance of nutrient-poor environments, and
high germination success. Yet North American populations, once established, also
are potentially long-lived
(22+ years), capable of growing to a relatively large size, and have shown the
propensity for near-continuous, low-level recruitment in the absence of large-scale
disturbance [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. While evidence is somewhat limited, it is speculated natural mortality rates in adult plants are quite low [<a href="#1">1</a>].

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">
Purple
loosestrife, once established, can persist within a site for relatively long
periods, even in the absence of frequent disturbance. After examining purple loosestrife population
structure within several different communities in eastern Massachusetts, Anderson [<a href="#1">1</a>]
concluded low levels of nearly-continuous recruitment are likely to occur
in areas where mature plants (and the inevitable prodigious purple loosestrife
seed bank) are present. Additionally, this trend is punctuated by occasional
disturbances that provide conditions suitable for short-lived recruitment episodes in which relatively large cohorts of new
plants are established.

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">
But there is some question regarding the view that purple loosestrife inevitably dominates
invaded sites in virtual monotypic stands. Anderson [<a href="#2">2</a>] points out that in a widely cited review by
Thompson and others [<a href="#129">129</a>], estimates of the proportion of stand biomass attributed to purple loosestrife,
which ostensibly increased over time following establishment, may instead have been
attributable to increases in the number of stems per genet rather than greater
numbers of individual plants. The number of
annually produced stems per single
genetically distinct plant has been shown to be a good predictor of the age of that
individual [<a href="#1">1</a>]. Anderson [<a href="#2">2</a>] also notes observations described in
Thompson and others [<a href="#129">129</a>] were
strictly visual assessments, and since no hard data was collected, there is
no way to definitively ascertain what, if any, changes in biomass distribution
among species may have occurred.

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">In its native range, European populations of purple
loosestrife may also form large monospecific
stands following pregrowing season disturbance, but are prone to invasion by
other species soon after stand establishment [<a href="#110">110</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>].
Whitehead [<a href="#141">141</a>] described the gradual yielding of monospecific stands of purple
loosestrife to mixed species communities in England as being due to slow growth
of purple loosestrife during periods of cool spring temperatures compared with
competitors possessing low-temperature growth capabilities such as cattails or
reeds (<i>Phragmites</i> spp.) It is likely that an aggregate of factors act to
limit purple loosestrife site dominance in its native habitats [<a href="#118">118</a>].

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">
Thompson and others [<a href="#129">129</a>] have reviewed several
historical accounts of purple loosestrife stands, both in its native Europe and
elsewhere. They determined that while purple loosestrife seldom maintains strong
community dominance in native (European) habitats, it commonly forms dense, long-lasting,
virtually monospecific stands in areas where it is not native, especially
temperate North America. They considered 3 factors that could possibly account
for this phenomenon: 1) the absence of many key insect predators that
effectively reduce competitiveness of European purple loosestrife plants, 2)
predominance of the muskrat in its native North American habitat and the impact of its
selective foraging behavior on cattails 
(see <a href="management_considerations.html#Importance to livestock and wildlife"> Importance to Livestock
and Wildlife</a> or <a href="management_considerations.html#Impacts and Control">Impacts
and Control</a> in the MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS section),
and 3) the possibility that North American purple loosestrife may have evolved
adaptive traits which make it more vigorous and competitive than its European
relatives.

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">Many factors are likely to affect the
ability of purple loosestrife to form and maintain extensive
monodominant stands in North American wetlands. Characteristics
particular to certain classes of habitat may lead to monodominance. Auclair and others [<a href="#8">8</a>] have noted some
trends in 2 distinct plant communities of
Huntington Marsh, located along the St. Lawrence River near the junction of the
Quebec, Ontario and New York borders. In the emergent aquatic community, the
dominant emergent taxa tended to exclude each other,
resulting in a mosaic of nearly monospecific communities. In particular, river
bulrush (<i>Schoenoplectus fluviatilis</i>), common reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>) and
narrow-leaved cattail (<i>Typha angustifolia</i>) displayed this
phenomenon. In contrast, sedge meadow communities were much more diverse and
lacked the dominance and segregation of species. Instead they demonstrated
subtle gradients in composition that were generally difficult to discern.

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">
The nature of particular disturbance events may also impact initial floristics
and subsequent successional trajectories. For instance, the relative
competitiveness of purple loosestrife seedlings following disturbance may depend upon when initiation of the new seedling community occurs within the
growing season. Because purple loosestrife growth rates are closely linked to
day length [<a href="#111">111</a>], early summer establishment of a
seedling cohort or community, compared with late summer establishment, is more
likely to result in a monospecific stand of purple loosestrife because purple
loosestrife seedlings will be more competitive [<a href="#102">102</a>].

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">
More research is needed to help elucidate the means and extent to which purple
loosestrife alters successional trajectories and community dynamics. Long-term
studies that examine preinvasion vs. postinvasion data would be particularly
helpful.

<br />

 Flowering typically occurs 8 to10 weeks following
germination [<a href="#113">113</a>]. Onset of rapid growth and eventual flowering is strongly influenced by
photoperiod length. Purple loosestrife plants grown under controlled conditions
were examined for effects of day length on growth and development. It was
determined a critical photoperiod of 13 hours is required to enable
formation of &quot;highly competitive morphogenetic entities&quot;. When
subjected to shorter daylength, plants had substantially reduced vegetative
growth and little to no flowering. [<a href="#111">111</a>]. Most reports
indicate flowering commences sometime in June and ceases in September [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. Both mature plants and seedlings whose growth rates
were tracked throughout the growing season in central New York reached at least
90% of their final height by August 3 [<a href="#102">102</a>]. Senescence proceeds with the onset
of fall frost, marked by the turning red, fading and abscission of leaves.
Dead but rigid stems remain standing through winter and spring. Seed capsules
also remain attached to flower stalks through winter [<a href="#128">128</a>].

<br />

<font face="Bell MT">Fire adaptations:</font>  Purple loosestrife is an
herbaceous perennial, with growing points that overwinter on the root crown
about 0.8 inches (2 cm) below the soil surface (see <a href="botanical_and_ecological_characteristics.html">BOTANICAL
AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</a> section). Consequently, it is likely to
survive the heat of most surface fires. In addition, postsenescent purple
loosestrife stems remain standing through winter. Because a substantial amount
of fuel remains standing in monodominant stands at any given time, and because it occurs on mostly wet
soils, very little accumulation of fine fuels occurs on the soil
surface. As a result, fire in purple loosestrife is unlikely to provide enough
heat or burn for a long enough duration to cause substantial damage to
belowground plant organs [<a href="#129">129</a>].<br><br>

<font face="Bell MT">Fire regimes:</font>    Because purple loosestrife is
distributed across many habitats in North America (see <a href="distribution_and_occurrence.html">DISTRIBUTION
AND OCCURRENCE</a> section), fire regimes associated with the species vary.
Recurrence and behavior of fire in areas where purple loosestrife occurs is
likely to be closely tied to particular local fire regimes, and cannot be easily
summarized over broad spatial scales. Given purple loosestrife's moisture requirements, it is unlikely to occur in
areas experiencing frequently recurring fire. Similar to many areas that
experience fire infrequently, occurrence of fire in areas where purple
loosestrife is found is likely to driven by drought. However, information describing
interactions between purple loosestrife and fire are lacking, and information
linking purple loosestrife to specific North American fire regimes is
nonexistent.<p>Given the
dearth of information on fire and purple loosestrife and our relatively poor
understanding of how purple loosestrife generally affects plant community
dynamics where it occurs, any description of interactions between particular
fire regimes and purple loosestrife is speculative. Where purple loosestrife displaces native vegetation
dependent upon recurring fire for maintenance of a seral stage, persistent
stands of invasive purple loosestrife may alter fire regimes if purple loosestrife burns less frequently or less readily than the native
vegetation it displaces. For example, sedge meadow
communities along the St. Lawrence River in southern Quebec where purple loosestrife
is sometimes found, are historically maintained by dormant season fire recurring every
1 to 3 years. If invading purple loosestrife reduces fire frequency or
severity at these sites, these communities are likely to succeed to woody species such as willow (<i>Salix
</i>spp.<i>) </i>or maple (<i>Acer</i> spp.) [<a href="#8">8</a>].</p>
<p>The following table lists fire return intervals for communities
or ecosystems throughout North America where purple loosestrife may occur. This
list is not intended as a description of purple loosestrife distribution, but
rather as a guide to fire regimes in areas where purple loosestrife could
potentially be found. (For more specific distributional information see the <a href="distribution_and_occurrence.html">

this list mainly describes upland habitats, purple loosestrife is generally
associated with wetland or riparian habitats within these communities or
ecosystems. As such, this list is meant as a guideline to illustrate historic
fire regimes and is not to be interpreted as a strict
description of fire regimes for purple loosestrife.</p>

IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Very little information exists describing the effect of fire on purple
loosestrife, but indications are it does not burn readily [<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>].
<p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT">
DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Reports of interactions between purple loosestrife and fire usually attest to
the difficulty associated with trying to burn plants as a control method. Such
attempts are commonly described as being confounded by moist soil conditions and
patchy fuel distribution [<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. Because postsenescent purple loosestrife retains
persistent standing dead stem material [<a href="#14">14</a>], it is possible that dry
winter or early spring conditions may permit dense stands to carry fire, but
this is speculative. 

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE">
PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Although no direct evidence exists, it is likely that purple loosestrife will
survive fire by sprouting from buds located below the soil surface on the root
crown [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>].

FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>

<br />

The use of fire as a control measure for purple loosestrife largely has been
dismissed as ineffective [<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. In large part, this has been due to typically wet soil
condition where
it occurs, combined with a well-protected rootstock from which it produces
annual stem growth. Attempts to burn residual biomass following cutting or
herbicide treatments, to the extent that material will actually combust, may
merely result in recruitment of purple loosestrife seedlings due to exposure of
bare substrate containing a substantial seed bank [<a href="#118">118</a>]. Rawinksi [<a href="#102">102</a>] compared the effects of burning following cutting with
cutting alone on mean shoot density in a central New York wetland. Attempts to
burn cut purple loosestrife stems were generally ineffective, although some dense
clumps of cut material &quot;burned rather completely.&quot; Reasons given for
ineffectiveness of burn treatments were diffuse fuel arrangements, presence of
substantial soil moisture, and the retention of moisture 
within cut materials.

Purple loosestrife shoots may be grazed by white-tailed deer [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>], muskrat
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>], and rabbits [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>], but extent of mammal
herbivory is sometimes difficult to determine due to rapid regrowth of
multiple new stems from browse points.
In a mixed stand of purple loosestrife and cattail, foraging muskrats were
observed to occasionally cut stems of purple loosestrife but preferentially fed
on roots and overwintering shoots of cattail [<a href="#102">102</a>].

</p>

<p class="subframeContent"> While purple loosestrife invasion is often reported
as detrimental to wetland-bird habitat, some evidence indicates little
to no harmful effect. American coot, pied-billed
grebe, black-crowned night heron, American goldfinch and gray catbird have all been
observed nesting in purple loosestrife stands [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>]. Red-winged blackbirds
preferentially nest in purple loosestrife over cattails [<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>]. American goldfinch construct nests in purple loosestrife, utilizing the relatively
stable stalks to attach nests above the ground or water surface [<a href="#69">69</a>]. Pied-billed grebes
use dead purple loosestrife stems
as nest substrate in habitat with standing and emergent vegetation [<a href="#78">78</a>]. In a 2-year survey of birds in wetlands surrounding Lake
Huron's Saginaw Bay in eastern Lower Michigan, swamp sparrow nests were most abundant in areas of purple loosestrife dominance
[<a href="#142">142</a>].

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">Although purple
loosestrife, with its tiny seeds, has been assumed to provide little to no food
for birds [<a href="#129">129</a>], there are several
reports of ducks and red-winged blackbirds consuming purple loosestrife seeds
[<a href="#2">2</a>], and a report of damage to experimental seedling
plots in England caused by ring-necked pheasants and pigeons [<a href="#112">112</a>].

OTHER USES:</a>
</span>
<br />

Purple loosestrife was previously used by European immigrants in herbal remedies for a variety of
maladies [<a href="#129">129</a>]. Purple loosestrife, as
well as other loosestrifes, have long been popular with gardeners for
their abundant and attractive floral displays and are still sold legally in some
places. However, many North American horticulturalists have now abandoned its promotion
because of its potential for escape [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. It has also been
utilized as a honey plant by beekeepers [<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. Purple
loosestrife seed has occasionally been included in commercial
&quot;wildflower&quot; seed mixes [<a href="#129">129</a>].

<p class="subframeContent">
<span class="subframeName">
<a name="IMPACTS AND CONTROL">
IMPACTS AND CONTROL:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Impacts:</b></font>   Purple loosestrife can be highly
competitive, often reported as occurring in dense, monospecific stands, with the potential to dominate wetland plant communities where it
occurs (see <a href="botanical_and_ecological_characteristics.html#Successional Status"> Successional Status</a> in the
BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS section) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#136">136</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>]. While it is evident that invading purple loosestrife
may have harmful impacts on native flora and fauna, more research is needed to clarify the extent of these impacts. Hager
and McCoy [<a href="#48">48</a>] and Anderson [<a href="#2">2</a>] provide critical reviews of literature
describing purported negative impacts caused by purple loosestrife in North
America. Both papers express concern that widespread claims of ecological harm
caused by purple loosestrife are largely
unproven. In a widely cited review of purple loosestrife literature in North
America, Thompson and others
[<a href="#129">129</a>] describe encroachment of purple loosestrife around the margins of
a waterfowl impoundment in central New York. Their estimates of percent of total
plant biomass contributed by purple loosestrife along dike areas of the
impoundments describe &quot;dramatic&quot; increases over about a 15-year period.
Based on visual estimates of plant biomass, the authors
contend that native plant species were displaced,
vegetation structure was altered, and habitat quality for nesting waterfowl was
seriously degraded. The paper by Thompson and others [<a href="#129">129</a>] demonstrates how untested hypotheses can be perpetuated in the literature until
they become widely accepted, without the benefit of experimental analysis [<a href="#48">48</a>]. As
emphasized by Anderson [<a href="#2">2</a>], &quot;detailed, quantitative data are needed to
understand loosestrife's natural history, population dynamics, and impacts on
native ecosystems if we are to effectively manage this plant.&quot;


</p>

<p class="subframeContent">Because purple loosestrife has demonstrated strong
competitive abilities where it has invaded North American wetland communities,
there is concern that it may diminish native plant diversity.
For instance, competition with purple loosestrife has been
suggested as
a contributing factor in the decline of the rare Long's bulrush (<i>Scirpus
longii</i>) in Massachusetts [<a href="#28">28</a>]. However, studies published to date have
failed to demonstrate a deleterious effect of purple loosestrife on native plant
diversity. Treberg and Husband [<a href="#130">130</a>] examined the association between purple loosestrife
abundance and vascular plant richness along the Bar River in Ontario. Purple
loosestrife had been present in this area for at least 12 years and there was a wide range in
established plant densities. They found no significant (P&lt;0.05)
difference in mean species richness associated with the presence or percent
cover of purple loosestrife, and no plant species was significantly (P&lt;0.05) more likely
to be found in the absence of purple loosestrife than in its presence. Anderson
[<a href="#1">1</a>] showed no significant (P&lt;0.05)
correlation between total species richness and either percent cover, genet
density or median age of purple loosestrife, even in plots containing 18-20 year
old purple loosestrife plants. He suggested areas with
apparent purple loosestrife monocultures perhaps had low species richness to
begin with, and species richness more likely resulted from habitat
heterogeneity rather than the presence of innately competitive species. More research is needed in this area.


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">Purple loosestrife colonization has been purported to
have detrimental effects on birds, based on: a) creation of unsuitable nesting
habitat and b) low food potential of purple loosestrife relative to
vegetation it displaces. However, published studies and observations
indicate impacts on birds are not yet clear. Marsh wrens prefer cattails to purple loosestrife for nesting [<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>]. There is speculation that invasion of riparian areas
in Nebraska may have adverse effects on important night-roosting habitat for
migratory sandhill cranes. Purple loosestrife invasion is predicted to have detrimental
effects on nesting habitat of black terns and
canvasbacks in the north-central United States, but this has not been tested
[<a href="#129">129</a>]. Whitt et al. [<a href="#142">142</a>] found purple loosestrife-dominated
habitats had significantly (P=0.003) higher bird densities but significantly
(P=0.03) fewer bird species than other habitats. These higher densities were mainly
due to increases in populations of a single species, the swamp sparrow.


</p>

<p class="subframeContent">Purple loosestrife colonization can substantially
reduce or eliminate open water in small marsh areas, potentially reducing its usefulness for waterfowl. In areas
with substantial seed banks, mudflats
that are commonly used as feeding areas by shorebirds are impacted by rapid,
dense colonization by purple loosestrife seedlings. Decline in the extent of open water habitats from
increased emergent purple loosestrife can retard access to aquatic prey items such as fish and aquatic invertebrates. Important aquatic food plants for wildlife such as
pondweeds (<i>Potamogeton</i> spp.) are inhibited under the shade of emergent
purple loosestrife [<a href="#102">102</a>]. Invading purple loosestrife in
coastal British Columbia's Fraser River estuary may have negative effects on
detrital food chains [<a href="#45">45</a>].


</p>

<p class="subframeContent">
Thompson and others [<a href="#129">129</a>] have illustrated how muskrats might interact with
purple loosestrife in a manner detrimental to muskrats. Muskrats apparently find stems of purple loosestrife much less palatable then those
of cattail, but they do cut purple loosestrife stems. As they forage they favor cattail stems, potentially
shifting the competitive balance toward the less palatable purple loosestrife.
The ability of muskrats to shift the competitive balance between cattails and
purple loosestrife was corroborated by Rawinski [<a href="#102">102</a>] from observations of
mixed stands where muskrats were present. At a particular site, muskrats removed entire
patches of cattail, leaving purple loosestrife the only remaining emergent.
Muskrats may further favor purple loosestrife seedling establishment following
den construction. This activity can cause substantial soil disturbance that is rapidly
colonized by purple loosestrife seedlings during lower summer water levels. Because of their ability to generate new vegetative growth, partially eaten purple loosestrife stems also represent potential new propagules,
adding to its competitive advantage [<a href="#23">23</a>]. As community composition shifts from
cattails to purple loosestrife dominance, habitat quality and subsequent muskrat
carrying capacity apparently decline [<a href="#129">129</a>].


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">
Conversion of wetland pasture to predominantly purple loosestrife is believed to reduce forage value for livestock and deer [<a href="#128">128</a>]. As purple
loosestrife density increases and mature plants
produce greater numbers of shoots, the woody nature of purple loosestrife stems diminishes
forage value [<a href="#118">118</a>].


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">
Purple loosestrife may have
adverse effects on habitat of the threatened bog turtle,
although details are scant [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">
Purple loosestrife invasion may be detrimental to production of
natural and domestic wild rice in areas of the upper Midwest, particularly in
commercial wild rice paddy operations where water level manipulation presents
ideal germination conditions. Dense purple loosestrife infestations can
also undermine the functionality
of drainage waterways, such as irrigation ditches [<a href="#118">118</a>].


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">Water level manipulations in impoundments
have been hindered by threat of purple loosestrife invasion. A 1000-fold increase in acreage containing purple
loosestrife was noted over a 23-year period in a central New York wetland and
the cause was speculated to be recurrent drawdown of impoundments [<a href="#102">102</a>].
In areas managed for waterfowl production, such as
many federal and state wildlife refuges, water level drawdowns in impoundments
may provide establishment opportunities for purple loosestrife.
Drawdowns are often executed to encourage recruitment of plants valuable to
waterfowl such as
cattails, smartweed (<i>Polygonum</i> spp.) and wild millet (<i>Echinochloa</i> spp.) on exposed soils [<a href="#91">91</a>].


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">Invading purple loosestrife is being monitored in the
middle Snake River corridor in Idaho for effects on stream channel dynamics. Purple
loosestrife is colonizing gravel bars under low flow conditions. Once
established, it appears able
to withstand inundation and flowing water conditions better than native annuals.
It is feared that persistent purple loosestrife plants may
contribute substantially to sediment trapping, leading to gravel bar aggradation, closure of
small channels, and despoiling of secure, predator-free island nesting habitat
for local waterfowl [<a href="#33">33</a>].


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Control:</b></font> Land managers concerned about
invasive purple loosestrife should focus on eliminating small, recently-established populations before tackling large, well-established populations.
Buildup and persistence of purple loosestrife seed in the soil seed bank appears to be the most problematic, long-term obstacle in eradicating, or at least
controlling purple loosestrife. Preventing seed production and seed bank
accumulation within recently-established stands is a pragmatic goal, especially
in the face of limited resources and knowledge [<a href="#138">138</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>]. Welling and Becker
[<a href="#138">138</a>] demonstrated the potential
difficulty managers face with attempts to exhaust seed banks in areas where
purple loosestrife is well established, although not necessarily
monodominant. Because seed dormancy is enforced by burial at relatively shallow
(&gt;0.8 inch (2 cm)) depth, and because purple loosestrife seed banks may contain thousands of seeds per square foot at these depths, even successful
eradication of extant adult plants and new recruits from near-surface germinants
may not suffice for successful long-term control. Even the ability to exhaust
near-surface (&lt;0.4 inch (1 cm)) seed banks by promoting germination and removing emergent
seedlings is in question. 


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">Any disturbance or management activity that fragments
live stem or root tissue is likely to result in the spread, rather than
containment of purple loosestrife [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>]. Live
stems that are dislodged and buried can give
rise to new shoots via adventitious buds [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. Carp may play
an important role where they co-occur with purple loosestrife. Carp eat the roots
of purple loosestrife, sometimes until the plants are dislodged and float away.
These plants then become potential
propagules if they lodge on suitable substrate [<a href="#102">102</a>].


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">Detection and control efforts may be hindered by purple loosestrife's
propensity to occasionally remain dormant for an entire
growing season. Some plants fail to generate aboveground shoots during a
particular year, but exhibit normal growth from the same rootstock in preceding
and following years [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>].


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">
<font face="Bell MT">
Prevention: </font>It is important to avoid management activities that may
enhance the risk of purple loosestrife invasion and expansion.
Examples of mitigative efforts are a) encourage
establishment, growth, or perpetuation of native woody cover that might provide
enough shade to depress or discourage purple loosestrife, b) minimize water
level fluctuations in manipulated wetlands or waterways that might encourage
establishment of purple loosestrife seedlings, especially early-season drawdowns
that expose bare substrate, and c) avoid any form of stress or disturbance to
extant native plant communities in susceptible areas, such as disturbing soil
with heavy machinery, and where such activities are unavoidable,
monitoring impacted areas to detect invaders [<a href="#129">129</a>].


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">Periodic, systematic monitoring of susceptible
habitats is strongly encouraged [<a href="#144">144</a>]. Development of local populations, as
expressed by percent biomass constituted by purple loosestrife, is roughly a logistic
function through time. Initial rate of spread of local infestations is
slowed when extant competition is strong. As a result, early detection and
eradication of colonizing plants is highly preferred. Fortunately, early detection is aided by the tall, showy flower
stalks and lengthy period of bloom. Once purple loosestrife
becomes strongly established, with many (&gt;10) flowering stems per rootstock,
multiple clumps forming monospecific patches or stands, and establishment of a
seed bank, eradication becomes more expensive, intrusive, and difficult
[<a href="#129">129</a>].


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">Spread of purple loosestrife in natural areas likely has been
accelerated by the development, sale and use of various loosestrife cultivars
for horticultural purposes. Sale and utilization of ornamental loosestrife cultivars should be curtailed to prevent the risk of further dissemination into
previously uncolonized areas. Cultivars are capable of contributing viable seed and
pollen to wild populations, and claims of sterile hybrids have been shown
to be mainly false [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>].


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">As with most invasive species, public education plays
an important role in preventing establishment and spread of purple loosestrife.
Planting of loosestrife cultivars
for horticultural purposes should be strongly discouraged. Individuals who
frequent areas susceptible to invasion can aid in prevention by washing boots,
clothing, equipment, etc. before exiting such areas, and should be encouraged to
identify and report potential new infestations to authorities.


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">

<font face="Bell MT">
Integrated management:</font>   A single method may not be effective for
long-term control or removal of purple loosestrife. Integrated management
involves using several management techniques in a well-planned, coordinated
and organized program. Many combinations of control methods can achieve
desired objectives. Methods selected for a specific site will be
determined by land-use objectives, desired plant community,
extent and nature of infestation, environmental factors (nontarget vegetation,
habitat types, climate, hydrology, etc.), economics, and effectiveness and
limitations of available control techniques [<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>].


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">

<font face="Bell MT">
Cultural: </font> Seeding of competitive vegetation in areas where bare soil has been exposed may be a useful mitigative measure. This may be
especially helpful where presence of seed in the soil seed bank indicates potential
for robust purple loosestrife regeneration.
Experiments examining the effectiveness of seeding Japanese millet (<i>Echinochloa</i>
<i>esculenta</i>) to reduce the
impact of purple loosestrife recruitment have shown mixed results [<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#140">140</a>]. In addition to providing competition against purple loosestrife
seedlings, Japanese millet may be used by waterfowl and is thought to represent
a minimal threat of invasiveness, although it is not native to North America
[<a href="#129">129</a>]. Seeding native species may provide a desirable
postdisturbance community, but explicit tests of the competitive abilities of
various native plants when seeded with purple loosestrife are lacking. Seeding of competitors should take place
immediately following exposure of soil to maximize their competitive abilities
[<a href="#81">81</a>].


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">Flooding infested areas by raising water
levels for extended periods may eliminate
purple loosestrife from impoundment sites [<a href="#47">47</a>]. Flooding duration is more likely to influence mortality than depth of
flooding, but specific guidelines are lacking [<a href="#9">9</a>]. Persistent high water conditions can slow the growth and reproductive capacity
of purple loosestrife and over several years may eliminate extant stands, but
results are variable and interactions with other factors poorly understood [<a href="#81">81</a>]. In plots subjected to consistently high water levels
(16 inch (40 cm) mean depth)), competition with narrow-leaved cattail
significantly (P&lt;0.001) reduced stem densities of purple loosestrife compared
with flooded stands where purple loosestrife was the predominant species [<a href="#101">101</a>]. More research is needed to
determine optimal flooding duration and factors that influence variability in the effect of flooding
duration [<a href="#9">9</a>].


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">Effectiveness of flooding as a control measure may be
enhanced by cutting purple loosestrife stems prior to raising water levels [<a href="#81">81</a>].
Cut material should always be removed from
the site to prevent spread of vegetative propagules. The efficacy of flooding may be influenced by the presence of carp within
contiguous waterways, although the ultimate effects are unclear. Carp may reduce
purple loosestrife by grazing its roots or enhance its spread by disseminating
vegetative propagules [<a href="#102">102</a>]. Carp are not native to North America and should not
be introduced as a means to control purple loosestrife.


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">Consistent spring and early-summer flooding may
inhibit purple loosestrife seedling establishment [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>]. Flooding seedlings
0.8 to 4 inches (2-10 cm) tall for 9 weeks at depths up to 12 inches (30 cm) did not significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduce mean
stem densities. Most plants continued to grow, if slowly, while submerged, and
plants which emerged above the surface quickly resumed rapid growth [<a href="#53">53</a>]. Established purple loosestrife plants
can survive in deepwater emergent habitat, in part by development of
aerenchymous (containing large intercellular air spaces) stem tissue that facilitates gas exchange in aquatic environments.


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">Several factors may hinder the
effectiveness of controlling purple loosestrife by flooding. Managers may be
constrained in their ability to manipulate water levels by the geologic profile
of the site or by development along its margins. Substantial warm season
evaporation can contribute to this problem. Sustained high water levels may be
detrimental to desirable native emergent or shoreline vegetation. Once
purple loosestrife has been killed, managers should consider
species composition within the remnant seed bank, and the ensuing colonizing
community, when water levels have been reduced. It is likely that purple
loosestrife seedlings will recolonize the newly exposed soil and further
management may be inevitable.


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">

<font face="Bell Mt">
Physical/mechanical:</font> Cutting stems or removing flower heads prior to seed dissemination can prevent
local seed bank accumulation. Late-summer cutting appears to
reduce vegetative growth more effectively than mid-summer treatments. However, cutting stems
is unlikely to prevent perennial stem growth [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>].
Cutting flower heads may be useful in preventing further seed production when
primary control activities, such as herbicide application, require more than 1 season
to completely eradicate purple loosestrife [<a href="#13">13</a>]. Cutting purple loosestrife stems underwater at
various times in summer was ineffective [<a href="#52">52</a>].


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">Digging or hand-pulling plants is
recommended for early infestations or a few scattered plants. Digging or pulling young plants in recently colonized
areas can be effective in preventing establishment of dense, intractable stands
and buildup of substantial seed banks. Early detection is important since
established plants may rapidly become too large and deep-rooted for easy removal [<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. Because
growing points of the plant are located on the root crown, removal of as much rootstock as possible is strongly encouraged [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>]. Pulling entire plants is
easiest when the soil is wet [<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>]. All pulled plant material
should be removed from the site to prevent vegetative reproduction from
discarded fragments [<a href="#23">23</a>]. Spot spraying individual
plants with herbicide may be less time and labor intensive when infestations become too
large for removal by pulling or digging [<a href="#129">129</a>].

Biological:</font>   The objective of biological control is to re-establish
ecological relationships that have evolved between purple loosestrife and its
native predators in order to suppress invasive populations and reduce harmful impacts. Potential advantages of biological control are cost effectiveness
at large scales, sustainability, and benign effects in the nontarget
environment [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>]. The Nature

</p>
<p class="subframeContent">Plant communities where purple loosestrife
is found are similar in North America and Europe. Because native insect
herbivory inhibits purple loosestrife performance in Europe, it is hoped introductions of

herbicides that have been used effectively against purple loosestrife in North
America, as well as a brief discussion of important considerations regarding
their use. This is not intended as an exhaustive review of chemical control
methods. For more detailed information regarding appropriate use of

</table>
<p class="subframeContent">A serious challenge to controlling purple loosestrife
infestations with herbicides is preventing its re-establishment from the seed bank. In the presence of large purple loosestrife seed banks,
removal of a considerable fraction of extant vegetation (weed or otherwise) can
result in a dense monoculture of purple loosestrife seedlings. The result may be
a worse infestation than was originally present [<a href="#91">91</a>].
Broadcast application of broad-spectrum herbicides, such as glyphosate, will likely result in widespread exposure of
bare substrate and a dense, monotypic stand of purple loosestrife seedlings
[<a href="#118">118</a>]. By carefully targeting glyphosate spray application
to only purple loosestrife, damage to
nontarget plants can be minimized. Continued careful treatments over
several years can eventually reduce dense populations of purple loosestrife to
minimal levels while promoting native plants [<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>]. Native plants are not just inherently valued, but
can also
provide competition against inevitable purple loosestrife recruitment from existing
seed banks [<a href="#118">118</a>].


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">An apparent tradeoff exists when determining the best
time to treat adult stands with herbicides. Managers must attempt to balance preventing
seed production in established plants with treatments
early in the growing season and preventing establishment of a viable new stand of purple loosestrife seedlings by delaying
treatments long enough to inhibit recruitment. By conducting
herbicide treatments on adult plants late in the growing season, newly
established seedlings may not
develop sufficiently to survive winter [<a href="#90">90</a>].
Late-summer herbicide application also appears to reduce negative effects on
desirable native plants [<a href="#81">81</a>]. Rawinski [<a href="#102">102</a>] found that glyphosate application
during late-bloom (mid-August in central New York) period, compared with
late-vegetative (mid-June) period, resulted in fewer loosestrife seedlings the following season and increased presence of naturally
established, beneficial plants such as shallow sedge (<i>Carex lurida</i>), rice
cutgrass (<i>Leersia oryzoides</i>), smartweed and marsh
seedbox (<i>Ludwigia palustris</i>).
Late-season application of glyphosate in Minnesota wetlands tended to reduce cattail mortality compared with mid-summer treatments, perhaps because
the onset
of cattail senescence reduced herbicide uptake [<a href="#12">12</a>].


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">Another tradeoff exists between spray
volume and target vs. nontarget effects. Purple loosestrife in Wisconsin was examined for
response to variation in spray coverage of glyphosate (Rodeo at 1.5%).
Individual genets were spot treated in mid-September and received either low
(10-25% leaf area coverage), medium (40-60%), or high (75-90%) dosages.
Reduction in adult purple loosestrife density was greatest in the high dosage treatment
(90-100% reduction) and
lowest in the low dosage treatment (75-90% reduction). Surviving purple loosestrife plants
in all treatments were greatly reduced in size and vigor. Because glyphosate is
nonselective in its effect, survival of nontarget vegetation
was also closely related to dosage. High dosage
treatment resulted in dense stands of purple loosestrife seedlings with little
to no interspecific competition. In contrast, low dosage treatment resulted
in high survival rates of desirable perennials and greatly reduced germination of purple loosestrife seedlings. Effective long-term control of purple loosestrife
with glyphosate might best be achieved using low-dosage spot applications and
conducting followup treatments in subsequent years as necessary [<a href="#104">104</a>].


</p>
<p class="subframeContent">To minimize non-target effects, managers in Michigan have
developed a cut-and-herbicide
method for purple loosestrife control. They propose cutting plants
high on the stem (just below infloresence), allowing them to continue growing
and better absorb the applied herbicide throughout the entire plant. Cutting too low
apparently risks forcing the plant to &quot;give up&quot; on
the leader and instead producing new ramets from the rootstock. Sponge applicators have been developed that limit contact between
chemicals and nontarget plants [<a href="#131">131</a>]. These methods may be particularly
useful in areas where mitigation of damage to indigenous species is important.
Encouraging competition from extant native plants often helps reduce the vigor of invasives. For more detailed information regarding
these methods, visit the TNC Wildland Invasive Species Program website: <a href="https://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/esadocs/lythsali.html">https://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/esadocs/lythsali.html</a>.
