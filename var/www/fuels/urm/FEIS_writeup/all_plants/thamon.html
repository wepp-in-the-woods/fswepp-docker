<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Mojave desertrue is commonly found in creosotebush (Larrea tridentata)
scrub, blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima) scrub, and other warm desert
shrub communities, and in Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia) and
pinyon-juniper (Pinus spp.-Juniperus spp.) woodlands [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  In
addition to the above mentioned species, Mojave desertrue is commonly
associated with desertsenna (Cassia armata), Nevada ephedra (Ephedra
nevadensis), banana yucca (Yucca baccata), Mojave yucca (Y. schidigera),
spiny hopsage (Grayia spinosa), winterfat (Ceratoides lanata), budsage
(Artemisia spinescens), Utah agave (Agave utahensis), purple sage
(Salvia dorrii), desert almond (Prunus fasciculatus), Dalea spp.,
Atriplex spp., Tetradymia spp., Eriogonum spp., and Lycium spp.
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Mojave desertrue is not listed as a dominant or indicator
species in the available literature.

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Mojave desertrue is occasionally browsed by desert bighorn sheep [<a href="#5">5</a>].

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Mojave desertrue has been used by the Indians as a tonic and in the
treatment of gonorrhea [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Mojave desertrue commonly accumulates organic material and windblown
soil beneath its crown.  These shrub mounds serve as an increased source
of nutrients and water for Mojave desertrue in addition to providing a
microhabitat for desert ephemerals [<a href="#6">6</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Thamnosma montana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Mojave desertrue is a native, long-lived, profusely branched, deciduous,
perennial shrub 1 to 2.5 feet (30-80 cm) tall [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  It has stout,
spine-tipped, broomlike branches that are thickly covered with
blisterlike glands and are leafless most of the year [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  Mojave
desertrue forms new branches from the root crown, resulting in multiple
stems arising from the ground [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  The leaves are 0.16 to 0.6 inch
(4-15 mm) long and 0.04 inch (1 mm) wide [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  The flowers are in
small cymose or racemose clusters [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Mojave desertrue reproduces by seed.  The flowers are animal pollinated
and the fruit is dispersed by animals [<a href="#19">19</a>].  The fruit is a capsule
containing one to three seeds [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  The ability of Mojave desertrue
to reproduce vegetatively was not specifically described in the
literature.  However, since it branches fron the root crown, Mojave
desertrue may be able to sprout after top-kill.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Mojave desertrue is commonly found on sunny, dry, rocky, or gravelly
slopes and mesas. [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  It occurs at the following elevations:

Arizona - 4,500 feet (1,371 m) and lower [<a href="#15">15</a>]
California - 5,500 feet (1,676) and lower [<a href="#18">18</a>]
Utah - 2,316 to 4,265 feet (760-1,300 m) [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Mojave desertrue is present in most stages of succession.  Wells [<a href="#32">32</a>]
described it as a pioneer shrub typically found in disturbed areas such
as drainageways and actively eroded bedrock areas.  Others have reported
that Mojave desertrue is a long-lived shrub, present in later stages of
desert succession [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  On a sandy bajada in California, Mojave
desertrue was one of the most common species found in an old, stable
creosotebush scrub community [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Mojave desertrue flowers in the spring at the same time new vegetative
shoots are being initiated [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  It flowers from February through
April in Arizona, and from March through May in California [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].
Mojave desertrue leaves are deciduous and are shed soon after flowering
[<a href="#3">3</a>], but the twigs often remain green for 3 to 5 years [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Thamnosma montana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Regeneration of Mojave desertrue after fire in not described in research
currently available.  However, since it produces new branches from the
root crown, it probably can sprout from the root crown if top-killed by
fire.  Mojave desertrue probably also colonizes burned areas via
animal-dispersed seeds.

Fire frequency in the communities where Mojave desertrue occurs depends
on productivity and continuity of fuels.  Where livestock grazing has
reduced grass cover and accelerated erosion, fire frequency has
decreased [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  In creosotebush scrub communities, fires generally
occur in those occasional years when exceptionally heavy winter rains
have produced abnormally heavy stands of annuals [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Fires are also
rare in blackbrush communities; however, these communities have been
known to burn under conditions of high temperature, high wind velocity,
and low relative humidity [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Pinyon-juniper communities historically
burned every 10 to 30 years [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Small shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Thamnosma montana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Information was not available regarding the immediate effects of fire on
Mojave desertrue.  Mojave desertrue is probably top-killed or killed by
most fires.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Mojave desertrue was present on a burn in the Sonoran Desert, Arizona,
within 4 years of a June fire [<a href="#33">33</a>].  The absolute cover value of Mojave
desertrue following controlled fires in a blackbrush community in
southwestern Utah is as follows [<a href="#7">7</a>]:

                                Absolute cover value (percent)  
Time elapsed since burning        mean     standard deviation 
unburned                          0.9       2.3
1 year                            0.5       0.8
2 years                             0         0           
6 years                             0         0
12 years                            0         0
17 years                            0         0  
19.5 years                       11.7       3.8  
37 years                         15.4      11.4

The 37-year-old site was dominated by shrubs and annual grasses.  Mojave
desertrue had the greatest absolute cover value of any other species on
this site [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
For several decades after burning blackbrush communities, these sites
may be dominated by nonpalatable shrubs such as Mojave desertrue.
Therefore, prescribed burning is not recommended in blackbrush
communities to improve forage for livestock [<a href="#33">33</a>].
