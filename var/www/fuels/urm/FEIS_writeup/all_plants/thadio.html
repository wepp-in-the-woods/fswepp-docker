<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name for early meadowrue is Thalictrum
dioicum L.  It has three recognized varieties in Canada: T. d.
adiantinum Greene, T. d. huronense Greene, and T. d. langfordii Greene
[<a href="#19">19</a>].  In Canada and Minnesota, this species has been confused with
Thalictrum venulosum Trel., which is a separate and valid species [<a href="#12">12</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Thalictrum dioicum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Early meadowrue is a dioecious perennial.  Its hollow stems rise 8 to 28
inches (20-70 cm) from a caudex or rootstock [<a href="#9">9</a>].  The caudex has dried
persistent bracts from the growth of previous years.  The alternate,
compound leaves have long stalks.  Flowers have no petals and are in
loose, open panicles.  Both male and female flowers have four purple to
greenish white sepals that drop off before fruits are formed [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Early meadowrue has a shallowly rooted caudex.  Foliage dies back to
this rootstock each winter and resprouts in spring.  Brundrett and
others [<a href="#3">3</a>] note that it grows typically in colonies.  However, Melampy
[<a href="#14">14</a>] asserts that only male plants produce stolons; therefore, colonies
are unisexual.  While vegetative reproduction favors the spread of male
plants, Melampy [<a href="#14">14</a>] notes that they may be more susceptible to
environmental stresses than female plants.  Male plants also reproduce
sexually, having long pendulous stamens that facilitate wind pollination
[<a href="#9">9</a>].  Fruits are achenes with no special dispersal mechanisms.  Most
likely, the dry fruits drop near the parent plants unless they are
consumed.  There is no information on the effects of animal digestive
tracts on seed survival.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Early meadowrue commonly occurs on alluvial soils that range from
well-drained sandy loams to poorly drained clays [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>]; however, it
usually is found on well-drained soils [<a href="#1">1</a>].  It grows in moist open
woods and is found on north-facing slopes, ledges, rocky areas, ravines,
and near limestone outcrops [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

A shade-tolerant plant, early meadowrue occurs as a minor component (up
to 25% cover, [<a href="#4">4</a>]) in subclimax communities of bur oak (Quercus
macrocarpa) and aspen (Populus tremuloides).


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
With its leaves about half grown, early meadowrue blooms early in spring
(April or May) throughout its range [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  It flowers with or
before the expansion of leaves on deciduous trees.  Fruit begins to
mature approximately 1 month later (June) [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Leaves are
maintained throughout summer.  In fall, leaves become senescent, and
there are no living shoots during winter [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Thalictrum dioicum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Early meadowrue is a component of deciduous forests that abutt prairies.
Prairie fire suppression has increased the range of this plant [<a href="#4">4</a>].
With a shallowly rooted caudex, the degree of resistance to fire depends
on protection obtained from soil cover.  As with other stolon-producing
species, early meadowrue is most likely to survive cool fires that do
not consume duff [<a href="#7">7</a>].  However, seedlings probably will not survive.
This plant would not survive severe fires.  Fire risk is greatest during
the summer when severe thunderstorms commonly occur throughout its
range.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Caudex, growing points in soil

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Thalictrum dioicum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire effects have not been studied in this plant.  It is probably
top-killed by fire.  Any aboveground stolons also would be killed.
Spring burning would have the greatest impact on this species, since it
would kill the seeds that mature in June.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>



<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
The abundance of early meadowrue would be severely reduced immediately
postfire.  Since this species reproduces both vegetatively and sexually,
long-term postfire recovery should be fairly successful.  Off-site
regeneration is possible but anticipated to be slow, since seed is not
wind dispersed.  Fire severity and rooting depth of the caudex controls
its recovery.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY
