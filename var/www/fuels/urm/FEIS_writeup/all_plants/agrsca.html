<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Although ticklegrass is a common and widespread species, the large ratio
of seed head to foliage prevents it from being an important livestock
forage plant.  Prior to flowering, however, cattle, sheep, and horses
readily consume it [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].

Ticklegrass is occasionally eaten by elk, mule deer, white-tail deer,
pronghorn, small mammals, upland gamebirds, and waterfowl [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Moose
may also graze on ticklegrass throughout the year [<a href="#26">26</a>].



<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Ticklegrass is considered to be relatively unpalatable to livestock but
is consumed early in the season [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  The relish and degree of
use shown by livestock and wildlife in several western states is rated
as follows [<a href="#8">8</a>]:

Small mammals         poor        fair          ----           ----


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Ticklegrass has been rated as fair in energy value and low in protein
value [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
In certain areas, ticklegrass provides moderate cover for white-tailed
deer, pronghorn, small mammals, upland gamebirds, and small nongame
birds.  It may also provide good cover for waterfowl [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Ticklegrass is a suitable candidate for revegetation programs,
particularily in northern regions [<a href="#43">43</a>].  It has been used successfully
in seeding experiments on alpine sites, where areas disturbed by
grazing, recreation, and mining or mineral exploration are common [<a href="#4">4</a>].
Ticklegrass is also reported to be common on abandoned coal-mine sites
in Alberta [<a href="#37">37</a>] and has colonized industrially damaged sites near
Sudbury, Ontario [<a href="#19">19</a>].  It naturally invades areas damaged by sulfur
emissions [<a href="#48">48</a>] and can be found on soils with copper concentrations of
450 p/m and nickel concentrations of 500 p/m [<a href="#15">15</a>].  In Yellowstone
National Park, ticklegrass was seeded onto disturbed sites and after one
growing season comprised 18 to 30 percent of the vegetation on test
plots [<a href="#29">29</a>].  In revegetation trials in the Yukon Territory, seedlings
emerged in the first growing season in 100 percent of seeded plots.  All
plots contained viable plants 7 years later.  Eighty-six percent of
plants produced seed in the second growing season, and all live plants
produced seed during the seventh growing season [<a href="#43">43</a>].  In addition,
ticklegrass has a fibrous root system that is effective in preventing
soil erosion [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Ticklegrass is one of the most successful native grasses in the
revegetation programs in which it has been included [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  It has
shown good potential for both short-term and long-term revegetation, and
has low establishment requirements [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Ticklegrass seed is not
available commercially, but it is produced at the Plant Materials Center
in Bridger, Montana [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Seed can be collected at a rate of
approximately 3.3 ounces per hour (95 g/hr) [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Ticklegrass produces
lush growth in the first year if fertilized.  In field trials near Tent
Mountain, Alberta, it produced greater than 20 percent cover in
fertilized plots in the first growing season [<a href="#15">15</a>].  In alpine areas,
seeds should be planted in the fall to avoid breaking dormancy and to
allow for optimal growth in the spring [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Ticklegrass is very
effective at seed dispersal, and it is not necessary to plant seeds in
areas where a source is nearby [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Ticklegrass increases in response to grazing [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Because the plant is
not readily grazed after flowering, it is only utilized in the spring or
early summer.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Agrostis scabra
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Ticklegrass is a short-lived, perennial bunchgrass.  Culms are slender
and erect, and the basal leaves are often scabrous.  The panicle is
large and diffuse at maturity [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Ticklegrass is typically 6
to 39 inches (15-100 cm) tall [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>] but often reaches 50 inches
(130 cm) in height [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  The plant has a fibrous root system [<a href="#48">48</a>]
but is not rhizomatous [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Ticklegrass is often confused with winter bentgrass (A. hyemalis (Walt.)
B.S.P.), but the latter generally flowers earlier [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Ticklegrass reproduces primarly by seed but can spread laterally by
stolons.  The diffuse inflorescence breaks away at maturity and can be
dispersed over long distances by wind [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Seeds colonize recently
disturbed sites with exposed mineral soil seedbeds [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Ticklegrass occurs throughout a wide variety of habitats including
woodlands, forest openings, grasslands, shrublands, meadows, swamps,
bogs, marshes, and stream and lake margins [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  It also grows
on disturbed sites, such as in ditches or along roadsides, and in
pastures or abandoned fields [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Ticklegrass occurs from sea
level to alpine zones [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  It occupies sites as high as 12,000
feet (3,600 m) in Colorado [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Ticklegrass is tolerant of a wide range
of moisture regimes; it thrives in wet or moist soils and can survive
seasonal stem submergence [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Ticklegrass is also found in dry
habitats and is a common component of semiarid grasslands and sagebrush
communities [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].

Ticklegrass grows well on sandy loam, loam, and clay loam soil textures
[<a href="#8">8</a>].  It is adapted to soils that are low in nutrients and is tolerant
of low pH levels [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Ticklegrass shows poor growth in sodic soils
[<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Ticklegrass is generally a pioneer or invader species [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  It is
relatively shade intolerant, and thrives in open, sunny locations [<a href="#15">15</a>].
Seed is widely dispersed by wind and requires bare mineral soil for
establishment; seedlings are common on recently disturbed sites [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].
Ticklegrass has invaded abandoned fields throughout prairie regions, and
barren sandy soils near Coniston, Ontario.  It is a pioneer of dry white
spruce (Picea glauca) sites near Norman Wells, Northwest Territories
[<a href="#15">15</a>], and clearcut jack pine (Pinus banksiana) sites in Saskatchewan
[<a href="#7">7</a>].

Once ticklegrass becomes established, it may remain important throughout
the early seral stages [<a href="#22">22</a>].  In boreal forest floodplain succession,
ticklegrass invades initially, and then endures through the early willow
stages [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Ticklegrass is also a component of near climax range
communities in Montana [<a href="#36">36</a>].  In the Sierra Nevada, California,
ticklegrass is an increaser species in climax meadow vegetation [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Ticklegrass flowers from June to September, depending on location
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  Seed is shed in late summer [<a href="#41">41</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Wind-dispersed ticklegrass seeds readily colonize bare mineral soil on
recently burned sites [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  Seeds may also be stored for short
durations in the soil, allowing for early establishment of areas burned
in the spring [<a href="#11">11</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire generally top-kills ticklegrass.  Specific effects on ticklegrass
mortality, however, are not well documented.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
In general, ticklegrass increases in abundance in response to fire.
Seedlings immediately colonize recently burned areas, provided a
favorable seedbed has been established [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Annual spring burns in
aspen stands in Alberta caused an increase in ticklegrass inflorescence
production.  In unburned areas, there was an average of one flower head
per square foot (10/sq m), but on burned sites 10 flower heads per
square foot (110/sq.m) were produced [<a href="#2">2</a>].  In interior Alaska, seedlings
were not found in burned plots where the organic layer had not been
completely removed, although a seed source was nearby.  Seedlings were,
however, abundant on adjacent firelines [<a href="#45">45</a>].
