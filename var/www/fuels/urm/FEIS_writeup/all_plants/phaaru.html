</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Waterfowl, upland game birds, riparian mammals, and fish all use reed
canarygrass for cover and food.  Reed canarygrass hay fields have been
created for goose grazing areas [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Reed canarygrass has been rated as good forage for cattle, sheep, and
horses in Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana [<a href="#6">6</a>].  It is most
palatable when it is growing, becoming more coarse and increasing in
alkaloids by autumn [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Nutrient contents were measured for reed canarygrass in the United
Kingdom following two seasons of simulated grazing trials and cutting
for silage [<a href="#10">10</a>]:

Simulated              content
grazing                g kg-1           Silage             g kg-1
                   year 2  year 3                       year 2  year 3
----------------------------------      -------------------------------
Phosphorus          4.6     3.8         Phosphorus       3.7    3.0
Potassium          38.7    31.7         Potassium       34.1   25.8
Calcium             4.2     4.6         Calcium          4.5    4.0
Magnesium           2.5     2.3         Magnesium        2.5    2.4

In the same simulated grazing trials dry matter production decreased
from 8.82 t/ha to 7.0 t/ha in 3 years, and digestive organic matter
decreased from 5.87 t/ha to 4.62 t/ha.

Crude protein during winter has been measured at 7.8 percent [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Prairie chickens use reed canarygrass for hiding cover in winter [<a href="#28">28</a>].
It is also used by muskrats and fish for cover [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Reed canarygrass is rated as a good for streambank stabilization and
excellent for rehabilitating waterways and trapping and filtering
sediments to prevent erosion [<a href="#27">27</a>].  However, because it is an aggressive
competitor, it can replace other native riparian vegetation, and its use
should be restricted [<a href="#3">3</a>].  In some areas it is desirable, especially
where the exotic, purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), is invading
riparian areas [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Reed canarygrass is used to revegetate strip mine
spoils [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Seeding guidelines are available [<a href="#7">7</a>].



<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Reed canarygrass is considered an undesirable invader in oak savannahs
of south-central Wisconsin [<a href="#14">14</a>].  It can be controlled with glyphosate,
followed by covering treated areas with black plastic.  This method is
successful if done for 3 years, and then the treated area seeded with
desirable species.  Selective hand-pulling is also successful but must
be carried out two to three times a year for 5 years [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Other
chemicals, such as Dalapon and Amitrol, are effective in fall or early
winter [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Reed canarygrass can also be eliminated by applying boron.
Root growth is reduced by 50 percent by adding 29 parts per million of
boron.  Shoot growth is reduced by the same percentage by adding 82
parts per million [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Mowing can increase reed canarygrass, although repeated mowing over a
5-year period mowing can reduce percent frequency [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Reed canarygrass can be a desirable forage crop for cattle.  Grazing
should begin when the grass is 12 inches (30 cm) tall, and when soils
are dry to minimize trampling [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Intense stocking rates with a short
rotation period are recommended.  Reed canarygrass should not be grazed
to less than 5 to 8 inches (13-20 cm) in height.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Phalaris arundinacea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Reed canarygrass is a perennial grass that can grow as tall as 8 feet
(2.66 m) but usually reaches heights of only 27.6 to 55.1 inches (70-140
cm) [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Leaves are up to 12 inches (30 cm) long and 0.75 inch (2 cm)
wide [<a href="#21">21</a>].  The seed head is a compact panicle that can vary in length
from 2.8 to 15.7 inches (7-40 cm) [<a href="#1">1</a>].  The panicle is green or light
purple [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Reed canarygrass reproduces mainly by rhizomes [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Rhizomes grow into
dense mats within 1 year, and up to 74 percent of new shoots are
believed to arise from rhizomes.  Tillers bud within 2 inches (5 cm) of
the soil surface [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Reed canarygrass can also readily reproduce by
seeds, which germinate shortly after ripening.  There are no known
domancy requirements [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Reed canarygrass occurs along streambanks, ponds, lakes, irrigation
canals, ditches, and in wet meadows, brackish tidelands, and marshes
[<a href="#31">31</a>].  It tolerates frequent and prolonged flooding as well as
submergence.  pH of water has been measured at 7.3 to 8.8 [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Soils
are usually Entisols and Mollisols, fine textured, and poorly drained
[<a href="#3">3</a>].  Elevation ranges have been recorded for some western states [<a href="#6">6</a>]:

Colorado     4,500 to 9,000 feet (1,372-2,743 m)
Wyoming      3,500 to 9,000 feet (1,067-2,743 m)
Montana      3,600 to 7,000 feet (1,097-2,134 m)
Utah         6,400 to 8,900 feet (1,951-2,713 m)

Some plant associates of reed canarygrass include cattail (Typha spp.),
bulrush (Scirpus spp.), rush (Juncus spp.), sedge (Carex spp.),
smartweed (Polygonum spp.), spikerush (Eleocharis spp.), horsetail
(Equisetum spp.), pondweed (Potamogeton spp.), arrowhead (Sagittaria
latifolia), rice cutgrass (Leersia oryzoides), bluejoint reedgrass
(Calamagrostis canadensis), fowl bluegrass (Poa palustris), prairie
cordgrass (Spartina pectinata), and white spiraea (Spiraea alba)
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Reed canarygrass is a native, cool-season, perennial grass [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  It
is not shade tolerant but is moderately tolerant of drought and saline
or alkaline soils [<a href="#31">31</a>].  It usually forms monotypic stands and is highly
competitive with timothy (Phleum pratense), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa
pratensis), and redtop (Agrostis alba), often invading these grasslands
to become the dominant cover type [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Inflorescence and seed development dates for reed canarygrass have been
recorded for Montana [<a href="#33">33</a>]:

inflorescence boot -    May through June
inflorescence appears - June
seed development -      June through July
seed dispersal -        July

Similar dates have been recorded for Illinois and Wisconsin [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Reed
canarygrass can bloom 16 weeks after germination.  At 5 to 7 weeks,
tillers form, and at 26 days rhizomes begin to develop [<a href="#1">1</a>].
Occasionally panicles are not produced until the second growing season,
and full stands are not reached until the third growing season [<a href="#31">31</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire probably top-kills reed canarygrass.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Early April fires may cause increases in reed canarygrass, while mid to
late May burns can prevent it from producing seed [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Reed canarygrass can be controlled to a limited extent by burning every
2 to 3 years during the dry season [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Prescribed fires are
recommended in April and May to prevent shrub invasion of sedge and reed
canarygrass meadows [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Marshes, where reed canarygrass is present,
can be burned in winter (when the ice is 9 to 12 inches [23-30 cm]
thick) to reduce plant density and improve wildlife feeding areas [<a href="#34">34</a>].
