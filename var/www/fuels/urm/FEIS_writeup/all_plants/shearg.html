<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Silver buffaloberry occurs in a variety of habitats including woodland,
pinyon (Pinus spp.)-juniper (Juniperus spp.), shortgrass prairie,
mixed-grass prairie, shrubland, sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), and riparian
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].

Silver buffaloberry occurs in seral communities throughout the
Intermountain region.  It is a riverine floodplain shrub in narrowleaf
cottonwood (Populus angustifolia), black cottonwood (P. trichocarpa),
and willow (Salix spp.) communities of California, Colorado, and Nevada
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].  In Colorado silver buffaloberry occurs in a narrowleaf
cottonwood/strapleaf willow (S. ligulifolia)-silver buffaloberry
association [<a href="#2">2</a>].  In North Dakota silver buffaloberry is a member of
the quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides)/water birch (Betula
occidentalis) habitat type [<a href="#29">29</a>].  

In eastern Montana and western North and South Dakota, silver
buffaloberry is an important species in woodland and riparian draws
dominated by green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  Some
common habitat types include green ash, green ash/chokecherry (Prunus
virginiana), and green ash/western snowberry (Symphoricarpos
occidentalis) [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  In western Montana a silver buffaloberry
community type has been described; western snowberry may form dense
ecotonal thickets around silver buffaloberry stands [<a href="#28">28</a>].  

Silver buffaloberry is an important species in native shortgrass and
mixed-grass prairies of the northern Great Plains.  In North Dakota
silver buffaloberry is commonly found in shrub-grassland communities
dominated by western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii), needlegrass (Stipa
spp.), blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), and little bluestem
(Schizachyrium scoparium) [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>].  Silver buffaloberry occurs in 
little bluestem-threadleaf sedge (Carex filifolia) and creeping
juniper (Juniperus horizontalis)/little bluestem habitat types [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>]. 

In the Black Hills silver buffaloberry occurs in a bur oak (Quercus
macrocarpa)/skunkbush sumac (Rhus trilobata) association [<a href="#34">34</a>].  In North
Dakota silver buffaloberry is the dominant shrub in the little Missouri
River Badlands [<a href="#39">39</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Shepherdia argentea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Silver buffaloberry is a valuable forage species for mule deer,
pronghorn, and grizzly bear [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].  It is browsed by mule deer
in Montana and constituted 15 percent of mule deer summer diets in 1969
[<a href="#11">11</a>].  In North Dakota silver buffaloberry is an important browse
species in mule deer winter diets [<a href="#39">39</a>].  In the northern Great Basin,
deer and elk browse silver buffaloberry [<a href="#54">54</a>].

In Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota, silver buffaloberry fruits
are eaten by sharp-tailed grouse, cedar waxwings, other passerine
species, and small mammals [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>].  In the northern Great Plains,
the fruit of silver buffaloberry provides the best native winter food
source for sharp-tailed grouse [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  In Montana sharp-tailed grouse
feed primarily on silver buffaloberry buds in the winter [<a href="#76">76</a>].

Silver buffaloberry is nearly worthless as livestock forage due to its
thornlike twigs [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  In Utah cattle and sheep make limited use of
silver buffaloberry [<a href="#41">41</a>].  In the northern Great Basin, silver
buffaloberry is fair forage for sheep [<a href="#54">54</a>].  Forage production under
dense, thorny, monotypic stands of silver buffaloberry is low; as stands
open up, forage production increases due to invasion by Kentucky
bluegrass [<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability ratings for silver buffaloberry are as follows [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>]:

Energy rating is fair and protein content is poor [<a href="#31">31</a>]; however,
Erickson [<a href="#13">13</a>] stated that the protein content of silver buffaloberry is
sufficient to meet maintenance requirements of sheep and cattle during
the growing season.  Silver buffaloberry fruit gross energy is
4.937 kcal/gram oven-dry matter and crude protein is 8.4 percent of
oven-dry matter [<a href="#14">14</a>].

In the northern Great Plains, silver buffaloberry provides nesting cover
for sharp-tailed grouse and many species of passerine birds [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].
In Montana the distribution of sharp-tailed grouse increases in areas
containing high densities (10-15% canopy cover) of silver buffaloberry
[<a href="#59">59</a>].

In Montana silver buffaloberry provides thermal and hiding cover for
livestock, upland game birds, small mammals, and big game [<a href="#28">28</a>].  In
North Dakota silver buffaloberry provides bedding sites for mule deer
[<a href="#39">39</a>].  


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Silver buffaloberry adapts well to disturbed or degraded sites in the
Intermountain region [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  It is used for multiple-row windbreaks,
shelterbelts, erosion control, wildlife habitat enhancement, and land
reclamation [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].  Nursery-grown stock readily establishes on
disturbed sites and once established, silver buffaloberry is a good soil
stabilizer [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Silver buffaloberry is used for erosion control in
riparian areas in the Intermountain region [<a href="#52">52</a>].    

In the northern Great Plains, silver buffaloberry is not recommended for
shelterbelt plantings because of high winds which may uproot plants
[<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Silver buffaloberry is an actinorhizal pioneer species that is
widely planted for land reclamation in the northern Great Plains [<a href="#44">44</a>].
It is used for rehabilitating mine spoils in the northern Great Plains
and Utah [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].  Restoration of coal mine spoils increases when
trickle irrigation is used for 2 years.  In North Dakota this technique
increased the survival rate of silver buffaloberry by 257 percent [<a href="#5">5</a>].
Dryland techniques for establishment of silver buffaloberry on bentonite
and low-salt coal spoils was moderately successful; survival rate of
silver buffaloberry at the start of the third year was 7 percent [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Plains Indians and pioneers preserved the fruit of silver buffaloberry
and made a sauce from the berries that was eaten with bison meat
[<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  Today the fruit is used to make pies, jams, and
jellies [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].

Silver buffaloberry is planted as an ornamental [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].  
   


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In the Black Hills silver buffaloberry has strong browsing resistance,
aided by thorny branches and the ability to sprout from the root crown
[<a href="#85">85</a>].  In Nevada silver buffaloberry decreases with grazing [<a href="#43">43</a>].  In
the Badlands of North Dakota, three green ash draws exposed to different
grazing intensities were selected to determine the effects of browsing
on silver buffaloberry height.  The mean height of silver buffaloberry
on the lightly browsed, moderately browsed, and heavily browsed sites
was 8.2 feet (2.49 m), 7.1 feet (2.17 m), and 7.3 feet (2.21 m),
respectively.  Both shrub- and tree-height silver buffaloberry had
highest density and percent cover on moderately browsed sites [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Silver buffaloberry fixes nitrogen [<a href="#77">77</a>].  

Silver buffaloberry is susceptible to leaf spot, white heart rot, and
insect parasites [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  White heart rot can lead to brittle wood
and subsequent breakage of branches by wind and snow [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Rodents may
harvest planted seeds and girdle young plants [<a href="#85">85</a>].  

Silver buffaloberry is difficult to transplant from its native habitat
[<a href="#39">39</a>].  For field transplanting, root cuttings will give best results
[<a href="#52">52</a>].  At the Woodward Field Station in Oklahoma, 9-year-old silver
buffaloberry transplants were 9 feet (2.7 m) tall and similar in spread
to plants growing in native ranges, but were less vigorous [<a href="#40">40</a>].

In silver buffaloberry stands trails are established by livestock and
deer which may open the stands to invasion by weedy species [<a href="#28">28</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Shepherdia argentea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Silver buffaloberry is a native, deciduous, thicket-forming small tree
or large shrub with spreading to ascending thorny branches
[<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].  It grows from 3.3 to 20 feet (1-6 m) tall [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].
Leaves are 0.8 to 2.0 inches (2-5 cm) long and 0.28 to 0.4 inch (7-10
mm) wide [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].  The drupelike, ovoid fruit is 0.16 to 0.24 inch (4-6
mm) long [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>] and is one seeded [<a href="#71">71</a>].  In western North Dakota 
rooting patterns of 323 silver buffaloberry shrubs were examined.  On
12-year-old silver buffaloberry shrubs that were 12 feet (3.6 m) tall,
97 percent of the total roots were found in the first 4 feet (1.2 m) of
soil.  The longest root was 22 feet (6.6 m) long.  The maximum depth of
root penetration was 5.8 feet (1.74 m).

Silver buffaloberry has thin, exfoliating bark with shallow furrows and
flat-topped ridges [<a href="#71">71</a>].  

A study on relatively undisturbed sites in North Dakota showed that
silver buffaloberry stems were 1 to 32 years old, with an average age of
7.62 years [<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Seed production begins at 4 to 6 years of age, with good seed
crops generally produced every 3 to 4 years [<a href="#77">77</a>].  The small, hard seed
shows poor and erratic germination.  The embryo is dormant; cold
stratification at 41 degrees Fahrenheit (5 deg C) for 60 to 90 days will
increase germination [<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>].  Seed can be stored under cold, dry
conditions in the laboratory for 11 to 15 years and retain viability
[<a href="#66">66</a>].  Silver buffaloberry seed with a moisture content of 13.1 percent
showed 97 percent germination after 3.5 years of storage at 41 degrees
Fahrenheit (5 deg C) [<a href="#77">77</a>].  Seed is disseminated primarily by animals
[<a href="#77">77</a>].

Vegetative:  Silver buffaloberry sprouts originate from a complex
network of underground stems and rootstocks [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].  It also sprouts
from the root crown [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Shrubs are interconnected for distances of up
to 20 feet (6 m).  In western North Dakota no seedlings were found in
323 silver buffaloberry shrubs examined [<a href="#39">39</a>].
    


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Silver buffaloberry occurs in riparian areas such as wet meadows,
floodplains, terraces, and along streams, rivers, lakes, springs, and
ponds [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>]. 

Silver buffaloberry grows best on moist to semiwet soils with good
drainage [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>], but will grow in semishaded areas and on dry, exposed
hillsides [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>].  It grows best on loam and sandy loam soils,
but occurs on clay, clay loam, and gravelly substrates as well
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].  Silver buffaloberry is tolerant of poorly drained soils
and some flooding, but is intolerant of prolonged flooding and
permanently high water tables [<a href="#28">28</a>].

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Silver buffaloberry occurs in seral and climax communities.  It is
generally shade intolerant, but grows in some shaded areas such as
semiwooded draws [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].  In New Mexico silver buffaloberry is an
obligate riparian species [<a href="#9">9</a>].  In North Dakota silver buffaloberry is
a pioneer species that invades grasslands [<a href="#39">39</a>]; it also occurs on older
portions of streams [<a href="#55">55</a>].  Silver buffaloberry is a highly competitive
species except with taller woody plants such as green ash [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].

In the northern Great Plains, silver buffaloberry forms dense, nearly
impenetrable thickets, often exceeding 6.6 feet (2 m) [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Where
there is abundant moisture and deep fertile soil, silver buffaloberry
may reach tree height; where conditions are severe, silver buffaloberry
persists as a low or medium shrub [<a href="#57">57</a>].

In California silver buffaloberry trees have suffered much crown
dieback as a result of water diversion; many of the damaged shrubs are
now regenerating from sprouts and seeds [<a href="#73">73</a>].
   


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Silver buffaloberry flowering dates are as follows:

California              Apr-May       [<a href="#89">89</a>]
Colorado                Apr-Aug       [<a href="#10">10</a>]
Great Plains            May-Jun       [<a href="#25">25</a>]
Montana                 Apr-Jun       [<a href="#77">77</a>]     
Nevada                  Apr-May       [<a href="#70">70</a>]
North Dakota            Apr-May       [<a href="#10">10</a>]
Utah                    Apr-May       [<a href="#10">10</a>]
Wyoming                 May-July      [<a href="#10">10</a>]
Saskatchewan            late Apr      [<a href="#33">33</a>]

Fruit ripening occurs from July to September in the Great Plains, July
to August in Nevada, June to August in Montana, and in early August in
Saskatchewan [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>].  Seed dispersal occurs from June to December
in Montana [<a href="#77">77</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Shepherdia argentea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Silver buffaloberry has fair tolerance to fire in the dormant state and
sprouts from rootstocks following fire [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].  In North Dakota the
green ash/chokecherry and boxelder/chokecherry habitat types, in which
silver buffaloberry is common, are adapted to fire.  When main trunks of
most shrubs and trees in these habitat types are damaged by fire, the
plants sprout from the root crown [<a href="#30">30</a>].  
  


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tall shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Small shrub, adventitious-bud root crown

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Shepherdia argentea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Silver buffaloberry is probably killed by severe fires.  In the northern
Great Plains, silver buffaloberry abundance was greatly reduced by "hot"
fires in early August [<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Silver buffaloberry sprouts from the root crown following fire
[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].  Varying responses to fire have been reported.  In northern
mixed-grass prairies, silver buffaloberry percent cover decreased after
spring and summer fires [<a href="#45">45</a>].

A 5 acre (2 ha) fire occurred in a plains cottonwood forest in Dinosaur
Park, Alberta, in August 1989.  In July 1990, average percent canopy
cover of silver buffaloberry on burned and unburned sites was 0.0 and
0.3, respectively [<a href="#53">53</a>].

In North Dakota an October 1976 fire burned mixed-prairie and wooded
draw plant communities.  Average densities (stems/sq m) of silver
buffaloberry within wooded draw transects in the summers of 1977 and
1978 were as follows [<a href="#88">88</a>]:

                               1977          1978 

lower draw-burned               0.5           1.2
upper draw-burned               1.5           1.9
unburned                        ---           0.6



<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Uses of fire specifically for managing silver buffaloberry are not
described in the literature.  In the northern Great Plains prescribed
fire may be useful for opening up shrub thickets or triggering sprout
reproduction of remnant shrubs in failing stands [<a href="#65">65</a>].
