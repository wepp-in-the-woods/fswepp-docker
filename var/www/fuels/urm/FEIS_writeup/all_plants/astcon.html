<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Aster conspicuus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Showy aster is a common constituent of summmer diets of black bear in
lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests of Alberta [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Showy aster is preferred forage for grizzly bears in the Bob Marshall
Wilderness Area, northwestern Montana [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Showy aster provides valuable forage for deer, elk, cattle, and domestic
sheep in Idaho and British Columbia [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Showy aster is low in resistance to repeated human trampling, but it may
recover rapidly.  In montane grassland in Montana, showy aster cover
increased more than 30 percent between the end of August and the
following June [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Showy aster cover decreased from 4.4 to 0.7 percent under heavy grazing
in a Douglas-fir forest in northern Idaho [<a href="#27">27</a>].  It also declined in
abundance and vigor following heavy grazing in a Douglas-fir vegetation
type in British Columbia [<a href="#25">25</a>], and decreased to 0.0 percent frequency
following 12 years of heavy grazing in a mountain meadow community in
northern Idaho [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Showy aster increased following clearcutting in a Douglas-fir/ninebark
(Physocarpus malvaceus) habitat type in western Montana [<a href="#1">1</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Aster conspicuus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Showy aster is a native, perennial herb.  Its peduncle is 1 to 2 feet
(30-60 cm) tall, and it usually has several shorter sterile stems
arising from extensive creeping rhizomes [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Rhizomes grow 0.5 to 2.0
inches (0.5-5 cm) below the soil surface [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Flowers are borne in an
open, flat-topped inflorescence [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Showy aster reproduces by seed.  Seeds are wind dispersed long
distances and can germinate on bare soil [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].

Asexual:  Showy aster sprouts from extensive, creeping rhizomes [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Showy aster occurs in continental boreal and cool-temperate climates on
moderately dry soils.  It is a common interior species on "water
shedding" sites [<a href="#12">12</a>].  It is most common in montane zones, but is also
found in forested areas of valley and lower subalpine zones [<a href="#14">14</a>].  In
Wyoming showy aster occurs from 5,500 to 9,000 feet (1,667-2,727 m)
elevation.  In Montana it is found from 3,000 to 7,100 feet (910-2,152
m) elevation [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Showy aster is tolerant of both sun and shade.  Small colonies typically
establish following stand-destroying fires or clearcutting and site
scarification [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Showy aster produces more vegetative growth and
fewer flowering stems with increasing shade in later succession [<a href="#14">14</a>].
It can, however, maintain extensive colonies beneath pine (Pinus spp.)
and open Douglas-fir canopies.  It is an indicator of late seres in
Douglas fir/ninebark (Physoparpus malvaceus) habitat types of central
Idaho [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Showy aster flowers in late summer throughout its range [<a href="#14">14</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Aster conspicuus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Showy aster is moderately resistant to fire, typically sprouting from
surviving rhizomes.  Rhizomes usually survive light- to
moderate-severity fires that do not cause excessive soil heating [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].

After fire, showy aster also regenerates from wind-dispersed and
soil-stored seed [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Growth is stimulated after fire, resulting
in mass flowering in the first few postfire years [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)
   Secondary colonizer - on-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Aster conspicuus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Showy aster is top-killed by fire.  Because rhizomes often survive, the
species has been classified as moderately resistant to fire [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Showy aster increases rapidly after fire [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Showy aster exhibits
mass flowering in postfire years 1 and 2.  The extent of flowering is
directly related to preburn abundance and postfire survivorship
[<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Showy aster frequency increased from 8 percent before fire
to 20 percent 2 years after a moderate-severity fire in a Douglas-fir
forest in Idaho.  By postfire year 7, showy aster frequency increased to
52 percent [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Following the 1977 Pattee Canyon Fire in Missoula,
Montana, showy aster cover was 1.4 percent in 1978 and 2.0 percent in
1982 [<a href="#16">16</a>].
