<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Agarito grows as a dominant or codominant in a number of desert shrub
and grassland communities.  It is on lands that have changed from mixed
prairie to open scrub oak-juniper (Quercus-Juniperus spp.) woodlands
[<a href="#42">42</a>] and where honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa)) is expanding its
range in Texas savannas [<a href="#2">2</a>].  It is also a component of south Texas and
Arizona chaparral, semiarid Texas grasslands, and pinyon (Pinus
spp.)-juniper woodlands [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Common codominants include
creosotebush (Larrea tridentata), tarbush (Flourensia cernua),
lecheguilla (Agave lechuguilla), juniper, sotol (Dasylirion spp.), yucca
(Yucca spp.), and black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda).

Agarito has been listed as a dominant in the following community
type classification:

Natural terrestrial communites of Brewster County, Texas [<a href="#21">21</a>]

Plant associates:  Common associates of agarito in bottomland
communities include little walnut (Juglans microcarpa), netleaf
hackberry (Celtis reticulata), oneseed juniper (J. monosperma),
littleleaf sumac (Rhus microphylla), and lotebush condalia (Condalia
obovata) [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Pungent oak (Quercus pungens), live oak (Q. virginiana),
mesquite, sugarberry (Celtis laevigata), Texas persimmon (Diospyros
texana), spiny hackberry (Celtis pallida), curly mesquite (Hilaria
belangeri), Texas needlegrass (Stipa leucotricha), grama (Bouteloua
spp.), and lotebush (Ziziphus obtusifolia) occur with agarito in scrub
oak-juniper woodlands and Texas savannas [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Ashe juniper (J.
ashei) and redberry juniper are common overstory dominants [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  In
chaparral communities, honey mesquite, curly mesquite, acacia (Acacia
spp.), threeawn (Aristida spp.)  and buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides)
are common associates [<a href="#8">8</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Mahonia trifoliolata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Browse:  Agarito reportedly has no forage value for cattle, horses, or
domestic sheep, and has little value for domestic goats [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Less than
1 percent of the tender new sprouts were browsed by Spanish goats
following fire on the Edwards Plateau of Texas [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Agarito is browsed
by deer in some areas [<a href="#35">35</a>] but is generally considered an "undesirable
deer food" [<a href="#5">5</a>].  In some locations, twigs, bark, and leaves of
grape-hollies (Mahonia spp.) are eaten by the ringtail, and various
species of hares and rabbits [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Fruit:  Agarito berries are readily eaten by many species of small birds
[<a href="#52">52</a>] and mammals.


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Leaves of agarito are spiny and unpalatable [<a href="#29">29</a>] and toughen with age
[<a href="#53">53</a>].  Mature leaves may remain palatable to some insects, such as
foraging ants, but often become too tough for the ants to cut [<a href="#53">53</a>].
Increasing toughness may deter large herbivores as well.

Berries are highly palatable to many species of small birds and mammals.


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Nutrient value of agarito varies by plant part [<a href="#30">30</a>] and phenological
development.  The chemical composition of mature foliage has
been documented as follows [<a href="#26">26</a>]:
                        
                              percent

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Agarito provides valuable cover for many wildlife species [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Clumps
or thickets serve as important hiding cover for white-tailed deer on the
rolling Texas plains [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Agarito forms good hiding, nesting, and
resting cover for a variety of small birds and mammals [<a href="#35">35</a>].  In parts
of Texas, wild turkeys occasionally nest beneath agarito [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Rehabilitation value of agarito is unknown.  However, plants can be
easily propagated from seed [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Seed can be planted in the fall, or
stratified and planted in the spring [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Agarito can also be
propagated by suckers, cuttings, and layering.  Properly treated
cuttings taken in early summer will usually root by fall [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Roots of agarito contain berberine and other alkaloids and were
traditionally used to make preparations for treating toothaches and
stomach ailments [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  However, these alkaloids are poisonous in
high concentrations [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Yellow dyes were made from the roots and wood
[<a href="#52">52</a>].

Fruit of agarito is edible [<a href="#51">51</a>] and can be used to make wine and jelly
[<a href="#52">52</a>].  However, Durand [<a href="#24">24</a>] cautions that when collecting the fruit of
Texas mahonias, "it is always a good precaution to poke around the bush
with a stick before threshing to make sure there are no rattlesnakes."
Seeds of agarito can be roasted and used as a coffee substitute [<a href="#52">52</a>].
Flowers provide nectar for honeybees, and consequently agarito is
considered to be a good honey plant [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].

The attractive leaves and flowers make agarito well-suited for use as an
ornamental [<a href="#45">45</a>].  It can be planted as a hedge or used singly [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].
When mixed with Amur privit, it forms an excellent and attractive
combination hedge [<a href="#24">24</a>].  The variety glauca has been cultivated in
England [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Agarito is relatively intolerant of cold temperatures and
in North America is not hardy north of zone 6 [<a href="#46">46</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Brushfield expansion:  During the past century, shrubs such as mesquite
(Prosopis spp.) and agarito have been increasing on Texas rangelands
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  An estimated 736,744 acres (1.82 million ha) of Texas
rangeland is now "infested" with agarito.  The situation is particularly
pronounced on the Edwards Plateau where agarito density can reach up to
121 plants per acre (300/ha) [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Possible causes of this shrub
expansion include fire suppression, overgrazing, and/or climatic change
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].

Grazing:  In semiarid grasslands of Texas, heavy grazing apparently
favors the spread of redberry juniper (Juniperus pinchotii) which in
turn facilitates the establishment of agarito.  Frequency of agarito is
typically highest on grazed sites occupied by redberry juniper, as
illustrated below [<a href="#39">39</a>]:

            high plains                   rolling plains
   grazed sites    ungrazed sites       redberry      redberry
 present   absent  present absent       j. present    j. absent
                      (percent frequency)
      
    29       0       63      20               25         0  

Mechanical removal:  Ranchers commonly view agarito as a nuisance [<a href="#24">24</a>],
and numerous studies have focused on various means of mechanical removal
[<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Soil penetration to a depth of 4 to 6 inches (10-15 cm) is
generally necessary to sever the taproot from the crown and to uproot
all lateral roots capable of resprouting.  Resprouting often occurs
where blade penetration is insufficient.  Small plants with shallow
roots are most readily killed by mechanical means [<a href="#19">19</a>].

On the Edwards Plateau of Texas, various types of mechanical grubbing
have produced erratic mortality [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Grubbing, using a modified blade
with fins on top, killed up to 93 percent of the plants where
pretreatment densities had ranged from 17 to 79 plants per acre
(42-195/ha).  Consequently, this method of control was judged both
effective and economical [<a href="#19">19</a>].  On rocky outcrops with shallow soil, the
blade was prevented from eliminating all of the lateral roots.  An
estimated 88 percent of agarito was killed on these sites.  Root plowing
is also effective, although often prohibitively expensive.
Posttreatment burning, when used in combination with mechanical removal,
can also aid in reducing agarito density [see Fire Management
Considerations].

Chemical control:  Agarito is resistant to many herbicides including
2,4,5-T and picloram [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Although canopies were reduced by 24
to 30 percent 13 months after large amounts of picloram were applied to
the soil, plants recovered within 24 months [<a href="#33">33</a>].  No plants were
actually killed by the herbicide.  Details on response to various rates
of herbicide application are available [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].

Damage/disease:  Agarito is susceptible to black stem rust [<a href="#52">52</a>].
However, roots contain large amounts of the alkaloid berberine, a
substance known to inhibit some root fungi.  Roots may, therefore, be
relatively resistant to a number of pathogens [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Biomass:  Models have been developed for predicting biomass estimates of
agarito.  Current growth is primarily leaves and includes little twig
elongation.  Studies indicate that new growth on young plants is greater
per unit volume than is growth on older plants [<a href="#16">16</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Mahonia trifoliolata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Agarito is a dense, thicket-forming evergreen shrub which grows 3 to 10
feet (1-3 m) in height [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Twigs are smooth and reddish-green
when young but turn gray to reddish-brown with age [<a href="#52">52</a>].  Bark is gray
to reddish-brown and often exfoliating [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].

The alternate, trifoliolate leaves are stiff, spiny, and hollylike
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Leaflets are thick and coriaceous, lanceolate-oblong to
elliptic, and have coarsely serrate or spinose margins [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].
Leaflets are pale green to glaucous [<a href="#28">28</a>].  

Yellowish, perfect flowers are borne in few-flowered racemes at the
upper axils or terminally on short shoots [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Fruit is a
subglobose to globose berry, 0.3 to 0.5 inch (8-12 mm) in diameter
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Berries are lustrous, and red or black to pruinose blue
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  The pulpy fruit is acidic and aromatic [<a href="#52">52</a>].  Fruit is borne
on short pedicels which are tightly appressed to the stem axis [<a href="#24">24</a>].
Each fruit contains one to several seeds [<a href="#52">52</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Agarito reproduces through seed and sprouts vigorously following most
types of disturbance.

Seed:  Agarito produces an abundance of seed nearly every year [<a href="#43">43</a>].  In
related species of mahonia, annual fruit production is sometimes reduced
by poor pollination and adverse weather conditions.  The specific
genetic composition of individual plants can also influence fruit
production [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Seed of agarito is dispersed during the summer by a
variety of birds and mammals.  Under natural conditions, seed germinates
the following spring [<a href="#43">43</a>].

Vegetative regeneration:  Agarito typically sprouts vigorously from the
roots or root crown after aboveground vegetation is removed or damaged
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Box and others [<a href="#11">11</a>] reported that agarito sprouts from or near
ground level after fire.  After mechanical removal, Cross and Wiedemann
[<a href="#19">19</a>] observed sprouting from lateral roots and from crown tissue
attached to the taproot.  The majority of regrowth (56 percent) was
attributed to lateral root sprouting, whereas 13 percent was derived
from crown tissue.  No sprouts were observed on the taproot itself.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Agarito grows in a variety of habitats including flat pastureland, lower
alluvial flats, in ephemeral drainage channels, on mesa sides, and on
dry, stony hills [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Agarito grows well on sunny sites
[<a href="#51">51</a>].  It is often well represented in riparian areas and in bottomland
communities of the rolling Texas plains [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].

Soils:  Agarito grows on a variety of soil textures including loam,
clay, shallow clay-loam, and gravelly soil [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  Soils are
commonly dry and well drained [<a href="#51">51</a>].  Agarito often occurs on soils
derived from limestone parent material [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].

Climate:  Agarito grows in semiarid climates with average annual
precipitation estimated at 22 to 30 inches (55-76 cm) [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Winters
are typically short and mild, with as many as 283 frost-free days per
year [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Elevation:  Agarito grows at approximately 3,000 feet (914 m) in Arizona
[<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Grasslands:  Agarito is a common woody invader in semiarid grasslands of
Texas [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  On the Edwards Plateau, mixed prairie has given rise to
a scrub oak-juniper disclimax in which agarito occurs as a prominent
woody species [<a href="#42">42</a>].  In many semiarid grasslands of Texas, redberry
juniper is a common invader on overgrazed sites.  The presence of large
junipers consequently facilitates the establishment and spread of
agarito [<a href="#39">39</a>].

Texas savannas:  In south Texas savannas which have been gradually
invaded by honey mesquite, species such as Texas pricklypear (Opuntia
lindheimeri) and prickly ash (Zanthoxylum fagara) assume dominance
during years 12 to 26.  Sugarberry, Texas persimmon, and lotebush
condalia commonly dominate 29- to 39-year-old stands, while agarito,
desert yaupon (Schaefferia cuneifolia), and lotebush dominate 36- to
45-year-old stands [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Agarito may eventually be lost from climax
stands [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Desert shrub communities:  Agarito invades disturbed desert shrub
communities including those in the Guadalupe Mountains of New Mexico.
It commonly appears in the "last stages of community degradation" [<a href="#54">54</a>].
Once vegetation has reached this level of degradation, recovery may be
unlikely.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Fruit ripens from April through July [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>], but reportedly reaches
peak ripeness on approximately May 1 [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Generalized flowering and
fruiting dates by geographic location are as follows:

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Mahonia trifoliolata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Relatively frequent fires in western Texas rangeland tend to favor
climax grass species [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Fire suppression and vegetative changes
brought about by overgrazing have contributed to the invasion of woody
species such as agarito [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Fine fuels have been reduced by both
grazing and fire suppression and competition from grasses has decreased.

Agarito generally sprouts from the roots or root crown after a single
fire [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Growth in large mottes affords some protection from fire.
Although the outer portion is commonly destroyed, centers of large
mottes are often undamaged.  Seed from adjacent unburned areas may be
dispersed onto burned sites by birds and mammals.  Some postfire
seedling establishment is possible.

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Mahonia trifoliolata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Agarito is described as "very resistant to fire" [<a href="#49">49</a>].  It is readily
top-killed by fire [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>], but underground regenerative structures such
as roots often survive [<a href="#49">49</a>].  In south Texas chaparral, mortality is
typically greatest on the windward side of large mottes, and least on
the leeward side.  Centers of large mottes are often undamaged [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Few plants were root-killed by a prescribed burn conducted in Tom Green
County, Texas [<a href="#49">49</a>].  However, 33 percent of individual agarito plants
were killed after a fall burn in south Texas chaparral [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Burned
plants generally exhibit damage such as split stems and shredding bark
[<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Agarito commonly sprouts from the roots or root crown after aboveground
vegetation is consumed by fire [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Lateral sprouting is most
common where the motte growth pattern existed prior to fire.  Centers of
large mottes often survive and subsequently increase in size in the
postfire community [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Individual plants and small mottes are
generally less likely to sprout.

Fire can cause reductions in canopy cover and relative abundance of
agarito [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  A single burn reduced cover by as much as 58 percent
in south Texas chaparral [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Following fire, many of the sprouts were
of poor vigor and some plants produced only a single sprout.
Approximately 40 percent of the plants that eventually died produced new
sprouts during the first spring [<a href="#11">11</a>].  However, many sprouts died during
the summer.  Some postfire establishment from seed may occur as birds
and mammals disperse seed from adjacent unburned sites.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Prescribed fire:  On west Texas rangeland, fires tend to favor climax
grass species and, when used in combination with other methods, can help
to reduce the cover of woody colonizers such as mesquite and agarito
[<a href="#10">10</a>].

Fire is most effective in reducing agarito when large mottes are first
mechanically treated [<a href="#11">11</a>].  In southern Texas grasslands, density of
agarito was reduced by 28 percent on plots which had been roller
chopped, shredded and burned, or roller-chopped, treated with
herbicides, shredded, and burned.  Density was unchanged on plots which
had been roller-chopped and shredded but not burned [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Without
pretreatment, burns are often patchy and uneven and leave many large
mottes intact [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Best results can often be obtained by waiting up to
3 years after the brush is chopped or shredded and allowing grass and
forbs to grow vigorously among the drying woody fuels.  The herbaceous
growth and chopped portions of old brush tops can provide fuel for a
relatively hot fire [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>], which is presumably more effective in
reducing agarito.  The following canopy cover of agarito was reported 1
year after a fall burn in south Texas chaparral [<a href="#11">11</a>]:

                  unburned          burned

control           5.6               1.1
shredded          1.2                .9
chopped            .7                .7
scalped            .3                .4

Evidence suggests that both fall and winter burns can reduce agarito.
However, winter burns tend to favor forbs, whereas fall burns often
decrease forb production and increase grass production[<a href="#12">12</a>].  In experiments
in south Texas chaparral, a fall fire with a winter reburn was more
effective in reducing agarito than either a single fall or winter fire
[<a href="#12">12</a>].  Response by season of burn was as follows on the Welder Wildlife
Refuge of Texas [<a href="#12">12</a>]:

            control           fall        winter      fall and winter
                        (percent composition)

            4.1               2.8         1.6         2.2

Wildlife:  Agarito is often replaced by more desirable browse species
such as honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.) and hackberry (Celtis spp.) after
fire in Texas shinoak rangeland [<a href="#44">44</a>].
