pine forest community [<a href="#24">24</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ilex coriacea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Large gallberry is not a preferred livestock forage, but livestock will
eat branches of young plants when other forage is scarce [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palability of large gallberry to white-tailed deer is considered
fair, although deer feed on more preferable forage when available
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Large gallberry provides security cover for a variety of reptile and
amphibian species in the southern coastal parts of its range [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Large gallberry presumably provides watershed protection and erosion
control.


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Pine growth is reduced by overtopping of seedlings or proximity to large
gallberry and other shrubs [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Large gallberry can be controlled by
streamline basal application of the herbicide Garlon 4 [<a href="#19">19</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ilex coriacea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Large gallberry is a small evergreen tree or large shrub, native to the
southeastern United States.  Its fruits are shiny black berries.  Plants
grow up to 7 feet (2.1 m) tall.  The leaves are leathery.  The flowers
are usually unisexual; the plants are dioecious [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State: Phanerophyte (microphanerophyte)
   Undisturbed State: Phanerophyte (nanophanerophyte)
   Burned or Clipped State: Crytophyte (geophyte)


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Large gallberry regenerates vegetatively by sprouting from rhizomes [<a href="#5">5</a>].
It also regenerates sexually, although the details have not been studied
[<a href="#27">27</a>].  The nature of the fruit suggests that the seeds are dispersed by
animals.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Large gallberry grows in pine savannas and flatwoods, shrub-tree bogs
and bays, open bogs, seepage areas in woodlands, on lower slopes, wooded
ravines, and depressions [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].

Typical soils are sandy, acidic, and low in organic matter.  They are
often poorly drained, and frequently or seasonally flooded [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].

Large gallberry is common on longleaf pine or longleaf pine-slash pine
sites.  Overstory associates include baldcypress and pondcypress
(Taxodium spp.), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), and water tupelo (N.
aquatica) [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].

Understory associates include saw-palmetto (Serenoa repens), sweetbay
(Magnolia virginiana), swamp cyrilla (Cyrilla racemiflora), bitter
gallberry (Ilex galbra), laurelleaf greenbrier (Smilax laurifolia),
buckwheat-tree (Cliftonia monophyla), blueberries (Vaccinium spp.), and
blackberries (Rubus spp.) [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Large gallberry is a mid to late seral species that grows well under a
canopy.  It tends toward a mature forest and competes with tree
seedlings [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  It typically does not on sites lacking the shade of a
dense canopy [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].



<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Large gallberry flowers between April and May; its fruit ripens from
September to October [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ilex coriacea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Large gallberry is sensitive to fire, but survives by resprouting from
rhizomes [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>]




<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on site surviving rhizomes
   off site colonizer; seed carried by animals or water; post fire yr 1&2

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ilex coriacea

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Large gallberry has very flammable foliage.  Most fires top-kill the
plant [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Large gallberry sprouts from underground rhizomes after fire [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Prescribed burning on a 1- to 3-year cycle effectively controls large
gallberry [<a href="#29">29</a>].
