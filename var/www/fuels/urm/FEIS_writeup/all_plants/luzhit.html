<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Smooth woodrush generally occurs with subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa)
and mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana).  It also occupies 20 to 25
percent ground cover of subalpine larch (Larix lyallii) communities in
the Pacific Northwest [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Associated tree species include Douglas-fir
(Pseudotsuga menziesii), western larch (Larix occidentalis), western
white pine (Pinus monticola), lodgepole pine (P. contorta), whitebark
pine (P. albicaulis), and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii).
Understory associates include grouse whortleberry (Vaccinum scoparium),
Sitka valerian (Valeriana sitchensis), mountain arnica (Arnica
latifolia), and menziesia (Menziesia ferruginea) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].

Publications listing smooth woodrush as an indicator or dominant species in
habitat types are as follows:

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Luzula hitchcockii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Smooth woodrush sites are generally important to wildlife species
inhabiting high elevations.  Thirteen plant species were identified as
being important grizzly bear food on a smooth woodrush habitat site in
northern Idaho and Montana [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Elk in central Idaho find smooth
woodrush sites to have medium forage value in both summer and fall [<a href="#9">9</a>].
Caribou use smooth woodrush sites in northern Idaho for calving habitat
during June to mid-July [<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Not much information is available concerning the palatability of smooth 
woodrush.  Grizzly bears in northern Idaho, however, comsume all plant
parts of smooth woodrush which include the flowers, leaves, roots, and
stems [<a href="#2">2</a>].

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>

<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Many of the sites that include smooth woodrush are outside commercial
timber production areas, and timber management activities are not
anticipated.  Therefore, management of smooth woodrush is generally not
part of a timber management plan.  Those sites occupied largely by
subalpine fir and mountain hemlock (SEE HABITAT TYPES) are generally
managed using partial thinnings, long rotations (60 to 80 years), and at
times are artificially regenerated [<a href="#28">28</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Luzula hitchcockii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Smooth woodrush is a short, rhizomatous perennial graminoid, 6 to 20 inches
(15-50 cm) tall, with round, hollow culms.  The leaves are shiny, 1 to 2
inches (2-6 cm) long, with flattened reddish-brown tips; often becoming
mottled rusty red in midsummer.  Smooth woodrush has a solitary
inflorescence containing small flowers.  Fruits are reddish-brown
capsules containing three seeds [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Smooth woodrush has been widely cited as being rhizomatous, and usually
regenerates into extensive colonies.  It also reproduces via seed.

Seeds:  Specific information relating to smooth woodrush is not
available.  Information on alpine rush (Luzula spicata), however, a
species which occupies a similiar environment, is available.  Seed
germination was experimentally induced in L. spicata by random
scarification, which was achieved by repeated freeze-thaw cycles,
followed by stratification for 2 to 3 months.  This germination
requirement may represent an adaptation to fall freeze-thaw cycles
followed by extended chilling under heavy snowpack [<a href="#7">7</a>].  In areas with
heavy snowpack, smooth woodrush has exhibited nearly full-sized growth
of etiolated shoots under the snow [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Seed dispersal:  Seeds of smooth woodrush are primarily dispersed by the
splash cup method.  Heavy raindrops falling directly, or from a tree
drip edge, throw seeds out from the flared lip of the open capsule.  In
higher elevations where heavy snowpacks restrict smooth woodrush height,
seed dispersal relies upon vibrations from wind or passing animals.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Smooth woodrush is found in high elevations, generally ranging from
5,700 to 8,200 feet (1,737-2,500 m), with deep, late-melting snowpacks
[<a href="#20">20</a>].  It occupies a variety of sites from montane forests to subalpine
and alpine slopes, ridges, meadows, and cirque floors [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Soils:  Smooth woodrush is found on soils derived from granitics to
noncalcareous parent materials.  Surface soils tend to be very acidic
(pH 4.2 to 4.8).  Soil textures range from sandy loam to gravelly loam
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Smooth woodrush is onsidered an indicator of cold environments where
snow lies late [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Once smooth woodrush becomes established, it often
forms a heavy mat which excludes other understory plants from
establishing.  It was listed as a mesic site indicator within the
subalpine larch habitat type in the Pacific Northwest [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Seasonal records for smooth woodrush are scarce.  The phenological
stages for alpine rush, however, were observed near Boulder, Colorado,
and are as follows [<a href="#6">6</a>]:

                            Apparent end            Spring bud  
                         of autumn die-back            break
                        -------------------         ----------
                        
Luzula spicata              20 September        30 March - 15 April


Herbarium specimens of smooth woodrush collected in western Montana
show a flowering period that ranges from June 28 to August 13 for plants at 6,000 to 7,100
feet (1,829-2,164 m).  At high elevations (8,000 to 8,700 feet
(2,438-2,652 m)), flowering occurs from July 15th to September 1 [<a href="#26">26</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Following fire, smooth woodrush sprouts from surviving rhizomes [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].
In western Montana, mean fire intervals for smooth woodrush sites range
from 30 to 41 years [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire will consume all aboveground parts of smooth woodrush.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Smooth woodrush often shows an increase in biomass following fire [<a href="#11">11</a>].
Following a fire in a whitebark pine community in the Bob Marshall
Wilderness, Monatana, smooth woodrush increased by 252 pounds/acre (92
kg/ha) from postfire year 1 to postfire year 3, while the cover percent
remained constant.  This biomass increase was attributed to vegetative
sprouting from the surviving plants [<a href="#5">5</a>].
