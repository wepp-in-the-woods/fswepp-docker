<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Water birch is most often found in riparian woodland communitiesqq
characterized by cottonwoods (Populus spp.), willows (Salix spp.),
alders (Alnus spp.), and box elder (Acer negundo) [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].
These communities often occur as narrow bands adjacent to streams on
alluvial terraces throughout the mountainous West in the Douglas-fir
(Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), or Engelmann
spruce (Picea engelmannii) zones but may extend well into big sagebrush
(Artemisia tridentata) flats [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Water birch also grows in
riparian communities in the Mojave Desert of California [<a href="#13">13</a>].  In North
Dakota, aspen (Populus tremuloides)/water birch habitat types are found
on relatively steep northeast- to east-facing slopes of upland ravines
[<a href="#16">16</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Betula occidentalis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Water birch seldom reaches commercial size and is therefore of
little importance for wood products.  However, the wood is "hard and
heavy" and is used locally for firewood and fence posts [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Water birch is only lightly browsed by most classes of livestock.  Sheep
and goats seem to browse this plant more than other livestock [<a href="#44">44</a>].
This species can sometimes form dense, monotypic stands, thereby
excluding access to livestock [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Community herbage production for
livestock may be low as a result of frequent flooding and alluvium
deposition [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Browsing of water birch by big game animals such as mule deer and elk is
light; use increases when other more palatable woody species become
scarce [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Birch (Betula spp.) catkins, buds, and seeds are
eaten by numerous bird species including sharp-tailed grouse, spruce
grouse, ruffed gouse, redpolls, pine siskin, chickadees, and kinglets
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  The broad-tailed hummingbird and red-naped sapsucker feed on
sap oozing from holes in the bark made by sapsuckers [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Beaver build
dams and lodges with water birch stems [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Water birch is generally considered to have a poor to fair palatability
rating for most classes of livestock and wildlife.  It may be slightly
more palatable to sheep and goats than to cattle and horses.  The relish
and degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife species for water
birch in several western states is rated as follows [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Water birch's energy and protein value is rated as fair [<a href="#8">8</a>].  


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Water birch often occurs in dense stands which provide excellent thermal
and hiding cover for many wildlife species [<a href="#15">15</a>].  A member of woodland
riparian communities, water birch contributes to structural diversity
which is an important habitat requirement of many avian species [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].
Grouse often winter in these riparian habitats and use water birch for
cover and food [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Cavity-nesting birds utilize mature trees [<a href="#47">47</a>].
Plants overhanging streambanks provide shade and organic matter
important for fish habitat [<a href="#47">47</a>].

The degree to which water birch provides environmental protection during
one or more seasons for wildlife species is as follows [<a href="#8">8</a>]:


                         CO    MT    ND    UT    WY

Pronghorn               ----  ----  ----  poor  poor

Upland game birds       ----  good  ----  fair  poor
Waterfowl               ----  ----  ----  poor  poor


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Water birch is well-adapted for revegetating disturbed riparian sites.
Nursery-grown seedlings transplanted onto moist sites establish easily
and grow rapidly [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>], but direct seeding is considered unreliable
[<a href="#37">37</a>].  Once transplants become established their roots effectively
stabilize the streambank [<a href="#47">47</a>].  The best time for transplanting is in
the spring just as the buds begin to turn green [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Seed may be collected from local trees for establishing nursery stock.
Proven seed collection and planting methods should be followed [<a href="#6">6</a>].
Seedlings are normally transplanted when 1 or 2 years old.  


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
In Utah, water birch is recommended for landscape plantings in
residential areas occurring on historic mule deer winter range.  Many
traditionally used landscape plants have been heavily browsed and
damaged by mule deer.  However, water birch is normally browsed only
moderately by mule deer and recovers quickly [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Soils on steep streambanks may be susceptible to sloughing, especially
along trails used by livestock and wildlife.  Heavy recreational use
associated with fishing in nearby streams may increase sloughing rates
[<a href="#15">15</a>].

The dense root system of water birch effectively stabilizes streambanks.
Stands should therefore be maintained for their streambank stabilization
value [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Betula occidentalis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Water birch is a highly variable species occurring as a deciduous shrub
or small tree.  On favorable sites it may attain tree stature and grow
to about 33 feet (10 m) tall with several trunks having diameters of
about 14 inches (36 cm) [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  However, it is more often found as a
shrub with several spreading trunks.  As plants mature, dormant buds
hidden beneath the bark at the base of the trunk begin to sprout sending
up small new trunks alongside the original one.  As these grow they also
produce sprouts so that a massive clump of up to a hundred or more stems
of all sizes is produced [<a href="#30">30</a>].  This dense thicket of multiple stems may
extend outward for several yards [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Windthrow is common since
plants are shallowly rooted and grow on sites with high water tables
[<a href="#30">30</a>].  The bark is thin, dark reddish-brown or yellowish-brown to brown
to nearly black on young trunks and has pale horizontal lenticels.  It
does not peel as readily the bark of paper birch (Betula papyrifera)
does [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  The leaves are simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic, 0.5
to 2 inches (1-5 cm) long and 0.25 to 1.6 inches (0.7-4 cm) wide, and
usually doubly serrate [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  Mature plants have separate male and
female catkins. One or sometimes two pistillate catkins occur on a
lateral spur and become conelike at maturity.  The fruit is a
broad-winged samara.

In eastern Oregon, eastern Washington, western Idaho, and southern
British Columbia water birch freely hybridizes with paper birch
producing many intermediate forms [<a href="#20">20</a>].  This further adds to the high
variability this species exhibits.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (microphanerophyte)
   Burned or Clipped State:  Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
The dispersal of thousands of small wind-blown seed is water birch's
primary method of reproduction.

Water birch plants are monoecious.  Male flowers occur in narrow catkins
that form in the summer, remain naked until the next spring, and then
elongate and shed their pollen.  The pistillate catkins appear with the
leaves, then become conelike as they mature by late summer or autumn.
Seed, in the form of winged nutlets, are dispersed in the fall by wind
and sometimes by water.  During late fall and winter the catkins
disintegrate on the plant, a process which may be aided by the foraging
activities of small birds such as chickadees or kinglets.  Seeds have
been observed blowing over crusted snow [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].

Birch (Betula spp.) seeds are very small and light.  All birch average
from several hundred thousand to a few million seed per pound [<a href="#6">6</a>].
Light is apparently needed for good germination.  Seed can germinate
soon after dispersal in the fall or the following spring.  Nursery
managers have found that birch seedlings require shade for 2 to 3 months
during their first summer [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Water birch is typically a riparian plant, occurring almost exclusively
along streams, springs, or other water courses [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  It is most
often found in colonies adjacent to streams on alluvial terraces or
steep sideslopes [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  This species is very flood tolerant, in
some areas enduring floods every year [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Plants may occasionally be
found on uplands [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].

Associated species:  Water birch is commonly found with other riparian
trees and shrubs.  Commonly associated trees include several
cottonwoods, boxelder, bigtooth maple (Acer grandidentatum), aspen,
peachleaf willow (Salix amygdaloides), Douglas-fir, and Rocky Mountain
juniper (Juniperus scopulorum) [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Commonly associated
shrubs include red-osier dogwood (Cornus sericea), woods rose (Rosa
woodsii), nootka rose (R. nutkana), chokecherry (Prunus virginiana),
thinleaf alder (Alnus incana ssp. tenuifolia), Saskatoon serviceberry
(Amelanchier alnifolia), sandbar willow (Salix exigua), yellow willow
(S. lutea), inland currant (Ribes setosum), and skunkbush sumac (Rhus
trilobata) [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].

Soils:  Water birch occurs on a wide variety of soil textures.  In
Montana, silty or sandy soils overlying a rocky substrate are most
common [<a href="#15">15</a>].  In Utah, coarse-textured soils are most common, and most
soils contain at least 35 percent rock fragments [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Profiles are
usually thin and overlie river cobbles [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Water birch has very high
nutritional requirements especially for magnesium and calcium.  Both
elements are normally available for uptake where it grows [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Elevation:  Water birch generally occurs at low to middle elevations
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Elevational ranges for the following western states are
presented below [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>]:

     4,000 to 8,800 feet (1,220-2,685 m) in UT
     5,800 to 8,500 feet (1,768-2,591 m) in WY
              


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Although water birch communities are normally restricted to streamsides
which receive seasonal flooding, most communities appear to be stable,
with little changes in the vegetation due to flooding [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Water birch is a deciduous shrub or small tree.  Male catkins begin
blooming in the spring before or as the leaves expand.  After
fertilization the female catkins ripen and develop into conelike
structures which resemble "miniature spruce cones" [<a href="#24">24</a>] and
disintegrate on the tree in the fall and winter [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  The leaves turn
yellow before they drop in the fall [<a href="#36">36</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Water birch is generally restricted to streamside communities where
fires occur infrequently [<a href="#7">7</a>].  When fires do occur, water birch's
aboveground plant parts are easily killed by fire; however, plants
normally resprout from basal buds [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Wind-transported seed from

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Aboveground plant parts of water birch are easily destroyed by fire
because its bark is both thin and flammable [<a href="#18">18</a>].  However, plants will
normally resprout from uninjured basal buds [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].

NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Water birch often sprouts from uninjured basal buds following fire
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Fires may expose mineral soils which are favorable seedbeds for
this species' light, wind-dispersed seed [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Water birch is normally restricted to riparian areas which may act as
natural fire breaks [<a href="#7">7</a>].
