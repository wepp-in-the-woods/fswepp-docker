<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Fire moss is widespread throughout Canada, where it is known from every
province and territory.  In the United States it occurs in every state.
It likely occurs in every country throughout the world but is possibly
replaced by closely related taxa in tropical latitudes [<a href="#16">16</a>].

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
The rapid colonization of fire moss after disturbance can help prevent
soil erosion [<a href="#29">29</a>].  In revegetation trials on disturbed riverbank sites
in Quebec, Canada, fire moss was codominant with Canada bluegrass (Poa
compressa) [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fire moss is able to tolerate much higher pollution levels than other
mosses [<a href="#26">26</a>].  It is common in urban and industrial environments
subjected to a variety of pollutants, along highways, and on the
tailings and refuse associated with both coal and heavy-metal mining
activities.  Fire moss is common in the vicinity of a zinc smelter in
Palmerton, Pennsylvania.  However, populations growing on mine tailings
or in other habitats contaminated by heavy metals often lack sporophytes
in spite of vigorous gametophytic growth [<a href="#30">30</a>].

Fire moss contains photoprotective pigments, which are a useful
adaptation for the bright antarctic environment.  Leaf pigment varies
from green to ginger [<a href="#24">24</a>].

The abundance of fire moss after disturbance promotes a large
accumulation of organic matter, which favors the development of
invertebrate fauna [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Fire moss is eaten by some grasshopper species in the genus Tetrix [<a href="#26">26</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ceratodon purpureus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Fire moss is a native, short moss that forms dense tufts or sometimes
cushions [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  The stems are erect, usually about 0.5 inch (1.3 cm)
long.  The upper 0.19 inch (0.5 cm) is current year;s growth [<a href="#28">28</a>]; often
slightly branched by forking at the tip of the old growth [<a href="#8">8</a>].  The
stems sometimes become 2.4 to 3.1 inches (7-8 cm) long in shaded places
[<a href="#14">14</a>].  Leaves are short and hairlike, spreading when moist; somewhat
folded or twisted when dry [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Fire moss is dioecious [<a href="#30">30</a>].  The capsules are held horizontally on the
end of a long seta (fruit stalk) [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Fire moss generally fruits
abundantly [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Wind is the main method of spore dispersal [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Spore germination in fire moss is a two-phase process.  Spores first
swell then distend [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Usually the setae are present in great numbers
in the colony; with changes in humidity they twist and untwist.  This
movement helps to jerk the capsules, helping in spore discharge.
Possibly the contraction of the grooves in the capsule at maturity also
helps to squeeze out the spores [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Spores of fire moss have remained
viable even after drying for 16 years [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Fire moss reproduces vegetatively via
protonemata (threadlike or platelike growths) [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Fire moss is often found on disturbed sites.  It occurs on a wide range
of substrates including soil, rock, wood, humus, old roofs, sand, and
cracks of sidewalks [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  It is most abundant on exposed, compact,
mineral, dry, gravelly or sandy soils but tolerates a wide range of soil
textures [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Sand dunes close to water in Scotland are colonized by
fire moss, which grows between the shoots of grasses [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Fire moss is
typically found associated with other species characteristic of
disturbed sites such as fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium) and pearly
everlasting (Anaphalis margaritacea) [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

Fire moss prefers low competition and high light; however, it is
somewhat shade tolerant [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  It is a colonizer of disturbed sites
and readily invades mineral soil by spores [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Fire moss is often
replaced by flowering plants in later stages of succession [<a href="#26">26</a>].  In the
black spruce (Picea mariana)-lichen woodlands of Alaska and Canada, the
first stage of revegetation, which lasts from 1 to 20 years, is
dominated by pioneer mosses such as fire moss.  Fire moss continues to
increase in the early part of the shrub stage but begins to decrease
toward the end of this stage [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Fire moss sporophytes appear early in the spring, as soon as the snow
melts [<a href="#3">3</a>].  In March, the setae reach their full height and begin to
turn from green to red.  Capsules mature by late spring [<a href="#8">8</a>].  By
midsummer the capsules often decay, and the setae break from the moss
[<a href="#14">14</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire moss is typically killed by fire [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Fire moss will colonize burned areas through lightweight, off-site,
wind-dispersed spores [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].  High-severity fire, which exposes mineral
soil, provides ideal conditions for the germination of fire moss spores.
Fire moss is often the dominant vegetation for several years following
high-severity fire [<a href="#26">26</a>].  It produces few spores late in the first
postfire year and many in the second [<a href="#7">7</a>].  If fire takes place in early
spring; gametospores can develop in 4 to 5 months.  If the fire takes
place in the fall, colonization is slower [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Following a 1976 high-severity summer fire on heathlands of Brittany,
France, fire moss was the most prevalent species in the majority of
sites until fall of 1979 when heavy rain and frost caused high mortality
[<a href="#4">4</a>].  Fire moss populations culminated about 15 years after a
high-severity fire in northern Sweden.  After 24 years, populations had
declined considerably [<a href="#31">31</a>].  At one site in Michigan, fire moss was
first observed in 1930, 4 years after a high-severity fire.  By 1940,
this moss covered 50 percent of the ground, and by 1950 it had colonized
95 percent.  Other mosses and Cladonia lichens appeared in 1942 and by
1971 had almost replaced fire moss [<a href="#26">26</a>].  On a severely burned heathland
in Brittany, France, a moss layer dominated by fire moss developed to a
maximum in the first year then decreased rapidly and disappeared by the
third year.  Forty-three percent of the original fire moss patches were
replaced by patches of the moss Polytrichum piliferum [<a href="#12">12</a>].

<b>CASE NAME : </b>
The effects of fires on black spruce forests 


<b>REFERENCE : </b>
Dyrness, C. T.; Norum, R. A. 1983 [<a href="#9">9</a>]


<b>SEASON/SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION : </b>
Seven units of black spruce (Picea mariana)-feather moss forest were
experimentally burned under various fuel moisture conditions during the
summer of 1978.  Surface woody fuels were sparse and the principal
carrier fuel was the forest floor (largely mosses and their
decomposition products).  Forest floors after burning comprised a
small-scale mosaic of unburned, scorched, lightly burned, moderately
burned, and heavily burned conditions.


<b>STUDY LOCATION : </b>
The area lies within the W 1/2 sec. 12, NE 1/4 sec. 13, T.4 N, R.2 W, of
the Fairbanks Meridian.


<b>PREFIRE VEGETATIVE COMMUNITY : </b>
The prefire vegetation was a typical open black spruce/feather moss
forest community.  The mature, open black spruce tree layer comprised a
mosaic of two dominant age-classes of about 85 and 140 years.  Some of
the seven units burned had small groups of aspen (Populus tremuloides)
and scattered paper birch (Betula papyrifera).  The tall shrub layer was
represented by scattered clumps of American green alder (Alnus crispa),
willows (Salix spp.) and prickly rose (Rosa acicularis).  The most
common low-growing shrubs were mountain cranberry (Vaccinium
vitis-idaea), bog blueberry (V. uliginosum), crowberry (Empetrum nigrum)
and Labrador tea (Ledum groenlandicum).  The herbaceous layer was very
sparse.  Virtually the entire forest floor was covered with a thick
layer of feather mosses.


<b>TARGET SPECIES PHENOLOGICAL STATE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>SITE DESCRIPTION : </b>
The total burned area covers about 32 acres (13 ha).  The elevation is
1,575 to 1,706 feet (480-520 m).  The slope is 10 to 15 percent and the
aspect is generally southeast to south from a main ridge running
southwest to northeast.  The position of the fires was on the upper
third of the slope.  The soil is silty loam, somewhat poorly drained in
shallow loess over schist bedrock.  Before the fire, a forest-floor
layer 8 to 12 inches (20-30 cm) thick was present.  The mineral soil is
made up of a very dark-brown silty loam surface horizon underlain by a
yellowish-brown, stony (30-50 percent by volume), silty loam subsoil.
Bedrock was generally within 29 inches (75 cm) of the surface.


<b>FIRE DESCRIPTION : </b>
Seven units of approximately 5 acres (2 ha) each were burned
individually between July 19 and August 8, 1978.  The down, dead, woody
fuels contributed little to fire behavior or subsequent fire effects.
Fire behavior on the seven units varied from slowly moving surface fires
to rapidly advancing crown fires.  All fires became crown fires on parts
or all of each unit.  The crown fires were passive, making the
transition after hot surface fires had passed beneath the trees.  The
surface fires determined the rate of spread, and the crown fires
followed, with flames commonly reaching 50 feet (15 m) or more.  Most of
the units were completely covered by fire and had burned down to glowing
combustion within an hour after ignition.  Weather conditions during the
fire at the seven units were as follows:

                                     Unit

<b>FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES : </b>
Fire moss was apparently not present in the prefire community.  For the
first 2 years after fire, heavily burned sites were invaded by fire
moss, which dominated along with fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium) and
Marchantia polymorpha.  Fire moss greatly increased in biomass for the
first 3 postfire years from about 8 g/m sq in 1979 to 38 g/m sq in 1980
and almost 60 g/m sq in 1981.


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS : </b>
Species such as fire moss tend to invade heavily burned areas by light,
wind-borne spores.  However, competition from sprouting plants on
lightly burned areas tends to limit fire moss invasion.  Areas must be
burned severely if a postfire community dominated by fire moss is the
goal.
