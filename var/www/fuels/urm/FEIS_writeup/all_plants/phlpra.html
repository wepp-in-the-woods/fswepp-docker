<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Timothy is of Eurasian origin but was first cultivated in the United
States [<a href="#47">47</a>].  It was found growing in New Hampshire in 1711 and was
named herd's grass.  In 1747, timothy spread from New England to Canada
and westward [<a href="#139">139</a>].  Timothy is found in all 50 states and throughout
Canada except Prince Edward Island and Labrador [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>].  Timothy is
widely cultivated in the northeastern states south to the Cotton Belt
and west to the 100th meridian, in humid regions of Puget Sound, and in
mountainous regions [<a href="#45">45</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Timothy is a palatable and nutritious forage for domestic livestock and
big game animals [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>].  It is cultivated for both hay and pasture
throughout North America [<a href="#140">140</a>].  Timothy is valuable for range seeding
because it grows under a wide variety of range and soil moisture
conditions [<a href="#96">96</a>].  On a Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) clearcut in
Montana, timothy was the preferred forage species of livestock [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Timothy is frequently seeded in mixtures with legumes for better
performance but is grown alone to make premium hay for horses.  Timothy
is also grown with meadow foxtail (Alopecurus arundinaceus), big trefoil
(Lotus uliginosus), and white clover (Trifolium repens) for hay and
silage [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Timothy is inferior to alfalfa and clover hays for
fattening cattle [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Timothy is grazed by deer and rodents in Washington [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Songbirds and
gamebirds consume timothy seeds.  It is an important forage for elk in
Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado and elsewhere, and is eaten by
mule deer and mountain sheep [<a href="#46">46</a>].  In Arizona in July, timothy
contributed 0.38 percent to mule deer diets [<a href="#53">53</a>].  In Glacier National
Park, timothy contributed 20 percent to elk diets in the spring, and
just a trace in the winter [<a href="#109">109</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Timothy is highly palatable to all classes of livestock and big game
species [<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>].  It is highly palatable to horses and cattle in
spring, summer, and fall; and to sheep in summer [<a href="#141">141</a>].  Palatability of
timothy is high for elk in the spring and summer, and high for deer in
the summer [<a href="#108">108</a>].

Palatability ratings for timothy from selected western states are as
follows [<a href="#143">143</a>]:

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The nutritive value of timothy decreases as plants mature; the
digestibility of cellulose is directly proportional to overall nutritive
value of timothy [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Crude protein, phosphorus, and carotene levels of timothy decline over
the course of the growing season.  Some nutritional values for timothy
are as follows [<a href="#56">56</a>]:

              dry    crude  crude  crude  ash   Ca     P    carotene

weathered     95.1    2.45  1.20   42.5   4.85  0.26  0.03    1.00

Moisture content of timothy decreases as the plant matures; before
heading, moisture content is 78.5 percent; at full bloom, moisture
content is 67.2 percent; and as seeds mature, moisture content is 49.9
percent [<a href="#46">46</a>].

Feeds with low digestibility have a low net energy value; the net energy
value of timothy hay is 43 therms.  The best time to cut grass for hay
is a few days after it has reached the stage of maximum flowering and
before seeds begin to form.  It will yield a greater return of
digestible nutrients per acre [<a href="#57">57</a>]:

Livestock utilize forested sites in the Black Hills of South Dakota less
than adjacent meadow sites.  Shading of timothy in forested areas
decreases sugars and easily hydrolyzable carbohydrates.  The high sugar
content of timothy in the meadow sites is associated with an increase in
utilization of these sites.  Phenological development is 1 to 2 weeks
later in forested areas than in meadow areas [<a href="#83">83</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Timothy provides important cover for a variety of game birds, small
mammals, and waterfowl [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#138">138</a>].  It provides cover for dwarf shrews
and deer mice in southeastern Montana [<a href="#75">75</a>].  Stands of redtop (Agrostis
alba), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis), and timothy are indispensable
as nesting cover and brood-rearing cover for prairie chickens in the
North Central States [<a href="#131">131</a>,<a href="#138">138</a>].

In grass meadows along drainage ditches in Wisconsin, timothy provides
nesting cover for sharp-tailed grouse, blue-winged teal, and prairie
chickens [<a href="#40">40</a>]. 

Regional cover values for selected wildlife species are as follows [<a href="#143">143</a>]:

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Timothy is widely used for rehabilitation of cutover, burned-over, and
overgrazed mountain rangelands [<a href="#119">119</a>].  It helps stabilize the soil and
is commonly used in Nebraska and the cornbelt for erosion control [<a href="#107">107</a>].
Timothy is used for rehabilitation of sites disturbed by construction of
railroads, canals, trails, and highways; logged sites; and sites altered
for recreational purposes.  It is recommended for use in the Alaska
boreal zone for reclamation and erosion control.  Timothy was seeded
onto a strip mine in south-central Alaska in 1976 and 1979, and was
found growing on those sites in 1981 and 1985 [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Timothy is well
adapted to intense disturbances.  Plant cover of timothy increases with
a corresponding increase in disturbance [<a href="#63">63</a>].

Timothy was used in the rehabilitation of a high-elevation mine on the
Beartooth Plateau, Montana.  Timothy was transplanted while dormant to
reduce physiological damage.  The well-developed root system and root
crown of transplants are not as susceptible to frost heaving and
desiccation as are those of emerging seedlings.  Consequently
transplanting is the most successful technique available for alpine
areas [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Timothy is good for short-term rehabilitation efforts
[<a href="#13">13</a>].

After a fire in South Dakota, timothy was seeded with other grasses at a
rate of ll pounds per acre (12.4 kg/ha).  As ground cover developed,
summer runoff and erosion rates decreased until cover density reached
about 60 percent.  Some stabilization of soil was realized in the first
growing season, and by the fourth growing season all areas were
stabilized.  Introduced species provide a more evenly dispersed cover
than native species and supply a steady accumulation of litter cover
[<a href="#93">93</a>].

Timothy was used as a part of a seed mixture for streambank and stream
bottom reseeding on the Manti-Lasal National Forest in Utah.  It was
recommended that all recently exposed sand and gravel bars within the
stream channel and floodplain be broadcast seeded with this seed mixture
to help control flooding and landslides [<a href="#128">128</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Timothy is successfully and profitably used for reseeding rangelands
where the soil is moist and the growing season long enough for seed
production [<a href="#119">119</a>].  Before planting, managers should take into account
the grazing management plan for the ranch or range unit.  Seeded species
can do more harm than good, and timothy may not always be the most
appropriate species.  Exotic grasses are one of the most disruptive
factors in native fescue grasslands in Glacier National Park [<a href="#118">118</a>].
Timothy is the most widely distributed exotic in the park, where it is
associated with substrate disturbed by post-1980 underground utility
construction.  Timothy was intentionally seeded by outfitters in the
1940's and by park personnel in the 1980's.  Extensive tiller mats of
timothy limit cryptogam colonization sites and reduce native graminoid
colonization.  Reduction of timothy is not a realistic option in Glacier
or other natural areas; the most reasonable recommendation for resource
managers is not to use it for revegetating disturbed sites [<a href="#118">118</a>].

The exotics of greatest concern to wildland managers are timothy and
Kentucky bluegrass because they establish quickly, spread vigorously,
and usually escape early detection.  Timothy has the highest ability of
34 exotics tested to invade closed vegetation areas.  Constancy values
in forest, meadow, and alpine tundra is 99, 99, and 36 percent,
respectively.  Numbers and frequency of timothy increases from
undisturbed sites to regularly disturbed sites.  More resources are
available at the latter sites because competition is greatly reduced.
Timothy is of great concern because it often dominates the area it
occupies.  Control should include both elimination and simultaneous
introduction of a desirable competitor [<a href="#130">130</a>].

Livestock use:  Timothy maintains itself well with proper management,
but it is not resistant to heavy grazing.  It will grow up to 12 years
on properly managed rangelands, but stands tend to die out in 6 to 7
years [<a href="#119">119</a>].  Grazing is chiefly responsible for impoverishment and
retrogressive succession of vegetation in Utah; erosion caused by sheep
and cattle grazing is pronounced, and the runoff in many riparian areas
has reached flood proportions.  Grazing must be regulated better in
these areas [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Moderate grazing in Iowa and Wisconsin was more
destructive than mowing.  Grazing compacts the soil and if important
range grasses are overgrazed, timothy will start to dominate range sites
[<a href="#23">23</a>].

Cattle grazing should be deferred to late summer to lessen streambank
alterations; forage utilization should be monitored closely to enhance
improvements in bank protection [<a href="#78">78</a>].  Noncontinuous grazing early or
late in the growing season has a less detrimental effect on other
vegetation than does continuous season-long grazing [<a href="#67">67</a>].  Meadows
should be grazed on a rotation plan.  In humid zones, timothy should be
grazed until the jointing stage, then mown for hay at bloom stage; this
can be repeated two to three times under favorable grazing conditions.
Timothy meadows should be harrowed and fertilized annually [<a href="#130">130</a>].

Riparian areas are directly affected by upland site conditions.
Management including no grazing, limited grazing, or artificial
restoration can stabilize erosive areas and reduce sedimentation and
destructive erosive runoff to downslope riparian areas [<a href="#111">111</a>].  

Timothy seedlings can be detrimental or beneficial in young conifer
plantations.  They may hinder conifer seedling establishment by
preemption of resources, allelopathy, attraction of insects and animals,
and increased fire potential.  They can be beneficial by excluding other
competitive plant species.  Timothy seedlings compete strongly with
conifer seedlings, especially when conifer seedlings are not fully
established.  After establishment of conifer seedlings, approximately 5
years, timothy seeds may aid conifer seedling growth by excluding shrub
competition.  Grasses should be eliminated from plantations until
conifer seedlings have become established; the limiting resource is soil
moisture [<a href="#82">82</a>].  The interior Douglas-fir-Engelmann spruce (Picea
engelmanii)-subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) biegeoclimatic zones have
potential for producing both trees and grass depending on soil
capability, erosion hazards, regeneration objectives, and cattle
management problems [<a href="#85">85</a>].

Establishment:  Timothy should be planted before or early during the
2-month period most favorable for rapid germination and seedling growth:
late summer, early spring, or late fall in most regions; June or early
July in high mountains; August for irrigated plantings.  When used in
mixtures with legumes, the mixture should be at the optimum time for
seeding legumes.  Timothy seeds germinate rapidly:  10 days in lab
testing aided by prechilling.  Timothy seedlings are moderately
vigorous.  They usually become well established by the second growing
season, and sometimes by the end of the first growing season under
favorable conditions and a longer growing season.  Maximum dry matter
hay yields are obtained by harvesting in the postbloom stag  [<a href="#129">129</a>].

Fall seeding is best when seeding timothy alone or with winter wheat.
Seedlings from fall seedings are less likely to be injured by dry
weather in late spring or early summer than seedlings from spring
seedings.  Also, less seed is required for fall than for spring
seedings.  For the fall, 3.5 pounds per acre (4.0 kg/ha) are needed; in
the spring, 10 pounds per acre (11.2 kg/ha) are needed.  Timothy is
commonly sown with clover or alfalfa to produce hay with higher protein
content and to maintain better soil productivity [<a href="#119">119</a>].  When timothy is
seeded in mixtures with other perennial grasses, it will be replaced by
the slower developing, longer lived species in a few years.  Except at
higher elevations, properly managed stands are maintained by good seed
crops.  Timothy competes successfully with native grasses only where
moisture and soil are favorable [<a href="#104">104</a>].

Fertilizers increase timothy seedling establishment in mineral and peat
soils.  There is more rapid growth on peats, but sustained growth is
better on mineral soils that are kept moist.  Fertilizer trials indicate
that a N plus P treatment is most effective [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Diseases:  Timothy is susceptible to winter crown and root rots.  Purple
spot (Heterosporium phlei) is widespread in timothy stands but is rarely
severe.  Severe infection will impair hay quality and reduce seed yields
[<a href="#139">139</a>].

Cultivars:  There are 25 varieties of timothy used in agricultural
practices today.  In Montana, recommended varieties are 'Climax' and
'Hopkins'.  'Climax' timothy should be used for seed production on
irrigated land or dryland with favorable moisture.  'Hopkins' timothy
should be used for hay and seed production on irrigated lands or high
altitude dryland with favorable moisture [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Another cultivar used
frequently in Alaska, is 'Engmo' timothy.  It is a long-lived perennial
that can persist indefinitely if not killed by winter or pathogens [<a href="#62">62</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Phleum pratense
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Timothy is an introduced, cool-season, perennial bunchgrass that grows
from 20 to 40 inches (51-102 cm) tall [<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>].  Culms emerge from a
swollen or bulblike base and form large clumps.  The flowering heads of
timothy are cylindrical and spikelike, and about 6 inches (15 cm) long.
The one-flowered spikelet produces seeds that are small and enclosed in
awned, urn-shaped husks [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>].  Leaves of timothy are flat and 3
to 13 inches (7.6-33 cm) long [<a href="#119">119</a>].  Timothy is generally short-lived
(4 to 5 years) but can live up to 6 or 7 years [<a href="#124">124</a>].  Timothy has a
moderately shallow and fibrous root system; roots can extend to 48
inches (120 cm) in depth [<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>]. Timothy is nonrhizomatous [<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>].
Timothy plants contain corms at their base which are annual, forming in
early summer and dying the next year when the seed matures [<a href="#47">47</a>].

Timothy forms vesicular-arbuscular endomycorrhizal associations [<a href="#143">143</a>].  


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction:  Timothy reproduces mainly from seed.  It is a
prolific seeder [<a href="#140">140</a>]; the small, hard seeds are dispersed by livestock,
wind, and other agents [<a href="#119">119</a>].  There are 1.1 to 1.3 million seeds per
pound (0.495-.0585 million per kg) [<a href="#133">133</a>].  Maximum germination usually
occurs about 3 or 4 weeks after it is harvested, when nearly 100 percent
should germinate.  Germination rates remain high for 1 to 2 years.
Timothy seed remains viable for 4 to 5 years if kept in a dry, cool
place [<a href="#133">133</a>].  Timothy seedlings are vigorous and fast growing [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Timothy reproduces vegetatively through
tillering [<a href="#2">2</a>].  When timothy plants are plowed under, many become
reestablished through rooting stems which develop and grow upwards to
the surface.  Vegetative reproduction occurs through buds in the axils
of the leaves, at nodes which may or may not be adjacent to the corms
[<a href="#29">29</a>].  Tillering suppression has been noted at the onset of sexual
reproductive growth [<a href="#2">2</a>]. 

The major site of carbohydrate storage is in the lower regions of the
stems (corms, stem bases, and stolons).  Adequate carbohydrate reserves
are important in perennial plants for winter survival, early spring
growth initiation, and regrowth initiation after herbage removal [<a href="#134">134</a>].
High night temperatures decrease the carbohydrate reserves of timothy.  


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Timothy is adapted to a wide range of climatic and edaphic conditions
but grows best on well-drained moist clay or loam soils [<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#140">140</a>].
Timothy is best adapted to growth in poorly drained alluvial, Humic
Gley, and Brown Podzolic soils [<a href="#39">39</a>].  It thrives in deep, fertile,
loamy, silty, and clayey soils of humid regions but can also grow in
thin, gravelly, and rocky substrates if adequately moist [<a href="#129">129</a>].

Timothy has escaped cultivation and has become established at medium to
high elevations in the mountains where it grows in moist grasslands, in
aspen and conifer stands, and along roadways.  It has become naturalized
on sites ranging from warm, dry grasslands to cool, moist supalpine
forests [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Timothy has a medium to high water requirement and is
intolerant of drought.  It does best on sites where the water table is
low enough to allow at least the upper 6 inches (15 cm) of soil to
remain unsaturated most of the year [<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#140">140</a>].  Timothy is intolerant of
alkaline or acidic soils.  Lower pH limit is 4.5 to 5.0 [<a href="#124">124</a>].  It can
tolerate up to several weeks of flooding in the winter but only a few
days during the growing season [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>].

Timothy needs about 20 inches (50 cm) of precipitation per year on good
soils, and up to 30 inches (76 cm) on less favorable soils.  Irrigation
greatly enhances productivity in dry climates [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>].  Timothy has
excellent cold tolerance and winter hardiness [<a href="#129">129</a>].  It will tolerate
high shade but thrives in partial shade [<a href="#108">108</a>].

Timothy does best at medium elevations but grows up to 11,500 feet
(3,506 m) in Colorado [<a href="#119">119</a>].  Regional elevation distributions are as
follows [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]:

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

Timothy usually occurs in early to mid seral stages, although it can
also dominate in self-perpetuating grasslands.  It is an intermediate
competitor.  It colonizes disturbed areas via seed [<a href="#123">123</a>].  Timothy has
been observed in early seral mixed forests [<a href="#41">41</a>].  In southwest Ohio, it
was found in fields up to 50 years of age but not in fields 90 years of
age [<a href="#123">123</a>].  Timothy does better following disturbance of sites in early
successional stages compared with those in later successional stages.
For example timothy cover was high after disturbance in old fields and
low after disturbance in forests.  Mid-seral old fields contained an
abundance of timothy [<a href="#123">123</a>].  In Wyoming, a cottonwood-grass sere is one
of the dominant riparian communities in the Northern Great Plains.  It
progresses from seedlings of Great Plains cottonwood establishing on
newly deposited alluvium, to a thicket of sandbar willow and cottonwood,
to cottonwood forest, to shrubland dominated by snowberry and wood's
rose, to a self-perpetuating grassland dominated by timothy [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Timothy begins growth in early spring.  Flowering occurs from June to
September, depending on altitude and latitude [<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>].  Seeds are
formed by midsummer and are released in August.  Timothy produces a
moderate amount of cool-season regrowth in early summer and fall with
adequate moisture and fertility [<a href="#129">129</a>].

Some reported dates for anthesis are as follows [<a href="#133">133</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]:  

        Colorado             June-September
        Wyoming              June-September
        Montana              June-August
        North Dakota         June-July
        Ohio                 June-July

Timothy seeds are harvested in Missouri in July, and in Minnesota in
early August [<a href="#133">133</a>].  There is a critical period in early fall for
transfer of food reserves to the corms [<a href="#29">29</a>].

</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
As with most perennial grasses, timothy is well adapted to fire.
Susceptibility of pasture or range vegetation to fire depends on
specific fire adaptations of the species and phenological stage when
burned.  Timothy has underground regenerative organs that are not harmed
by moderately severe fires.  Timothy is harmed if burned when actively
growing in the spring and summer but is fairly fire tolerant when
dormant [<a href="#129">129</a>].  In Yellowstone National Park after the fires of 1988,
timothy sprouted from the roots after being top-killed [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Timothy can
occurs on extremely cold sites; these sites seldom burn [<a href="#129">129</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Moderately severe fires will top-kill timothy, and severe fires may
cause damage to or kill the root crown, killing the plant [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Fire stimulates the production of reproductive tillers in timothy.  In
Illinois, a prescribed burn in August was beneficial for rejuvenation of
timothy sods.  Seed production increased following fire, and there was
an increased success of timothy 2 to 4 years after the burn [<a href="#132">132</a>].

In Oregon in early November, fire increased the vegetative yield and
maximum height of timothy [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Following a prescribed prairie fire in
Iowa carried out after snowmelt but while the soil was still frozen,
timothy started growth 2 to 3 weeks earlier in the spring and matured
earlier on burned areas than on adjacent unburned areas [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Several forage species were tested for performance on recently burned
lodgepole pine sites in northeastern Washington.  After 4 years, timothy
was considered adequate in vigor and density.  On a northeastern slope,
timothy was more successful because of better soil and moisture
conditions [<a href="#27">27</a>].

On a game farm in Pennsylvania, 5 acres (2 ha) were burned on April 22,
1983 to determine vegetation response.  Timothy production decreased
after the spring burn.  There was no change in percent composition of
timothy between 4 and 16 months after the fire.  Early spring burning
temporarily reduced perennial grasses and increased forbs.  Grassy cover
improved by postfire year 2 [<a href="#49">49</a>].

<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Timothy is often used to stabilize soil against erosion and to provide
cover for wildlife in clearcut areas that have been burned [<a href="#3">3</a>].  In the
midwestern states, prairie fires are often prescribed and timothy seeded
to provide nesting cover for prairie chickens and waterfowl [<a href="#3">3</a>].
  
In Montana, timothy was aerially seeded on a lodgepole pine clearcut
that had been burned.  It was monitored for 12 years, from 1962 to 1973.
Timothy was a strong competitor in the early years postburn, but
eventual dominance by native grasses was suggested by the decline of
timothy from 3.0 percent in 1964 to 0.7 percent in 1973 [<a href="#71">71</a>].

  Percent vegetal cover for timothy for 12 transects, 1962-1973    
           
  1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9    10    11    12
 0.6   2.1   3.0   2.5   1.7   1.9   ---   1.8   ---   1.3   ---   0.7
 
In Oregon on a clearcut burned in 1969, timothy was seeded with a
mixture of other grasses and legumes at a rate of 6 pounds per acre (6.8
kg/ha).  In 1973, timothy was abundant.  By 1984, timothy declined
drastically in numbers, partially because of heavy grazing pressure
[<a href="#86">86</a>].

In Deadwood, South Dakota in 1959, an intense forest fire burned 4,500
acres (1,800 ha) of land.  Artificial seeding on 4,011 acres (1,604 ha)
at 11 pounds per acre (12.4 kg/ha) of a mixture containing timothy was
completed.  The mixture consisted of 3 pounds per acre (3.4 kg/ha) of
timothy, 3 pounds per acre (3.4 kg/ha) of smooth brome, 2 pounds per
acre (2.25 kg/ha) of Kentucky bluegrass, 2 pounds per acre (2.25 kg/ha)
of yellow sweet clover, and 1 pound per acre (1.125 kg/ha) of hairy
vetch.  Two sites were seeded.  Site one was on stony-loam soil at 5,400
feet (1,620 m) and site two was on a finer textured soil at 4,900 feet
(1,470 m).  Timothy established quickly and persisted in dominance on
site one.  At site two, timothy was codominant with other species [<a href="#93">93</a>].

In northern Alberta, timothy was used to reseed burned-over land after a
fire in 1950.  The organic matter was destroyed and the depth of ash was
1 to 3 inches (2.5-7.6 cm).  Seedings were done in the fall on 3 to 6
inches (7.6-15 cm) of snow and in April at the same depth with no snow
or frost.  Productivity was not influenced by the time of seeding.
Timothy seeds established where moisture was adequate.  Stands of
timothy declined with age [<a href="#3">3</a>].
