<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Many waterfowl species eat the seeds and occasionally the leaves of
foxtail barley [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Before flowering, foxtail barley is palatable to
livestock and big game.  Up to the time when seedheads develop, it is
fair to good forage for cattle and horses and fair for sheep [<a href="#35">35</a>].

Foxtail barley seedheads, when dry, are very harmful to all kinds of
grazing animals, particularly deer, elk, and pronghorn [<a href="#35">35</a>].  The
sharp-pointed joints of the spike, each with several long and slender
awns, stick in the nose and mouth of grazing animals, often penetrating
the flesh [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Infection caused by awns stuck in tissue can cause
necrotic sores and necrotic stomatitis, which in turn finally attacks
the bones and causes an abnormal enlargement as well as lumpy jaw and
pus-forming abscesses.  These infections may result in death of the
animal [<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability of foxtail barley to livestock and wildlife species in
several western states is rated as follows [<a href="#8">8</a>]:

                         CO      MT      ND      UT      WY

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Foxtail barley has potential for revegetation of saline mine spoils
where forage value is of secondary importance.  Its extensive root
system and aggressive habit make it a good species for erosion control.
Foxtail barley seeds are not commercially available [<a href="#45">45</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Foxtail barley, cut before the awns have expanded, is sometimes used as
an ornamental in dry bouquets [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Because of the damage foxtail barley can cause to livestock and other
animals, it is often considered a pasture weed [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Hay
containing foxtail barley is nearly valueless [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Additionally,
seedheads of this species can downgrade the value of wool or pelts,
causing further economic loss to ranchers [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Once established,
foxtail barley is hard to eradicate.  It increases under excessive
grazing pressure.  Dense stands are usually associated with some type of
disturbance, such as overgrazing, close mowing, or repeated burning
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].

Seeding disturbed meadows and pastures with desirable, fast-growing
forage grasses is effective in reducing the amount of foxtail barley
that invades the site.  Additionally, conservative grazing can
facilitate the establishment of native, palatable grasses and reduce
foxtail barley [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

Control with herbicides:  Forty-eight pounds of dalapon
(2,2-dichloropropionic acid) per acre (7.2 kg/ha) in water at 50 gallons
per acre (76 liters/ha) has been shown to give complete kill of foxtail
barley.  Lower rates of 16 and 32 pounds of dalapon per acre (2.4
kg/ha-4.8 kg/ha) allows some survival.  A combination of 30 pounds (4.5
kg/ha) of dalapon and 4 pounds (0.6 kg/ha) of amino triazole per acre
will also effectivly control foxtail barley [<a href="#36">36</a>].  The herbicide
mefluidide is most effective in controlling foxtail barley when applied
near initiation of flowering [<a href="#39">39</a>].  In a meadow brome (Bromus spp.)
stand, the herbicide kerb at the rate of 0.5 pounds per acre ( 0.7
kg/ha) gave excellent control of foxtail barley without apparent
reduction of the meadow brome [<a href="#18">18</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Hordeum jubatum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Foxtail barley is a short-lived, native, perennial, cool-season grass
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  It has erect, slender stems, 1 to 2 feet (0.3-0.6 m)
tall, growing in thick bunches or tufts [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  The roots are
fibrous [<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction:  Foxtail barley is a prolific seeder.  Ripe
seedheads break up and are dispersed by wind or transported in the hair
of grazing animals [<a href="#35">35</a>].

Seed germination:  Foxtail barley produces two germination cohorts:  one
in the spring and one in the fall.  These two cohorts are important in
maintaining populations of foxtail barley [<a href="#2">2</a>].  On a saline marsh at
Rittman, Ohio, foxtail barley seed production per inflorescence was
greater with an increase in soil salinity [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Seed germination is
inhibited by warm summer temperatures, but seeds readily germinate when
exposed to cooler fall temperatures.  After cold stratification the
temperature range favorable for germination broadens.  Freezing
temperatures result in high seed mortality [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Seeds are capable of
germinating in 1.0 percent total salts or less. Germination decrease
when salinity increases past 1.0 percent [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Germination is
independent of light conditions [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Seedlings:  Foxtail barley seedlings can survive for several months at
salinities unfavorable for growth and reproduction.  In a marsh at
Rittman, Ohio, highest survival of fall and spring seedlings occurred in
the most saline lower marsh [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Foxtail barley reproduces vegetatively by
tillering [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Foxtail barley grows chiefly on grassland types on the plains and lower
foothills but also extends upward to subalpine elevations in the spruce
belt.  It is very common throughout the West, especially along roadsides
and other waste places, and in grain and hay fields [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  It
reaches its greatest abundance on the edges of sloughs and salt marshes,
grassy slopes, and flatlands in the western prairies [<a href="#4">4</a>].  It is also
abundant in overgrazed sagebrush margins and irrigated meadows [<a href="#14">14</a>].  In
sagebrush, pinyon-juniper, salt-desert shrub, and plains grasslands
communities, it generally occurs in areas where extra water has
accumulated, such as sloughs and around stock-water developments [<a href="#38">38</a>].

Soils and salt-tolerance:  Foxtail barley grows well on a variety of
soil textures ranging from sandy loam to clay, with clay content varying
from 17 percent to 56 percent [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  It requires fairly moist
conditions and cannot sustain itself during long dry periods [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].
Foxtail barley commonly occurs on soils with moderate salinity but can
also grow and reproduce under nonsaline conditions [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Foxtail
barley has a broad tolerance to variations in pH.  It occurs in areas
with a pH from 6.4 to 9.5, with a median value of 8.1 in the surface
soils [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Elevational range:  The elevational range of foxtail barley in several
western states is as follows [<a href="#8">8</a>]:

        Utah:  2,500 to 8,800 feet (762-2,682 m)
        Colorado:  3,400 to 10,400 feet (1,036-3,170 m)
        Wyoming:  3,500 to 9,400 feet (1,067-2,865 m)
        Montana:  2,100 to 3,900 feet (640-1,189 m)

Plant associates:  Foxtail barley may occur in relatively pure stands in
moderately saline communities or as a codominant with inland saltgrass
(Distichlis stricta var. stricta) and spearleaf saltweed (Atriplex
patula var.  hastata) [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Foxtail barley is also commonly associated
with coastal saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), nutka alkaligrass
(Puccinellia nutkaensis), Pursh seepweed (Suaeda depressa), heath aster
(Aster ericoides), field sowthistle (Sonchus arvensis), curly dock
(Rumex crispus), bluegrass (Poa spp.), and wheatgrass (Agropyron spp.)
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Foxtail barley is a pioneer or invader in disturbed areas and in areas
with high salinity [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  It is among the first grasses to
establish after disturbance and may become dominant in early seral
grassland communities.  It also occurs but is not dominant in some late
seral to climax grassland communities [<a href="#29">29</a>].  It rapidly invades areas
exposed by a receding water table.  If the water table becomes stablized
at a high level, foxtail barley will ultimately be replaced by saltgrass
(Distichlis spp.) or common spikesedge (Eleocharis palustris) in saline
areas [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Foxtail barley starts growth in April or May.  Flowering and seed set
generally occur from May until late July [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Moderate fires with probably top-kill foxtail barley, and hot fires may
kill the underground root system.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Foxtail barley generally recovers after fire through off-site seeds
[<a href="#27">27</a>].  Foxtail barley is most sensitive to spring fire that coincides
with its active growing period [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  After a North Dakota prairie
fire in the spring of 1966, foxtail barley culm production was greatly
reduced [<a href="#12">12</a>].  However, the opposite was found to be true following a
1972 spring fire on a northwestern Minnesota prairie.  Here flowering
activity was stimulated [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Following a burn along the Missouri River
Breaks of central Montana, foxtail barley was one of the first grass
species to become established [<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
As a general rule, undesirable cool-season grasses such as foxtail
barley can be reduced with late spring burns [<a href="#41">41</a>].
