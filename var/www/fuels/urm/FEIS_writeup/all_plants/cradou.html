<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of Douglas hawthorn is Crataegus
douglasii (Lindl.) [<a href="#18">18</a>].  There are three extant varieties, each
distinguishable by floral parts and geographic location [<a href="#19">19</a>]:

                    C. douglasii var. douglasii 
                    C. douglasii var. rivularis
                    C. douglasii var. suksdorfii

C. douglasii var. douglasii and C. douglasii var. rivularis have 10
stamens each and occupy mesic sites in the northern Rocky Mountains.  C.
douglasii var. suksdorfii has 20 stamens and occupies moist sites
generally west of the Cascades.  Current research strongly supports var.
suksdorfii as a distinct species, C. suksdorfii [<a href="#6">6</a>].

<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Crataegus douglasii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
The most widespread occurrence of Douglas hawthorn is in the Pacific
Northwest, from southeastern Alaska south through British Columbia,
Alberta, Washington, and Oregon to northern California.  Inland
distribution encompasses northern Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming,
western Montana, and Idaho. Douglas hawthorn may also be found as a
disjunct in northern Michigan, Minnesota, Sasketchewan, and southern
Ontario [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].

Contradictory information concerning the distribution of Douglas
hawthorn is plentiful.  Many sources [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>] include populations
distributed into the Dakotas, and isolated disjuncts in New Mexico,
Arizona, and Texas.  Stiles [<a href="#35">35</a>] claims to have sampled fruits and seeds
of Douglas hawthorn from the Eastern deciduous forests (40 degrees N).
Others [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>] have shown no distribution east of Montana (excluding
the Great Lakes disjunct) or south of Utah.  The basis of these
contradictions may be the inclusion of Douglas hawthorn varieties in
some botanical range maps.  The information presented above is assumed
to be the true distribution of C. douglasii var. douglasii.

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Douglas hawthorn generally occurs as an understory dominant in plant
community types, or associations.  It mostly occurs as an understory
species within sites dominated by black cottonwood (Populus
trichocarpa), eastern cottonwood (P. deltoides), quaking aspen (P.
tremuloides), or ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa).  In western Montana,
Douglas hawthorn has been described as a nonextensive riparian dominance
type [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Pure stands of Douglas hawthorn typically have an understory
occupied by Wood's rose (Rosa woodsii), chokecherry (Prunus virginiana),
or common snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus).  In west-central Montana,
Douglas hawthorn exhibited at least 5 percent cover value within the
tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia cespitosa) community type [<a href="#28">28</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Crataegus douglasii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Douglas hawthorn has no known wood products value.


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Forage production is usually low from Douglas hawthorn thickets.  Stands
may be so dense as to preclude most livestock use.  Livestock will,
however, readily eat Douglas hawthorn foliage when it is accessible
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Douglas hawthorn thickets produce an abundant amount of food
and cover for wildlife species [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Dried fruits and stems provide
autumn food for frugivorous birds such as blue and sharp-tailed grouse
in Washington and Idaho [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Mule deer and small mammals consume
dry Douglas hawthorn fruits in Utah during winter [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Marks and Marks
[<a href="#27">27</a>] found that sharp-tailed grouse in western Idaho fed exclusively on Douglas
hawthorn fruits.  No documentation, however, is available concerning bud
consumption when ripened fruits become unavailable.


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Seasonally, Douglas hawthorn was found to be moderately palatable to
livestock.  Evidence of hedging was apparent on many smaller individuals
on a site in northeastern Oregon [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Cattle prefer Douglas hawthorn
thickets less than 3 feet (1 m) tall; stem utilization can often exceed
50 percent [<a href="#28">28</a>].  In Utah, Douglas hawthorn is a poor browse species for
sheep, cattle, and horses [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
In general, the energy and protein value of Douglas hawthorn is fair.
For ungulates and waterfowl in Utah, the food value is rated fair to
poor; for small nongame birds and mammals, it is rated good [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Nutritional information on Douglas hawthorn fruit from the Rainbow Creek
Research Natural Area, southeastern Washington, is presented below [<a href="#29">29</a>]:

* Percentages based on dry pulp masses


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Douglas hawthorn has good structural diversity, and provides both
thermal and hiding cover.  Birds such as magpies and thrushes are
especially attracted to Douglas hawthorn for cover and nesting due to
its thick, intricate branching [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Avian use is heaviest during the
nesting/brooding season, and at the time of fruit ripening [<a href="#11">11</a>].  During
the winter, Douglas hawthorn continues to provide dense escape cover
[<a href="#27">27</a>].  Black-billed magpie nests are built mainly in Douglas hawthorn
crowns, and long-eared owls will build their nests atop magpie nests
[<a href="#11">11</a>].  Fourteen species of birds were found to use Douglas hawthorn for
nesting/brooding cover in northeastern Oregon [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Small mammals also
use Douglas hawthorn stands for cover.  Rickard [<a href="#32">32</a>] found deer mice and
long-tailed voles living in Douglas hawthorn thickets. In a 1979 summer
census, it was estimated that 280 to 320 individuals/acre (700-800/ha)
were inhabiting a Douglas hawthorn community.  Mountain voles made up 80
percent of the population in all seasons [<a href="#20">20</a>].

The degree to which Douglas hawthorn provides environmental protection
during one or more seasons for wildlife species is presented below [<a href="#12">12</a>]:

                       Utah       Wyoming
                      ------     ----------
Pronghorn              poor         poor
Elk                     na          fair
Mule deer              fair         good

Waterfowl              poor         poor


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Douglas hawthorn is an excellent soil and streambank stabilizer.
Successful seedling establishment, however, is difficult, and growth
rates are slow.  The use of transplanted nursery stock is recommended
[<a href="#17">17</a>].  In north-central Washington, over 6,700 Douglas hawthorn saplings
were planted across 93 acres (37.5 ha) to provide forage and cover for
wildlife adjacent to an altered reservoir site [<a href="#9">9</a>].  In Utah, the
erosion control potential of Douglas hawthorn is considered medium,
short-term revegetation potential is low, and long-term revegetation
potential is medium [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Douglas hawthorn's brushy growth form makes it a desirable species for
biological barriers between recreational areas and physical structures
[<a href="#17">17</a>].

Native people of the Nuxalk Nation, Bella Coola, British Columbia,
utilize Douglas hawthorn fruits in the summer as food.  It has been
estimated that one person can harvest 250 ml of fruits in approximately
1.5 minutes.  One Douglas hawthorn tree averages 550 fruits [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Little is known about cultivating this genus.  Most hawthorns develop a
long taproot and should not be kept in seedbeds more than 1 year [<a href="#4">4</a>].
Limited agriculture/livestock development will help maintain Douglas
hawthorn thickets, thus protecting an important food and cover species
for wildlife [<a href="#27">27</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Crataegus douglasii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Douglas hawthorn is a large shrub or small tree ranging from 3.5 to 13.0
feet (1-4 m) tall and possessing straight, strong thorns 0.5 to 1.0 inch
(1.00-2.50 cm) long.  Leaves are generally 1.5 to 2.5 inches (3-6 cm)
long, broad, and serrated at the tip.  Blackish, smooth fruits are about
0.5 inch (1 cm) long.  Numerous mosses and lichens are present upon the
entire bark system [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>]

Douglas hawthorn stems are usually clustered from the base or from a
point just above the soil surface.  Shade-killed lower limbs persist on
the stem, creating large, dense thickets [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Stems are very flexible
and have been shown to withstand avalanche impact pressures of up to 10
tons per square meter [<a href="#8">8</a>].



<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte
   Cryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Douglas hawthorn produces many fertile seeds.  Following the removal of
aboveground stems, Douglas hawthorn will resprout and sucker from the
root system [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Seeds:  The average amount of cleaned Douglas hawthorn seeds collected
from Washington, Idaho, and Oregon was 22,600 per pound (10,170/kg).
Cultivation of Douglas hawthorn seed requires pregermination treatments
to break embryo dormancy.  Scarification in acid for 0.5 to 3.0 hours,
followed by 84 to 112 days of cold treatment at 41 degrees Fahrenheit (5
deg C) will generally yield 50 to 80 percent germination [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Douglas hawthorn can be found at lower elevations from 2,200 to 5,400
feet (670-1,645 m).  It typically forms small, dense, impenetrable
thickets in irregular patterns across open areas or along moist riparian
sites [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Douglas hawthorn is also found on steep, uncultivated
slopes [<a href="#11">11</a>].  In west-central Montana, it is common on mesic valley and
montane sites [<a href="#22">22</a>].  It can be found on all exposures, including dry
southern exposures, where moisture levels are sufficient [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Soils:  Douglas hawthorn generally occurs on deep, moist, fine-textured
soils.  Soils under Douglas hawthorn stands were found to be cooler and
wetter than adjacent steppe communities in eastern Washington [<a href="#11">11</a>].
These stands typically provide 100 percent soil cover, thus increasing
soil moisture by decreasing surface soil temperatures [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Kauffman
and others [<a href="#20">20</a>] found soils beneath Douglas hawthorn in northeastern
Oregon to have a thick A-horizon, 13 to 17 inches (33-43 cm), with
evidence of mottling.  Depth to the parent material varied from 27 to 40
inches (69-100 cm), but was usually less than 30 inches (75 cm).


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Douglas hawthorn predominantly occurs as an understory species (see
Habitat Types); however, it can be found in pure stands.  Typically,
Douglas hawthorn does not occupy disturbed sites [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Disturbance from
fire, agricultural cropping, or flooding seems to inhibit proliferous
growth [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Butler [<a href="#7">7</a>], however, found Douglas hawthorn present on
frequently disturbed areas such as avalanche shoots in Glacier National
Park, Montana.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Specific information concerning the seasonal development of Douglas
hawthorn is not available.  Douglas hawthorn fruits are considered ripe
when they are black and lustrous.  In Oregon fruit was dispersed from
August 16 to 31, and in Washington from July 15 to 30 [<a href="#35">35</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Douglas hawthorn is fire tolerant [<a href="#11">11</a>].  This tree has a shallow and
diffuse root structure that allows for sprouting and sucker-rooting
following the destruction of aboveground parts [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Crataegus douglasii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Both high- and low-severity fires will consume the aboveground parts of
Douglas hawthorn.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
The structural configuration of Douglas hawthorn limbs makes it highly
flammable due to the sheltering of dry grasses and twigs.  These fuels
may create a "ladder" for fire to be carried up to the crown, destroying
the entire thicket.


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
The range of Douglas hawthorn is limited by fire.  Removal of the plant
may require years of growth for full reestablishment.  Frequent fires
may confine Douglas hawthorn plants to dense thickets [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Daubenmire [<a href="#11">11</a>] hypothesized that the expanded range of Douglas hawthorn
stands in eastern Washington was the result of improved agricultural
cropping practices which exclude stubble burning.  Douglas hawthorn
thickets have redeveloped from stump sprouts as the number and size of
fires have decreased [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].
