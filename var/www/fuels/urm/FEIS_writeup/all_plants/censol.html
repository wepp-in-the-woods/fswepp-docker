As of this writing (2002), yellow starthistle is listed as a noxious weed in at
least 11 states and 2 Canadian provinces. See the <a href="https://invader.dbs.umt.edu/">Invaders</a> or
<a href="https://plants.usda.gov/">Plants</a> databases for more information. The
California Exotic Pest Plant Council lists yellow starthistle as one of the most
widespread and invasive wildland pest plants in California (<a href="https://www.caleppc.org/info/plantlist.html">CalEPPC</a>).&nbsp;

Yellow starthistle is native to southern Europe and western Eurasia (<a href="https://www.rbge.org.uk/forms/fe.html">Flora Europaea</a>). Today, yellow starthistle can be found in most of the temperate areas
around the world [<a href="#82">82</a>]. In North America, yellow starthistle now occurs in at least 41 of
50 U.S. states and 4 Canadian
provinces. Yellow starthistle is reported to be adventitious in Hawaii [<a href="#138">138</a>]. Infestations of yellow starthistle in the eastern 2/3 of the U.S. are
sporadic and localized, but apparently populations fail to establish and persist
on a year-to-year basis, possibly because of unfavorable growth conditions
[<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. Infestations west of the Rocky Mountains are most severe in
California, Washington, Oregon and Idaho [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].
Infestations in California cover more area than those in all other states
combined [<a href="#82">82</a>].<p>It is likely that there were multiple introductions of
yellow starthistle to the U.S. [<a href="#78">78</a>], and that
contaminated alfalfa seed (<i>Medicago sativa</i>) was the primary vehicle for
these introductions [<a href="#82">82</a>]. Yellow starthistle seeds were found in adobe bricks from the period between 1824 and 1848 in
California (Hendry 1931, as cited by [<a href="#54">54</a>]). The plant was
first collected in Oakland, California in 1869 and was most likely introduced from Chile, while introductions from 1899 to 1927 appear
to be from Turkestan, Argentina, Italy, France and Spain [<a href="#32">32</a>].
Introduction of yellow starthistle to other western states began in the late
1800s, and it was first reported outside of California near Bingen, Washington, around 1900
[<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>]. Yellow starthistle began
spreading into grasslands in the Pacific Northwest in the 1920s. By 1985 yellow
starthistle had spread to about 8 million acres (3.2 ha) in California [<a href="#81">81</a>]. Extensive
road building, suburban development, and
expansion in the ranching industry since the 1960s have contributed to the rapid
and long-range dispersal of seed and the establishment of new satellite
populations [<a href="#45">45</a>].</p>
<p>
 The following table reflects estimates of yellow starthistle acreage as reported by
surveyed states or provinces in 1988 and again in 2000 (from [<a href="#38">38</a>]):</p>

In California, yellow starthistle is widely
distributed in the Central Valley and adjacent foothills, and is spreading
into mountainous regions of the state below 7,000 feet (2134 m). It is less commonly
found in desert, high mountain and moist coastal
sites [<a href="#35">35</a>]. Yellow starthistle is found primarily on disturbed sites
in the grassland steppe and oak woodlands [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>]. California
annual grasslands are dominated by many exotic species of European origin, both
grasses and forbs, more than 70% of which originated in the Mediterranean
region, including yellow starthistle [<a href="#67">67</a>]. Infestations in California and
the Pacific Northwest range from scattered individuals to dense stands of yellow starthistle
associated with annual grasses [<a href="#133">133</a>].&nbsp;
<p>
In the Pacific Northwest, yellow starthistle
codominates with cheatgrass (<i>Bromus tectorum</i>) on over 625,000 acres 
(250,000 ha) of grassland steppe [<a href="#131">131</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>]. In southwestern Oregon, 
yellow starthistle grows on foothill sites [<a href="#15">15</a>]. In
Washington, yellow starthistle is capable of establishment and at least
short-term persistence in any of the major plant communities below subalpine.
However, it is found primarily in the southeastern part of state on 
south-facing natural grassland slopes [<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>].

<br />

Yellow starthistle in an invasive winter annual, or rarely a biennial or
short-lived perennial forb. Yellow starthistle populations in the U.S. exhibit variations in
phenology (bolting and flowering time) and morphology (plant size and leaf
shape) [<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>]. Sun [<a href="#142">142</a>] found genetic diversity within
yellow starthistle populations, and little divergence between populations. The following description provides characteristics
of yellow starthistle that may be <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">relevant to fire ecology
and </span>is not meant to be used for identification. Keys for identifying yellow starthistle
are available [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>].<p> Yellow starthistle stems are stiff and erect, 6 to
72 inches (15-200 cm) in height. Stems are openly branched, except in
some very small plants [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>]. Yellow starthistle produces rosette leaves that lie close to the ground
[<a href="#133">133</a>]. Lower leaves are 2 to 6 inches (5-15 cm) long, and progressively smaller up the
stem. Upper leaves are 0.4 to 1.2 inches (1-3 cm) long, narrow and densely
covered with cobwebby hairs later in the season.</p>
<p> Yellow starthistle
inflorescences are borne in solitary flowerheads on stem tips, although vigorous
plants may produce flowerheads in branch axils. The involucre is about 0.5 to 0.7
inches (1.2-1.8 cm)
long. Phyllaries have 1 long central spine 0.4 to 1 inch (1.0-2.5 cm) long and 2 or more pairs
of short lateral spines and are densely to sparsely covered with hairs. Yellow
starthistle fruits are achenes of 2 types, both glabrous and about 2-3 mm long.
Most of the achenes (seeds) (75-90%) have a short (2-5 mm), stiff pappus (plumed). Seeds at the periphery of
the flowerhead are darker in color and have no pappus (plumeless).</p>
<p>Yellow starthistle has a large taproot that grows to soil depths of 3.3 feet
(1 m) or
more, allowing access to deep soil moisture during dry summer and fall months
[<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>]. Hairs and waxy coating on
mature yellow starthistle leaves reflect light, thus reducing the heat load and transpiration
demand, while winged stems also dissipate heat. These qualities, along with deep
roots, allow yellow starthistle to thrive under full sunlight in hot, dry conditions
[<a href="#30">30</a>]. Vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
have been observed on yellow starthistle plants [<a href="#50">50</a>].&nbsp;</p>



<p> Once established, yellow starthistle can
survive at high population densities, with estimates of 2-3 million plants per
acre (5-7.5 million per hectare) reported. This dense cover reduces sunlight penetration to the soil
surface, inhibiting germination and development of competing vegetation. Old yellow starthistle stalks
are persistent and usually remain standing through the winter [<a href="#20">20</a>].</p>



<p>It has been suggested by several researchers
that yellow starthistle might have an allelopathic effect on surrounding vegetation; however,
there is no direct evidence to substantiate that claim [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].

Yellow starthistle is a facultative winter annual (sometimes biennial, from a
tap root) that relies on abundant seed production for population persistence
and spread [<a href="#80">80</a>]. The reproductive biology [<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>] and life history [<a href="#131">131</a>] of yellow
starthistle have been explored.</p>



<p>

<font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Breeding system:</b></font>  Yellow starthistle is monoecious, pollinator-dependent and facultatively
xenogamous [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. Most yellow starthistle plants are self-incompatible [<a href="#80">80</a>].</p>



<p>

<font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Pollination:</b></font> European honeybees are an important pollinator of yellow starthistle and may be
responsible for up to 57% of seed set [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. Bumblebees are also important floral visitors, and several other insects
contribute to the fertilization of yellow starthistle ovules [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].<br><br>

<font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Seed production:</b></font>  The number of flowerheads and seeds produced by yellow
starthistle plants varies with soil moisture and intensity of competition.
Plants can produce 1 to 1,000 flowerheads per plant and 30 to 80 seeds per
flowerhead [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>]. Large plants can produce nearly 75,000
seeds, and Roche [<a href="#117">117</a>] calculated a
potential 148,928 seeds produced by a nursery plant. The number of seeds per
unit area produced by an infestation of yellow starthistle has been measured by several
authors, with reports ranging from 14 to 100 million seeds per acre (35-250 million
seeds per hectare) [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>]. The number of seeds produced on an annual basis is dependent
on the size of the infestation and the amount of spring precipitation [<a href="#131">131</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>]. Sheley and Larson
[<a href="#131">131</a>]
measured seed output in yellow starthistle at 1,940 and 470 seeds per square foot
(21,600/m<sup>2</sup> and 5,200/m<sup>2</sup>) under moist and dry
spring conditions, respectively. The percentage of plumed seeds ranges
from about 70 to over 90% [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>]. In heavy infestations, yellow starthistle populations produce far more seeds than are
necessary to reinfest the area year after year [<a href="#30">30</a>].</p>



<p>



<font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Seed dispersal:</b></font>    Distribution of yellow starthistle seedlings is predominantly in
and near the previous year's yellow starthistle debris, suggesting a relatively slow
rate of spread [<a href="#117">117</a>]. Plumeless seeds usually remain in seedheads until fall and winter
(between November and February [<a href="#133">133</a>]) and fall to the soil just below the parent plant as seedheads deteriorate
[<a href="#20">20</a>]. The size of the pappus on plumed seeds is small relative to seed size and
wind moves seeds only short distances, roughly equal to the height of the plant
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>]. Roche [<a href="#114">114</a>]
recorded 92% of seeds falling within 2 feet (0.6 m)
of the parent plant, and 48% within 1 foot (0.3 m). A combination of gusty wind
and dry conditions maximizes wind dispersal. Roche also measured maximum wind dispersal
at about 16 feet
(&lt;5 m) over bare ground with wind gusts of 25 miles per hour (40 km/hr).
While not an effective long-distance dispersal mechanism, wind dispersal can
serve
to increase the area of an infestation by persistently advancing the perimeter. Yellow starthistle seed
can also be transported over short to medium distances by animals and humans. The pappus bristles are covered with stiff,
microscopic
barbs that readily adhere to clothing and hair [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>]. Long-distance dispersal of yellow starthistle seed is
often directly related to human activities and occurs by movement of livestock, vehicles,
equipment, and contaminated hay and crop seed [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>]. Birds such as ring-necked pheasants, California quail, house finches, and
American goldfinches feed
heavily on yellow starthistle seeds [<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>]. While some (e.g. ring-necked pheasants) may be responsible for long distance dispersal
of yellow starthistle seed, most seeds consumed by birds are lost to the regeneration pool
[<a href="#114">114</a>].&nbsp;
</p>



<p>Seed losses have been recorded by researchers as a discrepancy between total
seed production and number of seeds dispersed. In Washington, plumed
seed was dispersed in August with a 30% loss between crop production and
dispersal, and plumeless seed was released in December with a 65% loss [<a href="#74">74</a>]. Sheley and Larson
[<a href="#130">130</a>] observed a 41% loss of seed production at the time of dispersal. Further
losses are observed between dispersal and seedling establishment. Roche [<a href="#114">114</a>] found 290 seedlings per square foot
(3,230/m<sup>2</sup>) and
 1.8 seeds per square foot (20/m<sup>2</sup>) in May, in an area where about
2,630 seeds per square foot (29,200/m<sup>2</sup>)
were dispersed the previous fall. He speculated that the remaining seeds may
have been consumed or moved by birds, rodents, insects or whirlwinds.<br><br> 

 <b> 

<font face="Bell MT">
Seed banking:</font>     </b>    Yellow starthistle seed may remain viable in the soil for as
long as 10 years [<a href="#23">23</a>]. In heavily infested areas, the soil
 seed bank of yellow starthistle approaches 13% of annual seed production and consists
 primarily of plumeless seeds [<a href="#131">131</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>]. However, evidence for seed banking in yellow starthistle varies. Induced
 dormancy, seed type, depth of burial, site fire history, and other site conditions may be responsible for observed
differences in seed longevity.</p>



<p> On a bunchgrass site in California where yellow starthistle was present, no yellow starthistle
seeds
germinated from soil samples taken from 0 to 5 inches (0-13 cm) in October [<a href="#83">83</a>]. On a
bunchgrass range site in Washington state that was dominated by cheatgrass and yellow starthistle
(density of 16 to 21 adults per square foot (180-236/m<sup>2</sup>)), the number of yellow starthistle seeds found in soil
samples ranged from about 252 to 378 per square foot (2,800-4,200/m<sup>2</sup>)  [<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>]. On a California grassland site, seed density measurements in the soil
under yellow starthistle in the fall varied from year to year in untreated, control plots from
309 to 911 per square foot (3,438-10,127/m<sup>2</sup>) [<a href="#33">33</a>].</p>



<p>

After-ripening may prevent premature germination of yellow starthistle in dry habitats.

Many yellow starthistle seeds undergo secondary dormancy after exposure to high temperatures and low
moisture within 1 month of dispersal. These seeds
do not then germinate even under adequate light and moisture conditions [<a href="#30">30</a>].
Joley and others [<a href="#64">64</a>]
observed some evidence of after-ripening in both buried and dry-stored seed,
although results were inconsistent. Benefield and others [<a href="#11">11</a>] report 87.6 to 95.2%
viability and 84 to 87.6% germination rates at the dispersal stage at 2
California
sites. Thus, nearly all viable seed was able to germinate suggesting that yellow starthistle
at these locations may not have an innate or induced dormancy mechanism or an ecologically
significant after-ripening period.</p>



<p> Callihan and others [<a href="#23">23</a>] harvested plumed and plumeless yellow starthistle
seeds from a site in Idaho, and buried them in a sandy loam soil under
an annual grass community in southeast
Washington at depths of 1, 2, and 6 inches (2.5, 5, and 15 cm).
They detected no effects of burial depth on seed longevity, but did find that
viability decreased over time. Average longevity of plumed and plumeless seeds
was 10 and 6 years, respectively [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>]. Joley and others [<a href="#64">64</a>] buried plumed and
plumeless seeds at 2 inches (5 cm) for 72
months in the field in a sandy loam soil under a fallow orchard in north-east California. They found no effects of
seed type on germination. In another study, plumed seeds were
buried at several depths. After 13 months, germinable seeds increased with
depth, with 0.5, 3.9, 63.1, and 88.1% germinability at 0.2, 0.4, 1, and 2 inch (0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 cm)
depths, respectively. The loss of germinable seeds at shallow depths is
attributed primarily to germination, as indicated by split seedcoat.</p>



<p>One year of prescribed burning in Sonoma County, California, significantly reduced the seed bank
of
yellow starthistle (p&lt;0.05) and
3 consecutive years of burning, with no further seed recruitment, further depleted the
seed bank. Prior to burning, yellow starthistle seed density ranged from 309 to 911
seeds per square foot (3,438-10,127/m<sup>2</sup>). Seed density declined to 240 seeds per square foot (2,673/ m<sup>2</sup>)
after 1 year of burning,
38 seeds per square foot (421/m<sup>2</sup>) after 2 years of burning, and 5 to
11 seeds per square foot (52-127/m<sup>2</sup>) after 3 consecutive years of prescribed burning.
Corresponding decreases in seedling density the following springs were also
observed [<a href="#33">33</a>]. Similarly, Joley
and others [<a href="#64">64</a>] reported
over 83% depletion in the seed bank 1 year after preventing seed rain by mowing or clipping mature
plants, and after 3 years, only 3.9% of the
original seeds remained. Benefield and others [<a href="#11">11</a>] sowed 1,000 seeds 0.4 inch (1 cm) deep
in weed-free soil containers in California. They observed that after 1 year, germination and
seed recovery accounted for 69% and 57% of the original 1,000 seeds sown, for
plumed and plumeless seeds, respectively. Of the seeds recovered, over 80% were damaged or degraded by microbial or insect
activity. Unrecovered seed was speculated to have been lost to bird or rodent
predation. These results support the contention that, under California soil and climatic
conditions and average field
conditions where seeds are predominantly dispersed on the soil surface, yellow starthistle
seeds are
relatively short-lived. Microbial degradation and predation of yellow starthistle
seeds probably contribute to the rapid depletion of the soil seed bank [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].</p>



<p>Two to 3 years of effective control can dramatically reduce yellow starthistle
infestation and presence in the soil seed bank [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>]. Yet the survival of even a small percentage of seeds can potentially lead to reinfestation of
a site, even in the absence of off-site seed recruitment [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].</p>



<p>

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Germination:</b></font>    The mean number of viable and
germinable yellow starthistle seeds increases consistently with advancing phenological stage,
with some germinable seed developing as early as the late flowering stage [<a href="#80">80</a>] and late senescence stage (see Seasonal Development section below) [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Plumeless seeds mature earlier than plumed seeds, and germination of
plumed seeds is slightly greater than plumeless seeds [<a href="#35">35</a>]. Dimorphic seeds may be associated
with the success of yellow starthistle in exploiting variable soil moisture and temperature regimes in
semiarid
environments [<a href="#75">75</a>]. The different seed types tend to have different optimums with regard to temperature and
moisture in the lab [<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>]. In the field, the
germination rate of plumed seed is higher in late fall and winter, and that of
plumeless seed is higher in spring [<a href="#11">11</a>].&nbsp;</p>



<p> Over 90% of yellow
starthistle seeds are germinable 1 week after seed dispersal [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Yellow starthistle seeds germinate at both low and high
temperatures, allowing
for both fall and spring germination when moisture is adequate [<a href="#20">20</a>]. In the field, seeds usually germinate in late fall
or early winter, when sufficient soil moisture is present [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>], though
germination can continue throughout winter and into spring in northern
California [<a href="#63">63</a>]. Germination is closely correlated with winter and
spring rainfall events [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>], with germination
occurring throughout the rainy season, and emergence highest after
early-season rainfall events [<a href="#11">11</a>]. The extended period of germination increases the
difficulty of controlling yellow starthistle populations with late winter and early
spring treatments, as germination subsequent to control efforts can result in continued infestations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Joley and others [<a href="#63">63</a>] found that temperature, light, seed type, collection date, dormancy and storage,
and interactions of these factors all affected
yellow starthistle germination in the lab. Nearly 100% germination occurs when seeds are exposed to moisture, light
and constant temperatures of 50, 59, or 68 degrees Fahrenheit (10, 15, or 20
�C), or alternating temperatures of 59:41 or 68:50 degrees Fahrenheit (15:5 or 20:10
�C). Sheley and others [<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>] found that under similar conditions of
moisture and temperature and no light, germination occurred rapidly, with nearly all seed
germinating within 96 hours. Total germination is reduced at temperatures
above 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 �C) and below 43 degrees Fahrenheit (6 �C) [<a href="#122">122</a>].
Although seeds can germinate in the dark, germination is greatly
reduced in dark environments [<a href="#63">63</a>] and appears to
be stimulated by white light [<a href="#92">92</a>].&nbsp;</p>



<p> 

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Seedling establishment/growth:</b> </font>Yellow starthistle
seedlings first allocate resources to root extension and then to leaf expansion.
Yellow starthistle
root growth is vigorous and can extend
deeper than 3.3 feet (1 m) during early seedling establishment [<a href="#116">116</a>].&nbsp;</p>



<p> In exposed areas, high germination can result in extremely
dense seedling populations [<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>]. Near Walla Walla, Washington, yellow starthistle
seedling
populations
reached winter (mid-January) densities approaching 2,500 plants per square foot
(26,875 per m<sup>2</sup>). Subsequent frost heaving reduced seedling populations by about 40%,
and yellow starthistle density was further reduced by
75% during the juvenile phase (late may to mid-June) [<a href="#131">131</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>]. Similarly, Roche [<a href="#117">117</a>] observed a 58% reduction in yellow starthistle
density from April to
July. Adult density of yellow starthistle at a particular site can be
closely associated with soil depth and, thus, late season water storage
capacity. Roche and others [<a href="#116">116</a>] observed a significant relationship (P<u>&lt;</u> 0.001) between the number of
yellow starthistle plants per unit
area and total soil moisture from 19 May to 29 August in southeastern
Washington.</p>

Asexual regeneration:</b></font>  There is no evidence for asexual regeneration in
yellow starthistle.<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SITE CHARACTERISTICS">
SITE CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Yellow starthistle is most often found on

roadsides and abandoned fields and pastures, waste places, recreational
areas and disturbed grassland or woodland [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#158">158</a>]. It is a problem primarily
in moderately warm, exposed areas on relatively dry, fertile soils [<a href="#32">32</a>].</p>



<p>

Yellow starthistle is best adapted to open grasslands with average annual
precipitation between 10 and 60 inches (250-1500 mm). It is generally
associated with deep, well-drained soils. Although populations can occur at
elevations from sea level to as high as 8,000 feet (2,400 m), most large infestations are found
below 5,000 feet (1,500 m) [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. The optimum environmental conditions for
yellow starthistle appear
to be in northern California's Mediterranean-type climate (cool, wet winter and hot, dry
summer), which enable yellow starthistle to grow during winter, bolt in spring, and escape summer
drought [<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>]. Yellow starthistle is uncommon in deserts and moist coastal
sites [<a href="#32">32</a>].</p>



<p> Yellow starthistle is capable of establishment and
at least
short-term persistence in any of the major plant communities in Washington below subalpine, but
demonstrates its maximum potential in the bluebunch wheatgrass (<i>Pseudoroegneria
spicata</i>)-Idaho fescue (<i>Festuca idahoensis</i>) zone
of the steppe region of the Columbia Basin Province. In this community, on the
southern slopes of the foothills of the Blue Mountains, it appears to reach its
northern limits. Occasional small populations are found farther north, but the
farther north the more they are restricted to steep south-facing slopes [<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>]. Here it is most competitive on deep silt loam soils on south slopes of
the higher natural grassland types. In other areas, compensating factors for moisture or
heat were found, or yellow starthistle was not competitive, producing only
a few heads on a dwarfed plant [<a href="#119">119</a>]. Although yellow starthistle more readily invades
and dominates south slopes and disturbed sites in southwestern Oregon, it is
not restricted to them. In the absence of competitive perennial vegetation, yellow starthistle
often forms dense stands on valley floors and invades openings in the conifer
transition zone above oak woodlands [<a href="#118">118</a>]. In north-central Idaho, yellow starthistle infestations thrive in disturbed
areas with high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils that receive 10-30
inches (254-762 mm) of precipitation per year [<a href="#20">20</a>].</p>



<p>On annual rangelands where yellow starthistle occurs with cheatgrass, population dominance
oscillates between yellow starthistle and cheatgrass [<a href="#130">130</a>]. Yellow starthistle
invades and dominates annual
grasslands by using the deep soil moisture that remains after shallow-rooted
annual grasses die in early summer [<a href="#118">118</a>]. Areas with deep soil and years with moderate to heavy spring
rainfall give yellow starthistle the greatest advantage [<a href="#74">74</a>]. In dry spring conditions (and shallow soils), early maturing annual
grasses have the advantage [<a href="#130">130</a>], although yellow starthistle
can also survive at
extremely low soil water potential (&lt; -6.0 MPa) as compared to annual grasses
(&gt;-2.1 MPa) [<a href="#35">35</a>]. Growth rates of cheatgrass and yellow starthistle
appear to
depend primarily on plant density, soil depth, and available soil moisture [<a href="#132">132</a>]. Sheley and Larson
[<a href="#130">130</a>] suggest that
intraspecific competition is more important for both yellow starthistle and cheatgrass than is
interspecific competition, citing evidence of
resource partitioning via root depth, allowing for greater niche occupation on a
site.</p>



<p>Yellow starthistle seedlings are more likely to dominate in deep silt loam and loam soils
with few coarse fragments [<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>], but they can
also establish on shallow, rocky soils [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. In
deep soils, yellow starthistle can reduce soil moisture reserves to depths greater than 6
feet (~2 m),
and in 3 feet (~1 m) deep foothill soils it can extract soil moisture from fissures in
bedrock [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. A Washington study suggested a
relationship between yellow starthistle cover and soil depth or total moisture-holding capacity
of the soil on south facing aspects. Here, yellow starthistle may be dependent on the ability of the soil to retain
sufficient moisture for the maturation of the plant during
the summer drought period [<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>]. Studies in southeastern Washington natural grasslands indicated that
the dual
requirements of soil moisture for reproduction during
the summer drought period, and light for winter growth may be critical limiting factors for
yellow starthistle [<a href="#116">116</a>].</p>



<p>At its northern limit in Washington state (48� 45' north latitude), yellow
starthistle is restricted to south-facing slopes
[<a href="#116">116</a>]. Yellow starthistle's conspicuous absence on north aspects in this area appears to
be related to heat and light [<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>]. This may explain why
it has not
persisted in British Columbia [<a href="#115">115</a>], and why it has gradually disappeared in
northern areas of Romania (46� 47' north latitude) (Prodan (1930) as cited by [<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>]). A critical factor at the northern limits
of yellow starthistle appears to be radiation during the winter [<a href="#116">116</a>]. Yellow starthistle needs sunlight
at the soil surface from fall through spring to grow roots that can tap water
stored deep in the soil during summer drought [<a href="#118">118</a>]. Yellow starthistle
seedlings
can survive extended frost periods, but mature plants rarely survive the
winter in cold climates. Cold tolerance appears to be lost during the
transition from vegetative to reproductive phases [<a href="#30">30</a>].</p>



<p>When yellow starthistle seed from 34 distinct stands in California, Idaho, Oregon and
Washington was grown in a uniform nursery at Pullman, Washington, there was wide biotypic
variation for the following variables: rosette area, decurrent leaf width,
plant height, stature, number of branches, shape and form, growth stage on four
dates, number of
buds produced on 2 dates, flowering rate, date of first flower and first seed,
average number of flowers, and seed production rate. None of the variables
correlated with precipitation, elevation, or latitude of the population source
[<a href="#113">113</a>].

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SUCCESSIONAL STATUS">
SUCCESSIONAL STATUS:</a>

<br />

Yellow starthistle does not survive well in shaded areas, and is less competitive in areas
dominated by shrubs, trees, tall perennial forbs and grasses, or late-season
annuals. Yellow starthistle infestations are nearly always restricted to disturbed sites or open
grasslands dominated by annuals. In areas dominated by yellow starthistle, the level of competition for light can be intense, resulting in a low rate of seedling
survival through self-thinning [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>]. The
rosette growth form is particularly vulnerable to shading by overtopping
vegetation (Regehr and Bazzaz 1976, as cited by [<a href="#116">116</a>]). Yellow starthistle
is
dependent on light on the soil surface for winter rosette and taproot
development [<a href="#117">117</a>].</p>



<p>In an experiment in southeastern Washington, shade was indicated as a major stress factor for yellow starthistle in unclipped perennial grass stands. Yellow starthistle
did not invade
areas of undisturbed perennial grasses; and clipped bunchgrasses
were more susceptible to yellow starthistle invasion than were clipped sod forming grasses.
Yellow starthistle seedlings in plots shaded by
grass litter and standing grass plants appeared weak and spindly with erect yellowish-green leaves compared to vigorous blue-green leaves
of prostrate rosettes grown in grass-free control plots. Reduced light levels also reduced root growth and flower
production. Plants grown under 6% full sunlight failed to flower;
and the average number of flowers increased with increasing light [<a href="#116">116</a>].</p>



<p> Because yellow starthistle plants can germinate over an extended time
period, the
canopy of an infestation may be composed of yellow starthistle plants in several stages of development. In dense
stands of yellow starthistle, the population consists of both large canopied, deep-rooted plants receiving
full sunlight, and an understory of smaller, shallow-rooted, shaded plants. In
this way yellow starthistle maximizes niche occupation on a site [<a href="#30">30</a>], and can
halt native plant succession by not allowing germination and establishment of
natives.</p>



<p>In some areas, control of one weed may lead to increase of another. Mosley and others
[<a href="#90">90</a>] suggest that cheatgrass control may lead to replacement with yellow starthistle.

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT">
SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Yellow starthistle's reproductive phenology is usually later than that of its associated
vegetation, flowering after both native bunchgrasses and exotic annuals have become
dormant [<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>]. Cohorts emerging between October
and July require about 1,240 degree days for 50% of the plants to reach bud stage and an
additional 500 and 900 degree days to anthesis and seed dispersal,
respectively [<a href="#123">123</a>].</p>



<p>Although yellow starthistle germination occurs throughout the rainy season
(October to June in California), emergence is highest after fall and early
winter rainfall events [<a href="#79">79</a>]. Yellow starthistle plants are insensitive to photoperiod and lack a vernalization
requirement, allowing late germinating plants to
flower and set seed within 1 year, provided adequate moisture is available [<a href="#122">122</a>].
Yellow starthistle allocates resources first to root extension, then to leaf expansion, and finally to stem development and
flower production [<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>]. A yellow starthistle seed germinating in fall
will overwinter as a basal rosette, and may have a root penetrating to 2 feet by spring [<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>]. Rapid, deep root
growth in yellow starthistle extends the period of resource availability into late
summer, long after seasonal rainfall has ended and shallow-rooted annual grasses
have senesced. By extending the period of resource availability, competition is
reduced at the reproductive stage. Rosettes develop slowly in the early spring
[<a href="#30">30</a>]. In most years,
60 to 75% of yellow starthistle rosettes die by July either from moisture stress or
self-thinning [<a href="#133">133</a>]. Competition for moisture can also delay
development [<a href="#123">123</a>].&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bolting typically occurs from late spring to early summer, coinciding with increased light availability at the time when neighboring annual
species senesce and desiccate. Flowerheads are produced from
early summer to late summer or fall [<a href="#32">32</a>]. Flowering continues until newly developing buds are killed by frost
[<a href="#122">122</a>].&nbsp;Benefield and others [<a href="#11">11</a>] identified 10 phenologically distinct seedhead
developmental stages in yellow starthistle, ranging from late bud stage to seed dispersal.&nbsp;On
average, seedheads required about 21 days to progress from the prebloom stage to
petal abscission.</p>

<p>Plumed seeds are usually dispersed soon after flowers senesce and
drop their petals. Plumeless seeds are usually retained in the seedhead until the spiny bracts fall
off (about a
month), but can be retained well into winter [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>]. In early fall, yellow starthistle plants
lose their leaves and dry to a silvery-gray skeleton with cottony-white
terminal seedheads [<a href="#133">133</a>]. Senesced stems of yellow starthistle degrade slowly and may
remain erect for a year [<a href="#30">30</a>]. With the arrival of fall rains, seeds on or in the soil
begin to germinate, and the cycle is repeated [<a href="#133">133</a>]. Plants that

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font>  Yellow starthistle is a winter annual that
produces abundant seed crops. It can colonize a site after fire either
from undamaged seed in the soil seed bank on site, or from seed brought to the
site from an off-site source. Fire creates conditions that are
favorable to the establishment of yellow starthistle (i.e. open canopy, reduced competition, areas of bare soil), so if
yellow starthistle seeds are present and competition is scarce or weak, yellow starthistle
will be favored in
the postfire community.
<br><br>

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font>  Yellow starthistle occurs primarily in annual
grasslands and oak woodlands in California and perennial grasslands in the
Pacific Northwest, where historic fire regimes have been dramatically altered. Yellow starthistle
did not occur in these communities at the time in which historic fire
regimes were functioning, but has established since fire exclusion began. Hastings
and DiTomaso [<a href="#53">53</a>] suggest that invasion of California grasslands by yellow starthistle
may be
due, in part, to fire suppression and reductions in fire frequency in these
ecosystems. This is supported by results from prescribed fire programs in these
areas that have resulted in large reductions of yellow starthistle cover, and increased native
plant diversity (see<a href="fire_case_studies.html"> &quot;FIRE CASE
STUDIES&quot;</a> section of this report) [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>]. Additionally, dense infestations of yellow starthistle
may change the fire regime
by changing the fuel characteristics at a given site. In
the Sugarloaf Ridge study, on a site with dense yellow starthistle, there was
insufficient fine fuel to carry fire when yellow starthistle was still green
[<a href="#53">53</a>]. Later
in the season, dried skeletons of yellow starthistle can provide fuel for late
summer wildfires [<a href="#100">100</a>].

IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Fire usually kills yellow starthistle plants [<a href="#33">33</a>], although some plants may resprout after low severity burning [<a href="#85">85</a>].
Fires are usually not severe enough to kill yellow starthistle seed. It has been suggested that heat from
prescribed fires actually stimulates germination of yellow starthistle seed in the soil
[<a href="#53">53</a>].<br>

<br />
<span class="subframeName">
<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT">
DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Complete
destruction of yellow starthistle plants by fire is not necessary to kill the
plants, although sufficient heat
is required to scorch the foliage and stem-girdle and kill the plants [<a href="#53">53</a>].
<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE">
PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Fire seems to stimulate germination of yellow starthistle seed in the soil seed bank, while
also reducing competition in the plant community, reducing the thatch layer,
exposing the soil, and recycling
nutrients from the burned vegetation. Therefore, yellow starthistle plants that germinate
following fire may grow larger and have more flowerheads the following season [<a href="#53">53</a>]. This might explain why Sheley and others
[<a href="#133">133</a>]
suggest that in most cases (although
they cite no examples), burning increases plant size and seed production in yellow starthistle
by
releasing nutrients tied up in plant material.<p><span class="subframeName"><a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE">DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Season and frequency of burning are important in determining yellow starthistle's response to fire. Three
consecutive years of burning at early flowering stage (late June to early July
in northern California) controlled yellow starthistle and
depleted the yellow starthistle soil seed bank. Yellow starthistle plants
may remain green for up to 4 days following burning, possibly allowing seed to
mature if burning is conducted too late in the flowering stage [<a href="#53">53</a>]. Prescribed fires conducted early in the spring may not be hot
enough to kill yellow starthistle and may damage desirable plants.</p>

FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

<b>

<font face="Bell MT">
Fire as a control agent:</font>      </b>     The effectiveness of fire in killing
invasive plants or reducing their
population growth depends on fire severity, time of burning, and
prior and subsequent weather conditions [<a href="#29">29</a>], as well as the species present in the preburn community and
represented in the soil seed bank.
Sheley and others [<a href="#133">133</a>] state that burning is
an ineffective method for controlling yellow starthistle; however, consecutive, annual prescribed fires
have resulted in large reductions of yellow starthistle cover and seeds in the soil seed bank
on some California and Oregon grassland sites [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>]. Prescribed burning may also be a useful
component in an integrated management approach [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>].</p>
<p>DiTomaso [<a href="#35">35</a>] suggests that fire is an important component of most
grassland ecosystems and that it can be used to control yellow starthistle as well as some of
the invasive annual grasses with which yellow starthistle is often associated. Successful control
requires timing the burn to the early flowering stage of yellow starthistle, and burning with
sufficient heat to scorch the foliage and stem-girdle the plants. This heat may also
stimulate seed germination, thereby facilitating seed bank depletion with
repeated burning. The 1st year after burning, yellow starthistle plants emerge
from seed stored in the soil. It is critical to remove these plants before they
produce seed, as they are likely to be highly productive due to
decreased competition [<a href="#53">53</a>]. Three consecutive years of
burning in early July at Sugarloaf Ridge State Park in northern California
reduced yellow starthistle cover by 90%, reduced yellow starthistle seeds in the soil
seed bank by 99%, and
increased total plant diversity and species richness [<a href="#33">33</a>] (See <a href="fire_case_studies.html">FIRE
CASE STUDIES</a> in this
report).</p>
<p>A similar prescription achieved somewhat different results when applied on a
grassland site in the Lassen foothills of
northern California [<a href="#58">58</a>]. For more information on the Lassen
foothills project, see the <a href="https://tnc-ecomanagement.org/Fire/SiteInformation/">Fire Management Network</a>
on the The Nature Conservancy website. In this area, yellow starthistle and medusahead (<i>Taeniatherum
caput-medusae)</i> are both target species, and burns are
timed in relation to the phenology of the dominant invasive species of
individual burn units. The timing of burning for medusahead control (when it is cured, and just before seed
shatter) tends to coincide with the early flowering stage in yellow starthistle
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>]. Grazing is deferred for 3 months prior to burning to allow a
build-up of fuels. Slow-spreading backfires are used and are intended to be
severe enough to kill medusahead seed. Because medusahead seed is not long-lived, eradicating
it requires as little as 1 year
of burning, whereas yellow starthistle requires 3 years of burning and follow-up monitoring, since seeds
can remain viable for several years. Two consecutive years of burning were effective in reducing
cover of invasives without reducing overall plant diversity. However, plant
diversity decreased after the 3rd year of burning, causing concern for several
sensitive plant species in the area. The observed differences between this and
the Sugarloaf Ridge site may be attributable to differences in soil type and
climate; the Lassen site is a drier site [<a href="#58">58</a>].</p>
<p> Unlike mowed yellow starthistle plants, burned yellow starthistle plants do not usually resprout
[<a href="#14">14</a>]. Minimal resprouting of
scorched plants was observed following an early-spring burn where much of the vegetation was only lightly
to moderately burned [<a href="#85">85</a>]. However, seeds on the soil surface
are not typically damaged and may actually be stimulated to germinate following grassland fires,
since the soil surface is
only transiently heated to about 392 degrees Fahrenheit (200
�C) [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>]. Because a single burn is likely to increase yellow starthistle plant size and seed production the
following year, follow-up treatments (e.g. monitoring, repeated burning, hand-pulling)
are critical to yellow starthistle control [<a href="#35">35</a>]. After several years of decreasing
follow-up
treatments, managers are able to maintain a 50-acre site free of yellow starthistle with
1 day's effort
annually, in a Mediterranean annual grassland in southern Oregon [<a href="#14">14</a>].</p>
<p>One concern with consecutive annual burning is that there be sufficient fuels for prescribed burning to be effective [<a href="#34">34</a>]. This can be a
problem where
yellow starthistle populations are very dense and/or fuels are depleted with each successive
burn. Prescribed fire will carry in starthistle of
moderate density, but fire will not carry in very dense patches, since yellow starthistle is green at the optimal time of burning. To address this
concern at Pinnacles National Monument in the Gabilan Mountains of the Central
Coast Range in California, prescribed burning was coupled with seeding a sterile, annual wheat
� wheatgrass
hybrid in the fall to provide fuel for subsequent burns. The 1st year of
burning resulted in a 98% reduction in yellow starthistle plants. Further
results are forthcoming
[<a href="#85">85</a>]. In areas where consecutive annual burning may be
difficult or have negative impacts (e.g. areas with insufficient fuels, erosion
concerns, or populations of sensitive species), prescribed burning may be more
appropriate as part of an integrated management approach. For example, DiTomaso
and others [<a href="#34">34</a>] suggest spraying with clopyralid the 1st year, which would suppress legumes and stimulate
grasses; and burning the 2nd year,
when fuel loads would be higher and the previously suppressed legume populations may be stimulated by fire.</p>
<p>The time of burning for effective control of yellow starthistle in California
is after annual grasses have cured and before
yellow starthistle flowers. There may be air quality issues and a high
potential for fire to escape at this time of year. Information about prescribed
fire projects should be made available to local residents prior to any burning.
Escape problems can be minimized by involving the local fire departments and the
California Department of Forestry [<a href="#34">34</a>]. Burning in the fall or spring to reduce risk of fire
escape may not as effectively control and may actually benefit yellow starthistle
[<a href="#118">118</a>]. However, Martin and Martin [<a href="#85">85</a>] burned earlier than is typically recommended,
with 98% reduction of yellow starthistle. It is also
possible to reduce risks by burning earlier in the season using a &quot;brown and
burn&quot; technique, in which a nonselective herbicide such as glyphosate is applied,
and the vegetation is allowed to cure before burning. The fire is contained more
easily because surrounding vegetation is still green. The
potential of fall burning to reduce weed competition for fall seedings is under
investigation [<a href="#118">118</a>]. Yellow starthistle seedlings have also been controlled
using winter or early spring flaming techniques that employ a gasoline and
kerosene mixture to ignite the wet biomass and keep it burning long enough to
blacken the plants [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>]. This approach reduces risk of escaped fire and avoids major air quality issues,
but it is somewhat non-selective and provides inconsistent control of yellow starthistle.
It works well when
followed by spring drought, but it can be a complete failure when followed
by a wet spring,
especially if competing species are suppressed [<a href="#34">34</a>].</p>
<p>Burning can also affect other control methods. Fire can have a serious impact on small animals and insects
such as biocontrol agents and their larvae [<a href="#34">34</a>]. Burning to remove heavy
annual plant debris improves herbicide efficacy by increasing contact with the
target plants. Prescribed fire may also be used to prepare a
seedbed for competitive perennials and seed broadcast in the ash [<a href="#118">118</a>]. In some cases, burning can lead to
rapid invasion by other undesirable species from wind dispersed seeds and seeds in the
soil seed bank [<a href="#34">34</a>].</p>

<font face="Bell MT">
Postfire colonization potential:</font>      </b>     The reduction in competition and
litter, exposure of the soil surface to light, release of nutrients, and stimulation of germination in yellow starthistle seed associated with either wild or
prescribed fire all provide ideal conditions for postfire colonization by yellow starthistle. Asher and others
[<a href="#5">5</a>] cite a case in the Ishi Wilderness
Area of northern California
in which yellow starthistle provides an example
of &quot;severe postfire weed spread and impacts&quot;. No more information was
given.</p>



<p>

General precautions should be followed
to prevent yellow starthistle establishment after fire. The USDA Forest Service's &quot;Guide to
noxious weed prevention practices&quot; [<a href="#154">154</a>]
provides several fire management considerations for weed prevention in general
that can be applied to yellow starthistle. Wildfire managers might consider including
weed prevention education and providing weed identification aids during fire
training; avoiding known weed infestations when locating firelines, monitoring
camps, staging areas, and helibases, to be sure they are kept weed free;
taking care that equipment is weed free; incorporating cost of weed prevention
and management into fire
rehabilitation plans; and acquiring restoration funding. Careful postfire vigilance
to identify and record the establishment of new populations is critical. About 1 month after
fire, survey for signs of new or resprouting weeds. Repeated surveys will be
needed, with the frequency and intensity guided by local conditions [<a href="#5">5</a>].</p>



<p>Potential weed
problems must be addressed during prefire planning of prescribed burns, and following both
wild and prescribed fires. When planning a prescribed burn, preinventory the project area and evaluate
cover and phenology of any yellow starthistle present on or adjacent to the site
and evaluate the
potential for increased yellow starthistle populations in the area [<a href="#5">5</a>]. Avoid ignition and burning in areas at high risk for yellow starthistle
establishment or spread, and/or plan for follow-up treatments in succeeding
years. Avoid creating soil conditions that promote weed
germination and establishment. Discuss weed status and risks in burn
rehabilitation plans [<a href="#154">154</a>].</p>
To prevent infestation, re-establish vegetation on bare ground as soon after
fire as possible, using either natural recovery or artificial techniques as
appropriate to site conditions and objectives. When reseeding after wildfires
and prescribed burns, use only certified weed-free seed. Monitor the burn site
and associated disturbed areas after the fire and the following spring for
emergence of yellow starthistle, and treat to eradicate any emergent yellow starthistle
plants. Regulate human, pack animal, and livestock entry into burned
areas at risk for weed invasion until desirable site vegetation has recovered
sufficiently to resist weed invasion. Additional guidelines and specific
recommendations and requirements are available [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#154">154</a>].

The grassland component of the park contains components of both native perennial
vegetation, dominated by purple needlegrass (<i>Nassella pulchra</i>), blue wild
rye (<i>Elymus glaucus</i>), and beardless wildrye (<i>Leymus triticoides</i>), and
a variety of annual European grasses dominated by ripgut brome (<i>Bromus
diandrus</i>), soft chess (<i>B. hordeaceus</i>), silver
European hairgrass (<i>Aira caryophyllea</i>), wild oats (<i>Avena fatua</i>),
and little quakinggrass (<i>Briza minor</i>). Scattered populations of the rare
California endemic Sonoma ceanothus (<i>Ceanothus sonomensis</i>) are of
special concern.<p>The vegetation in the study sites was predominantly yellow starthistle and
annual grasses, with a &quot;substantial&quot; component of native perennial
herbs and grasses.

Prescribed burns were carefully timed to prevent seed production in yellow
starthistle, while allowing for seed dispersal and senescence of
associated vegetation, thus stacking the seed bank in favor of desirable species
and providing a dry fuel source. Burns were timed to the early flowering stage
or late floral bud stage of yellow starthistle, when less than 10% of flower
buds were opened 
(see &quot;<a href="botanical_and_ecological_characteristics.html#Seasonal Development">Seasonal Development</a>&quot;, in the
&quot;BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS&quot; section).

<br />

Sugarloaf Ridge State Park is in the northern Coast Range of California near
Sonoma. It is a dry, low-elevation woodland with large expanses of open
grassland. Nearly all open grassland areas have been severely infested with yellow
starthistle since 1989.

Burns were conducted on 2 open grassland sites within the study area at 2 different time periods. Site A
(35 acres (14 ha) of heavily infested grassland) was burned
in 1993, 1994, and 1995; and Site B (175 acre (70 ha) grassland) was similarly burned in
1995, 1996, and 1997.

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">

FIRE DESCRIPTION:</a>
</span>
<br />

Burns were conducted annually over a 3-year period at each site. All burns were conducted in
early July except for the 1997 burn, which was conducted in late June due to
early development of yellow starthistle. Burns were initiated with a drip torch and a steady
backing fire was sustained in most locations. In all locations, the fire carried
well with an average 4-foot (1.2 m) flame length. Average maximum temperature at the
soil surface, measured with
temperature pellets, was about 426 degrees Fahrenheit (219 �C) in the 1st year
burn area, 448 degrees Fahrenheit (231 �C) in previously burned areas, and
ranged from 300 to 576 degrees Fahrenheit (149-302 �C), for all burns in all
years. Burns were conducted at ambient temperatures between 70 and 81 degrees
Fahrenheit (21- 27 �C), relative humidity between 35 and 52% and light winds ranging between
1.8 and 4.8 miles/hour (3-8 km/hour). Fires burned unevenly resulting in a
patchwork of high to low severity areas on a scale of a few meters in size.</p>
<p> In all years and over most of the area, the dried vegetation carried the fire well,
with the exception of a severely eroded gully, where there was insufficient
grass and fine fuel to carry fire the 2nd year of burning and yellow starthistle
cover approached 100%. Additionally, in 3rd year burns, both flame-length and
rate of spread were reduced due to reduction of fine fuel accumulations by
previous fires.

Fire caused nearly complete mortality of yellow starthistle, although plants
remained green and fleshy for up to 4 days following scorching.</p>
<p>After a single year of burning, percent cover of yellow starthistle measured the
following spring showed a significant decrease (p&lt;0.05), compared to both the previous year and
to the unburned control in the same year. However, the percent cover of yellow starthistle
that
summer was not different than percent cover in the unburned control or in the same site
the prior year. This is because while stem density decreased, the individual
plants were bigger and produced more seedheads per plant in the
burn sites, compared to unburned control sites. Therefore, a significant
(p&lt;0.05) reduction in
summer cover of yellow starthistle was not observed until after a 2nd year of
burning. Yellow starthistle cover was further reduced after a 3rd
year of burning, but differences were not
significant compared to 2nd year data.</p>
<p> The reduction in yellow starthistle vegetative cover following 3
consecutive years of burning corresponded to a depletion of yellow starthistle
seeds in the soil seed bank. After 3 consecutive annual burns, the soil seed banks at sites A and B were reduced by 99.5 and
96.3%, respectively, compared to the unburned control in the same year. Some
results from this study are given below:</p>

Fire effects on associated plant species were also documented. After the 1st year of burning, some increases in the abundance and diversity of native
plant species on burned sites were documented, while exotic species increased on
unburned control plots. Spring cover of native
perennial grasses, primarily purple needlegrass, initially decreased following the 1st burn
on site B (possibly due to decrease in the size
of the clumps rather than to clump mortality), but increased significantly after
3 consecutive years of burning. Burning did not have a significant effect on the
percent cover of introduced
annual grasses or total forbs; however, there was a change in the proportion of
native and introduced forbs. Over all sites, native forb cover increased from
17% to 67% of total forb cover after 3 years of burning. Results also indicate
an increase in species richness and diversity on burned sites compared to
unburned controls. Increases in the abundance and diversity of native plant
species are possibly attributable to reduced competition from yellow starthistle,
increased light, and higher soil temperatures in the spring. Fires killed most
of the mature Sonoma ceanothus plants, and seemed to stimulate germination of
seeds, although observations were not quantified.



<p><span class="subframeName"><a name="FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS">FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS:</a>

<br />

Proper timing is critical to the successful use of prescribed burning for yellow starthistle
suppression. In northern California grasslands, a burn window opens before yellow starthistle
produces seed and after desirable
grasses and broadleaf species have completed their reproductive cycle and cured;
thus providing dry fuel for the fire. Burning at this time should lead to depletion of the
yellow starthistle seed bank and to an increase in seed bank, establishment, and competitive ability
of desirable species.</p>



<p>Timing of the burn is more important than fire intensity, since complete
destruction of yellow starthistle plants by fire is not necessary, and plants
may remain green for up to 4 days following burning. This could allow seed to
mature if burning was conducted too late in the flowering stage. Sufficient heat
is required to scorch the foliage and stem-girdle the plants. This heat may also
stimulate seed germination, thereby facilitating seed bank depletion with
subsequent burning.</p>



<p>With consecutive annual burns, there is also some concern whether sufficient
fuel will be present for burning in latter years. For example, in a severely
eroded gully within the burn area at Sugarloaf Ridge, there was insufficient
grass and fine fuel to carry fire the 2nd year, and yellow starthistle cover
approached 100%. At this site, managers broadcast sowed seeds of 2 non-invasive,
non-native annual grasses in early December to provide fuels for the following
year's burn.

Cattle, sheep and goats will graze on yellow starthistle in early spring, and up to the bolting
stage. These ruminants will not graze yellow starthistle plants after the spines emerge
[<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#149">149</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>]. Yellow starthistle
provides forage for ruminants in late
spring and early summer when other green
forage is generally unavailable [<a href="#150">150</a>]. Yellow starthistle is toxic to horses, causing a
neurological disease called equine nigropallidal encephalomalacia, or
&quot;chewing disease&quot; with prolonged ingestion. Poisoning is most likely when yellow starthistle is the only feed available (e.g. on poor condition range) or when
yellow starthistle is a substantial contaminant of dried hay. In some cases, horses acquire a taste for
yellow starthistle and seek it out even when other forage is available [<a href="#98">98</a>]. Other animals (e.g. mules and burros) are not susceptible to the toxic
effects [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].<p>

Yellow starthistle foliage may be eaten by grasshoppers, and yellow starthistle seeds are consumed by several
species of birds including ring-necked pheasants, California quail, house finches, and
American goldfinches [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>].</p>

It has been suggested that the nutritional value of yellow starthistle is low,
and that cattle subsisting on the plant will lose weight (Callihan and others
1982, as cited by [<a href="#82">82</a>]). The nutritional component of yellow starthistle leaves is highly digestible by
ruminants during the growing season [<a href="#22">22</a>], but its nutrient value declines as the plants
mature [<a href="#82">82</a>]. Measures of protein and acid
detergent fiber (ADF) content by Thomsen and others [<a href="#148">148</a>] indicate that yellow starthistle
has
acceptable nutritional value as a component of a ruminants diet. In the rosette stage protein
content ranged between 10 and 13% and acid detergent fiber (ADF) between 26 and
28%. In the
bolting to early bud stage, protein content was 11 to 13% and ADF was 28 to 32%. An analysis of the nutritional status of cattle manure in the fall
indicated that yellow starthistle infested pastures contain considerably less
crude protein and total digestible nutrients compared to uninfested pastures (Barry
1995, as cited by [<a href="#30">30</a>]).

OTHER USES:</a>
</span>
<br />

Yellow starthistle is regarded as an important honey source plant in California and other
western states [<a href="#30">30</a>]. Yellow starthistle is used in Turkish folk medicine for the
treatment of ulcers. In a laboratory study, aqueous extracts of fresh or dried
flowers of yellow starthistle given orally showed significant (p&lt;0.01) antiulcerogenic
activity in rats [<a href="#163">163</a>].

<br><br>



<span class="subframeName">
<a name="IMPACTS AND CONTROL">
IMPACTS AND CONTROL:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Impacts:</b></font> Infestations of yellow starthistle can displace
native plants, reduce native wildlife habitat
and forage, decrease native plant and animal diversity, limit access to recreational
areas, and reduce land value [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>]. Dense
infestations of yellow starthistle can fragment sensitive plant and animal
habitat [<a href="#30">30</a>]. Several rare and sensitive plant
species such as agate desertparsley (<i>Lomatium cookii</i>) on the Agate Desert Preserve in
southwestern Oregon,
and California
bearpoppy (<i>Arctomecon californica</i>) on the Ash Meadow Preserve in Nevada,
along with several plant species on the Garden Creek Ranch preserve in Idaho are
thought to be threatened by yellow starthistle [<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>]. Large populations of yellow
starthistle deplete soil moisture reserves and alter the water cycle in annual
grassland and foothill woodland ecosystems in California, by using more water to
a greater soil depth than would native or desirable vegetation [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. Because dense infestations of yellow starthistle
use deep soil moisture reserves earlier
than associated natives such as blue oak (<i>Quercus douglasii</i>) or purple
needlegrass (<i>Nasella pulchra</i>), native species can experience
drought conditions even in years with normal rainfall [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. It has been suggested that this can cause large annual economic losses in water conservation costs
in California [<a href="#37">37</a>]. Other economic losses may occur from interference
with livestock grazing and forage harvesting procedures, and lower yield and
forage quality of rangelands [<a href="#30">30</a>]. Yellow starthistle is toxic to horses, causing a
neurological disease called equine nigropallidal encephalomalacia, or
&quot;chewing disease&quot; which is characterized by an acute inability to eat
or drink, eventually causing death by starvation or dehydration [<a href="#98">98</a>].



</p>



<p>   Over the past 40 years,
yellow starthistle has spread exponentially to infest rangelands, native grasslands, orchards,
vineyards, pastures, roadsides, and waste places [<a href="#35">35</a>]. Estimates reached
over 19 million infested acres (7.6 million ha) in the U.S. and Canada in the year 2000 [<a href="#38">38</a>]. In California, yellow starthistle has
expanded its range from less than 1 million acres (0.4 million ha) in 1958 to roughly 10 million
acres (4 million ha) in the early 1990s and is now a severe problem,
infesting an estimated 17 million acres (6.8 million ha) in 2000 [<a href="#108">108</a>].<br><br>

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Control:</b></font>  Control of yellow starthistle requires
preventing new seed recruitment, depleting the yellow starthistle soil seed bank, and establishing
desirable vegetation to thereby avoid reinfestation or replacement with other
invasive species. The choice of control techniques depends on management
objectives, site conditions, and available resources. Timing of treatments is a
critical element for yellow starthistle control. To prevent new seed recruitment, it is most
practical to gauge timing of defoliation control practices (e.g. tillage, mowing, prescribed
burning) around yellow starthistle flower initiation, before approximately 2% of the total
spiny heads have initiated flowering [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>]. If
control practices are delayed too long after flower initiation, viable seed may
be produced and dispersed [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Except for removal of entire scattered plants, control methods are not effective
if implemented when yellow starthistle is
in full flower [<a href="#118">118</a>]. Control treatments applied in late winter or early
spring may also be less effective for long-term control since yellow starthistle
achenes in the seed bank may germinate and produce seed in the same season [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>]. This may be
curtailed by planting and establishing perennial species that remove soil
moisture from yellow starthistle's rooting zone prior to its maturity [<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>].



</p>



<p>A brief discussion of each of the methods used for control of yellow starthistle
follows.
Several abstracts and articles from the proceedings of the First International
Knapweed Symposium are cited in this section. These proceedings are available
online (<a href="https://www.sidney.ars.usda.gov/knapweed/">2001 Knapweed Symposium</a>). Additionally,
detailed discussions and tables displaying management
options and their relative advantages, risks, timing, and
fit into a strategic management plan for yellow starthistle can be seen online at the University of California Weed Research and Information Center (<a href="https://wric.ucdavis.edu/yst/">WRIC</a>)
[<a href="#35">35</a>].



</p>




<font face="Bell MT">
Prevention:</font>  




<b>




  </b> The most cost effective method of yellow starthistle management
is to prevent its
establishment by maintaining a healthy community of native or otherwise
desirable plants, taking care not to import yellow starthistle seed, carefully monitoring the land
(especially roadsides and disturbed places) and eradicating new populations
upon detection [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#135">135</a>,<a href="#154">154</a>]. A vigorous community of
desirable vegetation uses soil moisture and shades
the soil surface, impeding establishment of yellow starthistle. Any activity that disturbs
the soil and/or increases sunlight at the soil surface can encourage yellow starthistle
[<a href="#118">118</a>].
Grazing management is
critical to successful management of yellow starthistle on rangelands. A detailed summary of grazing management practices to deter invasion by
yellow starthistle is
given by DiTomaso [<a href="#35">35</a>] (<a href="https://wric.ucdavis.edu/yst/">WRIC</a>). Managers should plan to invest strategically in routine
monitoring and maintenance to locate scattered and
isolated yellow starthistle plants and eliminate them [<a href="#118">118</a>].
Remote sensing may be useful for delineating, quantifying, and recording yellow starthistle
infestations [<a href="#76">76</a>]. It is important to educate managers,
landowners and the general public so that they can identify yellow starthistle plants,
eradicate them, report their presence, and/or not distribute the seeds
unknowingly [<a href="#133">133</a>]. The organization of cooperative weed management areas and cost-sharing
programs can be effective strategies to improve weed control efforts [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>].<p>

<font face="Bell MT">
Integrated management: </font>   The goal of any management plan should be not only controlling
invasive plants, but also improving the affected community, maximizing forage quality and quantity
and/or preserving ecosystem integrity, and preventing
reinvasion or invasion by other weed species, in a way that is
complementary to the ecology and economics of the site [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>]. Effective long-term control requires
weeds be removed and replaced
by more desirable and weed resistant plant communities [<a href="#149">149</a>]. Once the desired plant
community has been determined, an integrated weed management strategy can be
developed to direct succession toward that plant community by identifying key
mechanisms and processes directing plant community dynamics (site availability,
species availability, and species performance) and predicting plant community
response to control measures [<a href="#129">129</a>]. This requires a long-term
integrated management plan. The rapid growth,
high seed viability, and seed longevity in yellow starthistle necessitate a land manager's long-term commitment to control programs
[<a href="#133">133</a>]. <br><br>
Most often, a single method is not effective for controlling an invasive
plant, and there are
many possible combinations of methods that can achieve the desired objectives. Methods selected for removal or control of
yellow starthistle on a specific site will be
determined by land use objectives, desired plant community, extent
and nature of the infestation(s), environmental factors (non-target vegetation,
soil types, climatic conditions, important water resources), economics, and
effectiveness and limitations of available control techniques [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>]. Sometimes
control techniques must be in a particular sequence to be successful. The
most effective sequence for yellow starthistle control includes early season strategies in the 1st year
or 2 of a management program, followed by late-season options in the later years
[<a href="#35">35</a>] (see the (<a href="https://wric.ucdavis.edu/yst/">WRIC</a>) site
for more information). Consistent components of a
successful program include persistence, flexibility, and most importantly, preventing new seed recruitment
[<a href="#34">34</a>]. Also necessary for a successful integrated program is cooperation between all
private and public landowners and government agencies that manage land in the
area [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>].</p>
<p>Some examples of combined approaches and considerations are presented within
the following sections (e.g. [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#149">149</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>]). Managers are encouraged to use combinations of
control techniques in a manner that is appropriate to the site objectives,
desired plant community, available resources, and timing of application.</p>
<p><font face="Bell MT">Mechanical: </font>Mechanical control options for
management of yellow starthistle typically include hand pulling, hoeing, weed whipping, tillage
or mowing [<a href="#30">30</a>].</p>
<p>Manual removal (hand-pulling or digging) of yellow starthistle is most effective when small patches or
scattered plants are detected before they produce a crop of seeds. Hand-pulling can be
an important option in steep or uneven terrain
where other mechanical tools are impossible to use [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>], and is useful along rivers and riparian zones
[<a href="#133">133</a>]. Hand-pulling by volunteers controlled populations
of yellow starthistle in the Agate Desert Preserve in southwestern Oregon [<a href="#108">108</a>]. To ensure that plants do not recover, it is important to detach all aboveground stem material. A 2-inch piece of the stem can recover if leaves and buds are still attached
[<a href="#10">10</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<p> The best time to pull yellow starthistle is after plants have bolted but before they produce viable
seed. This stage is easy to recognize 
(see &quot;<a href="botanical_and_ecological_characteristics.html#Seasonal Development">Seasonal Development</a>&quot;
section in the &quot;BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS&quot; part of this
report) [<a href="#11">11</a>]. When using manual removal techniques it is
important to minimize soil disturbance around removed plants since it can
create an ideal site for re-establishment by new seedlings or invasion by another undesirable species
[<a href="#35">35</a>]. In areas where
yellow starthistle is growing with
competing vegetation it tends to develop a more erect and slender stem and
usually lacks basal leaves [<a href="#116">116</a>]. Under these conditions, yellow starthistle
can be relatively brittle and easy to
remove and will rarely recover, even when a portion of the stem is left intact
[<a href="#10">10</a>]. Sheley and others
[<a href="#133">133</a>] recommend transporting pulled plants in plastic bags to a location where the
plants can be burned in a hot fire, to prevent spreading the seeds
of flowering yellow starthistle plants. The Bradley
method [<a href="#43">43</a>] (read about it in the Fall 1997 <a href="https://www.caleppc.org/publications/newsletters/newsletters.html">CALEPPC</a>
newsletter) can be used to control yellow starthistle populations up to about 40 acres in size by
physically removing plants from the outer edge of the population and moving in.
The
technique requires multiple visits, but helps ensure that no new seeds are produced
and that soil disturbance is minimized [<a href="#35">35</a>]. Systematic surveys and repeated removal
should be conducted every 2 to 4 weeks throughout the growing season [<a href="#133">133</a>].</p>
<p>Any tillage operation that severs
the roots below the soil surface can effectively control yellow starthistle, which probably accounts for the uncommon occurrence of yellow starthistle
as a cropland weed. Tillage is sometimes used for yellow starthistle control on roadsides. Early summer tillage,
before viable seeds are set, and repeated tillage following rainfall/germination events
[<a href="#133">133</a>]
will rapidly deplete the yellow starthistle seed bank, but may also have the same effect
on the seed bank of desirable species [<a href="#35">35</a>]. Tillage is not appropriate in wildlands and
rangelands since it can damage important desirable species, increase erosion,
alter soil structure and expose the soil for rapid reinfestations if subsequent
rainfall occurs [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].</p>
<p>Mowing may be an effective control method for yellow starthistle in accessible
areas under intensive management, along roadsides, in recreational areas, and
where landowners do not wish to use herbicides [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>].
Successful control with mowing depends on proper timing, the growth form of
yellow starthistle [<a href="#10">10</a>], and the availability of desirable plants to fill the
emptied niche [<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#149">149</a>]. The
degree of control one can expect with mowing also varies with site conditions and
available moisture after defoliation. It is therefore important to monitor and
follow-up with whatever action may be indicated to achieve satisfactory control
[<a href="#147">147</a>].</p>
<p> Mowing too
early (before seedheads reach spiny stage) or too late (after seed set) will usually increase the
yellow starthistle problem [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#149">149</a>]. Mowing too early in the season can remove
associated
grass (native species are negatively impacted) cover and promotes more vigorous yellow starthistle
regrowth.
If done too late, mowing scatters yellow starthistle seed [<a href="#118">118</a>]. Thompsen
and others [<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#149">149</a>] achieved best results at 2 sites in northern California
by mowing once at the early flowering stage, and again 4 to 6 weeks later to cut
regrowth during the floral bud stage. Under this regime, yellow starthistle
canopy size, seed production and plant density were reduced, and plants had significantly fewer flowerheads and seedlings (p&lt;0.05). Results
were improved
when combined with plantings of subterranean clover (<i>Trifolium</i> <i>subterraneum)</i>. A dense
spring canopy of desirable vegetation optimizes yellow starthistle control
[<a href="#147">147</a>]. Yellow starthistle plants with
an erect,
high-branching growth form are effectively controlled by a single mowing at the
early flowering stage, while sprawling low-branching plants cannot be controlled
even with repeated mowing [<a href="#10">10</a>]. Other drawbacks to mowing
include a possible decrease in reproductive efforts of insect biocontrol agents,
injury to native forb species [<a href="#125">125</a>], and reduction of fall and winter
forage for wildlife and livestock [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>]. However, Platt and others [<a href="#102">102</a>] suggest that mowing is compatible with the use
of biological control agents.</p>

implementing a biological control program. The objective of biological control
efforts is to propagate and redistribute sufficient insect populations to hold yellow starthistle
to population levels similar to their populations in Europe [<a href="#153">153</a>]. A detailed summary of the status of biological control of yellow starthistle
in the
western U.S. is given by Piper [<a href="#100">100</a>], and comprehensive coverage of biological control
of yellow starthistle and how to establish a biocontrol program is presented by Jette and
others [<a href="#61">61</a>].</p>
<p>Since 1986, 6 insects have been released for biological control of yellow starthistle:</p>

</table>
<p>Of these, <i>Chaetorellia succinea</i> is not an approved agent and was released accidentally and is
now widespread in California. Because of a risk of damage to safflower,
deliberate introductions to other areas are not recommended [<a href="#7">7</a>]. William and others
[<a href="#160">160</a>], however, report that this agent is
also widespread in Washington and Oregon and is found on limited sites in Idaho.
They also report that this agent is available for redistribution in these
states. Surveys of insects investigated for biocontrol are available (e.g.
[<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>]).</p>
<p>The 6 insects that have become established are thought to have excellent
potential to diminish yellow starthistle seed production, especially <i> E. villosus</i> and <i> C. succinea</i>
 [<a href="#100">100</a>]. The impact of biocontrol insects may not be sufficient to provide
complete, long-term control; however,
biocontrol agents can be an important component of an integrated management
approach. Where yellow starthistle occurs in dense populations and experiences high levels of intraspecific competition,
however, a
reduction in density through seed destruction by biocontrol agents may only
release the weed from competition. The result would then be larger plants with more capitula
and seeds
per plant, thereby producing just as many seeds per unit area as before [<a href="#152">152</a>].
A more successful biocontrol program might include plant pathogens or
other insects capable of severely damaging or feeding on roots, stems, or
foliage [<a href="#35">35</a>]. Currently, a root-boring weevil (<i>Ceratapion
basicorne</i>) whose larvae feed on the midrib, root crown, and stem tissues is
undergoing host specificity testing and may have potential for release on yellow starthistle
in the
next few years [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].</p>
<p>Pathogens such as the Mediterranean rust fungus (<i>Puccinia jaceae</i>) are
also being studied for control potential in yellow starthistle, though they have not been released for use [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>]. The potential use of protein isolates from plant pathogens
as bioherbicides is also a subject under investigation (e.g. [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>]).</p>
<p> The use of grazing
animals to control yellow starthistle has also been investigated and has met with some
success [<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>].
Properly timed grazing by cows, sheep and goats can effectively manage yellow starthistle
stands, but will not eliminate populations. Timing of grazing is critical and is
more important than animal class, though
there were differences in acceptance by cows, sheep and goats. Optimum control is achieved when
yellow starthistle is grazed in the bolting, pre-spiny
stage, followed by 1 to 3 additional grazings to remove regrowth, as long as yellow starthistle
continues to bolt. The number of grazings
required to suppress plants increases when spring rains replenish soil moisture
[<a href="#150">150</a>]. Grazing in this way on California rangeland between mid-May and early July resulted
in major reductions in yellow starthistle biomass, canopy size and seed
production, though sufficient seed was
produced or already present in soil seed bank for new plants to establish in
subsequent years. This prescription must be continued for at least 3 years in a severe
infestation to reduce the yellow starthistle seed bank. Grazing at this time allows annual grasses, legumes
and most other resident annuals to complete their life cycle and set seed,
allowing for seed bank
replenishment and leaving appreciable amounts of plant residues on the ground
[<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>].</p>
<p>Grazing alone may not provide long-term control or
eradication of yellow starthistle, but can be a valuable tool in an integrated management
program [<a href="#30">30</a>]. Both grazing alone and grazing plus
herbicide applications provide some measure of success in managing yellow starthistle. While
some herbicides substantially decrease yellow starthistle densities, they also eliminate all other
broad-leaved plants within the sprayed strips and reduce total biomass
production [<a href="#148">148</a>]. Additionally, a study by Enloe and others [<a href="#41">41</a>] indicates that
other yellow starthistle management
strategies may interact strongly with posttreatment grazing management. It is
therefore essential to carefully prescribe grazing practices following yellow starthistle
control treatments. See DiTomaso's review (<a href="https://wric.ucdavis.edu/yst/">WRIC</a>)
for a detailed discussion of grazing management in conjunction with yellow starthistle
control.</p>
<p>

<font face="Bell MT">
Chemical:</font>   Herbicides are effective in gaining initial control of a new
or severe infestation of yellow starthistle, but are rarely a complete or long-term
solution to weed management. If chemical control is used it must be incorporated
into long-term management plans that include replacement of weeds with desirable
species, careful land use management, and prevention of new infestations [<a href="#19">19</a>].
Improper use of herbicides can lead to several potential problems, including
spray or vapor drift, water contamination, toxicity, selection for herbicide
resistance in weeds and reduction in plant diversity. The <a href="https://wric.ucdavis.edu/yst/">WRIC</a> 
website
has information on herbicides used in yellow starthistle control programs including rates, timing and
other considerations for their use [<a href="#35">35</a>]. See the <a href="https://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/handbook.html">Weed
Control Methods Handbook</a> for considerations on the use of herbicides in
natural areas and detailed information on specific chemicals.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Several selective and nonselective herbicides are registered
for control of yellow starthistle in noncrop areas, pasture, and rangeland [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#160">160</a>]. Picloram is the herbicide most widely used on yellow starthistle
in western states other
than California, where it is not registered for use. Other herbicides used for
control of yellow starthistle include clopyralid, 2,4-D, dicamba, triclopyr, chlorsulfuron, and
glyphosate. Of these, clopyralid is the most effective for yellow starthistle
control and the least injurious to grasses [<a href="#35">35</a>]. Herbicides may be applied at the seedling, rosette, or bolting stages of
yellow starthistle,
but higher rates are required to kill larger plants. Herbicides applied at bud
and flowering stages may reduce seed formation [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>], but
may not entirely prevent
the production of viable seed [<a href="#118">118</a>].</p>
<p>Of particular concern for yellow starthistle control is its resistance to
picloram and some
other synthetic auxin herbicides. Resistance of yellow starthistle to picloram was first observed
in 1988 in a pasture in Washington that had been frequently treated with picloram during the preceding 10
years [<a href="#24">24</a>]. DiTomaso [<a href="#35">35</a>]
summarizes the literature on herbicide resistance of yellow starthistle, noting that picloram
resistant plants were also cross-resistant to clopyralid, dicamba and
fluroxypyr, but not to triclopyr or 2,4-D, all of which are synthetic auxins and
have
the same mode of action as picloram (<a href="https://wric.ucdavis.edu/yst/">WRIC</a>). William
and others [<a href="#160">160</a>] and Mallory-Smith and others [<a href="#84">84</a>] discuss herbicide resistance and
methods of prevention. Integrated approaches for the control of invasive species can greatly reduce the incidence of herbicide resistant
biotypes [<a href="#35">35</a>]. More
information on herbicide resistance is available at <a href="https://www.weedscience.org/in.asp">WeedScience.org</a>. Repeated or continuous use of one
herbicide or
herbicides with the same mode of action may select not only for resistant
accessions but also for other plant species demonstrating tolerance. In this
way, one noxious weed may be replaced by another, equally undesirable
species that is insensitive to the herbicide treatment. For example when broadleaf selective
herbicides are used, noxious annual grasses such as medusahead, cheatgrass, or
barbed goatgrass (<i>Aegilops triuncialis</i>) may become dominant [<a href="#35">35</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<p> Used alone,
herbicides control yellow starthistle only temporarily, but may be a critical
initial step in establishing new vegetation, and may be useful for controlling yellow starthistle
among
perennial grasses and protecting uninfested areas by containing yellow starthistle
invasions [<a href="#118">118</a>]. An integrated combination of herbicide treatment and grass
seeding can be
effective in suppressing yellow starthistle seed production and can provide better long-term
control than herbicide alone. Herbicides can also be compatible with survival of biocontrol
agents. Studies combining prescribed burning and herbicide treatment have also
been suggested [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>].<br><br>

<font face="Bell MT">
Cultural:</font> Cultural
control of yellow starthistle includes revegetation programs in which infested sites are
seeded with either native or high forage non-native perennial grasses [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>]. Revegetation with desirable and competitive plant species
is an important part of most integrated management strategies, and can be the
best long-term sustainable method of suppressing yellow starthistle invasions, establishment, or
dominance while providing high forage production [<a href="#30">30</a>].</p>
<p>The degree of success or failure of any range revegetation program will depend on the
selection of a grass species suited to the site (no
single species or combination of species will be effective under all
circumstances), the density of the established
stand of grass, and the land manager's ability to maintain grass vigor after
establishment [<a href="#73">73</a>]. Only a few species have proven to be aggressive
enough to displace invasive species. In addition to being competitive,
seeded species need to be adapted to local soil conditions, elevation, climate,
and precipitation level of the site [<a href="#35">35</a>].




Monsen and McArthur [<a href="#89">89</a>] provide a detailed discussion of Intermountain range
and watershed restoration practices, including considerations for choosing
native or introduced plant materials.
In any revegetation program using non-native species (or even native species from other
regions), it is important to ensure that an introduced species will not itself
become invasive [<a href="#35">35</a>]. Harrison and others [<a href="#51">51</a>] review several
introduced species that have been used in revegetation programs in the Northwest
and discuss their innate potential for invasiveness.</p>
<p>Although perennial grasses have been
shown to be successful in competing with rangeland weeds, using a combination of species with
various growth forms and ecological traits (e.g. seed mixtures with grasses and
legumes) may be more effective, because a weed-resistant plant community is comprised of
diverse species that occupy most of the niches, above and below ground [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>]. Seed mixtures
of grasses and forbs may be
ineffective in conjunction with herbicides that kill broad-leaved plants. When using
herbicides to control yellow starthistle before seeding, one can begin seeding with grasses and add
forbs later. In this way, it may take several years to re-establish desirable vegetation [<a href="#35">35</a>].</p>
<p>DiTomaso [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>] summarizes research and considerations for revegetation
programs for yellow starthistle management in western states. Competitive grasses used
include non-native perennial grasses such as crested wheatgrass (<i>A.
desertorum</i>), intermediate wheatgrass (<i>Thinopyrum intermedium</i>), Bozoisky Russian wildrye (<i>Psathyrostachys
juncea</i>), sheep fescue (<i>F. ovina</i>), tall oatgrass (<i>Arrhenatherum elatius</i>), or
orchardgrass (<i>Dactylis glomerata</i>), as well as native perennial grasses
including big bluegrass (<i>Poa ampla</i>) and thickspike wheatgrass (<i>Elymus
lanceolatus</i>  ssp. <i>lanceolatus</i>). Thill and others [<a href="#146">146</a>] evaluate
several native and introduced species and their suitability for yellow starthistle
suppression under different site conditions and objectives.</p>
<p align="left">Studies in Idaho indicate that in communities dominated by bluebunch wheatgrass, intermediate wheatgrass, Idaho fescue,
sheep
fescue, or annual grasses, the fescue communities were least susceptible to invasion by yellow starthistle.
Bluebunch wheatgrass
was the most susceptible perennial grass community, and annual grass
communities were even more susceptible to invasion by yellow starthistle. Yellow starthistle
was
susceptible to competition from perennial grass dominated communities. In addition,
litter depth appeared to play a roll in
suppression of yellow starthistle in both annual and perennial communities as
more litter suppressed yellow starthistle germination [<a href="#106">106</a>]. In Oregon, Larson and
McInnis [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>] studied several grass species that have successfully controlled or
reduced the rate of yellow starthistle reinvasion. Preliminary control
techniques included treatment with picloram and tillage. Their results indicate that rate of
yellow starthistle re-establishment can be
reduced by selecting grass with competitive biomass and early growth, and that
seeding without site preparation or fertilizing grasses did not control yellow starthistle
reinvasion. Similarly, Borman and others [<a href="#16">16</a>] found that the more effective
competitive species were those with early active growth and continued growth through winter. Roche and White
[<a href="#118">118</a>] provide a detailed, step-by-step process for revegetation
of yellow starthistle infestations in Oregon. In California, several species in the legume family,
including non-native
crimson clover (<i>Trifolium incarnatum</i>) and subterranean clover,
have also been tested for their competitive
effect on yellow starthistle. More research is needed to address questions of what combination of
species to use in various environments, which species or combination will
aggressively compete with yellow starthistle, and how to economically establish these species
[<a href="#35">35</a>]. </p>
<p align="left"> Researchers in California also found that integrated
combinations of herbicide treatment and grass seeding can be effective
in suppressing yellow starthistle seed production and provide a more effective long-term
solution than applying herbicide alone [<a href="#35">35</a>]. When fall-dormant seedings are most practical, a late
season application of glyphosate can be used to eliminate fall germination
annuals such as cheatgrass and yellow starthistle that have emerged prior to application.
This
may substantially reduce weed competition for early season moisture the following
spring [<a href="#59">59</a>]. Similarly, in the Northwest, established stands of wheatgrass
species (Triticaceae) provide good
to excellent suppression of yellow starthistle. Wheatgrasses do not have adequate seedling vigor
to establish in stands of yellow starthistle, however, so yellow starthistle
cover must be reduced
prior to grass establishment [<a href="#139">139</a>]. </p>
<p align="left"> Full recovery of desirable rangeland plants should be allowed
before the area is grazed. This will help keep the plants vigorous and
competitive, and minimize reinvasion by yellow starthistle [<a href="#35">35</a>].
Successful competition
relies on limiting light to seedling yellow starthistle plants; therefore
removal of too much
top growth of desirable species with excessive grazing may enable yellow starthistle
to recolonize a site because the
shade is removed [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#146">146</a>].
Studies from southeastern Washington indicate that a stand of adapted perennial
grass can limit yellow starthistle if it is managed to provide shade over the soil surface
from fall through spring and to deplete soil water from late spring though
summer. Shallow soils do not have the potential to support enough vegetation to
shade yellow starthistle, but in the absence of summer precipitation, perennials deplete soil
moisture before yellow starthistle maturation and limit its competitiveness [<a href="#116">116</a>].
Yellow starthistle's rapid germination and root growth give it an advantage over
many potential competitive, desirable species [<a href="#134">134</a>], making establishment
of desirable species difficult because of uncertain
moisture availability. Therefore management of perennial forages should focus on
timing and intensity of grazing to shade yellow starthistle rosettes during the critical root
development phase [<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>].
