<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Silver maple is a dominant canopy species only in streamside communities
and lake fringes, and occasionally in swamps, gullies, and small
depressions of slow drainage [<a href="#16">16</a>].  The elm-ash-cottonwood type is
defined as bottomland forest in which elms (Ulmus spp.), green ash
(Fraxinus pennsylvanica), eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides), silver
maple, or red maple comprise a plurality of the stocking [<a href="#70">70</a>].

Silver maple and/or American elm (Ulmus americana) are usually the
dominant tree species in southern Wisconsin floodplain forests [<a href="#66">66</a>].  In
Illinois, silver maple was the leading dominant on floodplain sites that
were flooded at least 25 percent of the time.  With increased elevation
other species increased, although silver maple continued to be dominant
on sites that were flooded 3 to 5 percent of the time.  Silver maple,
sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), and green ash communities occurred at
the lowest elevations; silver maple, sycamore, green ash, American elm,
hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), and other species were found at higher
elevations [<a href="#5">5</a>].  In central New York, silver maple-green ash swamps are
relatively low in species diversity and density [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Silver maple
dominance decreases with decreasing latitude; it is relatively rare in
many southern floodplain forests [<a href="#12">12</a>].

In the Central Forest Region (as defined by the Society of American
Foresters [<a href="#73">73</a>]), understory associates of silver maple include willows
(Salix spp.), redberry elder (Sambucus pubens), red-osier dogwood
(Cornus sericea), and greenbriers (Smilax spp.).  In the Northern Forest
Region associates include swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor), sycamore,
pin oak (Quercus palustrus), black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), and eastern
cottonwood.  In New England and eastern Canada, associates include sweet
birch (Betula lenta), paper birch (B.  papyrifera), and gray birch (B.
populifolia).  In New York, associates include white ash (Fraxinus
americana), slippery elm (Ulmus rubra), rock elm (U. thomassii), yellow
birch (B. allegheniensis), black tupelo, sycamore, eastern hemlock
(Tsuga canadensis), bur oak (Q. macrocarpa), and swamp white oak [<a href="#16">16</a>].
In the elm-ash-cottonwood type, other associates include black willow
(Salix niger), boxelder (Acer negundo), and sycamore [<a href="#70">70</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Acer saccharinum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Silver maple wood is moderately hard, brittle, and close-grained. It is
not as heavy or hard as that of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].
Silver maple wood is used for furniture, boxes, crates, food containers,
paneling, and core stock [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Silver maple is cut and sold with red
maple as 'soft maple' lumber [<a href="#16">16</a>].  It is a valued timber species in the
Midwest, and may prove to be equally valuable in the Northeast [<a href="#43">43</a>].

On good sites silver maple can be managed for timber.  On poor sites,
it can be managed for cordwood [<a href="#43">43</a>].  It has potential for
short-rotation intensive cropping sytems for woody fuel biomass
plantations [<a href="#59">59</a>].  Biomass yields at various spacings have been reported [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Silver maple produces abundant annual seed crops; the seeds are eaten by
many birds, including evening grosbeaks, finches, wild turkeys and other
game birds [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>], and small mammals, especially squirrels and chipmunks
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Silver maple seeds were the most important food in the diet of
breeding wood ducks in southeastern Missouri [<a href="#13">13</a>].  The early buds of
silver maple are an important food for squirrels when cached food is
depleted.  Silver maple bark ranks high as a food source for beavers in
southeastern Ohio [<a href="#16">16</a>].  White-tailed deer and rabbits browse the
foliage [<a href="#28">28</a>].

In New Brunswick, wood ducks and goldeneyes frequently nest in silver
maples.  The soft wood of silver maple has a tendency to develop
cavities which are used by cavity-nesting birds and mammals, and which
otherwise provide shelter for a number of species including raccoons,
opossums, squirrels, owls, and woodpeckers [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Silver maple was one
of a few species of deciduous trees used as communal roosts by
red-winged blackbirds, common grackles, starlings, and brown-headed
cowbirds in Ohio [<a href="#41">41</a>].

Silver maple groves and the riparian communities in which silver maple
occurs are excellent habitat for wildlife [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  Silver maple is a
dominant member of riparian communities in Indiana that are important to
the endangered Indiana bat.  However, it was not listed as a species in
which maternity colonies were observed [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Silver maple is often a
dominant member of seasonally flooded flats, which are important to
tree- and shrub-nesting species, colony-nesting waterbirds, and
passerines.  It also occurs in wooded swamps and other riparian
communities which are valuable breeding habitat for wood ducks, black
ducks, herons, egrets, warblers, flycatchers, woodpeckers, thrushes,
nuthatches, vireos, rose-breasted grosbeaks, hawks, owls, grackles, and
many passerines [<a href="#35">35</a>].

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
In the Appalachian Mountains, succession on strip-mined lands can
include silver maple if a seed source is present [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Silver maple was
planted on surface-mined lands in Indiana between 1928 and 1975, and was
listed sixth (in order of number planted) out of 26 hardwood species
that were used for surface mine afforestation [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Silver maple is suitable for bottomland reforestation in the lower
Mississippi River Valley [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Silver maple has been planted as an ornamental, but the limbs are easily
broken in ice and snow storms [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Its use as an ornamental has
declined due to frequent breakage, tendency to rot, and prolific
sprouting.  The shallow roots invade water systems, the seeds are a
nuisance, and it sheds a lot of twigs [<a href="#71">71</a>].

Silver maple sap can be used to make maple syrup [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Silver maple stands are considered as having lower aesthetic value than
other bottomland hardwood types, and are therefore less valuable for
recreation [<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Young stems of silver maple can be maintained as low, dense cover for
wildlife by frequent patch cutting [<a href="#43">43</a>].

Where eastern cottonwood is the desired tree species, removal of
competing silver maple stems is necessary to prevent silver maple
dominance [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Silver maple is intermediate to resistant to 2,4-D, and
susceptible to intermediate in resistance to 2,4,5-T [<a href="#48">48</a>].  There was no
sprouting from silver maple stumps with direct application of undiluted
triclopyr ester.  Other application methods were also effective [<a href="#42">42</a>].

Silver maple can be managed on good sites for sawtimber, and on poor or
wet sites for pulp or cordwood.  Rapid growth occurs in both pure and
mixed stands [<a href="#16">16</a>].  In the northeastern and north-central United States,
selective cuts and shelterwood cuts are silvical options for silver
maple [<a href="#55">55</a>].  However, silver maple trees will sprout along the bole
where they are exposed to sunlight, reducing the amount of clear new
wood that can be formed.  It is recommended that silver maple be left in
clumps where possible during selective harvest, or that openings not be
so large as to allow full sunlight to fall on the trunks of remaining
silver maple stems [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Clearcutting followed by pre-commercial
treatments to remove undesirable stems is recommended [<a href="#45">45</a>].
Clearcutting or group selection/uneven-aged management can result in
good regeneration if seed sources are present.  Relatively large open
areas are required for good seedling establishment [<a href="#43">43</a>].  In
regenerating stands, cull trees need to be removed.  Girdled silver
maple stems sprout vigorously; herbicide treatment is necessary to
completely remove a cull silver maple from the stand [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Direct
seeding has not been tested for silver maple [<a href="#1">1</a>].

The riparian areas in which silver maple occurs are of prime value for
wildlife.  No tree harvesting should occur within 50 feet (15 m) of
streams [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Silver maple has potential as a nurse tree for interplanting with black
walnut (Juglans nigra) in Ontario.  Such interplantings showed the best
5-year growth compared with black walnut alone, black walnut and white
ash, or black walnut and autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellata) [<a href="#64">64</a>].

Silver maple is subject to damage by winds, ice, wood rot and insects
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Relatively soft wood renders it susceptible to a number of
wood rotting fungi.  The moist conditions in which it grows encourage a
number of leaf molds and wilts to which silver maple is also susceptible
[<a href="#16">16</a>].  Silver maple seedlings are susceptible to rodent damage,
especially in heavy grass or weed cover [<a href="#47">47</a>].  Silver maple seedlings
exposed to 0.1 ppm ozone under laboratory conditions experienced a
reduction in leaf area and in total new dry weight after 40 days [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Silver maple foliage is fed upon by later stage gypsy moth larvae only
when preferred foliage is not available [<a href="#21">21</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Acer saccharinum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Silver maple is a native, deciduous, medium-sized tree.  Mature height
ranges from 90 to 120 feet (27-36 m).  Silver maple is characterized as
a fast growing species [<a href="#16">16</a>].  The trunk is often separated into several
upright branches near the ground [<a href="#50">50</a>].  The crown is usually open and
rounded [<a href="#20">20</a>].  The bark of young stems is smooth; it becomes darker and
furrowed to flaky on older stems [<a href="#10">10</a>].  The root system is shallow and
fibrous [<a href="#16">16</a>].  The deepest roots of 35-year-old silver maples planted on
clay soil in North Dakota were 55 inches (139.7 cm).  The longest roots
extended horizontally 49 feet (14.9 m) [<a href="#68">68</a>].  The fruit is a winged
samara, 1.4 to 1.9 inch (3.5-5 cm) long and up to 0.48 inch (12 mm) wide
[<a href="#10">10</a>].

Silver maples can live to 130 years or longer [<a href="#16">16</a>].  The national
champion silver maple (1972) was found in Michigan.  It was 125 feet
(38.1 m) tall, 22.58 feet (82.6 m) in circumference, and had a crown
spread of 111 feet (33.8 m) [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
The mimimum seed bearing age for silver maple is 11 years.  Large seed
crops are produced annually [<a href="#46">46</a>].  The fruits are primarily wind
dispersed, with a minor amount of water disperal [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Release of
fruits is dependent on relatively high wind speeds, ensuring long
distance dispersal [<a href="#23">23</a>].  The seeds germinate immediately upon dispersal
[<a href="#10">10</a>].  Natural regeneration is most successful on moist mineral soil
with considerable organic matter [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Silver maple seed also
germinates well on moist litter.  Seedling establishment requires full
sun, but subsequent growth is best with partial shade [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Seedlings
are often stunted in saturated soils, but can recover when soil moisture
drops [<a href="#16">16</a>].  In Wisconsin, silver maple seedlings were found with higher
frequency in the spring than in the fall [<a href="#36">36</a>].

Silver maple can be propagated from cuttings and bud grafts, and by
layering.  It sprouts prolifically from the stump or root crown.  The
best sprouting occurs from stumps less than 12 inches (30 cm) in
diameter.  Larger trees tend to lose the ability to sprout [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Silver maple is typical of wet bottomlands, riverbanks, and lake edges.
It is less common on upland sites [<a href="#10">10</a>].  In Illinois, silver maple was
reported only from bottonland wet-mesic sites; it did not occur on drier
sites of even slightly higher elevation [<a href="#60">60</a>].  In New York, silver maple
occurs on limestone, outwash, and alluvial soils [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Best growth is
on moist, well-drained, fine-textured alluvial soil [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Silver
maple is found from 100 feet (30.5 m) to 1,600 feet (488 m) elevation in
the Adirondacks [<a href="#34">34</a>], and is uncommon above 1,980 feet (600 m) elevation
in the Appalachians [<a href="#14">14</a>].  In drier areas silver maple is only found
along streams [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Silver maple is usually found on soils with pH above 4.0, but has been
reported from muck and shallow peat soils with a pH from 2.0 to 3.3
[<a href="#16">16</a>].  Recommended soil pH range is 4.5 to 7.0 [<a href="#72">72</a>].  Forest floor
biomass under silver maple plantations had an average pH of 3.7 after 27
years of growth; the underlying mineral soils averaged pH 6.3.  The
effect appeared to be due to a decrease in buffering capacity [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Silver maple is intermediate in tolerance to water-saturated soils, but
can tolerate prolonged periods of inundation [<a href="#16">16</a>].  It is a member of
some greentree reservoir systems that are flooded during the dormant
season to provide waterfowl habitat and drained before the onset of the
growing season.  These sites usually have saturated soils most of the
growing season [<a href="#61">61</a>].  Silver maple seedlings survived 60 days of
continuously saturated soils [<a href="#25">25</a>], but seedlings of low vigor died after
only 2 days of complete inundation [<a href="#24">24</a>].  In the upper Mississippi River
valley, silver maple trees died after 2 years of constant inundation
(due to reservoir formation) [<a href="#22">22</a>].

In the northeastern United States, silver maple is a dominant or
codominant species on the following types of sites: 1) undifferentiated
alluvial deposits of poorly drained silts high in organic matter and
nitrogen, 2) undifferentiated alluvium composed of well-drained silts
with a high base content and nearly neutral soils, and 3) rapidly
aggrading alluvial areas and point bars composed of mixtures of sand and
silt that are of intermediate fertility [<a href="#43">43</a>].

Silver maple was consistently dominant in a model of riparian forest
stands under conditions of 4,000 growing degree days, even when other
model parameters were varied.  This is consistent with the natural
distribution of silver maple; it decreases in dominance with decreasing
latitude and increasingly warmer conditions [<a href="#38">38</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

The shade tolerance of silver maple is not well defined.  It ranges from
moderately tolerant to very intolerant of shade, depending on site
quality and location.  Silver maple tends to be more shade tolerant on
good sites and less tolerant on poor sites [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Silver maple is a dominant species in elm-ash-cottonwood forest types
which are pioneer to intermediate in succession.  These forests cannot
be maintained without management or natural disturbance [<a href="#44">44</a>].  The
silver maple-American elm type is usually a subclimax type, following
willows and eastern cottonwood.  The type is described as climax for
southern Ontario, where it regenerates in willow and red-osier dogwood
thickets [<a href="#73">73</a>].

Silver maple is one of a number of species that follow eastern
cottonwood to form a mixed hardwood bottomland community.  It is
described as an early, fast-growing species [<a href="#32">32</a>].  In a northern
Missouri floodplain community, in plots where silver maple was the most
important overstory species, there were many large silver maples in the
understory.  Silver maple will probably remain the canopy dominant for
some time since there are also large old eastern cottonwoods present,
which, when they die, will create openings large enough for silver maple
seedling establishment.  Similarly, the presence of American elms will
allow new silver maple establishment if they succumb to Dutch elm
disease (as is likely) [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Numerous silver maple seedlings and
saplings were present in a silver maple dominated forest on the Wabash
River in Illinois and Indiana, which should ensure the continued
dominance of silver maple on this site for some time [<a href="#49">49</a>].

Silver maple is typically found in riparian forests which are more or
less frequently disturbed by floods [<a href="#20">20</a>].  It is also found both on
sites that have been disturbed by stream channelization projects [<a href="#29">29</a>].
It forms stands at low elevations where new alluvium has been deposited
and will colonize bottomland clearings and adjacent slopes [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].
Silver maple was present on 28-year-old and 40-year-old abandoned
agricultural clearings in western Tennessee [<a href="#57">57</a>].  It invades sedge
(Carex spp.)  meadows in northern Wisconsin [<a href="#52">52</a>] and southern Quebec
[<a href="#2">2</a>].  Silver maple invades cutover areas when seed sources are present
[<a href="#40">40</a>].

Silver maple was a member of a plant community that established on a
small, frequently flooded island in Wisconsin.  On this island, silver
maple was quite common and there was a relatively large number of silver
maple seedlings.  Most of the large silver maple stems were of sprout
origin, and overall mortality rate for silver maple was lower than that
for most other species.  Apparently, flood damage breaks off aboveground
portions of silver maple.  The remaining stems sprout vigorously and may
therefore increase in number after such damage.  The largest stems of
all species were found on the downstream end of the island, where they
experienced less destructive disturbance [<a href="#3">3</a>].

A silver maple-green ash forest was reported to a National Park Service
survey as old growth.  This forest covers 7.5 to 10 acres (3-4 ha) on
Theodore Roosevelt Island in Washington D.C.  Approximate tree ages
range from 160 to 198 years [<a href="#62">62</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Silver maple is one of the earliest flowering species within its range;
flowering occurs over a short period from late February to April or May,
depending on latitude [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  All flowers on one individual are within
a day or so of each other in development; the period of pollen
receptivity lasts from a few days to a week [<a href="#67">67</a>].  The flowers often
fall before the leaves are fully grown [<a href="#19">19</a>].  The seeds ripen and are
released over a very short period, usually less than 2 weeks [<a href="#23">23</a>] from
April to June.  Germination usually occurs shortly after dispersal [<a href="#10">10</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Silver maple is not well adapted to survive fire despite its ability to
sprout after other disturbances.  Its relatively soft wood, thin bark
and tendency to rot render it susceptible to fire-caused wounds [<a href="#74">74</a>].
Its shallow roots are probably easily damaged by fire.  It does not
occur on sites that burn frequently.  In southern Quebec, a sedge meadow
that was protected from fire was rapidly invaded by a number of woody
species, including silver maple [<a href="#2">2</a>].

<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>

<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Prescribed fire is not recommended for the riparian or bottomland
forests in which silver maple occurs.  Silver maple is susceptible to
fire damage; surface fires kill seedlings and saplings and wound larger
trees which exacerbates the tendency of silver maple to rot.  Weeds and
vines follow fires and create heavy competition for tree seedlings.  The
destruction of organic layers by fire contributes to general site
deterioration [<a href="#44">44</a>].

The 'higher heat value' of ovendry silver maple wood averaged 8,360 Btu
per pound [<a href="#30">30</a>].
