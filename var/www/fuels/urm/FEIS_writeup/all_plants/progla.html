The currently accepted scientific name of honey mesquite is <i>Prosopis
glandulosa</i>  (Fabaceae) [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#181">181</a>]. Three varieties are recognized [<a href="#50">50</a>]:

<p><i>Prosopis glandulosa</i> Torr. var. <i> glandulosa</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; honey mesquite<br>
<i>Prosopis glandulosa </i>Torr. var. <i> prostrata</i> Burkart&nbsp;&nbsp; honey mesquite<br>
<i>Prosopis glandulosa</i> Torr. var. <i> torreyana</i> (L. Benson) M.C. Johnston&nbsp;&nbsp;
western honey
mesquite</p>

<p> Little information is available regarding the ecology
of <i>P. glandulosa </i>var. <i>prostrata. </i>In this species summary,
&quot;honey mesquite&quot; refers to the species, while the &quot;typical
variety&quot; and &quot;western honey mesquite&quot; refer to <i>Prosopis glandulosa</i> var. <i> glandulosa
</i> and <i>  Prosopis glandulosa</i> Torr.
var. <i> torreyana</i>, respectively.</p>

<p>Several hybrids have been reported [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>]. Honey
mesquite<i> </i>×&nbsp; western honey mesquite intermediates occur in western Texas and New
Mexico, and western honey mesquite<i>&nbsp;</i>&#215; velvet mesquite (<i>Prosopis
velutina</i>) hybrids
occur in Arizona, Sonora, and Baja California [<a href="#100">100</a>].</p>

GENERAL DISTRIBUTION:</a>
</span>
<br />


Honey mesquite is distributed from California east to Kansas and south to Louisiana,
Nuevo Leon, and Baja California [<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>]. The <a href="http://plants.usda.gov/index.html">PLANTS database</a>
provides a map of honey mesquite's distribution in the United States.


<p>The typical variety of honey mesquite is distributed from
southwestern Kansas, western Oklahoma, and Louisiana, and most of Texas west to New Mexico
and south to Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, and Coahuila, Mexico [<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>]. Western honey mesquite occurs in western Texas, southern
New Mexico, southeastern and western Arizona, extreme southwestern Utah,
southern Nevada, southern California, and northern Mexico [<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>]. <i>Prosopis
glandulosa </i>var<i>. prostrata</i> occurs in Texas [<a href="#101">101</a>].
</p>

<p>Before the introduction of livestock by European
settlers, the geographic ranges of North American mesquites were probably more
distinct. Since livestock effectively disperse the seeds, mesquites have
increased their abundance across the Southwest since settlement times, and many
species' ranges have changed [<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>]. The ranges of the typical variety of honey mesquite
and western honey mesquite overlap in western Texas,
eastern New Mexico, and northeastern Mexico [<a href="#139">139</a>], but for the most part honey
mesquite occurs east of the Pecos River, while western honey mesquite is more
prevalent west of the Pecos River [<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>]. Along the Rio Grande River near El
Paso, Texas, honey mesquite, western honey mesquite, and velvet mesquite all
occur together [<a href="#20">20</a>]. Western honey mesquite is the most common mesquite in the Trans-Pecos Region of Texas [<a href="#137">137</a>]. Isolated populations of the typical variety occur in
southeastern Arizona, southern California, and near Shreveport Louisiana, all
thought to be introductions, possibly from livestock-dispersed seed along
railways or stage routes, or by other human introductions [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>]. Similar
isolated populations
of western honey mesquite occur in the San Joaquin Valley, California [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>].

  Coastal prairies of southeastern Texas: Associated brush species include acacias (<i>Acacia</i> spp.),
  lime pricklyash (<i>Zanthoxylum fagara</i>), lotebush (<i>Ziziphus obtusifolia</i>), huisache
(<i>Acacia farnesiana</i>), bluewood (<i>Condalia hookeri</i>), and narrowleaf forestiera (<i>Forestiera
angustifolia</i>). Common grass associates include little bluestem (<i>Schizachyrium

  bluestem (<i>Andropogon gerardii </i>var. <i>gerardii</i>), indiangrass (<i>Sorghastrum
  nutans</i>), and switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>) [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>]. On coastal prairies of the Welder
Wildlife Refuge, honey mesquite grows with acacia species, tussock grass (<i>Nassella
leucotricha</i>), dropseed grasses (<i>Sporobolus </i>spp.), and silver bluestem
(<i>Bothriochloa laguriodes</i>) [<a href="#79">79</a>].
<p class="subframeContent">Rio Grande Plains of southwestern Texas: Honey
  mesquite is often codominant with mixed-brush species like huisachillo (<i>Acacia
  tortuosa</i>), blackbrush acacia (<i>Acacia rigidula</i>), guajillo (<i>Acacia berlandieri</i>),
  spiny hackberry (<i>Celtis pallida</i>), lotebush, desert yaupon (<i>Schaefferia
  cuneifolia</i>), lime pricklyash, Texas persimmon (<i>Diospyros texana</i>),
  and bluewood. Common grasses include little bluestem, Texas grama (<i>Bouteloua
  rigidiseta</i>), yellow foxtail (<i>Setaria geniculata</i>), bristle
grass (<i>Setaria</i> spp.), hooded windmill grass (<i>Chloris cucullata</i>), thin paspalum
  (<i>Paspalum setaceum</i>), and buffalograss (<i>Buchloe dactyloides</i>)
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>]. Brown [<a href="#32">32</a>]
describes communities in small basins in the Rio Grande area where honey mesquite,
longleaf ephedra (<i>Ephedra trifurca</i>), and soaptree yucca (<i>Yucca elata</i>) are
the dominant shrubs and the understory is composed of buffalograss and dropseed
grasses.
These communities are frequently located around the edge of ancient lake beds.

<p>Western Texas and New Mexico: Honey mesquite and
western honey mesquite are
  often associated with more xeric species, including allthorn (<i>Koeberlimia
  spinosa</i>), Gregg catclaw (<i>Acacia greggii</i>), fourwing saltbush (<i>Atriplex
  canescen</i>s), tarbush (<i>Flourensia cernua</i>), and catclaw mimosa (<i>Mimosa
  biuncifera</i>). Associated grasses include black grama (<i>Bouteloua
  eriopoda</i>), sideoats grama (<i>B. curtipendula</i>), mesa dropseed (<i>Sporobolus
  flexuosus</i>), threeawns (<i>Aristida</i> spp.), burro grass (<i>Scleropogon
  brevifolius</i>), tobosagrass (<i>Pleuraphis mutica</i>), and curlymesquite (<i>Hilaria
  belangeri</i>) [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>].</p>

<p>Edwards Plateau of central Texas: Honey mesquite is
often part of a brushy overstory composed of Ashe juniper (<i>Juniperus</i>  <i>ashei</i>),
redberry juniper (<i>J. pinchotii</i>), Texas persimmon, live oak (<i>Q. virginiana</i>),
sandpaper oak (<i>Q. pungens</i>. var. <i>vaseyana</i>),
or post oak (<i>Q. stellata</i>) [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>]. Grasses in these
communities include curly mesquite, threeawns, sideoats grama, hairy tridens (<i>Erinoneuron pilosum</i>),
tussock grass, red grama (<i>Bouteloua trifida</i>), and sedges (<i>Carex</i>  spp.)
[<a href="#118">118</a>].</p>

<p>High Plains of northwestern Texas and the Oklahoma
  Panhandle: These areas were once characteristically free of trees and shrubs,
but honey mesquite
  now dominates many areas. Brush associates include lotebush, agarito (<i>Berberis
trifoliolata</i>), plains prickly-pear (<i>Opuntia polyacantha</i>), soapweed
  yucca (<i>Yucca glauca</i>), cholla (<i>Opuntia</i> spp.), and redberry
  juniper. Associated grasses include buffalograss,
  sideoats grama, tobosagrass, and little bluestem [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>].<p>
  
  <p>East-central Texas: Honey mesquite is often found
  in post oak (<i>Quercus stellata</i>) savannas. Common associates in these
  savannas include blackjack oak (<i>Q. marilandica</i>), water oak (<i>Q. nigra</i>),
  sugarberry (<i>Celtis laevigata</i>), honey-locust (<i>Gleditsia triacanthos</i>),
  hawthorn (<i>Crataegus </i>spp.), common persimmon (<i>Diospyros virginiana</i>),
  eastern redcedar (<i>Juniperus virginiana</i>), gum bumelia (<i>Bumelia
  lanuginosa</i>), skunkbush sumac (<i>Rhus trilobata</i>), and winged elm (<i>Ulmus
  alata</i>) [<a href="#151">151</a>].</p>

<p>Western honey mesquite communities: Drainageways in the Mojave and Sonoran deserts are the primary habitat for
western honey mesquite. In these habitats western honey mesquite is commonly
associated with quailbush (<i>Atriplex lentiformis</i>), palo verde (<i>Cercidium
floridum</i>), desert willow (<i>Chilopsis linearis</i>), Fremont cottonwood (<i>Populus fremontii</i>),
saltcedar (<i>Tamarix ramosissima</i>), and Goodding willow (<i>Salix gooddingii</i>)
[<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>]. More information is provided in &quot;Vegetation types&quot;
below.</p>

<p>Riparian habitats: Honey mesquite often occurs in
  riparian habitats in either pure stands or
  mixed with other species. Pure stands typically are many-aged and occur along the outer
  floodplain as honey mesquite is not particularly flood tolerant [<a href="#145">145</a>].
In riparian honey mesquite communities, often called bosques, the plants' growth
form is more arborescent, growing up to approximately 50 feet (15 m) tall [<a href="#60">60</a>]. In riparian
  woodlands dominated by junipers, oaks, Texas persimmon, netleaf hackberry (<i>Celtis
  reticulata</i>), cedar-elm (<i>Ulmus crassifolia</i>), or Berlandier ash (<i>Fraxinus
  berlandiearana</i>), honey mesquite is often scattered with densities ranging
  from 12 to 24 plants per acre (30-60/ha.) [<a href="#175">175</a>,<a href="#183">183</a>,<a href="#184">184</a>].&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Honey mesquite is a deciduous, thorny shrub or small tree exhibiting a high
degree of variation in growth form. The three most common forms are: 1) a
single-stemmed tree reaching 20 to 40 feet (6-12 m) in height, with crooked,
drooping branches, 2) an erect, multiple-stemmed bush or small tree, often 10 to
15 feet (3-4.6 m) tall, and 3) a decumbent or running bush found on deep sandy
soils [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>]. The largest trees are often found along water courses or
floodplains where the deep root system has access to year-round water [<a href="#115">115</a>]. All mesquites have a strong tendency
for apical dominance and a well-developed crown [<a href="#129">129</a>]. Undisturbed trees
therefore develop into single-stemmed trees. If the aboveground growth is
damaged or removed, such as by freezing weather, drought, fire, trampling,
browsing, cutting, or herbicide treatment, dormant buds located on the underground stem initiate new
growth, resulting in the many-stemmed growth form [<a href="#61">61</a>]. On the Rolling Plains of
north-central Texas, 27 year-old plants within a fenced exclosure ranged from
0.7 to 4.9 feet (0.2-1.5 m) tall [<a href="#155">155</a>]. Thus small plants that are decades old may be mistaken for seedlings.
Thorns
may be 1 to over 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) long and generally occur singly on young
branches [<a href="#75">75</a>]. The flowers are in a raceme [<a href="#178">178</a>]. The flattened, straight, or
curved legume-type pods are 4 to 8 inches (10-20 cm) long and occur in
drooping clusters [<a href="#178">178</a>]. The seeds are oval, 0.2 inch (5 mm)
wide, 0.28 inch (7 mm) long, and 0.08 inch (2 mm) thick [<a href="#125">125</a>].

<p>Honey mesquite's root system is well adapted to dry
climates (during and shortly after seedling establishment, the rate of root
growth exceeds
that of shoot growth [<a href="#163">163</a>]). Honey mesquite is a facultative phreatophyte which
extracts moisture from a large volume of soil through a well-developed root
system [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#171">171</a>]. Honey mesquite's taproot
commonly reaches depths of 40 feet (12 m) when subsurface water is available
[<a href="#63">63</a>], though a taproot 190 feet (58 m) deep has been observed [<a href="#163">163</a>]. In areas where the soil is
shallow,
where water does not penetrate deeply, or where a distinct calcium carbonate
layer is present, the taproot seldom extends more than 3 to 6 feet (1-2 m), and
an extensive system of lateral roots often extends up to 60 feet (18 m) away from the
plant base [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#163">163</a>]. Lateral roots of a 19.7 foot (6 m) tall honey mesquite
tree excavated on the Rolling Plains of north-central Texas were concentrated in
the upper 1 foot (0.3 m) of the soil profile [<a href="#81">81</a>]. Similarly,
Sosebee and Dahl [<a href="#162">162</a>] reported that most active lateral roots are in the
upper 2.5 feet (0.75 m) of soil.&nbsp; Sprouting from lateral roots is common [<a href="#81">81</a>]. These adaptations allow honey
mesquite to retain most leaves in all but the most severe droughts.
</p>

<p>As a legume, honey mesquite is capable of housing N<sub>2</sub>-fixing bacteria in nodes along its roots; it is also commonly heavily colonized
by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [<a href="#14">14</a>]. Mesquites obtain about half of
their nitrogen from symbiotic bacteria housed in root nodules [<a href="#108">108</a>].
Deloach [<a href="#47">47</a>] commented that nodes are rarely seen in honey mesquite but that the nodulation process is likely under multifactorial control and may
not always be observable. Rundel [<a href="#148">148</a>] found that in the Sonora Desert of California, honey mesquite may fix up
to 66 lbs/ acre/ year. An nitrate accretion rate of 90 lbs/ acre/
year was observed for 10 years in California below a western honey
mesquite stand [<a href="#67">67</a>]. Honey mesquite, though
potentially detrimental to competitive grasses, also facilitates plant
growth by increasing soil organic matter content and nitrogen status [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].
</p>

<p>
Maximum ages that plants attain is unclear. Near Amarillo, Texas, the maximum
age of plants within a stand of multi-stemmed honey mesquites ranged from 40 to
110 years [<a href="#64">64</a>]. On the Rio Grande Plains of Texas, Archer [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>] found that 89%
to 93% of honey mesquite plants were less than 100 years old, and the maximum
age of plants sampled was 172 to 217 years.&nbsp;

REGENERATION PROCESSES:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT">
Breeding system:</font>  Honey mesquite flowers have both pistils
and stamens [<a href="#150">150</a>].<br><br>

<font face="Bell MT">
Pollination:</font>   As is typical of insect-pollinated plants, honey mesquite
flowers develop simultaneously with the leaves, are high in nectar, and are
scented. Honey mesquite is pollinated primarily by bees. At least
160 species of bees are associated with mesquites in the American Southwest. Although mesquite inflorescences contain hundreds of flowers, only a few fruits
develop per inflorescence.&nbsp; Most flowers are pollinated by numerous insect
visitors, but self abortion prevents most ovules from maturing. This ensures
that adequate resources are available for the fruits that do develop [<a href="#160">160</a>].&nbsp;<br><br>

<font face="Bell MT">
Seed production:</font>  Honey mesquite plants generally produce seed by 3 years
of age [<a href="#75">75</a>].
Several seeds are encased within an indehiscent fruit. The reproductive potential
of honey mesquite is often greatly reduced by seed-feeding insects, but honey mesquite produces pods in
such abundance that numerous viable seeds are still produced [<a href="#103">103</a>]. Insects
using flowers (leaf-footed bugs and thrips) reduced pod production from a mean
of 131 pods per tree on insecticide-sprayed trees to 97 pods per tree on
unsprayed trees in western Texas. Bruchid beetles (weevils) are dependent on
mesquite pods. In a southern California study, western honey mesquite had an
average of 12 seeds per pod, of which an average of 5 were destroyed by bruchid
beetles [<a href="#133">133</a>].<br><br>

<font face="Bell MT">
Seed dispersal:</font>  Pods are eaten and then dispersed by domestic and wild
animals. When honey mesquite pods were fed to livestock, 97%, 79%, and 16% of
the seeds passed through the digestive tracts of horses, yearling steers, and
ewes, respectively, with the greatest number of seeds passing through between 42
and 60 hours after consumption [<a href="#64">64</a>]. In southern Texas, Brown and Archer [<a href="#33">33</a>] found
honey mesquite seedlings in 75% of cattle dung piles sampled in September, but no
seedlings on sites fenced to exclude cattle. On sites without cattle, no seeds
were found away from parent trees. Because it takes days for seeds to pass
through the digestive tracts of domestic animals, seeds are dispersed great
distances. Mesquite seedlings commonly germinate from uneaten seeds in rodent caches. Floods are also a common means of seed dispersal [<a href="#69">69</a>].<br><br> 

<font face="Bell MT">
Seed banking:</font>  Most seeds of a closely related species, velvet mesquite,
germinated within 3 years after pod
segments were buried 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the soil surface of an Arizona site.
About 35%, 9%, and 1% of germination occurred 1, 2, and 3 years after
planting. Honey mesquite seeds in dry storage can remain viable for decades. Sixty percent
viability&nbsp; was reported for 44-year-old velvet mesquite seeds taken from
herbarium specimens [<a href="#171">171</a>].&nbsp;<br><br>

<font face="Bell MT">Germination:</font>  Honey mesquite seeds contain a
protective endocarp. Scarification of this hard seed coat must occur before the
seed can germinate. Scarification occurs naturally when seeds pass through the
digestive system of animals. Seeds remaining in pods not
consumed by animals remain dormant until the seed coat is broken by weathering
or fire [<a href="#75">75</a>]. Under laboratory conditions,
scarified honey mesquite seeds placed on
moistened filter paper germinated in about 7 hours at 93 degrees Fahrenheit (33
°C) [<a href="#154">154</a>].<br><br> 

<font face="Bell MT">Seedling establishment/growth:</font>  Honey mesquite seeds must be
covered with a small amount of soil or dung for seedlings to establish.
Seeds that germinate on the soil surface usually die. When honey mesquite seeds were planted at various soil depths,
emergence rates were greatest for seeds planted between 0.2 and 0.6 inch
(0.5-1.5 cm) from the soil surface. No seedlings emerged when seeds were planted
more than 2 inches (5 cm) deep [<a href="#154">154</a>].&nbsp; Field studies in southern Texas found that
under
natural conditions honey mesquite seedlings emerged from dung both fall and
spring following peaks in rainfall. When honey mesquite pods were fed to
livestock 82%, 69%, and 25% of the seeds that passed through the digestive
tracts of horses, yearling steers, and ewes, respectively, germinated [<a href="#64">64</a>]. Kramp and
others [<a href="#104">104</a>] tested the effect of coyote,&nbsp; cow,
and deer scat on 1- year seedling survival. Ten percent survived in coyote and cow
manure, 31% survived in deer scat, but there was a much higher average number of
initial seedlings in cattle manure (7 per manure unit) than in coyote and deer scat (3 per
unit). Kramp and others [<a href="#105">105</a>] found that 27% of seedlings survived 1 year in clipped
plots compared to 9.4% in unclipped plots (p=0.14). In central Texas, establishment of honey mesquite seedlings from sown seed was
high under several different clipping regimes on both grazed and protected
areas. However, on grasslands protected from grazing for several years,
seedling establishment was 7 to 8 times greater when the grasses were clipped
monthly to 10 inches (25 cm) than when not clipped [<a href="#34">34</a>]. Dense grass cover can
reduce honey mesquite seedling establishment because seedlings emerge and establish with a 50%
reduction in solar radiation, but when solar radiation is reduced by 75%,
survival of seedlings is reduced [<a href="#152">152</a>].

<p><font face="Bell MT">
Asexual regeneration:</font>  Honey mesquite plants can sprout from numerous perennial
dormant buds located along rhizomes or the upper part of the root [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].
Dormant buds can
occur up to 12 inches (30 cm) below the soil surface on older trees but are most
commonly concentrated along the basal portion of the underground stem in a zone
2 to 6 inches (5-15 cm) below the soil surface [<a href="#62">62</a>]. When aboveground growth is
damaged or killed, new sprouts arise from the bud zone. If aboveground growth is
destroyed or damaged during a dormant period, sprouts arise the following spring
and often flower during their first growing season. If
aboveground growth is damaged during the wet part of the growing season when
root carbohydrate levels are high, plants resprout rapidly but do not flower
until the following growing season. If destroyed during the dry portion of the
growing season when root carbohydrate levels are low, sprouting is delayed or
slow, sometimes for 3 to 5 years [<a href="#163">163</a>].

<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SITE CHARACTERISTICS">
SITE CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Honey mesquite grows on a wide variety of sites and soil types in the Chihuahuan
Desert and southern Great Plains. Honey mesquite was less common and more
restricted to drainages prior to European-American settlement and livestock
introduction. It has
invaded grasslands as a result of overgrazing and reduced fire frequency [<a href="#50">50</a>]. On upland sites
it often invades grasslands where it forms shrubby thickets. On some sites it
occurs as scattered plants forming mesquite savannas, but on others its
persistence has led to many grasslands being converted to &quot;brushy
ranges&quot; or thorny scrublands [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>]. Johnston [<a href="#98">98</a>] describes
the &quot;plains&quot; of southern Texas as being covered by more or less dense
growths of shrubs and low trees. Density of mature plants can range from 50 to
over 1,500 plants per acre (124-3,716/ ha.) [<a href="#62">62</a>]. Up to 3,000 seedlings per acre
(7,500/ ha.) have been observed in northern Texas [<a href="#156">156</a>].

<p>In the Mojave and Sonoran deserts, rainfall is
generally insufficient to provide adequate surface soil moisture for western
honey mesquite to survive. Under these extremely arid conditions, western honey
mesquite is a phreatophyte, typically occupying alkali sinks, outwash plains,
dry lakes, oases, arroyos, or riverbanks, where plants
have access to permanent underground water [<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#158">158</a>]. Plants are
much less common outside washes [<a href="#102">102</a>].
</p>

<p>
Soils: Mesquites are adapted to most soil types, but in Texas, honey mesquite
tends to grow best on medium to fine-textured soils. In areas of western Texas
and southern New Mexico, honey mesquite grows on hummocky sand dunes [<a href="#44">44</a>].
Honey mesquite can grow rapidly to keep photosynthetic and reproductive
structures above rising sand level [<a href="#110">110</a>]. On the Jornada Experimental Range near
Las Cruces, New Mexico, honey
mesquite is found on all soil types including loamy sand, sandy loam, calcareous
silt loam, noncalcareous silt loam, gravelly sand loam, deep sandy loam, and
calcareous clay [<a href="#37">37</a>].
</p>

<p>
Elevation: Honey mesquite generally grows below 4,500 feet (1,387 m) in elevation [<a href="#64">64</a>]. Western
honey mesquite's elevational range in California is from
197 feet (60 m) below sea level to 3,575 feet (1,090 m) above sea level [<a href="#88">88</a>]; in Utah
western honey mesquite grows between 2,197 feet (670 m) and 3,838 feet (1,170
m) [<a href="#181">181</a>]. In Arizona, western honey mesquite grows primarily below 5,000 feet
(1500 m) [<a href="#102">102</a>]. In New Mexico, the typical variety of honey mesquite grows primarily between 3,000 and 5,000
feet (900-1500 m) [<a href="#116">116</a>].
</p>

<p>
Climate: In arid areas where annual rainfall is less than 6 inches (150 mm),
honey mesquite is typically found along drainageways. It appears to be best
adapted to uplands where annual rainfall reaches 15 to 20 inches (380-510 mm) and
may be found on sites where annual rainfall exceeds 30 inches (760 mm) [<a href="#151">151</a>].
Honey mesquite is restricted northward and is limited to where the average annual minimum temperature is above -5 degrees
Fahrenheit (-20 °C) and the frost-free growing season is 200 days or
more [<a href="#64">64</a>].
</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SUCCESSIONAL STATUS">
SUCCESSIONAL STATUS:</a>
</span>
<br />

The successional pattern of grasslands that have
become dominated by honey mesquite on the Rio Grande Plains of southern Texas
has been from grassland to savanna to woodland. After colonizing grassland
sites, a lone honey mesquite plant establishes a circular cluster of other woody
plants within 10 to 15 years [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>]. Honey mesquite apparently aids the
establishment of other shrubs by attracting birds which disperse seeds of other
woody species [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>]. On study sites at the Texas Agricultural Experiment
Station near Alice, Texas, a lone honey mesquite plant was found in 80% of all
upland clusters of other shrubs. Woody plant clusters generally ranged from 3.3 to 132
feet (1-40 m) in diameter and contained 1 to 15 woody species. As new clusters
are formed and old clusters expand and coalesce, a woodland is eventually
formed. In about 25% of the clusters, the original lone honey mesquite had died.
Death usually occurred before age 30 [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>]. Invasion and establishment of
honey mesquite in grasslands on the High Plains of western Texas facilitated the
establishment of redberry juniper in much the same manner as described above
[<a href="#122">122</a>]. Drought also appears to be a factor in the spread of honey
mesquite. Honey mesquite seedlings often establish on areas where black
grama cover has been reduced and gaps were created from the death of many plants
following drought [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>]. Western honey mesquite's deep
root system increases its ability to compete with black grama on sandy soils
during droughts [<a href="#37">37</a>].

<p>The geographic range of honey mesquite has probably changed very little in the
past 300 to 500 years, but the abundance of mesquite within this range has
increased [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>]. Some researchers state that range fires were very
important in controlling honey mesquite before the introduction of cattle, while
others believe that honey mesquite was rare on grasslands because of limited
seed dispersal. Johnston [<a href="#98">98</a>] states that where mesquite has dominated former
grasslands, it was probably originally present but stunted by repeated
fire.&nbsp; Fire effects research supports this theory, demonstrating that honey
mesquite is very fire tolerant when only 3 years old [<a href="#190">190</a>]. Plants may be
top-killed by fire, but most resprout. Thus prior to grazing by livestock,
repeated grassland fires probably only killed mesquite seedlings and a few other
individuals but kept most plants low in stature and prevented many from
producing seed.
</p>

<p>
Dispersal of mesquite seeds was likely greater during the Pleistocene when
browsing megafauna, such as camelids, stegomastodons, notoungulates, and
edentates were present [<a href="#129">129</a>]. With the introduction
of livestock by European settlers, mesquite invaded grasslands as cattle
transported seed from plants which were primarily found in draws and
drainageways. Brown and Archer [<a href="#33">33</a>] state that seed dispersal was probably the most important factor in honey
mesquite's increase. Reduced fire frequencies due to overgrazing would have
allowed honey mesquite plants that were previously suppressed and kept low in
stature to reach maturity and thus produce more seed for livestock to disperse
away from the parent plants.
</p>

<p>
Fire exclusion has facilitated spread of honey mesquite. See the &quot;Fire
Ecology&quot; section of this summary for further information.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
In the Mesilla basin of southern New Mexico and
northern Mexico there are extensive dune fields, some of which predate European-American
settlement, and some that have been transformed from semidesert
grasslands during this century. It is theorized that conversion to dunelands is a
self-sustaining process which leads to further desertification [<a href="#147">147</a>]. With heavy grazing, drought, and competition
with honey mesquite for soil moisture, much of the grass cover on these sandy
sites was depleted. The loss of grass cover led to wind erosion and the
formation of dunes around honey mesquite plants. The multi-stemmed growth
form of honey mesquite, which characteristically occurs on sandy soils, entraps
drifting sands [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].
</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT">
SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Spring bud break in honey mesquite can vary by as much as 6 weeks from year to
year. Bud break is dependent upon both photo- and thermal periods and rarely
occurs until after the last spring frost has passed or the photoperiod exceeds
11.5 hours [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#163">163</a>]. Honey mesquite apparently has a cold requirement that must
be met before bud burst occurs. Goen and Dahl [<a href="#70">70</a>] found that the higher the
number of consecutive days with minimum temperatures below 30 degrees Fahrenheit
(-1 °C) during January 15 to February 14, the earlier spring bud break
occurs. They give equations for predicting honey mesquite bud break based on
minimum winter temperatures. Other researchers state that honey mesquite bud
burst begins in the spring when the soil warms to 64 degrees Fahrenheit (18 °C)
[<a href="#124">124</a>]. Plants from northern populations generally exhibit later
bud burst than plants from southern populations [<a href="#120">120</a>].

<p>Following bud burst, twig elongation and leaf growth
are rapid and generally completed in about 6 weeks [<a href="#43">43</a>]. New foliage is
generally very dense following a wet spring and fall, but less foliage is
produced if the preceding spring and fall were dry [<a href="#163">163</a>]. Inflorescences emerge
in the spring with the leaves. By the time the leaves are fully expanded,
miniature fruit pods have begun to develop [<a href="#43">43</a>]. It takes 2 to 3 months for the
fruits to mature, and by late summer they fall from the plant. More than 1 fruit crop per year is possible but uncommon. Sometimes a wet period late in the
flowering season causes a flush of new growth, producing new leaves and flowers
and, consequently, a 2nd fruit crop. Flowering may occur up to 4 times in 1 growing season. Flower production
varies with amount of
available soil moisture. Heavy flowering and fruiting often occur when soil
moisture is low; high soil moisture at the time of flowering appears to suppress
fruit production [<a href="#129">129</a>].
</p>

<p>Leaf drop generally occurs in November or December
and is often initiated by a killing frost or leaf removal by insects [<a href="#43">43</a>].
Plants from northern populations show early dormancy and are more resistant to
freezing damage than plants from southern populations [<a href="#134">134</a>]. Seasonal
development of honey mesquite plants in western Texas was documented as follows

<br />

<font face="Bell MT">

Fire adaptations:</font> When the aboveground portion of honey mesquite is damage by
fire, regeneration occurs by sprouting from lateral roots in the upper 1
foot (0.3 m) of soil and establishing from seed [<a href="#81">81</a>]. Mature
plants contain numerous, dormant buds on the upper 12 inches (30 cm) of the
taproots [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>] where they are insulated from the heat of most fires. Following top-kill by fire,
numerous sprouts arise from the underground buds. Even 6- month- old seedlings have sufficiently developed
underground stem buds to allow plants to survive &quot;cool&quot; burns [<a href="#190">190</a>]. The data of
Ansley and others [<a href="#10">10</a>] suggest that bark on older stems is often thick enough to
protect the phloem from damage; when top-kill does occur, it is more commonly
via damage at canopy height. Mortality is low
in honey mesquite, particularly in lowland areas where root systems are well
developed [<a href="#188">188</a>,<a href="#190">190</a>]. In riparian communities of the Colorado
River, however, where western honey mesquite grows with saltcedar, frequent fire will
likely lead to a decline of western honey mesquite and increase of saltcedar
because the latter grows much faster [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>].<p class="subframeContent">
Numerous wild and domestic animals consume and disperse honey mesquite seed
[<a href="#104">104</a>]. Little is known about honey mesquite seed banks, seed longevity in the
field, or the importance of seed banks in recovery after fire [<a href="#171">171</a>]. Seed from off-site honey
mesquite could potentially be transported to burned areas by
animals. Johnston [<a href="#97">97</a>] states that where mesquite dominates brushy ranges,
the successional changes may not have been from mesquite-free grasslands to
brushlands, but from low stature mesquite grasslands to brushlands. Brown and Archer [<a href="#33">33</a>] hypothesize that
since mesquites evolved with browsing Pleistocene megafauna, low densities
of honey mesquite in southwestern grasslands prior to European-American introduction
of livestock
resulted primarily from limited seed dispersal after the Pleistocene [<a href="#129">129</a>].

<p>
<font face="Bell MT">
Fire regimes:</font> More is known about historic fire regimes in communities of the
typical variety of honey mesquite than in western honey mesquite communities.
Western honey mesquite occurs in the Mojave and Sonora deserts; not much is known of their fire histories. It
is assumed that fuels in these desert were so discontinuous in the past that fire was
infrequent [<a href="#121">121</a>]. In former desert grassland communities that honey mesquite has
invaded in southeastern Arizona, southern New Mexico, and southwestern Texas,
fires occurred at &quot;rather frequent intervals&quot; prior to livestock
introduction [<a href="#90">90</a>]. McPherson [<a href="#121">121</a>] states
that it is difficult to know detailed fire history in desert grasslands but
indirect evidence, primarily accounts of European- American settlers, suggests that fires occurred at least
every 10 years. Also, based on known rates of velvet mesquite establishment and
growth in grasslands, McPherson [<a href="#121">121</a>] concluded that fires had to have occurred
at 7 to 10 year intervals to prevent its establishment. Using a similar
analysis, Paysen and others [<a href="#135">135</a>] concluded that the likely historic average
fire return interval in mesquite savannas was 10 years. There were large numbers of livestock in some areas of the desert grassland as early as 1880, and
fire frequency was reduced due to lack of fuel rather than fire suppression
[<a href="#90">90</a>].</p>

<p>Honey mesquite also grows in dune fields that, because of low fuel loading,
have seldom if ever burned. An example of such a habitat is the Wild Horse Desert of southern Texas, a sandy
rangeland where fuel is discontinuous and honey mesquite grows 15 to 20 feet
(4.6-6.1 m) tall [<a href="#90">90</a>].</p>

<p>Fire regimes for plant communities
and ecosystems in which honey mesquite occurs are presented below. More
information regarding fire regimes and fire ecology of these communities can be
found in the 'Fire Ecology and Adaptations' section of the FEIS species summary
for the plant community or ecosystem dominants below.</p>

IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT:</a>

<br />

Fire mortality is usually low in honey mesquite. Following most range fires, honey
mesquite is top-killed and then resprouts. Near Vernon, Texas winter fires top-killed 72% of honey mesquite and reduced their canopy by 95%
but did not cause any whole-plant mortality. Honey mesquite in a honey mesquite/
tobosagrass savanna in western Texas
was 90% top-killed and had 10% whole-plant mortality. Honey mesquite in silver bluestem, red
threeawn (<i>Aristida longiseta</i>), buffalograss, vine mesquite, plains
bristle grass, and sand dropseed grassland in western Texas experienced 76% top-kill and
11% mortality. In southern Texas, in an acacia (<i>Acacia</i>   spp.),
buffalograss, plains bristle grass community, honey mesquite had 72% top-kill and 10%
mortality after a late summer fire. Of the herbaceous vegetation on burned and unburned sites, there
was little difference in basal density, species
composition, or number of dead plants [<a href="#29">29</a>].

<p>There are conflicting findings regarding the relative
impacts of fuels and weather conditions on honey mesquite damage by fire. At the
Wagoner Estate near Vernon, Texas, Ansley and Lucia [<a href="#6">6</a>] compared 2 plots: plot 1 had 4,085 lbs/ac of fine fuel and
plot 2 had 1,861 lbs/ac of fine fuel. On plot 1, 72% of honey mesquite was top-killed
and there
was a 95% reduction in total canopy; on plot 2, honey mesquite was 15%
top-killed and its total canopy cover was reduced 42%.</p>

<p> The influence of
mesquite size and fuel loading on fire
mortality of velvet mesquite, a closely related species, has been thoroughly studied [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>]. Following a June fire on the Santa
Rita Experimental Range in Arizona, velvet mesquite suffered 25% mortality in an
area with 4,480 pounds per acre of herbaceous fuel dominated by the exotic
Lehman lovegrass (<i>Eragrostis lehmanniana</i>), but in areas with 2,200 pounds per
acre of herbaceous fuel dominated by black grama, velvet mesquite
suffered only 8% mortality [<a href="#41">41</a>]. Prescribed burning on the Santa Rita
Experimental Range generally resulted in about 50% mortality of young velvet
mesquite that were less than 0.5 inch (1.25 cm) in basal stem diameter, but only
8% to 15% mortality of plants that were greater than 0.5 inch (1.25 cm) in basal
diameter [<a href="#69">69</a>]. One experimental burn on the Wagoner Estate near Vernon, Texas
showed that honey mesquite top-kill was more correlated with relative humidity and air
temperature than with amounts of total or fine fuel
[<a href="#11">11</a>]. Another detailed fire study was undertaken on the Welder Wildlife
Refuge of southern Texas. Fire peak temperature and temperature duration at canopy
level were found to influence mesquite top-kill more than extreme temperatures
at the ground level [<a href="#10">10</a>].</p>

<p>
Using a propane burner and temperature control to simulate natural fire, Wright and others [<a href="#190">190</a>] found that young honey mesquite plants are very susceptible to
&quot;moderate- severity&quot; fires until they reach 1.5 years of age, moderately susceptible
at 2.5 years, and very tolerant after 3.5 years. In the study, the percent mortality
(after 15 months) of
various ages of individually burned young honey mesquite plants was observed
after 15 months after exposure; results are summarized below :

<a name="PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE">
PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:</a>
</span>
<br />

The response of honey mesquite following fire depends on the amount of damage the
fire inflicted on the plant. Plants may initiate new growth from either buds
within the crown or from underground buds on the taproot or lateral roots [<a href="#73">73</a>] following fire. Following low-severity fires
which only partially top-kill plants, mesquites often sprout from axillary buds
on branches [<a href="#41">41</a>]. In a low fuel load (1160 lbs/ac)
fire near Encinal, Texas honey mesquite had recovered to 106% of preburn canopy
cover in 2 years, but still had 14% less canopy cover than honey mesquite in the
unburned control plot [<a href="#78">78</a>]. Following fires that result
in complete top-kill, plants may survive by producing numerous basal stem
sprouts, by establishing from seed, or by sprouting from lateral roots or the
upper part of the taproot [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].&nbsp; 

<p>Winter burns often allow regrowth from buds in the
crown because fire severity is not great enough to cause complete top-kill. Though percent canopy cover of honey mesquite recovers quickly
following these low-severity fires, stand structure becomes more like a savanna
than a thicket, which is the most common structure following a disturbance that
causes a high rate of complete top-kill [<a href="#7">7</a>].</p>

FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Prescribed burning has not been effective in controlling honey mesquite because
of the species' fire survival strategies. However, plants that have been
recently top-killed by fire, drought, or herbicides are more susceptible to fire
mortality [<a href="#187">187</a>]. Fire has been used to kill up to 27% of large mesquite
trees previously top-killed with herbicide [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>]. Fire has
also been used to fell standing dead stems of herbicide-treated mesquites [<a href="#30">30</a>]. On grasslands in good condition with low densities of honey
mesquite, repeated prescribed fires may keep honey mesquite low in stature but
will probably kill only a few seedlings [<a href="#121">121</a>]. 

<p>
On some sites honey mesquite has reduced
the native grass cover to the extent that there is now insufficient fuel to
carry anything more than a &quot;spotty&quot; or &quot;cool&quot; fire [<a href="#61">61</a>]. In general, fire will not carry in southwestern grasslands unless
there is a minimum of 600 pounds per acre (654 kg/ha) of herbaceous fuels.
When there is less than 892 pounds per acre (1,000 kg/ha), a wind speed of 8
miles per hour (12.8 km/hr) is needed to carry the fire [<a href="#189">189</a>]. 
</p>

<p>Once honey mesquite stands are established, use of
stand- replacement fires can cause only minimal reduction in honey
mesquite density; regrowth is both rapid and of a thicket-like structure, that
is commonly more detrimental to forage production than the pre-burn stand
structure [<a href="#7">7</a>]. Paysen and others [<a href="#135">135</a>]
recommend that managers use low-severity fires so that apical dominance is
maintained and sprouting is minimized. Ansley and
others [<a href="#7">7</a>] also support
this strategy and recommend winter fires instead of summer fires except when
fuel loads are low. The Texas Extension Service recommends the following
conditions for prescribed burning (in intervals of 5 to 10 years) in honey
mesquite-tobosagrass communities: wind of 6 to 15 mph (10-25 kph), relative
humidity between 20% and 60%, temperature between 45 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit
(7.2- 21 °C), during late January, February, or early March [<a href="#2">2</a>]. 
</p>

<p> It is well-documented that fire can be used as a
management tool in tobosagrass and other mesic honey mesquite habitats
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#135">135</a>]. In shortgrass communities, according to Wright [<a href="#186">186</a>],
fire cannot be &quot;recommended as a tool to control shrubs or increase grass
production.&quot; In these communities fire, particularly in dry years, can harm
black grama and other grasses, thereby increasing the competitive ability of western
honey mesquite [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>].&nbsp; 
</p>

<p> Interactions of fire and herbicide effects: Britton and Wright [<a href="#30">30</a>] observed 24%
mortality in a stand of honey mesquite (20 miles south of Colorado City, Texas) that had been top-killed by herbicides 4
years prior to burning. On the Rolling Plains of Texas, 32% of
honey mesquite were killed by fires occurring in March or April soon after a 2,4,5-T
herbicide treatment. These mortality rates were unusually high and were attributed to dead foliage and stems that increased fire
severity locally. Repeated winter or
summer fires did not achieve root-kill greater than 4%. Though there had been an
herbicide (2,4,5-T) treatment 17 to 26 years prior to the fire, there were not many dead
stems to increase fire intensity and whole-plant mortality [<a href="#190">190</a>]. Three to six foot tall (1-2 m) honey mesquite plants, which had survived
herbicide (2,4,5-T) spraying 7 years earlier, were top-killed by a late March prescribed
fire in western Texas. Most plants survived by sprouting from belowground buds.
Resprouts ranged from a few inches to over 4 feet (1.2 m) tall 6 months after
the fire [<a href="#80">80</a>].</p>

<p>
Following controlled spring burning of honey mesquite plants in southwestern
Texas that had survived application of 2,4,5-T 4 years earlier, honey mesquite
plants were top-killed. Resprouts grew 17 inches (43.2 cm) tall within 4
months [<a href="#132">132</a>]. Six years of postfire growth is summarized below; data are means
of 15 replicates:

Another study of fire effects on honey mesquite was undertaken in the High Plains of Texas near Colorado
City. Fire
was prescribed on upland and riparian areas. The season during which fire
occurred was not specified but honey mesquite were physiologically active at the
time. On bottom lands there was no mortality of
large honey mesquite even though they had been sprayed with herbicides
(2,4,5-T); well-developed root
systems allowed resprouting the following growing season.&nbsp; On upland sites
mortality was up to 50%. Percent mortality was measured up to 5 years after burning,
showing that fire-induced mortality is sometimes not immediate. Insect and rodent
damage following fire damage causes indirect fire morality. Results and burning
conditions were as
follows [<a href="#190">190</a>].</p>

Ninemile
site, mesquite were 6.6 and 13.1 feet (2- 4 m) high and had stem basal
diameters ranging from 2 to 4.7 inches (5- 12 cm). At the Y ranch, stems were
6.6 to 9.9 feet (2-3 m) high and had stems between 1.2 and 3.1 inches(3-8 cm) in
basal diameter. The understory of the Ninemile site is dominated by a mixture of cool- and warm-
season grasses including Texas wintergrass (<i>Nassella leucotricha</i>), Texas
bluegrass (<i>Poa arachnifera</i>), Japanese brome (<i>Bromus japonicus</i>),
buffalograss (<i>Buchloe dactyloides</i>), and sand dropseed (<i>Sporobolus </i><i>cryptandrus</i>). The Y Ranch grasses include buffalo grass (<i>Buchloe
dactyloides</i>), tobosagrass (<i>Pleuraphis
mutica</i>), and sideoats grama (<i>Bouteloua curtipendula</i>).

Fires occurred during late January to mid-March when honey mesquite was
physiologically inactive and leafless. Honey mesquites on the site grew in multi-stemmed
clumps as the result of top-kill by herbicide treatments (herbicide
prescriptions were
not given). On the Ninemile site
herbicide top-kill occurred approximately 20 years prior to prescribed fire. Honey mesquite on the Y
experimental ranch had been treated with herbicides approximately 12 years prior
to prescribed fire.

FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES:</a>
</span>
<br />

Moisture content of honey mesquite stems was high and there was little dead mesquite wood to increase
fire severity. Most damage to stems was by scorching rather than by combustion.
Top-kill (including all sites) ranged from 11% to 94%, and percent foliage remaining on
non-top-killed trees ranged from 4% to 100%. Where fire did not top-kill, it often burned the
lower part of the canopy giving the appearance of a browse line. No more than 1%
of honey mesquite on any site were root-killed; top-killed trees all resprouted
from the base. Of the fire temperature parameters, the strongest relation was
between top-kill and FTD100 between 3.25 and 9.75 feet (1-3 m), though there was
also a clear effect of FTD200 on top-kill between 39 and 117 inches (1-3 m) and FTD200
between 4 and 12 inches (10-30 cm). Top-kill was influenced more by the
conditions within the canopy than those at ground level even though fire
severity (peak temperature and duration) was lower at canopy height. The
authors concluded that top-kill occurs by convective heating rather than by
girdling stem bases. Branches are thought to be less
resistant because their bark is thinner and less dense.

<p>
 Of the fuel and weather
characteristics, air temperature, fine fuel moisture, and fine fuel amount all
influenced top-kill. The finding that air temperature had a dramatic effect on
top-kill is in contrast to the findings of Britton and Wright [<a href="#30">30</a>] who found
little correlation between top-kill and air temperature. Relative humidity was a
factor in top-kill and foliage loss only on the Y Ranch pastures; Ninemile was
thought to be less affected by the relative humidity because fine fuel there was
more green.</p>

<p>
 Conditions required for root-kill are much different than those
required for top-kill.&nbsp;High temperatures at the ground
level influence root-kill more than top-kill.&nbsp; Presented below are r<sup>2</sup> values for regressions between fuel, weather, fire
temperature, and fire temperature duration (FTD) variables and mesquite responses.</p>

<a name="FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS">
FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

 Ansley and others [<a href="#10">10</a>] mention that in most of Texas where mesquite is a management
issue, significant fire-induced whole-plant mortality is unreasonable to expect.
Factors, such as air temperature and humidity, that affect fire temperature peak
and duration at
canopy level are important considerations in prescribed fire planning. In this study
top-kill was more influenced by these factors than by fine fuel amounts. Deciding
which day to conduct burns can be as important in managing mesquite as
preparation made a year in advance such as grazing reduction to increase fine
fuel. Root kill did not occur much here, likely because mesic climate and
deep alluvial soils allowed extensive root development.&nbsp; Similarly, Wright
[<a href="#190">190</a>] found greater root kill from single winter fires on upland compared to lowland
sites.<br><br>

The authors also caution that maximizing fire
intensity to increase root-kill and top-kill may produce thorny, dense stands of
multi-stemmed plants similar to stands produced by herbicidal and
mechanical brush control methods. The authors state that &quot;an alternative to
this approach with fire may be needed for long-term sustainable mesquite
management in certain areas.&quot; The alternative approach suggested was that
prescribed fires be manipulated to reduce foliage without top-kill, thus
facilitating savanna development.

WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE:</a>

<br />

Honey mesquite wood is used chiefly for firewood. The wood is easily sawed and
split, is dry and heavy, ignites readily, and produces intense heat [<a href="#76">76</a>]. It is often the only fuelwood available in regions where it grows
[<a href="#178">178</a>]. Since 1982, the use of honey mesquite wood in the barbeque industry
has grown considerably in the United States [<a href="#52">52</a>]. Products made from honey mesquite include chips, chunks,
nuggets, sticks, and
charcoal briquettes [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>]. Western honey mesquite's primary use is firewood,
though locally it is also used for fenceposts and lumber. Charcoal is the main
product of western honey mesquite in Mexico; a large proportion of this is exported
to the United States [<a href="#65">65</a>].

<p>There has been an increased interest in using
honey mesquite wood in manufacturing furniture, flooring, and handcrafts. Manufacturers like the wood because it is easy to work with and
has unique grain patterns that make the finished products attractive [<a href="#109">109</a>].
The wood is strong, hard, straight grained, warp proof, colored varying
shades of orange and red, and has a low volumetric shrinkage (4-5%) [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>].
However, few trees attain commercial size and many have serious defects which
force craftsmen to pay high prices for mesquite lumber [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>]. Fiberboard and
chipboard have been made from honey mesquite but have not been marketed
commercially [<a href="#134">134</a>].
</p>

<p>Felker [<a href="#56">56</a>] states that with the current rate of
use of long straight honey mesquite lumber, all of which comes from unmanaged stands, cannot be
maintained without actively managing mesquite woodlands for the production of
lumber. On more productive woodlands, mesquite thickets can be thinned to
improve volume growth of some individuals while enhancing forage production for
livestock.

<a name="IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE">
IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE:</a>

<br />

The fruit of honey mesquite is valuable forage for livestock and wildlife.
Cattle, horses, domestic sheep and goats, mules, and burros eat large quantities
of the ripe fruit during summer and fall [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].&nbsp; Livestock often remove the fruit as high on the tree as they
can reach and eat fallen pods from the ground [<a href="#18">18</a>]. Though seeds are high in
protein little is digested and many pass through livestock digestive tracts
intact and viable [<a href="#64">64</a>]. Livestock do not consume the
foliage to any great extent [<a href="#115">115</a>]. Foliage consumption is high only during drought
years, especially in the early spring when other forage is sparse [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].
Most livestock consume mesquite (<i>Prosopis</i> spp.) flowers when available [<a href="#115">115</a>]. In some areas of Mexico, mesquite beans are collected, ground, and fed to
cattle [<a href="#48">48</a>]. Because of its abundance in Texas, honey mesquite wood has been
proposed as a roughage source for ruminants. Preliminary research indicates that
cattle weight gains are satisfactory when ozone or sulfur dioxide is used to
increase cellulose digestibility of&nbsp; honey
mesquite woodchips used as supplemental feed [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>].

<p>The fruit crop of honey mesquite is quite
predictable, annually providing an abundant and nutritious food source for
numerous wildlife species upon ripening in July and August [<a href="#103">103</a>]. Honey mesquite seeds form an important part of the diet of mice, kangaroo rats,
woodrats, chipmunks, ground squirrels, rock squirrels, cottontail,
skunks, quail, doves, ravens, the black-tailed prairie dog, black-tailed
jackrabbit, porcupine, raccoon, coyote, collared peccary, white-tailed deer,
mule deer, wild turkey, and mallard [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>,<a href="#177">177</a>,<a href="#179">179</a>]. Many species of
small rodents derive a large portion of their diet from mesquite seeds [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].
On the Jornada Experimental Range, these animals frequently store whole beans of
western honey mesquite in dens or caches. Honey mesquite
beans formed the bulk of stored food [<a href="#185">185</a>]. Mesquite flowers are eaten by
numerous bird species [<a href="#160">160</a>]. Many species of quail eat mesquite buds and flowers in the spring, and seeds during the fall and winter
[<a href="#176">176</a>]. Mesquite seeds often comprise 10 to 25% of the Gambel's and
scaled
quails' diets [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>]. In a southwestern Texas study, honey mesquite fruit
comprised 14.9% of the white-tailed deer summer diet, but deer use of any honey
mesquite parts during the rest of the year was minimal [<a href="#177">177</a>].
</p>

<p>Mesquite browse is generally not a very important
wildlife food source. Wild turkeys, round-tailed ground squirrels,
cottontails, and woodrats consume some leaves [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>]. Jackrabbits consume large
amounts of honey mesquite. In southwestern Texas, honey mesquite (primarily
leaves) comprised 11% and 19.9% of black-tailed jackrabbit diet during winter
and spring [<a href="#177">177</a>]. On the Jornada Experimental Range near Las Cruces, New Mexico,
jackrabbits often crop honey mesquite leaves, buds, and bark as high as they can
reach [<a href="#180">180</a>]. In this study, honey mesquite was 56% of the black-tailed jackrabbit
diet. Locally, mule deer consume large quantities of honey mesquite foliage, but this
may reflect a scarcity of other browse rather than a preference for honey mesquite
[<a href="#157">157</a>].
</p>

<p>Along the lower Colorado River on the border of
southern California, western honey mesquite is often infested with mesquite mistletoe (<i>Phoradendron
californicum</i>). Western honey mesquite communities often attract large
numbers of birds that feed on mistletoe fruit [<a href="#157">157</a>].</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="PALATABILITY">
PALATABILITY:</a>
</span>
<br />

The sweet, nutritious seed pods of honey mesquite are highly palatable to all
types of livestock and to numerous small and large wildlife species. For both
livestock and wildlife, the palatability of leaves and twigs is relatively low.
Livestock browse small amounts of leaves and twigs as they green up in the
spring, but honey mesquite browse is otherwise seldom eaten [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>]. Leaf
consumption may increase during drought years when other forage is lacking or
following a killing frost in the fall [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>]. 

<br><br>



<span class="subframeName">
<a name="NUTRITIONAL VALUE">
NUTRITIONAL VALUE:</a>
</span>
<br />

The sweet-tasting pods of honey mesquite are nutritious. The fruit's pericarp is
high in sugars and the seeds contain large amounts of protein. However, seeds
are largely indigestible, and many pass through large mammals' digestive tracts
intact and viable [<a href="#64">64</a>]. Honey mesquite fruit provide a good source of minerals
for herbivores [<a href="#191">191</a>]. Although not consumed by livestock or wildlife to any
great extent, the leaves are high in protein and contain large amounts of
nitrogen [<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>].

Honey mesquite provides cover for large wildlife species and shade for
livestock. Its invasion of grasslands has greatly increased the amount of
habitat for white-tailed deer and other brush-dependent wildlife species
[<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>,<a href="#174">174</a>]. Honey mesquite-blackbrush acacia and honey mesquite-sand live oak (<i>Quercus virginiana</i> var.
<i> geminata</i>)
savannas of southern Texas provide important habitat for the collared peccary.
Collared peccaries often bed down in dense mesquite thickets [<a href="#51">51</a>]. The
banner-tailed kangaroo rat frequently digs burrows under
mesquite shrubs [<a href="#112">112</a>]. 

<p>Honey mesquite shrublands provide important habitat
for numerous species of birds. A search of 1,600 woody plants on the Rolling
Plains of central Texas found that nesting nongame birds preferred lotebush and honey mesquite over all other woody
plants [<a href="#139">139</a>]. A partial list of
birds known to breed in mesquite communities include the pyrrhuloxia,
phainopepla, Abert's towhee, northern cardinal, Chihuahuan raven, white-necked
raven, scaled quail, Gambel's quail, northern bobwhite, burrowing owl, northern
mockingbird, loggerhead shrike, cactus wren, lark bunting, mourning dove,
black-throated sparrow, Swainson's hawk, Harris hawk, roadrunner, scissor-tailed
flycatcher, ash-throated flycatcher, and the northern oriole [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>].
The Swainson's hawk, Harris hawk, roadrunner, scissor-tailed flycatcher,
ash-throated flycatcher, northern cardinal, white-necked raven, cactus wren,
loggerhead shrike, northern oriole, pyrrhuloxia, northern mockingbird, and mourning dove all nest in honey mesquite plants [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>]. Honey mesquite
provides cover for many types of quail during hot weather; quails preferred
lotebush cover during cold weather [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#140">140</a>]. On the Rolling Plains
of Texas, northern bobwhite coveys often feed within the security of dense honey
mesquite stands and prefer honey mesquite for nest building [<a href="#176">176</a>]. Large honey mesquite
provide roosts for migratory songbirds, wild turkeys, and resident owls, and
provide hunting perches for raptors [<a href="#139">139</a>]. 
</p>

<p>Honey mesquite stands along the Rio Grande serve as a corridor for
migratory birds. At least 38 species of birds nest within honey mesquite
dominated Rio Grande riparian communities [<a href="#162">162</a>]. Cavity-nesting birds
often excavate in large western honey mesquite trees [<a href="#123">123</a>]. In marshes
along the Colorado River in southern California, western honey mesquite snags
provide nesting sites for herons and cormorants and sometimes serve as major
rookeries [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Along the lower Colorado River in southern California, nursery- grown western
honey mesquite seedlings have been planted with other
native species to revegetate riparian areas following saltcedar removal
[<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#179">179</a>]. The 'Tacna' (named
for a site along the Gila River in Arizona) cultivar
establishes quickly and resists psyllid (aphid-like insects) infestation. This
accession was used in a riparian restoration project on the Gila River. Survival
was greatest when seedlings were planted in holes that had been dug and refilled
partway to reduce root impediments. The researchers also used a drip
irrigation system and chicken wire cages to protect seedlings from jackrabbits
and cottontails. The authors added that this cultivar, when used in dry
areas like western Arizona, will not exacerbate range infestations with mesquite
because the dry climate confines honey mesquite to drainages [<a href="#146">146</a>]. 

<p>
Stem cuttings of several species of mesquite have been successfully rooted in
greenhouse experiments when treated with a rooting compound [<a href="#59">59</a>]. Members of the genus <i>Prosopis </i>are being
developed for rehabilitation and biofuel production in developing countries to
help alleviate firewood shortages, erosion, and other problems associated with
desertification [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].&nbsp;Because of their nitrogen fixation capability
members of the Prosopis genus have potential to enhance soil quality [<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>]. 
</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

The widespread occurrence of honey mesquite on
grasslands appears to be a somewhat recent event. Many regions of Texas and New
Mexico that were described by early explorers as treeless grasslands, today are
thorny scrublands dominated by honey mesquite [<a href="#33">33</a>]. In Texas, in 1995, of
the 86.5 million acres (34.7 million ha) of native grasslands 64% has been invaded by
mesquite and 61% has greater than 10% canopy cover by mesquite. Estimates of
honey mesquite cover in the U.S. range from 84 million acres [<a href="#15">15</a>] to 93
million acres (34 million to 37 million ha) [<a href="#37">37</a>]. On the Jornada Experimental Range
near Las Cruces, New Mexico, mesquite was present on 26.3% of sites in 1858 and
in 1963 was present on 69.6% of sites. Honey mesquite's dramatic
increase on grasslands has been attributed to: 1) overgrazing by livestock which
reduces herbaceous fuels and thus reduces the frequency and intensity of range
fires [<a href="#90">90</a>], 2) the concurrent dispersal of mesquite seed by livestock into grazed
habitats, 3) reduced grass competition as a result of grazing [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>], and 4)
periodic drought [<a href="#149">149</a>]. 

<p>
Introduction of livestock in the Southwest resulted in
overgrazing, dispersal of mesquite seed by cattle, and a reduction of range
fires due to insufficient fuels, factors which allowed honey mesquite to
increase in density and spread into grasslands [<a href="#33">33</a>]. Of
Texas's 34.7 million acres of native grassland, 61% have become mesquite
dominated (greater than 10% canopy cover). This spread reduces herbaceous
forage available for livestock and makes moving and handling livestock more
difficult [<a href="#53">53</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
For decades chemical and mechanical methods have been employed in an attempt to
reduce or even eradicate honey mesquite on rangelands, but it has proven very
difficult to control.&nbsp; Adaptive features that make honey mesquite control difficult
include: 1) abundant, long-lived seed that is disseminated by livestock and
wildlife, 2) high germination of the seed over a wide range of environmental
conditions, and 3) the ability to resprout following injury [<a href="#63">63</a>]. Areas which have been
cleared in the past, whether by chemical or mechanical methods, generally were
reinfested with seedlings and/or resprouts. Herbicidal control attempts often
achieved only low to moderate mortality. Many or most plants resprouted after
treatment and developed into multi-stemmed bushes. Due to its regenerative
capability following injury, control attempts in the past have led to some
regions being covered with dense, shrubby thickets that are
commonly more detrimental to forage production than the original stands [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
Grazing:
Honey mesquite has increased on millions of acres of grazing land. Because it
reduces grass production, land managers and ranchers often attempt to remove it. Livestock management practices can improve the success of honey
mesquite control programs. Due to its reproductive potential and regenerative
capabilities, honey mesquite will probably never be eliminated from sites where
it has become established [<a href="#43">43</a>]. Dahl [<a href="#43">43</a>] suggests that a proper rotation
grazing system in coordination with controlled burning may be most
effective.&nbsp;In shortgrass communities where grasses are less competitive,
grazing management is most critical to suppression of western honey mesquite
invasion [<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#188">188</a>].</p>

<p>Mechanical control: Mechanical methods devised for
controlling mesquites include tree dozing, cable chaining, roller chopping, root
plowing, tree grubbing, and land imprinting [<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>]. For mechanical
measures to be effective, the dormant buds which occur along the underground
stem must be damaged or removed to prevent sprouting. If only the aboveground
portion of the plant is removed, honey mesquite will quickly resprout. Tree
grubbing with blades attached to crawler surface and root plows which sever
roots 6 to 12 inches (15-30 cm) below the soil surface and root plows which
uproot trees are effective control measures, often achieving over 90% control [<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>].
Areas root plowed or mechanically grubbed are often seeded with native grasses.
Without seeding, serious soil disturbances caused by these control methods often
reduce perennial grass cover for several years [<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>]. On areas with
moderate shrub density, an alternative to root plowing, cabling, or grubbing is
land imprinting followed by seeding. The land imprinter is a heavy roller, set
with pyramid-shaped teeth, 4 to 6 inches (10-15 cm) long, attached in an
irregular pattern and pulled behind a caterpillar tractor. The tractor and
roller crush and shred the vegetation and deposit the mulch into the funnel-like
depressions [<a href="#70">70</a>]. A study of tree grubbing with a crawler tractor and
U-shaped blade eliminated 90% of honey mesquite by cutting roots up to 1 foot
(30 cm) below the soil surface. However, because of &quot;soil and plant damage
the treatment did not increase grazing capacity or improve range condition
compared to nontreated rangeland.&quot; The authors recommended this technique
only for sparse stands of honey mesquite [<a href="#117">117</a>]. 
</p>

<p>Hand grubbing mesquite seedlings, although very labor
intensive, is an effective preventive measure used for removing honey mesquites during
early stages of invasion. When the roots are severed 4 inches (10 cm) below the
soil surface, hand grubbing effectively kills plants under 1 inch (2.5 cm) in
diameter [<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#149">149</a>]. 
</p>

<p>Chemical control: Clopyralid often results in 50% to 85%
mortality of honey mesquite [<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>]. Taller plants may be less susceptible to herbicides than shorter ones [<a href="#97">97</a>].
In 1997, the effect of herbicide application timing was tested for a 0.75%
solution of clopyralid. Nearly all applications, whether done in June, July,
August or September, caused 100% top-kill and no resprouts were observed the following year (because of rain after
application, 1 treatment in August was less damaging; only 20% did not resprout the
following year.) [<a href="#128">128</a>]. In general,
many-stemmed plants are more resistant to foliar applied herbicides
than single- to few-stemmed plants [<a href="#144">144</a>]. Detailed information concerning the
response of honey mesquite to various herbicides is available
[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>,<a href="#187">187</a>]. 
</p>

<p>Wildlife habitat: Total eradication of honey mesquite
is probably not warranted in many situations because it provides habitat for
numerous wildlife species and serves as an emergency forage for livestock. The
brushy habitat provided by honey mesquite has allowed many ranches to increase
their income through hunting leases. Control methods that leave selected
individuals, scattered patches, or strips of honey mesquite can increase forage
production for cattle while retaining enough cover for wildlife. Brush clearing can be
detrimental to bird populations [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>,<a href="#174">174</a>].
Savanna-like stands of mesquite
provide better habitat for quail than dense brush. Leaving some mesquite when
dense stands are cleared can favor upland game birds [<a href="#165">165</a>]. White-tailed deer in
Texas are dependent on brush for cover and open areas for forage. These needs
can be met within a 300-400 acre (120-160 ha) area [<a href="#35">35</a>]. Deer use often declines dramatically
following removal of honey mesquite in large continuous blocks [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>]. However,
up to 80% of an area can be treated without reductions in deer use when
herbicides are aerially applied in alternating strips or in a mosaic pattern at
various rates [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#161">161</a>]. Aerial applications of herbicides to control honey
mesquite are often detrimental to collared peccary populations because prickly
pear (<i>Opuntia</i> spp.), an important food source, is susceptible to
spraying. Root plowing disturbs or kills burrowing rodents [<a href="#174">174</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
Other uses: Only recently
has serious attention been given to harvesting mesquite on areas where it has
increased. Harvesting honey mesquite could provide additional income
to ranchers wishing to control mesquite on grazing lands. Due to its growth
form, honey mesquite is difficult to harvest economically. A mobile mesquite
harvester that can economically cut the plant near the base, chop the wood into
chips, and deliver and dump the chips to a transport vehicle has been developed
[<a href="#173">173</a>] but has received limited use.&nbsp; 
</p>

<p>
Mesquites were probably the most important wild plant staple of indigenous
Southwest Native Americans [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>]. The pods were a very reliable food source
because fruiting occurred even during drought years. Pods were collected in
large quantities and stored in granary baskets on the roofs of houses or sheds
[<a href="#20">20</a>]. The beans were ground into a flour which was used to prepare cakes and
breads, the main staple of the diet [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>]. Various refreshing drinks were made
from the pods. An alcoholic drink was sometimes prepared by allowing
the juices of the pods to ferment. Flowers were eaten raw or roasted, formed into
balls, and stored in pottery vessels [<a href="#55">55</a>]. 
</p>

<p>Mesquites are widely used as ornamental shade trees throughout the
Southwest because they need little or no watering and can survive on limited
rainfall [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>]. Honey mesquite provides an excellent source of nectar for honey
bees [<a href="#47">47</a>]. 
</p>

<p>Toxicity: Mesquite pods are normally considered
excellent feed for cattle and horses; however, when cattle consume large amounts
of beans continuously over a 2- month period, serious digestive disturbances or
death may occur [<a href="#51">51</a>]. An excessive
buildup of mesquite beans in the rumen apparently destroys the rumen bacteria
that digest cellulose and synthesize B vitamins [<a href="#51">51</a>].&nbsp; 
</p>

Honey mesquite causes an allergic contact dermatitis
in some humans [<a href="#109">109</a>].
