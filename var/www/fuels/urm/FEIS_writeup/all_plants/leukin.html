<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The fully documented scientific species name is Leucopoa kingii (S.
Wats.) W.A. Weber.  Spike fescue was formerly recognized as a species in
the genus Festuca or placed in the monotypic genus Hesperochloa,
Hesperochloa kingii (S. Wats.) Rydb. [<a href="#5">5</a>].  It was removed from the genus
Festuca because of dissimilar characteristics such as dioecism and
slightly keeled but unawned lemmas [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Weber placed the plant in the
small Asiatic genus, Leucopoa, which is composed of dioecious,
fescuelike grasses [<a href="#5">5</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Spike fescue is a climax indicator in a number of sagebrush-grassland
and drier forested habitat types and plant communities.  It occurs with
limber pine (Pinus flexilis), ponderosa pine (P.  ponderosa), mountain
big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana), curlleaf
mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius), bluebunch wheatgrass
(Pseudoroegneria spicata), and prairie junegrass (Koeleria macrantha).

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Spike fescue is rated good to fair for livestock and elk [<a href="#6">6</a>].  In
eastern Idaho and western Wyoming, cattle reportedly use spike fescue
only on slopes which are not steep [<a href="#23">23</a>].  In Utah, cattle and sheep
graze spike fescue during the spring but use it only sparingly after
midsummer [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Spike fescue may occur on summer or winter big game
ranges [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  In central Idaho, mule deer use of spike fescue is
described as "light but frequent" [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Productivity is low, since this
species most often occurs in scattered bunches [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Spike fescue is considered palatable for cattle and sheep during the
spring but becomes less palatable as it matures [<a href="#26">26</a>].  The degree of use
shown by livestock and wildlife species for spike fescue in several
western states is as follows [<a href="#6">6</a>]:

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Spike fescue provides some cover for smaller birds and mammals.  The
degree to which spike fescue provides environmental protection during
one or more seasons for wildlife species in two western states is as
follows [<a href="#6">6</a>]:

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Spike fescue grows well on many harsh, droughty, windswept microsites.
It is reported to have moderate value for erosion control [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Spike
fescue is rated as having low to moderate potential for short-term
revegetation and moderate to high potential for long-term revegetation
projects [<a href="#6">6</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Leucopoa kingii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Spike fescue is a coarse, densely tufted, rhizomatous, perennial
bunchgrass which grows from 12 to 39 inches (3-10 dm) in height [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].
Plants grow from dense clumps of straw-colored sheaths and culms [<a href="#5">5</a>].
Spike fescue often grows in a ringlike pattern, forming tufts up to 6.6
feet (2 m) in diameter [<a href="#5">5</a>].  This bluish-green grass is smooth to
densely puberulent-scaberulous [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].

Heavily veined blades are stiff, erect, glaucous, and flat to loosely
involate [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Hollow culms grow in dense clumps [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  Sheaths
are smooth, striate, and open, and reddish-brown when older [<a href="#19">19</a>].
Evidence suggests that the leaves of spike fescue are able to restrict
transpiration through stomatal control, permitting growth on sites with
high solar radiation loads during the growing season [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Spike fescue is three to five flowered, with spikelets laterally
compressed [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Glumes are broadly lanceolate and membranous, with
lemmas generally awnless [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Awnless ligules are membranous with a
rounded keel [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Fruit is bidentate [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Spike fescue is functionally dioecious [<a href="#13">13</a>] and is unusual in having an
excess number of males within populations [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Spike fescue is believed
to exhibit habitat assortment by sex, with fewer females present in more
xeric habitats [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Little is known about regeneration of spike fescue.  It is known to be a
rhizomatous perennial [<a href="#12">12</a>].  The plants are described as "functionally
dioecious" and produce bidentate fruit [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Reproduction may be
sexual, vegetative, or both [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Female plants growing in xeric
habitats generally display less reproductive vigor than do male plants
from the same sites [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Spike fescue grows on moist to, more typically, dry grasslands, open
woods, and rolling hills up to 11,000 feet (3,353 m) in elevation [<a href="#14">14</a>].
It occurs on open ridges and gravelly mountainsides, commonly on severe,
windy, droughty sites [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Spike fescue often occurs in a thin stip
between adjacent drier nonforest communities and more mesic slopes
dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudosuga menziesii), spruce (Picea spp.), or
subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) [<a href="#23">23</a>].  This species is adapted to
growth under low air temperatures and high solar radiation loads [<a href="#4">4</a>].

The understory in spike fescue communities is typically low and sparse,
with bare soil or rock comprising a high percentage of the cover
[<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Sites frequently have a "savanna-like" appearance [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Spike fescue grows best on sandy to clayey loams [<a href="#6">6</a>], but on some sites
soils may be dry and stony [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Common associates include limber pine,
mountain big sagebrush, curlleaf mountain-mahogany, bluebunch
wheatgrass, and prairie junegrass.  Annual forbs are often well
represented [P. Stickney, pers. comm. 1987].

Elevational ranges are as follows [<a href="#6">6</a>]:

      from   5,500-10,000 ft (1,678-3,050 m) in CO
             5,200-9,500 ft (1,586-2,898 m) in MT
             5,400-10,300 ft (1,647-3,142 m) in UT
             5,200-10,000 ft (1,586-3,050 m) in WY 


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Spike fescue is considered to be an indicator of climax in a number of
sagebrush-grassland, mountain grassland, and drier forest habitat types.
It grows as a topographic climax species on dry, stony, windswept ridges
and other harsh microsites [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
New growth arises from clumps of persistent, reddish-brown or
straw-colored sheaths and culms [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Flowering dates are as follows
[<a href="#6">6</a>]:

            Beginning of Flowering                 End of Flowering
   CO               June                                August
   MT               June                                August

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Leucopoa kingii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Spike fescue is described as a rhizomatous perennial [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Rhizomatous
grasses often increase after burning [<a href="#3">3</a>].

The growth habit of spike fescue closely resembles that of rough fescue
(Festuca scabrella).  Both species are characterized by a dense
arrrangement of sheaths and culms, although spike fescue is somewhat
less tightly packed than rough fescue [P. Stickney, pers. comm. 1987].
The densely packed growth form helps protect the interior of the plant
from damage by fire.

Harsh, montane sites in which spike fescue typically grows are
characterized by short-lived fuels and relatively few woody fuels.
Fires tend to be of the flashy-grassland type which may enhance the
survival of species such as spike fescue [P. Stickney, pers. comm.
1987].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Leucopoa kingii

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire generally consumes the foliage of dry grasses.  The rhizomatous,
fairly densely packed growth form of spike fescue may minimize the
impact of fire on this species.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Rhizomatous grasses often increase in abundance following burning [<a href="#3">3</a>].
Spike fescue resembles rough fescue in growth form.  Infrequent burning
can actually stimulate the growth of rough fescue [(P.  Stickney, pers.
comm. 1987] and presumably does little harm to spike fescue.
