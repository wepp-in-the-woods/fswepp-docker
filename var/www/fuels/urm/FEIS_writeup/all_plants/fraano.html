<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Fraxinus anomala
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Singleleaf ash is a native, deciduous, shrub or small tree ranging from
6.5 to 16.5 feet (2-5 m) tall with a maximum d.b.h of 5 to 7 inches
(12.5-17.8 cm) at maturity [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Leaves are simple to compound,
and are 1.5 to 2 inches (4-5 cm) long and 1 to 2 inches (3-4 cm) wide.
The fruit is an indehiscent samara 0.6 to 1.0 inch (1.5 to 2.5 cm) long
and 0.24 to 0.32 inch (6-8 mm) wide.  The bark is thin, and divided by
shallow fissures into narrow, scaly ridges [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].

In tree form, singleleaf ash typically has a crooked trunk and rounded
crown [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Singleleaf ash samaras are mature by late summer or fall and
are dispersed by wind shortly thereafter.  Samaras are dormant,
requiring warm, then cold stratification.  Germination is epigeal and
may occur the spring following dispersal.  Samaras, however, can remain
viable in leaf litter or humus for several years [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Vegetative:  Most ash species sprout from the root crown after logging
or fire has removed aboveground portions of the plant [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  It
is probable that singleleaf ash responds in such a manner.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Singleleaf ash grows well on a variety of soil types, ranging from
gravel to clay loams.  It occurs more often on poorly-developed soils
with 0.5 to 2.0 percent organic matter content [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Sites are
typically dry canyons or gulches with full exposure to sunlight and
range from 3,000 to 11,000 feet (910-3,300 m) elevation [<a href="#14">14</a>].
Singleleaf ash also colonizes talus slopes, dry hillsides, and alluvial
deposits [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].

Common plant associates of singleleaf ash include skunkbush sumac (Rhus
trilobata), desert ceanothus (Ceanothus greggii), Arizona rosewood
(Vequelinia californica), desert barberry (Mahonia fremontii),
chokecherry (Prunus virginianus), and mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus
spp.) [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community

Singleleaf ash is shade intolerant [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Singleleaf ash flowers from April to May [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Flowers usually appear
either before or with leaves [<a href="#12">12</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Fraxinus anomala
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Specific information concerning the effects of fire on singleleaf ash is
lacking.  It probably sprouts vigorously following fire, as do most
Fraxinus species.

Samaras may remain viable in the soil for several years, making them
important in the colonization of burned sites.  Wind-dispersed samaras
may also play an important role in fire ecology.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tree with adventitious-bud root crown/soboliferous species
root sucker
   Tall shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)
