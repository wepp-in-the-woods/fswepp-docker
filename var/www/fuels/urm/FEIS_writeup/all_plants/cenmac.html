The scientific name for spotted
knapweed is <i>Centaurea maculosa</i> Lam. (Asteraceae) [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#233">233</a>]. Oschmann [<a href="#137">137</a>] 
suggests that in North America, the name <i>Centaurea maculosa </i>has been
misapplied to <i>Centaurea stoebe</i> ssp. <i>micranthos</i>.
The taxonomy of spotted knapweed is discussed in Ochsmann [<a href="#137">137</a>]
and on the <a href="http://www.centaurea.net/">Centaurea website</a>.</font>

<p>Oschsmann [<a href="#136">136</a>] also cites evidence of hybridization between spotted and diffuse knapweed (<i>Centaurea
diffusa</i>) in at least 7 U.S. states. The hybrid is named <i>Centaurea</i> × <i>psammogena</i>
Gayer.</p>

GENERAL DISTRIBUTION:</a>

<br />


Spotted knapweed is native to eastern Europe, though it now occurs in western
and central Europe. It was
introduced to North America, probably as a
contaminant in alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i>) seed and/or ship's ballast, in the late 1800s [<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>,<a href="#161">161</a>]. In 1920, the distribution of spotted knapweed in North
America was limited to the San Juan
Islands, Washington. By 1980 it had spread to 48 counties in the
Pacific Northwest.
Between 1980 and 1998, the known range of spotted knapweed included 326 counties in the
western United States, including every county in Washington, Idaho, Montana, and
Wyoming [<a href="#175">175</a>]. Although it is reported to occur in 45 of the 50 states [<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#211">211</a>],
spotted knapweed is found primarily in the northwestern states and southwestern
Canada. The <a href="http://plants.usda.gov/">PLANTS database</a> provides a map
of spotted knapweed's distribution in the United States.
The following table reflects estimates of spotted knapweed acreage as reported by
state or province in 1988 and again in 2000 (from [<a href="#33">33</a>]):<br><br>

<p
>The decrease in acreage reported in Montana is
attributed to improved inventory methods during the past decade. Although
inventories are more common and more accurate, 50% of these states reported only
50% accuracy, while 31% reported 51 to 75% accuracy, and 2 states reported 75 to
100% accuracy [<a href="#33">33</a>]. Watson and Renney [<a href="#221">221</a>] reported that spotted
knapweed was abundant
in British Columbia, common in Ontario, Quebec and the Maritimes, and observed in
southern
Alberta in 1974.
</p>


<p>Information on the distribution of spotted knapweed
is limited for most North American states and provinces in which it occurs. It is commonly listed as occurring on
roadsides and other disturbed areas in the Adirondacks [<a href="#93">93</a>], New England [<a href="#170">170</a>], the
Northeast
[<a href="#45">45</a>], Michigan [<a href="#217">217</a>],
Illinois [<a href="#125">125</a>], Nebraska [<a href="#165">165</a>], the Great Plains [<a href="#48">48</a>],
the Blue Ridge region of North Carolina,
Tennessee, and Virginia [<a href="#231">231</a>], West Virginia [<a href="#197">197</a>], the Carolinas [<a href="#149">149</a>], and Florida
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#233">233</a>].
</p>

<p>Specific information on the plant communities in
which spotted knapweed occurs is also limited outside its primary area of
occurrence. The following lists reflect ecosystems and cover types in which
spotted knapweed is commonly found, although the lists are not

Montana is the center of distribution for spotted knapweed in the United States.
There it tends to favor ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>)/Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga
menziesii</i>), and
adjacent foothill prairie habitats (previously dominated by
bluebunch wheatgrass (<i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i>), Idaho fescue (<i>Festuca
idahoensis</i>), rough fescue (<i>F. altaica</i>), and needle-and-thread grass
(<i>Hesperostipa comata</i>)) [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#161">161</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>], although it is said to grow in nearly every
habitat type west of the Continental Divide in Montana [<a href="#126">126</a>]. On undisturbed sites (e.g. Glacier National Park) additional associates may include
slender wheatgrass (<i>Elymus trachycaulus</i>), prairie junegrass (<i>Koeleria
macrantha</i>), timber oatgrass (<i>Danthonia intermedia</i>), Richardson
needlegrass (<i>Achnatherum</i> <i>richardsonii</i>), western yarrow (<i>Achillea
millefolium</i>), northern bedstraw (<i>Galium boreale</i>), field chickweed (<i>Cerastium
arvense</i>), silky lupine (<i>Lupinus sericeus</i>), and cryptogams
[<a href="#208">208</a>]. On disturbed sites, old hayfields, and pastures, common
associates are Kentucky bluegrass (<i>Poa pratense</i>), smooth brome (<i>Bromus
inermis</i>), timothy (<i>Phleum pratense</i>), and cheatgrass (<i>B. tectorum</i>)
[<a href="#159">159</a>,<a href="#177">177</a>]. Spotted knapweed is found in the Idaho
fescue/bluebunch wheatgrass and bluebunch wheatgrass/blue grama (<i>Bouteloua
gracilis</i>) habitat types, and the antelope bitterbrush (<i>Purshia tridentata</i>)
series in Montana, as described by Mueggler
and Stewart [<a href="#127">127</a>]. Spotted knapweed occurs along roadsides in
Montana and North Dakota in shortgrass prairie types with blue grama; in mixed-grass with
wheatgrass (Triticacea), needlegrass (<i>Achnatherum,</i> <i>Hesperostipa, </i>and
<i>Nassella</i>  spp.) and little bluestem (<i>Schizachyrium</i> <i>scoparium</i>);
in foothill grassland with bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, and rough
fescue; and in ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, and subalpine fir (<i>Abies lasiocarpa</i>) forest types.
Spotted knapweed tends to escape the roadside disturbance area and penetrate less disturbed
communities in the shortgrass, mixed-grass, and foothill grassland environmental
types as described by Meier and Weaver [<a href="#123">123</a>]. Other Montana associates may
include common snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos albus</i>), Oregon-grape (<i>Mahonia repens</i>), basin wildrye
(<i>Leymus cinereus</i>), green needlegrass (<i>N. viridula</i>),
whitetop (<i>Cardaria draba</i>), long-leaved aster (<i>Aster chilensis</i>), spreading
dogbane (<i>Apocynum</i> <i>androsaemifolium</i>) [<a href="#51">51</a>], pinegrass
(<i>Calamagrostis rubescens</i>), elk sedge (<i>Carex geyeri</i>), thistles (<i>Cirsium
</i>and <i>Carduus</i> spp.), and kinnikinnick (<i>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</i>)
[<a href="#219">219</a>].
Spotted knapweed is also found in pinyon-juniper (<i>Pinus</i>-<i>Juniperus</i>
spp.) communities in the Intermountain West [<a href="#199">199</a>].

<p>Spotted knapweed is listed as a &quot;dominance type&quot; in
Montana riparian areas and is found primarily on upper terraces of major river
courses, relatively dry, disturbed sites, and gravel bars. Associated species
are affected by the degree of past disturbance. On relatively undisturbed sites
it may be found with bluebunch wheatgrass, redtop (<i>Agrostis </i>spp.), silver sagebrush (<i>Artemisia
cana</i>), Idaho fescue and Wood's rose (<i>Rosa woodsii</i>). On more disturbed sites
likely associates include Canada bluegrass (<i>Poa compressa</i>), Kentucky bluegrass, bulbous bluegrass (<i>P. bulbosa</i>), slender cinquefoil (<i>Potentilla
gracilis</i>), crested wheatgrass (<i>Agropyron cristatum</i>), and Canada thistle
(<i>Cirsium arvense</i>) [<a href="#57">57</a>]. It may occur with other species
associated with frequent disturbance such as common tansy (<i>Tanacetum vulgare</i>),
creeping bentgrass (<i>Agrostis stolonifera</i>), and widely scattered seedlings of
sandbar willow (<i>Salix exigua</i>) and black cottonwood (<i>Populus
balsamifera </i>ssp. <i>trichocarpa</i>) [<a href="#55">55</a>]. Hansen and others [<a href="#56">56</a>] list spotted
knapweed occurring in 24 riparian habitat types in
Montana. Dominant associates include red-osier dogwood (<i>Cornus
sericea</i>), black cottonwood, grand fir (<i>Abies grandis</i>), ladyfern (<i>Athyrium
filix-femina</i>), spruce (<i>Picea</i>   spp.), Douglas-fir,
Rocky Mountain juniper (<i>Juniperus scopulorum</i>), ponderosa pine, quaking aspen (<i>Populus
tremuloides</i>), narrowleaf cottonwood (<i>P.
angustifolia</i>), Geyer willow (<i>Salix geyeriana</i>), sandbar willow, Wood's rose,
thinleaf alder (<i>Alnus incana</i> ssp. <i>tenuifolia</i>), water birch (<i>Betula
occidentalis</i>), shrubby cinquefoil (<i>Potentilla fruticosa</i>), chokecherry
(<i>Prunus virginiana</i>), western snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos occidentalis</i>),
water sedge (<i>Carex aquatilis</i>), Baltic rush (<i>Juncus balticus</i>), and
reed canarygrass (<i>Phalaris arundinacea</i>). 
</p>

<p>In Washington state, spotted knapweed is found in openings in
ponderosa pine/bunchgrass or Douglas-fir/shrub forests, especially on coarse,
gravelly glacial soils [<a href="#163">163</a>]. Spotted knapweed is competitive in disturbed
forest types in Washington (primarily northeastern), including ponderosa pine with bunchgrass,
snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos</i> spp.),
or ninebark (<i>Physocarpus malvaceus</i>); or Douglas-fir with snowberry or ninebark
[<a href="#164">164</a>].
</p>

<p>Plants associated with spotted knapweed in British
Columbia are characteristic of dryland
range and pioneer sites including bluebunch wheatgrass, rough and Idaho fescue,
bluegrass (<i>Poa</i> spp.), and many others [<a href="#221">221</a>]. Bluebunch wheatgrass
communities in British Columbia are especially susceptible to spotted knapweed
infestation [<a href="#2">2</a>]. In west-central British Columbia, an infestation of spotted knapweed occurred along the
railroad with Kentucky bluegrass, red fescue (<i>Festuca rubra</i>), timothy, smooth brome, and
clover (<i>Trifolium</i> spp.) [<a href="#236">236</a>]. In open forests of British Columbia,
spotted knapweed may be found with ponderosa pine,
Douglas-fir, ninebark, Saskatoon serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier alnifolia</i>), mock orange
(<i>Philadelphus lewisii</i>), toadflax (<i>Linaria dalmatica</i>),
pinegrass, and Idaho fescue [<a href="#124">124</a>]; or with lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus
contorta</i>), Engelmann spruce (<i>Picea engelmannii</i>), subalpine
fir, huckleberry (<i>Vaccinium</i> spp.) and fireweed (<i>Epilobium
angustifolium</i>) [<a href="#148">148</a>].
</p>

<p>
Information on plant
communities invaded by spotted knapweed in other parts of the country is very
limited. In North Dakota spotted knapweed is found primarily along roads and
sometimes in adjacent grasslands [<a href="#17">17</a>]. In
Michigan oldfields it is found growing with blackberry (<i>Rubus alleghaniensis</i>),
poverty oatgrass (<i>Danthonia spicata</i>), and broomsedge (<i>Andropogon virginicus</i>)
[<a href="#40">40</a>]. In Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, spotted knapweed was found growing along a trail in the bigfruit
hawthorn (<i>Crataegus
macrosperma</i>)/shrub forest with black raspberry (<i>R. occidentalis</i>) and
dwarf cinquefoil (<i>Potentilla
canadensis</i>) [<a href="#54">54</a>]. Spotted knapweed is said to be
widespread in California, occurring in disturbed areas up to 6,600 feet (2,012 m)
[<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>]. In Yellowstone National Park it is found in a
campground in a big sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i>)/bluebunch
wheatgrass habitat type [<a href="#4">4</a>].

IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE:</a>
</span>
<br />

The importance of spotted knapweed to livestock and wildlife depends upon the size and density of
the infestation, the availability of other forage plants, and the season. Large-scale infestations of spotted
knapweed can impede access to more desirable forage for livestock and wildlife,
especially when the presence of old, dried knapweed stems creates a dense and spiny
overstory [<a href="#221">221</a>]. Large reductions in available forage [<a href="#60">60</a>] and wildlife use
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#175">175</a>] have been reported on knapweed-infested range. Reports of
forage losses for elk vary, and probably do not consider the possibility of elk
using spotted knapweed as forage [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#232">232</a>]. In
fact, the perception that spotted knapweed has minimal forage value and may even
be toxic [<a href="#110">110</a>] has changed since studies have shown that it has good
nutritional value [<a href="#89">89</a>], and it is eaten by both
livestock [<a href="#26">26</a>] and wildlife [<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#229">229</a>].

<p>Several reports from western Montana indicate some
use of spotted knapweed by livestock. In general, use of spotted knapweed by livestock is highest during spring and
early summer when plants are green and actively growing in the rosette and bolt
stages [<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#160">160</a>]. Use declines as spotted knapweed matures, and protein and digestibility decrease [<a href="#89">89</a>], although flowerbuds and seedheads may
be
grazed in the late summer [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>]. Domestic sheep may also
graze rosettes when present (from regrowth and late season germination) in the
fall [<a href="#26">26</a>]. Cox
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>]
observed domestic sheep eating large quantities of spotted knapweed in the spring and early summer in preference to grasses and other forbs. Olson and Wallander
[<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>] also report sheep readily grazing
spotted knapweed in an infested pasture, although they grazed other
plants as well and did not consistently graze one plant more than the others.
Sheep grazed
spotted knapweed leaves and avoided stems. In sagebrush steppe rangeland in
southeastern Idaho, spotted knapweed was readily consumed by domestic sheep throughout
the year. Grasses were consumed in amounts similar to spotted knapweed, but native forbs were most commonly used [<a href="#108">108</a>]. Sheep
grazing has been proposed as a potential control method for spotted knapweed
[<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>] (see &quot;Management
Considerations&quot; below).
</p>

<p>Reports on wildlife use of spotted knapweed are also
varied. Bedunah [<a href="#11">11</a>] cites several studies suggesting large potential losses
of elk range to spotted knapweed, though he indicates that quantifying the effects of
infestation on elk populations is complicated by their mobility. Spotted
knapweed infestation is considered more detrimental to elk than to deer because
spotted knapweed replaces grasses that are preferred by elk, while deer have a diet of predominantly shrubs and
conifers that spotted knapweed does not replace [<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#229">229</a>]. Elk use increased
following removal of spotted knapweed
with herbicides on sites in Montana [<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#200">200</a>]. In a study in western Montana on 2
game ranges in the Bitterroot
Valley, Willard and others [<a href="#229">229</a>] report minimal use of spotted knapweed dominated sites
by elk and mule deer. When used, mule deer
consumed knapweed flowerheads from December through April, while elk consumed knapweed
flowerheads only
during winter.&nbsp;Spotted
knapweed was preferred by deer and elk over other
plant species on sites with dense knapweed cover [<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#229">229</a>]. It was suggested that
deer and elk did not frequently use the spotted knapweed sites in this study because
cervid densities were relatively low
and other forage was available [<a href="#232">232</a>].&nbsp;On spotted knapweed infested
bunchgrass range in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, Idaho, Wright and Kelsey
[<a href="#232">232</a>]
report that elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer used spotted knapweed infested range as much
as or more than
uninfested bunchgrass range from 1
December through 25 April. All cervid species consumed both rosettes and
seedheads of spotted knapweed, with seedhead consumption greatest during periods of snow cover.
The authors suggest that when estimating
carrying capacity of a cervid range, spotted knapweed can be considered a
potential food source, because when animal densities are high and food choices are limited, elk and
deer will consume spotted knapweed [<a href="#232">232</a>]. In British Columbia, deer and elk forage on
diffuse and spotted knapweed
rosettes in late fall and early winter, and again when snow cover recedes and
spring green-up commences. Knapweed rosettes and bluegrass
comprised 90% of mule and white-tail deer diets in
February and early March [<a href="#124">124</a>].

</p>

<p>In the Gilpin range, British Columbia, California bighorn sheep
utilized
diffuse and spotted knapweed seedheads as primary forage when snow depth was in excess of
8 inches (20 cm). As snow cover
receded in January and February, knapweed basal rosettes were the largest
component (80%) of their diet. Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep also utilized knapweed seedheads and basal rosettes throughout the year in the Robson/Syringa Park area,
British Columbia [<a href="#124">124</a>]. 

</p>

<p> Spotted knapweed is a nectar source for the endangered Karner blue
butterfly in Wisconsin [<a href="#52">52</a>]. Rodent utilization of spotted
knapweed seed has been suggested [<a href="#221">221</a>]. Deer mice have been observed eating
larvae and seeds from spotted knapweed flowerheads infested with seedhead flies
(introduced biocontrol agents) [<a href="#145">145</a>].

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">
<span class="subframeName">
<a name="PALATABILITY">
PALATABILITY:</a>

<br />

It has been suggested that the bitter tasting sesquiterpene lactone, cnicin,
found primarily in the leaves of spotted knapweed, may make it unpalatable to mammalian herbivores
[<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>]. Wright and Kelsey [<a href="#232">232</a>] were unable, however, to correlate changes in cnicin levels to changes in the amount of
spotted knapweed consumed by mule
deer, white-tailed deer, or elk. Furthermore, observations by Cox [<a href="#27">27</a>] suggest that spotted knapweed is more palatable to
domestic sheep than
orchardgrass
(<i>Dactylis glomerata</i>), timothy, quackgrass (<i>Elytrigia repens</i>), Kentucky bluegrass, sainfoin
(<i>Onobrychis</i> <i>viciifolia</i>), or birdsfoot trefoil (<i>Lotus</i> spp.).
In a cafeteria trial, domestic sheep readily consumed spotted knapweed in all growth stages, although
they preferred rosette and bolting stages somewhat to the flowering stage
[<a href="#108">108</a>]. Robbins [<a href="#160">160</a>] also observed cattle readily grazing
spotted knapweed in the spring, though cattle prefer grasses when available
[<a href="#97">97</a>].
Mature spotted knapweed plants (with stems) are eaten less frequently than young
plants (rosettes), and may be less
palatable due to spininess and high fiber content [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>]. 

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">
<span class="subframeName">
<a name="NUTRITIONAL VALUE">
NUTRITIONAL VALUE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Spotted knapweed has substantial nutritional value that compares favorably to
the native plants with which it is commonly associated. By traditional measures of forage nutritive
value (e.g. crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), in-vitro
dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), and total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC)), spotted knapweed (especially leaves and flowerheads)
is more nutritious than Idaho fescue [<a href="#142">142</a>]. The following table provides
measurements of nutritive value of spotted knapweed, harvested before flowering, as
reported by Kelsey and Mihalovich [<a href="#89">89</a>]:<br><br>

<p>Values vary with season, plant part, age, and
site. Nutritional value declines as summer progresses [<a href="#142">142</a>,<a href="#232">232</a>], with crude
protein and nonstructural carbohydrates most concentrated during the spring.
Spotted knapweed becomes more fibrous, with lower protein and carbohydrate levels, as stems mature
over the summer [<a href="#89">89</a>]. Seedheads are less nutritious than rosettes, but may
be available above the snow [<a href="#232">232</a>]. Willard and others [<a href="#229">229</a>]
measured crude protein, fiber, and lignin content in spotted knapweed flowers and
recorded average values of 6.6%, 45.6%, and 14.5%, respectively. Crude protein
was similar for open and forested sites, while fiber and lignin values were
higher on forested sites than on open sties [<a href="#229">229</a>]. Jones and others [<a href="#80">80</a>] provide a detailed study of the forage
value of spotted knapweed from a sagebrush/grassland site in southeastern Idaho,
comparing different parts of mature and immature plants from May through
September.

</p>

<p>Secondary compounds in spotted knapweed, such as
cnicin, can negatively affect activity
and growth of anaerobic rumen microorganisms in domestic sheep, reducing digestibility of
spotted knapweed [<a href="#138">138</a>,<a href="#140">140</a>].

Watson and Renney[<a href="#221">221</a>] noted that &quot;the rapid establishment of
(spotted knapweed) cover in the form of rosettes on barren
soil prevents soil erosion and leads to accumulation of organic matter.&quot;
Kelsey
[<a href="#86">86</a>] points out that &quot;this characteristic is of marginal utility since the
plants inhibit further succession and are difficult to replace with more
desirable species.&quot; Furthermore, spotted knapweed establishment provides a seed source for invasion of adjacent lands
and potential for reduction of native plant diversity [<a href="#207">207</a>]. Lacey and others [<a href="#100">100</a>] determined that surface
water runoff and stream sediment yield were 56 and 192% higher, respectively,
and infiltration rates lower, for spotted knapweed-dominated sites compared to
bunchgrass-dominated sites.

Kelsey and Locken [<a href="#88">88</a>] cite studies indicating that the compound cnicin has antimicrobial
properties, as well as being active against some human carcinoma cells and L-1210 leukemia. Knapweeds provide substantial pollen and nectar for
domestic bees in interior British Columbia [<a href="#221">221</a>], the Intermountain
West [<a href="#86">86</a>], and Michigan [<a href="#35">35</a>]. Kelsey [<a href="#86">86</a>] recommends short-term research to utilize
spotted knapweed
biomass for commercial products.

OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Spotted knapweed is considered a serious threat to rangelands in Montana,
Washington,
Idaho, Oregon, Wyoming, and British Columbia. Because of its affinity for the climate of
western Montana, Chicoine and others [<a href="#25">25</a>] predicted that spotted knapweed had
the potential to invade 37 million acres (15 million ha) in that state alone, and Bedunah
[<a href="#11">11</a>]
speculated that the foothill grasslands in western Montana (the primary habitat
for spotted knapweed) are becoming an
endangered vegetation type. The ill effects of spotted knapweed are manifold. Spotted knapweed infestations have been associated with reductions in
forage production [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#221">221</a>], plant
species richness and diversity [<a href="#205">205</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>], cryptogam cover
[<a href="#206">206</a>], soil fertility [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#138">138</a>,<a href="#232">232</a>], and wildlife habitat [<a href="#10">10</a>], as well as increases in
bare ground
[<a href="#207">207</a>],
surface water runoff, and stream sedimentation [<a href="#100">100</a>]. Lesica and Shelly [<a href="#111">111</a>]
also found
that spotted knapweed reduced seed germination and seedling establishment of a
rare Montana endemic forb, Mt. Sapphire rockcress (<i>Arabis fecunda</i>).

</p>

<p>
Experimental evidence suggests that spotted knapweed gains dominance in part by
its ability to out-compete native grasses for nutrients such as nitrogen [<a href="#139">139</a>] and phosphorus
[<a href="#65">65</a>]. Other evidence
suggests that as succession proceeds and nutrients become less available, the
competitive advantage shifts from spotted knapweed to native plants such as bluebunch wheatgrass
[<a href="#91">91</a>]. Allelopathy, primarily from the compound cnicin, has been suggested as a
growth inference mechanism in
spotted knapweed [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>]. However, because cnicin concentration in soil is lower than that found to be toxic in in-vitro
experiments, allelopathy was not considered as important as resource competition in determining the
ecological success of spotted knapweed [<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>]. Allelopathic activity of cnicin may be enhanced,
however, when large quantities of stem and leaf tissue
from live or dead spotted knapweed plants come in direct contact with the soil
surface, as when plants are trampled or mowed. This allelopathic activity could be
minimized by burning or removing plant material before it comes in contact with
the soil surface [<a href="#113">113</a>]. More recent experimental evidence suggests that
knapweed's advantage over its North American neighbors could be attributed to
differences in the effects of its root exudates and how they, in turn, affect
competition for resources [<a href="#19">19</a>], thus linking allelopathy and resource
competition.

</p>

<p>In many areas, eradication of spotted knapweed is no longer an
option. Perhaps small patches can be eradicated with cultural practices or
herbicides. Large infestations must be
controlled or suppressed with cultural and biological methods, perhaps in conjunction with herbicides,
to contain the weed and slow its spread. Before management plans for the control of
spotted knapweed can be designed, land use objectives
must be defined.
A generalized objective may be to develop a plant community
that is weed resistant and meets other land-use objectives. Desired plant communities
can be
designed to maximize niche occupation with desirable species that compete
intensely, grow rapidly, and grow during much of the season [<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>]. It is important that the successional effects of
spotted knapweed control are considered in this manner to avoid replacing
spotted knapweed with another weedy species [<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#230">230</a>].&nbsp;

</p>

<p>Spotted knapweed control requires a sustained, site-specific
commitment over a period of several years [<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>].
Economic considerations for spotted knapweed control have
been investigated [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#138">138</a>],
and Griffith [<a href="#49">49</a>] provides a procedure for performing an economic evaluation for noxious
weed management on rangeland, with spotted knapweed as an example.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Integrated weed management: Managers are encouraged to integrate different
control methods that can complement one another in a given situation. Integrated
management includes considerations of not only killing the target weed,
but also of establishing desirable species and maintaining weed-free systems
over the long-term. Factors to be addressed before
a management decision is made include inventory and assessment to identify the target weed and
determine the size of the infestation(s); assessment of non-target vegetation, soil
types, climatic conditions and important water resources; and an evaluation of the
benefits and limitations of control methods [<a href="#131">131</a>]. Components of any integrated weed management program are sustained
effort, constant evaluation, and the adoption of improved strategies [<a href="#175">175</a>].

</p>

<p>
Conceptual models can be developed to determine the probability that the weed management strategy
will result in the desired plant community, based on the life
histories and population dynamics of the species in the existing plant community
[<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>]. A weed management strategy may include designed
disturbance (e.g. cultural or chemical control), controlled colonization (e.g.
planting competitive species), and controlled species performance (e.g.
biological control) [<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#230">230</a>]. Management strategies
may include several approaches designed to disrupt the stages in a weed's life cycle that are most vulnerable to
stress or control [<a href="#175">175</a>]. Jacobs and Sheley [<a href="#73">73</a>] identified juvenile, the transition from
juvenile to adult, and adult as critical phases in the life history of spotted knapweed.
The key processes associated with these stages are competition, growth, and
reproductive allocation. Successful control practices must target one or more of
these processes. Sheley and others [<a href="#178">178</a>] provide
examples of ecologically based spotted knapweed management systems.</p>

<p>Prevention: Prevention of spotted knapweed establishment is the most cost-effective
control strategy [<a href="#31">31</a>]. Prevention practices begin with the
maintenance of healthy, desirable vegetation that is resistant to weed
establishment. This includes minimizing soil disturbance in all activities and reestablishing
desirable vegetation promptly whenever soil disturbance leaves areas of bare
ground, with continued monitoring and immediate follow-up
treatment of colonizing weeds, and/or revegetation with
desirable species [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#208">208</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>]. In areas where it is critical to maintain native vegetation (e.g.
national parks, nature preserves, wilderness), avoid building new roads and
trails, since this is the primary habitat for many invasive species including
spotted knapweed [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#208">208</a>]. Carefully monitor the intensity, frequency, and season of grass
defoliation in grazing prescriptions so that grasses can tolerate grazing and resist weed
invasion. One greenhouse study suggests that even moderate defoliation
of competing grasses (30%) may allow greater spotted knapweed growth on Idaho fescue
rangeland [<a href="#72">72</a>]. Another study found that spring defoliations increased spotted
knapweed cover compared to summer defoliations; that grass defoliation greater
than 60% caused an increase in spotted knapweed cover and density; and that more
than one grass defoliation in a year increased spotted knapweed cover. The
researchers suggest that a single, annual grass defoliation of 60%
or less, regardless of the season, will not increase spotted knapweed invasion on rangeland [<a href="#78">78</a>].&nbsp;Rangeland managers must also consider the potential
for livestock to introduce spotted knapweed seed in their feces or fur.&nbsp;

</p>

<p> Regular removal of newly established spotted
knapweed plants at trailheads, campsites and along road corridors is critical to
prevent their spread into adjacent natural areas [<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>]. Monitor for weed emergence annually, especially in areas where there is vehicle or
livestock movement, in riparian areas, areas of
wildlife concentration, public use areas, and locations where sand, gravel, or fill materials have been
imported, soil has been disturbed, or vegetation or overstory has
been removed [<a href="#210">210</a>]. When spotted knapweed
plants are found, remove them immediately.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>The introduction of
spotted knapweed seeds from infested areas to recently disturbed and/or
uninfested areas can be limited by monitoring vehicle, livestock, and wildlife movement [<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#208">208</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>].
Encourage public land users to avoid driving vehicles through or scheduling livestock use in existing
spotted knapweed infestations when seeds are present, to inspect and clean vehicles of weeds
and their seeds, to brush and clean animals, tack, and equipment before
entering public lands, and to minimize
soil disturbance by stock. Regulations
promoting minimum impact camping and the use of weed-free feed, hay, straw, and
mulch in natural areas may reduce spotted knapweed
infestations [<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>]. Encourage the use of certified weed-free feed for several days before entering
backcountry
[<a href="#131">131</a>,<a href="#208">208</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>,<a href="#220">220</a>].
</p>

<p>A key component of prevention practices is education
and awareness of managers, land owners, and public land users [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>]. In Montana,
programs have been implemented such as a trust fund for weed
research and weed management efforts, organized
cooperative weed management programs for landowners [<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>],
a curriculum for educating school children [<a href="#133">133</a>], and bounty
programs [<a href="#175">175</a>]. Examples of successful cooperative spotted knapweed
control efforts have been reported in Canada [<a href="#3">3</a>] and Wyoming [<a href="#224">224</a>].
</p>

<p>Weed prevention and control can be incorporated into
all types of management plans, including logging and site preparation,
management of grazing allotments, recreation management, research projects, road
building and maintenance, and fire management [<a href="#210">210</a>]. See the &quot;Guide to
noxious weed prevention practices&quot; [<a href="#210">210</a>] for specific
guidelines in preventing the spread of weed seeds and propagules under different
management conditions. When prevention fails, or spotted knapweed populations
already exist, several
management approaches can be used to eradicate small populations or to control larger infestations including
cultural, biological and chemical
control methods, or some combination of methods timed in such a way as to be
complementary. Tu and others [<a href="#202">202</a>] provide a comprehensive review of weed
control methods that are applicable for use in natural areas. The information is
also available online (<a href="http://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/handbook.html">Weed Control Methods Handbook</a>).
</p>

<p>Physical and mechanical control: Manual control techniques may be
preferred in some areas with spotted knapweed infestations. For example, on the
Salmon River watershed in the Klamath National Forest in California, it is
recognized that manual control methods offer less risk to the high quality
waters and high value fisheries than do chemical applications. A cooperative
effort among the local residents and land management agencies, orchestrated by
the Salmon River Restoration Council (SRRC), has successfully employed the use of
several manual control approaches including propane torching of seedlings early
in the season, hand digging with small tools, mulching with black plastic, and
mowing with weed eaters [<a href="#167">167</a>]. For a detailed description of their knapweed control
program see the <a href="http://www.srrc.org/">SRRC</a>
website.
</p>

<p>Spotted knapweed
does not persist under annual cultivation or in irrigated alfalfa. This,
however, does not present a widely applicable solution for infested wildland, rangeland or
prairie
[<a href="#60">60</a>]. Mowing, hand-pulling, planting
competitive species, and
good range management may reduce the spread of spotted knapweed, but may not eliminate
well established stands [<a href="#86">86</a>]. Tillage can reportedly lead to the spread of
spotted knapweed [<a href="#31">31</a>]. This is especially likely in mature stands
since tillage creates an ideal
weed seed bed from which individuals in the seed bank may emerge. Tillage may be
more successful if followed by seeding with a strongly competitive grass-legume
mixture [<a href="#151">151</a>].</p>

<p> Consistent hand pulling can control spotted
knapweed, although it is time and labor intensive. Entire
plants must be removed before they produce seeds each year, and flowering plants should be
removed from the site so no seeds
are dispersed [<a href="#175">175</a>]. In greenhouse studies, only severe
defoliation reduced spotted knapweed root, root crown, and aboveground growth. Some spotted knapweed plants produced flowers even
when clipped monthly from June through September [<a href="#90">90</a>]. Mowing diffuse and spotted knapweed
in Canada at the bud stage, flowering stage, or once at bud stage and again at
flowering, reduced the number of plants producing seed by 77, 99, and 96%
compared to unmowed plants. The latter 2 treatments also reduced germination of
the seeds by approximately 79% [<a href="#221">221</a>]. Rinella and others [<a href="#159">159</a>]
found that a single mowing at the flowering or seed stage resulted in an 83-85%
decrease in adult spotted knapweed density at 2 sites in western Montana. This
reduction was as much as any treatment consisting
of repeated mowing at both sites. The long-term effects
on spotted knapweed densities are unknown, but Rinella and others [<a href="#159">159</a>]
hypothesize that repeated annual mowing may shift the competitive balance in
favor of desired grasses.&nbsp;Rolling plots with a
pasture roller, burning, mowing, or harrowing treatments had no effect on the
spotted knapweed seedbank at 2 sites in Montana [<a href="#23">23</a>].
</p>

<p>Burning: For information on fire management considerations for
spotted knapweed, please see the &quot;Fire Management
Considerations&quot; segment of the &quot;Fire Effects&quot; section of this
report.
</p>

<p>Biological control: The aim of biological
control is to stress spotted knapweed and shift the competitive advantage away
from the weed to desirable
grasses and forbs [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>,<a href="#175">175</a>,<a href="#230">230</a>]. Biological control efforts
for diffuse and spotted knapweed have been underway in North America since 1970. Wilson
and McAffrey [<a href="#230">230</a>] provide a discussion of considerations and safety issues in
developing and implementing a biological control program. The objective of biological control efforts is to propagate and redistribute sufficient insect
populations to hold spotted knapweed to population levels similar to their
populations in Europe [<a href="#209">209</a>]. It is believed that 4 agents are
necessary to affect 1 plant species, and that 6 established agents would
help control both diffuse and spotted knapweeds since most agents attack both
plants [<a href="#60">60</a>]. To date, 13 Eurasian insects have been
introduced for the control of these knapweeds, several of which are
demonstrating some impact against 1 or both species. Of
these, 8 of the insects attack the flower heads, while 5 attack the roots [<a href="#195">195</a>]. The idea is that these agents will work together to reduce viable seed production
and stunt the overall growth and strength of the plants [<a href="#209">209</a>]. In
this sense, there is an additional ecological niche to
be filled, since no agents attack the rosette foliage or root crown. These
structures are vulnerable to attack for at least 1 year before the plant can
reproduce [<a href="#182">182</a>].
</p>

<p>Story and Piper [<a href="#195">195</a>] provide a current 
assessment of the status of biocontrol agents on spotted knapweed. On sites in 
Montana where <I>Urophora affinis</I> and <I>U. quadrifasciata</I> coexist, 
spotted knapweed seed production is reduced by at least 50% [<a href="#194">194</a>,<a href="#195">195</a>], and 
Harris [<a href="#59">59</a>] reports a 92% reduction in spotted 
knapweed seed production at locations in British Columbia. He also notes that 
<I>Agapeta zoenga</I> and <I>Cyphocleonus achates</I> are causing noticeable 
reductions in density and vigor of spotted knapweed at several locations in 
western Montana [<a href="#195">195</a>]. Success has not been 
dramatic, and has not developed as expected [<a href="#171">171</a>]. One partial 
explanation for the limited success of introduced biocontrol agents may be that 
biocontrol agents came from <I>C. maculosa</I>, which is native to central 
Europe, while it has been suggested that the plant that is invasive in North 
America is actually <I>Centaurea stoebe</I> ssp. <I>micranthos</I>, which is 
native to eastern Europe [<a href="#182">182</a>]. Climatic analyses indicate that 
the climate of western Montana is more similar to the area in eastern Europe, 
from which <I>Centaurea stoebe</I> ssp. <I>micranthos</I> originated, than the area from which the bulk (12 of the 
13) of biocontrol agents came. It is therefore suggested that future 
explorations in the area of origin of the target plant are necessary to find 
agents that are adapted to colder climates and a more vigorous plant [<a href="#171">171</a>,<a href="#182">182</a>]. </p>

<p>Biological control efforts may also be hindered by
indirect effects of herbivory on nontarget species. Callaway and others [<a href="#20">20</a>]
found that herbivory on spotted knapweed had substantial negative, indirect
effects on Idaho fescue under 2 very different sets of experimental conditions.
They hypothesized that moderate herbivory may have stimulated compensatory
growth in spotted knapweed, induced the production of defense chemicals that
also had allelopathic effects, or stimulated root exudates that altered the
relationship between knapweed and Idaho fescue via soil microbes [<a href="#20">20</a>].
</p>

<p>Additional indirect affects of biological control of
spotted knapweed have been observed in west-central Montana [<a href="#145">145</a>]. Gall fly
larvae (<i>Urophora</i>  spp.) released as biological control agents for spotted
knapweed are the primary food item in native deer mouse diets for most of the
year and made up 84-86% of their winter diet. The implications of these findings
include the possibility that deer mice and other predators may reduce <i> Urophora</i> 
populations below a threshold to effectively control knapweed; the unknown
effects on deer mouse population dynamics and subsequent effects on food chains;
and the effects on seed dispersal, since 9% of deer mouse stomachs also
contained knapweed seeds during the period following seed dispersal [<a href="#146">146</a>].
</p>

<p> The following table shows insects that have
been established in North America for the control of spotted knapweed, and the
states or provinces in which they have been established or recovered, and

<p>In addition to insect control agents, several
microorganisms have been considered for potential control of spotted knapweed
including the fungi <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i>  [<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#175">175</a>], <i>Fusarium
avenaceum</i>   [<a href="#28">28</a>] and <i>F. oxysporum </i> [<a href="#79">79</a>], and the bacteria <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> 
[<a href="#84">84</a>]. A phytotoxin isolated from the black leaf blight fungus (<i>Alternaria
alternata</i>), maculosin, was found to be
the active ingredient in this host-specific pathogen of spotted knapweed, and
was synthesized in the laboratory [<a href="#187">187</a>,<a href="#198">198</a>]. Maculosin appears to be highly toxic only to spotted
knapweed and was being researched for potential field efficacy in 1993 [<a href="#130">130</a>], though no work has been completed to date
[<a href="#33">33</a>].</p>

<p>Grazing: Low to
moderate levels of grazing of spotted knapweed by cattle, domestic sheep, and
domestic goats have
been observed in Montana [<a href="#175">175</a>]. Of these, sheep seem to have the most promise
for control of spotted knapweed through prescribed grazing [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. Others suggest that
livestock grazing is not likely to seriously reduce spotted knapweed populations in native bunchgrass communities
because of its many other competitive attributes [<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>].
</p>

<p>Two consecutive years of
sheep grazing in May to early June and again in late
summer on 40 acres (16 ha) in western Montana heavily infested with spotted knapweed completely eliminated
spotted knapweed seed production,
and the sheep were healthy [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>]. Olson and others [<a href="#143">143</a>] observed that
1- and 2-year-old spotted knapweed plants
were effectively controlled by sheep grazing in Montana. Sheep grazing when grasses are
dormant can reduce potential negative impacts on associated grass species [<a href="#143">143</a>] and reduces density of very young
spotted knapweed seedlings, thereby limiting seedling
recruitment [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#175">175</a>]. Timing of
grazing is important, as sheep were observed to pass viable seed of spotted
knapweed up to 7 days after consumption [<a href="#220">220</a>].
</p>

<p>Chemical: Herbicides are
effective in gaining initial control of a new invasion or a severe infestation,
but are rarely a complete
or long-term solution to weed management. If chemical control is used it must
be incorporated into long-term management plans that include replacement of weeds
with desirable species, careful land use management, and prevention of new
infestations [<a href="#18">18</a>]. Use of herbicides may be limited in natural
areas. See the <a href="http://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/handbook.html">Weed Control Methods Handbook</a> for considerations on the use of herbicides
in natural areas and detailed information on specific chemicals.
</p>

<p>Chemical control of spotted knapweed can be
effective in some cases, but may be cost prohibitive because repeat applications are
usually necessary to exhaust the seedbank, and because spotted knapweed often infests large tracts of
marginal rangeland and rough terrain [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#168">168</a>,<a href="#209">209</a>].
It is important to consider not only the efficacy of the herbicide for control
of spotted
knapweed, but also its effects on non-target organisms (plants,
animals, aquatics, and invertebrates), the environmental persistence of the chemicals used, their
decomposition products, and the environmental effects of chemical contaminants
and other additives found in herbicide preparations. Chemical
control methods are the focus of considerable research. The following summary is
current as of July 2001: Clopyralid,
dicamba, picloram, and 2,4-D, alone and in combination, can effectively control
spotted knapweed on rangeland [<a href="#175">175</a>]. Each chemical or combination of chemicals
provides different degrees of control for varying periods of time
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>,<a href="#154">154</a>,<a href="#173">173</a>,<a href="#227">227</a>], has different effects on
non-target organisms [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#152">152</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>,<a href="#154">154</a>,<a href="#155">155</a>,<a href="#156">156</a>,<a href="#173">173</a>] (including biocontrol agents [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#193">193</a>,<a href="#215">215</a>]),
and has different degrees of environmental persistence [<a href="#222">222</a>]. Rate and timing of
application and site conditions (e.g. soil texture and precipitation) will
affect the degree of control, the impacts on non-target organisms, and the
persistence of the chemicals in the environment. </p>

<p>Germination of spotted knapweed seeds was not affected by the application of
wheat gluten meal at any rate [<a href="#47">47</a>].
Fertilization trials in western Montana using variable rates of nitrogen
fertilizer suggest that N fertilization alone is an impractical control
approach, and would likely contribute to an increase in spotted knapweed [<a href="#194">194</a>].</p>

<p>Prescribed burning in combination with herbicide application may increase the
efficacy of the herbicide and stimulate growth from competitive species. See the
&quot;Fire Management Considerations&quot; segment of the &quot;Fire
Effects&quot; section of this report for more information. A study examining the effect of the timing and frequency of grass
defoliation on spotted knapweed reinvasion in areas treated with picloram and fertilizer combinations found
increased densities of spotted knapweed at intermediate
fertilizer applications rates, and better grass growth at higher rates. Also, alternating spring/fall defoliation resulted in higher spotted knapweed density
and biomass than did annual spring or fall defoliation, while fall defoliation alone
appeared to be the best for minimizing spotted knapweed. The site with residual understory of
smooth brome and timothy was more responsive to picloram treatments than the site
which had a residual understory of Kentucky bluegrass, which was more affected by
fertilizer and clipping treatments [<a href="#75">75</a>].</p>

<p>Competition: Reducing spotted knapweed density on wildlife ranges without
filling the empty niches with more desirable forage and/or native species may encourage the proliferation
of other exotics that are less palatable and more toxic, spiny, or otherwise noxious
than spotted knapweed [<a href="#130">130</a>,<a href="#232">232</a>]. Temporary control of spotted knapweed is an
attainable objective; however, the subsequent establishment of a healthy
community of desirable plants is required for a more permanent solution
[<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#174">174</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>]. In a container study, competition with grass had a more
negative
effect on spotted knapweed growth than did either root herbivory or nitrogen shortage
[<a href="#184">184</a>]. A healthy,
weed-resistant plant community consists of a diverse group of species that
occupy diverse niches [<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>]. Establishing desirable species with diverse above- and
belowground growth can enhance resource capture by desirables on the site and
may limit exotic invasion.
In a growth chamber study of competition between spotted knapweed,
bluebunch wheatgrass and northern sweetvetch (<i>Hedysarum boreale</i>), Jacobs and Sheley
[<a href="#74">74</a>] found evidence to support the idea
that maintaining taprooted forbs along with grasses increases niche occupation
and may be more effective in minimizing invasion of taprooted weeds than
grasses alone.
</p>

<p>Due to the limited availability of seed from native species that are capable
of rapid development under stress conditions [<a href="#69">69</a>], natural revegetation of spotted knapweed infested rangelands often fails [<a href="#216">216</a>]. The initial level of spotted knapweed reduction
necessary to shift the competitive relationship between spotted knapweed and
bluebunch wheatgrass varies with location,
plant densities, and the initial composition and density of the suppressed grasses
[<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#174">174</a>]. Jacobs and others [<a href="#76">76</a>] provide evidence that establishment of bluebunch wheatgrass on spotted knapweed infested rangeland may
be improved by combining the fungus <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i> with dense grass seeding,
although the fungus has not been approved for use as a biocontrol agent to date.
</p>

<p>In areas
without a residual understory of desired plants, artificial revegetation is required
for effective control of spotted knapweed [<a href="#175">175</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>]. Revegetation of aggressive species has
been shown to inhibit reinvasion by spotted knapweed [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#175">175</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>]. In a controlled environment experiment, Lindquist and others
[<a href="#112">112</a>] found that smooth brome (an invasive species itself) is capable of suppressing the growth of spotted
knapweed, with the degree of suppression increasing with increasing nitrogen
levels. Bluebunch wheatgrass and Idaho fescue had no impact on spotted knapweed
growth [<a href="#184">184</a>]. Vigorous grass (especially
crested wheatgrass) slow knapweed invasion; however, the drought tolerance
and high seed production of spotted knapweed enable it to rapidly occupy dryland range,
especially if
grass
vigor is reduced by grazing [<a href="#60">60</a>]. Both 'Durar' hard fescue (<i>Festuca
trachyphylla</i>) and 'Covar' sheep fescue (<i>F. ovina</i>) are fairly aggressive
competitors with spotted knapweed in the Columbia River Basin, although both are
introduced grass species [<a href="#63">63</a>].
Reseeding may be limited by the challenge of achieving adequate seed coverage, which is
usually achieved by drilling and not feasible on most rangelands [<a href="#69">69</a>]. Some specific approaches to
controlling spotted knapweed by planting competitive species are given by Sheley
and others [<a href="#175">175</a>] and Velegala and others [<a href="#216">216</a>]. Combining herbicide
treatments with reseeding and/or fertilizer applications has met with some
success [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>,<a href="#177">177</a>].

GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS:</a>

<br />

Spotted knapweed is a non-native, perennial forb that can live at least 9 years.
Older plants (&gt;7 years of age) may have high incidence of root rot, indicating
senescence [<a href="#16">16</a>]. Once established, spotted knapweed is able to form
monotypic stands
because its age class hierarchy allows it to occupy all available niches [<a href="#175">175</a>].

<p>
Spotted knapweed has a deep, stout taproot and basal rosette
leaves that grow up to 8 inches (20 cm) long and 2 inches (5 cm) wide. Beginning
usually the 2nd year, each spotted knapweed plant
produces 1 to 6 flowering stems (15 or more
on older plants) that stand 8 inches to 4 feet (0.2 - 1.2 m) tall.
Leaves are alternate and grow smaller near the tops of the stems. Stems branch in the upper
half and bear terminal flowerheads that are 0.25 inch (6 mm) wide and 0.5 inch (12 mm)
long. Flowerheads are
solitary or borne in clusters of 2 or 3, with 25-30 flowers per head, and up to 60 flowering heads per plant
[<a href="#221">221</a>]. Achenes are oval, 1/8 inch (3 mm) long, bearing a pappus of
simple bristles which are less than the length of the seed (~1-2 mm) and persistent
[<a href="#176">176</a>]. Most stems remain erect after drying, with leaves and flowerhead bracts attached
[<a href="#87">87</a>].
</p>

<p>Early and deep fine root development, and the colonization of spotted knapweed 
roots by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, may contribute to its competitive 
dominance over native grasses [<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>] by allowing for greater resource 
acquisition. Chemical allelopathy of spotted and diffuse knapweeds has been 
suggested as a mechanism of interference of the growth of other herbaceous 
species [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>].</p>

Spotted knapweed reproduces almost entirely from seed. Plants are
also able to extend lateral shoots below the soil surface that form
rosettes adjacent to the parent plant, and multiple rosettes on
a single spotted knapweed root crown are common [<a href="#176">176</a>,<a href="#221">221</a>].<p class="subframeContent"> Flowering and pollination:
Spotted knapweed plants may remain in the rosette stage for 1 to 4 years,
producing flowering stems the 2nd year [<a href="#221">221</a>] or later [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>]. Flowering during the year of
seedling emergence is rare [<a href="#168">168</a>]. Boggs and Story [<a href="#16">16</a>] observed
the percentage of flowering plants increasing with age up to 5 to 7 years, with little
or no
flowering in the 1st and 2nd years, in Montana. Flowers are pollinated by insects [<a href="#221">221</a>], and
spotted knapweed is
heavily visited by several species of bees [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#221">221</a>]. Large pollen counts in late July and early
August in the Missoula Valley, Montana, suggest that spotted knapweed is also wind
pollinated [<a href="#44">44</a>]. Fertilization in spotted knapweed requires cross-pollination between flowers on different plants
(obligately xenogamous). This can limit the reproductive success of isolated
individuals, but it also promotes
genetic diversity, and may thereby improve competitive ability
[<a href="#64">64</a>].<p class="subframeContent">
Seed production: The number of seeds produced by an individual knapweed plant or
a population of plants is highly variable between plants, sites, and years.
Reported averages of seed production per plant range from about 65 seeds per
plant in Montana [<a href="#73">73</a>] to 400-900 seeds under range conditions in
British Columbia [<a href="#221">221</a>], and about 2,000 seeds per plant, averaged across
diverse sites in Washington and Idaho [<a href="#168">168</a>]. A population of plants
may produce about 5,000 to 40,000 seeds/m<sup>2</sup>/year [<a href="#176">176</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>]. Schirman [<a href="#168">168</a>] reported an average of 23.8 to
61.1 flowerstems per m<sup>2</sup>, 11.2 to 16.8 seedheads per stem, and 24.3 to 33 seeds per head,
producing 11,300 to 29,600 seeds
per m<sup>2 </sup>in Washington and Idaho. Similar stem and seed densities were observed in
Glacier
National Park, Montana [<a href="#207">207</a>]. Only about 0.1% of the seed produced under these
conditions would be needed to maintain the size of the stands observed [<a href="#168">168</a>].<p class="subframeContent">The following data were collected
on Idaho fescue-bluebunch wheatgrass habitat types in Montana [<a href="#73">73</a>]:<br><br>

<p> The number of seeds
produced may vary with site conditions (available moisture, nutrient
availability and competition), herbivory and seed predation, and age of plants. Site conditions and precipitation during the growing season
probably have the
greatest effect on the number of seeds produced each year, with more seeds
produced during wet years [<a href="#168">168</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>] and on wetter sites [<a href="#73">73</a>]. Schirman [<a href="#168">168</a>] reported a reduction in the number of viable seeds per
head in dry years and an increase in the
number of flowerheads per stem in wet years. On an irrigated
site,
spotted knapweed
produced an average of 25,260 seeds per plant, compared to about 680 seeds per
plant under range conditions in British Columbia [<a href="#221">221</a>]. Adult density also appears to be
sensitive to spring precipitation [<a href="#73">73</a>]. Maternal treatment (control, herbivory, herbivory +
nutrient shortage, and herbivory +nutrient shortage + grass competition)
affected physiology, morphology, growth, and size of maternal plants and the
numbers of seeds produced, but did not affect the mass or quality of seeds and
offspring produced [<a href="#223">223</a>]. In Glacier National Park, seed production is 3 to 4 times
higher in plants immediately adjacent to the road than in plants on adjacent grassland [<a href="#207">207</a>].<p class="subframeContent"> Seed predation may be an important
factor in seed production. The seed production numbers reported by Schirman
[<a href="#168">168</a>] in 1973 through 1976 were measured before the
introduction of <i>Urophora affinis </i>and <i>U. quadrifasciata</i>. Jacobs and
Sheley
[<a href="#73">73</a>] reported
in 1998 that 90% of the seedheads collected in their study were infested with
larva of these insects. Shirman [<a href="#168">168</a>] consistently found 2 to 10 times the seed production in his study,
compared with Jacobs and Sheley [<a href="#73">73</a>]. Differences in seed production may be
attributable to differences in precipitation and/or seed predation between
sites and years [<a href="#73">73</a>]. Harris [<a href="#62">62</a>] reports similar findings
and notes that prior to the release of biocontrol agents in British Columbia, Watson and Renney
[<a href="#221">221</a>] reported an average
of 26.6 seeds per head, whereas
in 1986 Harris [<a href="#62">62</a>] observed an average of 15.4 seeds/head.<p class="subframeContent">Seed
dispersal: As soon as bracts open, any movement of the stem
(e.g. by wind or passing animals) expels the loosely held seeds from the head
with a flicking action. The seeds usually land within 3 to 4 feet (0.9-1.2 m) of the parent plant [<a href="#132">132</a>,<a href="#175">175</a>,<a href="#221">221</a>]. In this way, spotted knapweed populations spread outward and downwind from the
perimeter of existing stands [<a href="#161">161</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>,<a href="#221">221</a>]. Dispersal
of achenes over long distances is facilitated by animals and birds. Wallander
and others [<a href="#220">220</a>] show that both domestic sheep and mule deer
excrete viable seeds of spotted knapweed in their feces for 7 to 10 days
after consumption, respectively. Seeds mixed with soil and mud may be carried by vehicles or other
equipment that, in turn, create an ideal seedbed for spotted knapweed
establishment [<a href="#161">161</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>,<a href="#221">221</a>]. Spread of seeds on logging trucks, off-road vehicles, and
trail bikes
has contributed
greatly to the spread of knapweed into new areas in British Columbia [<a href="#196">196</a>].
Spotted knapweed seeds can also be transported in rivers and other watercourses, and in crop seed and
hay [<a href="#175">175</a>].</p> 

<p>Seed banking: Spotted knapweed seeds are known for their longevity and
durability.
They have a thick, durable pericarp that protects the
seeds but does not restrict water imbibition or water loss [<a href="#30">30</a>].
Nolan and Upadhyaya [<a href="#132">132</a>] determined that a portion of the spotted knapweed seed population
requires exposure to red light to germinate. This light requirement may permit
buried seeds to remain dormant for an extended period of time [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>]. Experimental evidence indicates that spotted knapweed seeds can remain
viable but dormant after 5 years of burial [<a href="#29">29</a>]. Perez and others [<a href="#147">147</a>] observed evidence of
seed banking of spotted
knapweed in the
Nebraska sandhills prairie.</p>

<p>
When seed production was controlled with herbicide treatments at 2 other heavily infested spotted knapweed
sites in Montana, the spotted knapweed seed bank decreased by 72 to 81% after 15
months [<a href="#23">23</a>]. After 7 years, only 5% of the original seed bank
remained, leaving about 160,000 viable seeds per acre (400,000
seeds/ha, or about 4 viable seeds per 0.09 m<sup>2</sup>) [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>]. Seedlings showed a
decline in vigor associated with length of burial [<a href="#23">23</a>].</p>

<p>Germination: Spotted knapweed
seeds have the potential for germination shortly after maturity, and
approximately 90% are viable upon dispersal [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#168">168</a>]. However, many studies indicate a dormancy period for some portion of the
annual seed crop. For example, Watson and
Renney [<a href="#221">221</a>] observed an increase in germination from 40 to 80% after 25 days
of dry storage. Similarly, reports of low germination and emergence under field
conditions range from 65 to 85% of the seed crop ungerminated but viable the year
following dispersal [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#168">168</a>]. This period of dormancy may
be released by seed aging, cool-moist stratification, freezing [<a href="#34">34</a>], or exposure to red light
[<a href="#132">132</a>]. Nolan
and Upadyaya [<a href="#132">132</a>] describe 3 distinct types of germination behavior in spotted
knapweed seed, a phenomenon that distributes seed germination over time by facilitating the
incorporation of seeds into a seed bank.<p class="subframeContent">Spotted
knapweed seeds
germinate whenever moisture and temperature are suitable, and both fall and spring seedling emergence is common. Optimal temperatures for germination range from 45 to
93 degrees Fahrenheit (7-34 &deg;C), and germination is best at 66 degrees Fahrenheit (19 &deg;C)
[<a href="#221">221</a>]. Spotted knapweed seeds required at least 55% soil moisture to
initiate emergence. Germination increases with
increased soil moisture, and 65-70% soil moisture
content is optimum for germination [<a href="#183">183</a>]. Dormancy may prevent
germination at
higher temperatures when soil moisture status is
fluctuating, and at lower temperatures when germination in late fall may make
seedlings susceptible to winter kill. Germination after cold stratification
provides a strategy for spring emergence and avoidance of environmental extremes
[<a href="#34">34</a>]. Canopy cover had no effect
on emergence rate, with spotted knapweed germinating equally well over a range from
0-100% canopy cover, as simulated in a laboratory experiment [<a href="#183">183</a>]. Spotted
knapweed seeds can germinate in light and dark, with maximum germination in alternating light and
dark periods. Optimum germination occurs with the seeds at the soil surface, and decreases with depth, with little
germination below 2 inches (5 cm) [<a href="#183">183</a>,<a href="#221">221</a>].
Because of the bare interspace areas between plants and seasonal periods of
drought, bunchgrass rangeland provides favorable microsites for spotted knapweed seed germination
[<a href="#132">132</a>].</p>

<p>Seedling survival:
Spotted knapweed seedling survival depends primarily on environmental
conditions at the time of emergence and establishment.
Seed
weight was positively correlated with initial growth,
but its influence decreased over time and disappeared after 8 weeks. Competition
(with meadow ryegrass (<i>Lolium</i> <i>pratense</i>)) did not influence
growth of spotted knapweed seedlings during early weeks, but strongly suppressed growth after 9 weeks
[<a href="#223">223</a>]. Spotted knapweed seedling survival is poor when conditions are dry following emergence
[<a href="#221">221</a>], and survival is enhanced if precipitation coincides
with the time of seedling emergence [<a href="#168">168</a>]. Seedling mortality averages 12%, but can be as high as 55% under dry
conditions [<a href="#176">176</a>,<a href="#221">221</a>]. Seedlings emerging in April in Idaho and Washington had a high rate of survival, with most
plants flowering the following growing season. Seedlings emerging after May 15 had
a very low survival rate and almost no flowerstem production the following
season [<a href="#168">168</a>].</p>

<p class="subframeContent">

<br />

Spotted knapweed establishes and dominates on dry, disturbed sites, especially
along
roads [<a href="#161">161</a>,<a href="#169">169</a>,<a href="#208">208</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>,<a href="#221">221</a>]. In western Montana, the success of spotted knapweed
increases with site disturbance and soil moisture stress. Disturbance intensity
has the greatest influence in habitat types moister than the Douglas-fir group,
with coarse soil texture and steep slopes adding to success. In grass and shrub
habitat types, south aspect and disturbance intensity are important variables
for spotted knapweed success [<a href="#229">229</a>]. Spotted knapweed is well adapted to open forested
areas, especially after logging or other disturbances [<a href="#39">39</a>].

<p>Spotted knapweed is found on soils with a wide range of chemical and physical
properties [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#221">221</a>], and often on poor soils [<a href="#217">217</a>].
It does especially well in coarse-textured soils [<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>] that are well-drained with low water holding capacity
[<a href="#57">57</a>]. Spotted knapweed is well adapted to Montana
rangelands with &quot;light-textured&quot; soils that receive summer rainfall. In northeastern Washington, it is
usually found on glacial till and outwash soils [<a href="#161">161</a>]. Spotted knapweed is poorly adapted
to irrigated pastures where saturated soil is common [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#221">221</a>], and does not compete well with
vigorously growing grass in moist sites [<a href="#60">60</a>]. However, in central Washington spotted knapweed thrives in irrigated
land, although it is also found growing on compacted soil
in a 10 inch (254 mm) precipitation zone [<a href="#161">161</a>].</p>

<p>Spotted knapweed has been observed at elevations
ranging from 1,900 to 9,975 feet (578-3,040 m) and in precipitation zones ranging from
7 to 79 inches (200-2000 mm) [<a href="#97">97</a>]. Some general ranges by area

<p>In Montana, spotted knapweed is most abundant between
4,000 and 6,000 feet (1,219-1,829 m) in elevation and 10 to 80 inches (250-2,030
mm) precipitation and in areas with
50-120 frost-free days [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>]. In British
Columbia, spotted knapweed is more common below 2,950 feet (900 m) on south-facing slopes
[<a href="#124">124</a>].
</p>

<p>Spotted knapweed not only readily occupies disturbed
sites, but it also invades relatively
undisturbed perennial native plant communities in the northern Intermountain
region [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#175">175</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#208">208</a>], and invades wilderness areas all over Montana [<a href="#95">95</a>]. In Glacier National Park, spotted knapweed
colonized undisturbed rough fescue grasslands adjacent to roadside spotted knapweed infestations [<a href="#207">207</a>]. The frequent breaks in cover,
which provide favorable light conditions for seed germination, and the warm-dry
climate of these grassland ecosystems appear to facilitate invasion of spotted
knapweed and other alien species [<a href="#132">132</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>].

Spotted knapweed usually emerges shortly after disturbance, especially when
overstory species are removed. In western Montana, for example, when the dominant species from the ponderosa pine/red-osier dogwood or the black cottonwood/red-osier dogwood
riparian site types have been removed, spotted knapweed invades [<a href="#57">57</a>]. Spotted knapweed seeds are able to germinate under full canopy
[<a href="#183">183</a>],
but mature plants are uncommon in shaded areas [<a href="#221">221</a>]. Spotted knapweed is typically found under open

Yellowstone National Park, spotted knapweed was always found under &lt;20% canopy cover, and
75% of its occurrence was under &lt;5% canopy cover [<a href="#4">4</a>]. In a grand
fir/queencup-beadlily (<i>Clintonia
uniflora</i>) habitat type in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, spotted knapweed occurred in a 15-year-old stand but not in a 185-year-old stand [<a href="#181">181</a>].

presents a replacement series of weedy species in the Intermountain Region in which summer annuals are
replaced by winter annuals (e.g. Russian thistle (<i>Salsola kali</i>) is replaced by cheatgrass), and
the earlier winter annuals are replaced by the later maturing ones (e.g.
cheatgrass is replaced by medusahead (<i>Taeniatherum caput-medusae</i>) or knapweeds
(<i>Centaurea</i>  spp.)).

Spotted knapweed seeds germinate in the fall and early spring and develop into
rosettes, though most recruitment is between April and June [<a href="#73">73</a>]. Most
root growth occurs during this stage [<a href="#221">221</a>].&nbsp;

<p>
Spotted knapweed overwinters as rosettes or as seeds. Rosette mortality may occur under extreme
winter conditions. In the Intermountain West, rosettes that overwinter bolt in early May
[<a href="#176">176</a>,<a href="#221">221</a>]. Seeds that overwinter germinate in early
spring. Early spring growth gives spotted knapweed a competitive
advantage over many natives for soil moisture and mineral nutrients [<a href="#110">110</a>]. Flowering buds are formed in
early June and flowering occurs from July through September. Mature seeds are formed
by mid-August. Spotted knapweed flowerheads that are not infested with larvae open
after they dry, about 2 to 3 weeks after seeds mature, usually in late summer
[<a href="#161">161</a>], from mid-August
through mid-September [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>]. Most seeds are
shed upon maturity; very few overwinter in seedheads [<a href="#176">176</a>]. At 2
sites in Montana, seed rain occurred during August and
September, with 30 to 62% of the seeds produced reaching the soil surface by
October [<a href="#73">73</a>]. Rosettes that do not bolt die back to the root crown, which serves as the
perennating part of the plant over winter [<a href="#175">175</a>].&nbsp;
</p>

<p>In Virginia, flowering of spotted knapweed occurs from June through August or even
in November, and fruiting occurs from mid-June to November [<a href="#120">120</a>].
In the Adirondacks, spotted knapweed flowers 19 July to 20 August [<a href="#93">93</a>].

Spotted knapweed has a large, perennial taproot and survives after fire if the root crown
is not killed. It also produces large quantities of seed that can survive fire.<p class="subframeContent">Spotted knapweed
occurs primarily in bunchgrass and open ponderosa pine forest community types in
the Intermountain West, especially Montana.
The historical fire regimes of these communities were relatively frequent, low-severity surface
fires. Spotted knapweed did not occur in these communities at the time in which these fire regimes were functioning,
but has established since fire exclusion began. It is unclear
how this type of fire regime might affect spotted knapweed populations. It
is also unclear how the presence of spotted knapweed might affect these fire
regimes, though it has been observed that spotted knapweed does not carry fire
as readily as grasses. Therefore, dense knapweed infestations can change the
fire regime by changing the fuel characteristics and thus reducing the fire
return interval at a given site [<a href="#122">122</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>].<br><br>

Low-severity fire will not kill spotted knapweed plants or
seeds [<a href="#172">172</a>]. Fire will top-kill spotted knapweed and stress the plant, however
the sturdy perennial taproot can survive and resprout. Severe burns may
reduce germination of spotted knapweed seeds [<a href="#1">1</a>].&nbsp;

In a greenhouse study using seeds from a spotted knapweed infested site in
Michigan, germination of spotted knapweed
seeds was significantly (p&lt;0.05) reduced in seeds exposed to 200&deg; C for 120
seconds or more, and for seeds exposed to 400&deg; C for 30 seconds or more [<a href="#1">1</a>].

<p class="subframeContent">

<a name="PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE">

</span>
<br /> 

Fires are said to create the type of disturbance that promotes the colonization of
knapweeds by creating areas of bare soil and increasing the amount of sunlight
that reaches the ground surface [<a href="#176">176</a>]. Spotted knapweed plants present before
burning may resprout from root crowns,
and seedlings may emerge from the seed bank or invade bare ground from an
off-site seed source following fire.


Spotted knapweed is one of the introduced species mentioned as
&quot;taking over large tracts of logged, burned, or otherwise disturbed lands
in British Columbia&quot; [<a href="#204">204</a>]. Olson [<a href="#138">138</a>] observes that spotted knapweed is seldom
negatively impacted by fire. For example, spotted
knapweed cover and density increased and desirable
species were unaffected after prescribed burning on mountain grassland in
northeastern Washington [<a href="#172">172</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>]. Conversely, prescribed fire and spot- burning on prairie and dune sites in Michigan have
been used successfully to stimulate native vegetation and reduce
cover of spotted knapweed [<a href="#122">122</a>]. 

</p>

<br />


Differences in the observed response of spotted knapweed to fire may be regional,
may differ with the density of the infestation, may be
different in low fire severity versus high fire severity microsites, and in spring versus fall
burns. 

</p>

<p>On prairie sites in Michigan with low to moderate
spotted knapweed density and sufficient fine fuels to carry a fire, annual
spring broadcast burning under severe conditions (when humidity and
dead fine fuel moisture are as low as possible) serves to reduce spotted knapweed populations and increase the competitiveness of
the native prairie vegetation. On some sites, 3 years of this regimen reduced
spotted knapweed to the point where it could be controlled by hand-pulling
individuals and increasing the fire return interval to 3-5 years. In dense
infestations (&gt;60 rosettes/m<sup>2</sup>), broadcast burning is
ineffective due to lack of adequate fuel to carry the fire. In this case,
spotted knapweed plants can be killed with repeated spot- burning (using a
propane torch) of individuals and resprouts 3 to 4 times during the growing
season until root reserves are depleted. Top-killing individuals allows
seedlings to emerge in the time between burning treatments, so they are also
killed with subsequent burning, thus depleting the seed bank. This treatment
does not seem to harm existing prairie natives, but
newly-germinating natives may be at risk, and seeding after the last burning may help
them to recover [<a href="#122">122</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
In
Douglas-fir-ponderosa pine communities in western Montana, spotted knapweed cover increased after spring prescribed fires with both high and
low fuel consumption following shelterwood cuts. Fuel moisture and

<p>Spotted knapweed was present on these sites before
treatments were carried out, probably as a result of soil scarification during
logging activities, as well as big game and livestock use of the site prior to
these studies. Also, the harvesting done as a part of this study resulted in
scarification of about 11% of the area, which evidently encouraged spotted
knapweed establishment. Burning, especially high consumption, seems to further encourage the
spread of spotted knapweed. Severe wildfire (as might occur if fuels
are allowed to accumulate) would also probably favor expansion of knapweed
[<a href="#8">8</a>].</p>

<p>
Spotted
knapweed was reported on a Douglas-fir forest site 5 to 10 years after wildfire
in western Montana, though it was not recorded 3 years after the fire. No

After fall prescribed burning at a western Montana site in a
Douglas-fir/ninebark habitat type dominated by snowbush ceanothus (<i>Ceanothus

<p>After a spring burn of lesser intensity on an adjacent
site, no spotted knapweed was recorded before or after burning. Shrubs recovered faster and grasses
increased on the spring burn, while herbaceous cover recovered faster and
nongraminoid, herbaceous species increased on the fall burn [<a href="#134">134</a>].

<br />

It is thought that fire has little potential for
spotted knapweed control, because small areas are left unburned and fires are not
usually hot enough to eliminate all of the viable seed in the soil or to prevent
root crowns from resprouting [<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>,<a href="#175">175</a>]. Repeated burning of prairie and dune
sites in Michigan was, however, successful at encouraging the growth of native vegetation
and reducing spotted knapweed density [<a href="#122">122</a>]. Experimental evidence is, however, limited.&nbsp; 

<p> It has also been suggested
that burning prior to herbicide application can increase the efficacy of the
herbicide and stimulate new growth from competitive species [<a href="#176">176</a>].&nbsp;A study in western Montana, where dry conditions following burning limited spring
germination of knapweed prior to the herbicide application, did not support this
assertion [<a href="#21">21</a>], while results from Washington state supported the efficacy of
burning prior to herbicide treatment [<a href="#172">172</a>]. A more recent project was begun in
the fall of 1996 on the Lolo National Forest in western Montana, in which
herbicide treatments were coupled with prescribed burning to improve habitat for
elk. Prescribed burning in April 1997, followed by aerial application of picloram
in June 1997 resulted in a 95% decrease in weed biomass (primarily spotted
knapweed with small amounts of common mullein (<i>Verbascum thapsis</i>) and leafy
spurge (<i>Euphorbia esula</i>)), an 86% decrease in
native forb biomass, and a 714% increase in grass biomass as of July 1998
[<a href="#66">66</a>].&nbsp;The area was retreated in 1999 with a lower concentration of
picloram that was successful in killing spotted knapweed plants missed in 1997
and in killing the young knapweed that had sprouted after the original
treatments. The end results to date suggest that the treatments were successful
at reducing spotted knapweed cover and increasing native grass cover, although
native forb density decreased and compositional changes were not recorded
[<a href="#94">94</a>]. 
</p>

<p>Rice [<a href="#157">157</a>] suggests controlling weeds (including spotted knapweed) with
herbicides before reintroducing fire for the restoration of native plant
communities, to avoid increasing the weed problem by using fire alone. A study
is underway in western Montana comparing different combinations and timing of
prescribed burning and herbicide
applications [<a href="#158">158</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
Prescribed burning of spotted knapweed can be
difficult, especially if no fine grass fuels are present,
because fire does not usually carry through spotted knapweed stems easily. Grass fuel models work poorly for spotted knapweed
unless
associated grasses exceed 40-50% cover [<a href="#235">235</a>]. Spotted
knapweed fuel loading varies between sites, thus
affecting fire behavior. Intense
fires in spotted knapweed have been observed under some conditions, and prescribed burning in spotted
knapweed for
fire hazard reduction may be a consideration [<a href="#234">234</a>].</p>

<p>A fuel model for spotted knapweed and guidelines for prescribed burning are available
[<a href="#234">234</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>]. Calculation of
fuel load is based on knapweed plant height and percentage of ground cover (old,
standing plants and new plants), and
litter depth and cover (including sparse grasses) [<a href="#234">234</a>]. The model
was developed for early spring burns, and is valid only under specific fine fuel loading
conditions. It is offered as a guideline to help the user select environmental
conditions (wind, dead fuel moisture) that allow safe and effective burns.
Fire managers familiar with fire modelling can create their own site-specific models for knapweed
infestations using this general knapweed fuel model as it is summarized by Xanthopoulos
[<a href="#234">234</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>].
</p>

<p> When prescribed burning in spotted
knapweed for
fire hazard reduction in spring, sustaining a fire that carries without
interruption and without risk of escape generally requires a predicted flame length of at least 20 cm
(using a fuel model that does not include standing knapweed), and a controllable flame length
less than 120 cm (as predicted using a complete fuel model).
Fire behavior problems caused by discontinuous and nonuniform fuels
are similar to the ones found in big sagebrush.
Use these models with caution, since they have been verified with few actual test
burns in spotted knapweed [<a href="#234">234</a>].

<p>The USDA Forest Service's &quot;Guide to Noxious Weed
Prevention Practices&quot; [<a href="#210">210</a>] provides several fire management
considerations for weed prevention in general that apply to spotted knapweed. To prevent
infestation, re-establish vegetation on bare ground as soon as possible using
either natural recovery or artificial techniques as appropriate to site
objectives. When reseeding after wildfires and prescribed burns use only certified weed-free seed. Monitor the burn site and associated disturbed areas after the fire and the following spring for emergence of
spotted knapweed, and treat to eradicate any emergent spotted knapweed plants.
Regulate
human, pack animal, and livestock entry into burned areas at risk for weed
invasion until desirable site vegetation has recovered sufficiently to resist weed
invasion. 
</p>

<p>Additionally, when planning a prescribed burn,
preinventory the project area and evaluate cover and phenology of any spotted
knapweed present on or adjacent to the site, and avoid ignition and burning in areas at high risk
for spotted knapweed establishment or spread due to fire effects. Avoid creating soil conditions that promote weed
germination and establishment. Discuss weed status
and risks in burn rehabilitation plans. Also, wildfire managers might consider
including weed prevention education and providing weed identification
aids during fire training; avoiding known weed
infestations when locating fire lines; monitoring camps, staging areas,
helibases, etc., to be sure they are kept weed free; taking care that equipment is weed free;
incorporating weed prevention into fire rehabilitation plans; and acquiring restoration
funding. Additional guidelines and specific recommendations and requirements are
available [<a href="#210">210</a>].
