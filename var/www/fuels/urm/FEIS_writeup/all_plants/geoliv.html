<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of northern comandra is Geocaulon
lividum (Richardson) Fern. (Santalaceae) [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  There are no
recognized subspecies, varieties, or forms.

Forb

<b>FEDERAL LEGAL STATUS : </b>
See OTHER STATUS

<b>OTHER STATUS : </b>
The Montana Natural Heritage Program lists northern comandra as globally
secure (G4) but imperiled in Montana (S2) because of rarity or because
other factors make it vulnerable to extirpation [<a href="#20">20</a>].  The U.S.  Forest
Service classifies northern comandra as sensitive in Montana; it has
been located on the Flathead and Kootenai National Forests [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Northern comandra is included on Maine's list of Plant Species of
Special Concern [<a href="#43">43</a>] and is considered threatened in New Hampshire [<a href="#40">40</a>];
however, it is widespread in the Mahoosuc Range on the Maine-New
Hampshire border [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  It is also threatened in New York and has
been assigned a state rank of S1 (critically imperiled in New York state
because of extreme rarity or is extremely vulnerable to extirpation from
New York State due to biological factors) [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Northern comandra
was known from a single site in Vermont, a tiny bog on Mt. Mansfield,
but has not been found since 1901 and is now presumed extirpated in that
state [<a href="#40">40</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Northern comandra is not listed as a dominant or codominant understory
species in available publications.

Species commonly associated with northern comandra throughout its range
include American green alder (Alnus viridis ssp. crispa), bog Labrador
tea (Ledum groenlandicum), bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi), willow
(Salix spp.), crowberry (Empetrum nigrum), twinflower (Linnaea
borealis), prickly rose (Rosa acicularis), mountain cranberry (Vaccinium
vitis-idaea), bog blueberry (Vaccinium uliginosum), highbush cranberry
(Viburnum edule), bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), one-sided wintergreen
(Pyrola secunda), bluejoint reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis),

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Geocaulon lividum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Northern comandra is a perennial, hemiparasitic forb.  It has creeping
rhizomes, located in the humus layer of the soil.  The leafy stems are 4
to 12 inches (10-30 cm) tall.  The inflorescence is a cymule with two to
three green or purple flowers.  The central flower is perfect, but the
others have stamens only.  The fruit is a one-seeded, orange drupe
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].

Northern comandra is a root parasite that forms haustoria (lateral
outgrowths of the root) which connect it to a host's roots or rhizomes.
The haustoria are white when young but become brown with age.  They have
been described in detail.  Some host genera include spruce (Picea spp.),
pine (Pinus spp.), birch (Betula spp.), willow (Salix spp.), alder
(Alnus spp.), and twinflower (Linnaea spp.).  A more complete list of
host genera is available [<a href="#36">36</a>].

Northern comandra is difficult to distinguish from low sweet
blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) varieties, and from bog blueberry
(V.  uliginosum var. alpinum) [<a href="#29">29</a>].  It also closely resembles bastard
toadflax (Comandra umbellata) [<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Northern comandra presumably reproduces by seed and sprouting from
rhizomes.  However, specific information on regeneration is not
available in the literature.  Zasada [<a href="#39">39</a>] stated that undisturbed
feathermoss mats may inhibit germination of northern comandra seeds, but
not vegetative reproduction.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Northern comandra is found in bogs and moist coniferous or deciduous
woods [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  It often occupies acid or sterile soils and damp
sands [<a href="#26">26</a>].  In British Columbia, northern comandra is an indicator of
continental boreal and cool temperate climates and nitrogen-poor soils.
It is found in montane to subalpine coniferous forests [<a href="#17">17</a>].  In New
England, northern comandra is found from sea level to 4,100 feet (1,200
m) elevation [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Populations in Montana are found in moist
spruce (Picea spp.) forests, often bordering wetland areas, from 3,000
to 3,300 feet (900-1,000 m) elevation [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Northern comandra is found in both open and closed, mature white spruce
and black spruce forests in Alaska that range in age from 70 to over 180
years [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].

Northern comandra often occupies bottomland spruce-hardwood forests on
floodplains of the taiga of Alaska.  It is found in balsam poplar
(Populus balsamifera) and black cottonwood (P. trichocarpa) stands with
thick shrub understories that follow the initial shrub (alder and
willow) stage after flooding.  These stands are usually present for 20
to 100 years and are then replaced by white spruce if subsequent
flooding has not occurred.  Northern comandra persists through the
spruce stage and can be found in closed white spruce stands with a thick
feathermoss mat.  Greatest cover is reached in later successional stages
such as in open white spruce stands (250+ years old), and in black
spruce stands on older terraces above the active floodplain [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Northern comandra flowers from May to August [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Geocaulon lividum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Little information is available on northern comandra fire survival
strategies.  It probably survives fire by sprouting from buried
rhizomes.  Since fires in riparian and mesic sites are often
discontinuous, northern comandra may also colonize from unburned
patches.

Northern comandra is present in black spruce and jack pine woodlands
that result from fire and have a fire return interval of less than 100
years, and often as little as 50 years [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].



<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Geocaulon lividum

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Northern comandra is probably top-killed by most fires.  Survival of
rhizomes is dependent on depth of burial and fire severity.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>

<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Northern comandra is found in postfire communities in the taiga of
interior Alaska.  It may be present after fire in white spruce forests
on floodplains and river terraces on sites that are well drained, or in
black spruce forests that are poorly drained and underlain by
permafrost.  Northern comandra generally appears early in postfire
succession, increases slowly, and reaches greatest cover in late
successional, spruce-dominated forest.  Mean percent frequency (f) and
cover (c) of northern comandra in postfire communities on white spruce
or black spruce sites follow [<a href="#10">10</a>]:

In northeast Alaska, northern comandra was present on one of four sites
in postfire year 4 following the Porcupine River Fire of August, 1950.
The fire had burned all or most of the undecomposed material present and
was considered "severe" on the site where northern comandra was found.
Northern comandra was present in postfire years 7 and 11, but was not
reported in postfire years 23 or 31 [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Northern comandra had the following percent frequency and cover in
severely burned stands after the Wickersham Dome Fire near Fairbanks,
Alaska in June of 1971 [<a href="#33">33</a>]:

In postfire succession in white spruce, black spruce, and balsam fir
(Abies balsamifera) stands on Isle Royale, Michigan, northern comandra
increases with stand age.  It remains relatively unimportant in stands
less than 100 years old, then steadily increases until stands reach 200+
years of age [<a href="#16">16</a>].
