<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of common cattail is Typha
latifolia L. [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  

In North America, the cattail family Typhaceae consists of a single
genus with three species:

  Typha latifolia L. - common cattail
  Typha angustifolia L. - narrow-leaved cattail
  Typha domingensis Pers. - Dominican cattail

The distributions of these species overlap considerably in the
contiguous United States.  Wherever two species occur together, hybrids
are common, especially in habitats with variable water levels [<a href="#39">39</a>].
Typha latifolia x T. angustifolia hybrids (T. X glauca Godr.), commonly
known as hybrid or glaucus cattail, are especially common in the Midwest
and may develop extensive pure stands by rhizomatous growth [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].
Common cattail also hybridizes with Dominican cattail.  Hybrids are
almost always intermediate morphologically between the parental species.

This report focuses primarily on common cattail.  However, since hybrid
cattail is ecologically similar, information on it has been incorporated
into some slots.  When used, the reader will be alerted that the
information pertains specifically to hybrid cattail.

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Typha latifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Common cattail is generally considered a poor livestock and big game
forage [<a href="#8">8</a>].  These animals rarely graze common cattail unless upland
forage becomes scarce [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Common cattail rhizomes and basal portions are an important food of
muskrat, nutria, and geese [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  For ducks, however, common
cattail is of little value as food or cover.  It is considered an
undesirable weed in marshes managed primarily for ducks [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  The
seeds are too small to be an important bird food source, but are eaten
by a few species, mainly the green-winged teal, semipalmated sandpiper,
and Canada goose, snow goose, and tule goose [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability of common cattail foliage is low for wild ungulates and
livestock [<a href="#8">8</a>].  The starchy rhizomes and root stocks are palatable to
geese, muskrat, and nutria [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Common cattail's forage value is highest in the early spring, when
protein content may reach 15 percent of dry weight.  However, its forage
quality declines rapidly, and by summer it is usually a poor source of
energy and protein [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The structure and density of common cattail stands affect their
usefulness as waterfowl nesting cover.  Breeding ducks rarely nest in
dense cattail stands that cover vast expanses of marsh, but are attracted
to wetlands where open water and cattail cover are well interspersed
[<a href="#19">19</a>].  Murkin and others [<a href="#31">31</a>] reported that cattail cover for nesting
dabbling ducks was best when open water and common cattail stands
covered roughly equal areas.  These researchers found that the number of
nesting duck pairs increased greatly when large stands were cut in
checkerboard patterns to produce a 50:50 water-cover ratio.

Common cattail provides favored nesting sites for the red-winged
blackbird, yellow-headed blackbird, and marsh wren [<a href="#26">26</a>].  In the Horicon
Marsh in southeastern Wisconsin, hybrid cattail (T. X glauca) stands
were used extensively for nesting by the ruddy duck, redhead, sora,
Virginia rail, least and American bittern, and common gallinule [<a href="#3">3</a>].
Similarly, the ruddy duck and readhead were the principal duck species
nesting in common cattail marshes in Utah [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Common cattail provides an excellent hut building material for muskrat
[<a href="#26">26</a>].  Deer sometimes use common cattail for hiding cover [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Cattail leaves and stems have been used around the world as bedding,
thatching, and matting, and in the manufacture of baskets, boats and
rafts, shoes, ropes, and paper.  In recent years, cattail has been
proposed as a biomass crop for renewable energy [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  Total biomass
in southeastern Wisconsin hybrid cattail (T. X glauca) stands reached 15
tons per acre (33.6 t/ha) [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Native Americans used common cattail as food.  Rhizomes were dried and
ground into flour or eaten as cooked vegetables; young stems were eaten
raw or cooked; and immature fruiting spikes were eaten after roasting
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  The leaves were woven for matting and the "soft down" from
ripe fruiting heads was used as padding and in diapers [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Common cattail is considered a weed on some irrigated agricultural lands
and in managed waterfowl production areas.  On agricultural lands it
invades irrigation canals, farm ponds, and drainage ditches, impeding
water flow and increasing siltation [<a href="#12">12</a>].  In marshes managed for
waterfowl, it often forms dense stands which provide poor nesting
habitat [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Control measures include:  (1) drawdown to reduce cattail
and allow the establishment of species preferred by waterfowl, (2)
cutting plants below the soil or water surface, (3) crushing, which
immediately opens up stands making the surface water available to ducks,
(4) spraying with herbicides, (5) burning [see Fire Management
Considerations], and (6) cutting, crushing, spraying, or burning in
combination with water level manipulation [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  For best
results treatment should take place when carbohydrate reserves are at a
minimum.  This period, when common cattail is most susceptible to
injury, occurs when the pistillate and staminate portions of the spike
are lime green and dark green, respectively [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Furthermore, because a
portion of cattail leaves must protrude above the water surface for
normal gas exchange to take place, regrowth following control measures
is effectively eliminated if plants are kept completely submerged
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  On marshes where water levels can be manipulated, a combination
of drawdown followed by the control treatment and rapid reflooding
results in the greatest cattail mortality.

Because of increased mobility on ice, winter cutting or burning in
northern latitudes is a cost-effective method to remove accumulated
litter and thin stands [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Farm machinery that could cut cattail but
would be difficult to use in marshy habitats can be used on the ice
during the winter.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Typha latifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Common cattail is an erect, rhizomatous, semiaquatic or aquatic,
perennial herb.  Twelve to sixteen erect, linear, flat, basal leaves
arise from each vegetative shoot, which are 0.3 to 0.6 inch (8-15 mm)
wide and 3 to 10 feet (1-3 m) tall.  The stout rhizomes, which are
located 3 to 4 inches (8-10 cm) below the soil surface, grow up to 27
inches (70 cm) in length and are typically 0.2 to 1.2 inches (0.5-3 cm)
in diameter [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  Common cattail is monoecious.  The inflorescence
is a dark brown, cylindrical terminal spike on a stout, 3- to 10-foot
(1-3 m) stem.  The staminate portion is positioned above the pistillate
portion; they are continuous or slightly separated [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte
   Helophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Common cattail reproduces sexually and asexually.  Vegetative
reproduction occurs through an extensive rhizome system and is
responsible for the maintenance and expansion of existing stands.
Sexual reproduction via seed dispersal and seedling establishment is
responsible for invasion of new areas.

Seed production and dispersal:  Common cattail is a prolific producer of
minute seeds.  Each spike may contain 117,000 to 268,000 seeds [<a href="#47">47</a>].  At
maturity, the spike bursts under dry conditions, releasing the fruits.
Each fruit has bristly hairs that aid in wind dispersal.  When the fruit
comes in contact with water, the pericarp opens rapidly, releasing the
seed, which then sinks [<a href="#12">12</a>].  In wet weather the fruits often fall to
the ground in dense mats [<a href="#39">39</a>].

Germination and seedling establishment:  Common cattail seeds are
capable of germinating immediately after shedding under favorable
conditions, but require moist or wet substrates, warm temperatures, low
oxygen concentrations, and long day-short night exposures for
germination to occur [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  Sifton [<a href="#38">38</a>] achieved the highest
germination rates (86-89%) at temperatures from 77 to 86 degrees
Fahrenheit (25-30 C).  Because of the relatively high temperature
required for germination, seeds overwinter in northern latitudes, but
not necessarily in southern latitudes [<a href="#27">27</a>].  In a southeastern Wisconsin
marsh, hybrid cattail (T. X glauca) seeds germinated from May through
September, with the greatest number of seedlings seen in June and the
fewest in September [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Following summer marsh drawdown in
northwestern Minnesota, common cattail seedlings appeared on moist,
vegetation-free areas 10 days after soil exposure [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Light,
temperature, and oxygen requirements for germination are best met in
shallow water or on moist mudflats in vegetation-free areas.  Within
established common cattail stands, seedlings are practically
nonexistent.  This is because existing vegetative cover greatly reduces
light and temperature for germination, and because cattail leaves and
stems may produce allelopathic inhibitors [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].

Once established, a single seedling spreads rapidly by rhizomes.  In
Montana, a single seed planted in a stock tank on April 1, grew into a
massive network of clones with 98 aerial shoots and 104 lateral buds by
November 1 [<a href="#47">47</a>].  Grace and Wetzel [<a href="#13">13</a>] reported that 2 years after
germination, common cattail may spread over an area of 624 square feet
(58 sq m).


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Common cattail grows just about anywhere that soil remains wet,
saturated, or flooded most of the growing season [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Common habitats
include wet meadows, marshes, fens, pond and lake margins, floating bog
mats, seacoast estuaries, roadside ditches, irrigation canals, oxbow
lakes, and backwater areas of rivers and streams [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  It is
tolerant of continuous inundation and seasonal drawdowns but is
generally restricted to areas where the water depth never exceeds about
2.6 feet (80 cm) [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  It grows mostly in fresh water but also occurs
in slightly brackish marshes [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Along water depth gradients,
common cattail often grows upslope of bulrush or open water but
downslope of common reed (Phragmites australis), reed canarygrass
(Phalaris arundinacea), and willow (Salix spp.) [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].

When common cattail and narrow-leaved cattail cooccur, they are
frequently segregated by water depth, with common cattail found in
shallow water and narrow-leaved cattail in deep water [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Soils:  Cattail stands produce enormous quantities of litter.
Established stands tend to grow on soils with high amounts of organic
matter.  Common cattail may also grow on fine-textured mineral soils,
but the soils often have organic matter incorporated into at least the
surface horizons [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Common cattail is often a dominant component of early successional
stages in wetlands.  It rapidly colonizes exposed wet mineral soils, as
it produces an extremely high number of seeds, which are dispersed by
wind and water.  On logged-over black spruce (Picea mariana) lowlands in
Ontario, common cattail quickly invades exposed peat and water-filled
depressions created by logging machinery [<a href="#6">6</a>].  It is also an early seral
species occupying the water's edge on floating bog mats [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Along
oxbow lakes on the Athabaska River in Alberta, Canada, common cattail
was abundant only on sites showing evidence of recent flooding.  On
oxbows with stable water levels, common cattail was replaced by awned
sedge (Carex atherodes) and common rivergrass (Scolichloa festucacea),
with gradual siltation and organic matter buildup [<a href="#21">21</a>].  In some
situations where water levels remain constant, common cattail maintains
relatively stable communities [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
The general pattern of common cattail phenological development includes
spring rhizome sprouting and rapid leaf production, early to midsummer
flowering, and leaf senescence and new rhizome production in the fall
[<a href="#12">12</a>].  Timing of sprouting varies with water depth, with deep water
shoots sprouting before those in shallow water.  Spring growth is
usually rapid and sudden, and is almost entirely leaf growth.

Along the Athabaska River in northeastern Alberta, Canada, common
cattail growth began in late May, and stems reached maximum weight by
mid-August.  Shoots which began growth in spring showed substantial leaf
senescence by late August [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Hybrid cattail (T. X glauca) phenology in southeastern Wisconsin was as
follows [<a href="#3">3</a>]:

   April - sprout or primary aerial shoot begins growth
     May - new shoots elongating and growing above the water level
    June - staminate and pistillate spikes formed, carbohydrate levels
           in rhizomes at minimum in late June
  Winter - plants dormant, maximum levels of stored carbohydrates

Phenology of common cattail near Gainsville, Florida, was as follows [<a href="#34">34</a>]:  

mid- to late May - flowering
June to early August - fruit ripening
mid-August to mid-Nov. - sporadic fruit dispersal during low humidity   
February through May - active growth
Nov., Dec., Jan. - dormancy

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Typha latifolia

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Common cattail rhizomes are buried in the soil and are often under water
where they cannot be harmed by the heat of fire.  When aboveground
foliage is consumed by fire, common cattail quickly initiates new
top-growth from these surviving underground regenerative organs.

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Typha latifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
The effects of fire on common cattail vary with water depth and soil
moisture.  On flooded sites and on sites with exposed but saturated
soils, fire consumes most or all of the aboveground biomass, but
underground rhizomes remain undamaged and plants survive [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  When
soils become dry because of drought or marshland drainage, fires can
burn deep into the organic horizons, consuming the rhizomes and killing
the plant [<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Common cattail quickly sprouts from surviving rhizomes following fires
that remove the top-growth.  If burned when plants are dormant, new
top-growth is initiated in the spring, and annual productivity is not
lowered [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Even following summer fires, plants quickly initiate
new growth from surviving underground rhizomes and grow until killed by
fall frosts.  After an early September fire in Utah, common cattail grew
to 1.3 feet (0.4 m) in height before winter dormancy [<a href="#41">41</a>].

Hybrid cattail (T. X glauca) stands in New Brunswick, Canada, were
burned in spring, summer, or fall in both flooded and drained marshes.
Summer burning on drained sites resulted in the greatest reductions in
cover, density, and height 3 years after burning.  Three years after
burning on flooded marsh, hybrid cattail increased in cover but showed
little or no change in cover, stem density, or height.  Changes in these
characteristics 3 years after burning are presented below [<a href="#24">24</a>]:

<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Prescribed burning in late fall, winter, or early spring when plant tops
are dry opens up common cattail stands by removing years of accumulated
litter.  In northern latitudes, winter burning has advantages in that
fires can be better directed over ice than open water, as the ice allows
for faster movement of men and equipment.  Additionally, winter fires
are easier to control because they are of lower intensity than fires
during warmer months [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Annual burning is difficult because more than
1 year of litter is needed to carry fire in cattail stands [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>].

On marshes where water levels can be controlled, drawdown followed by
burning and rapid reflooding kills common cattail if regrowth is kept
completely submerged.  Following marsh drawdown and burning in Utah,
common cattail quickly resprouted and covered areas that were reflooded
with up to 8 inches (20 cm) of water.  No plants survived, however, on
areas flooded with 8 to 18 inches (20-46 cm) of water [<a href="#32">32</a>].  When winter
burning over ice in southwestern Ontario, Ball [<a href="#1">1</a>] found that
slow-moving backfires left the shortest cattail stubble which
subsequently needed the least amount of water level increase to submerge
the stalks.  Furthermore, snow buildup over ice can protect the stalks
from burning, resulting in tall stubble that is difficult to submerge
the following spring.  Thus, when using winter burning in conjunction
with water level manipulation to control cattail, it is best to burn
over ice in early winter before snow accumulation or in early spring
after snow melt.

In Utah, common cattail was controlled with a combination of burning and
cutting.  Stands were first cut, then the cut material burned.  This
made it easier to flood the cut stems, and allowed a second cutting, if
needed, to be made very close to the ground [<a href="#32">32</a>].

In the Southern High Plains region of Texas, winter burning did not
improve common cattail nutritive quality [<a href="#40">40</a>].
