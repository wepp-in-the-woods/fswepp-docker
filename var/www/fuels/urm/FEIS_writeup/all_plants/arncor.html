<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arnica cordifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
In northern Utah heartleaf arnica is an important constituent of summer
diets of mule deer and elk [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Deschamps and Urness [<a href="#12">12</a>] found it
comprised 24 percent of summer deer diets in mature lodgepole pine
(Pinus contorta) forests in Utah.


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
In Colorado, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming, the palatability of heartleaf
arnica is rated poor to fair for cattle, fair to good for sheep, and
poor for horses [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Heartleaf arnica is rated fair in nutritional value for pronghorn,
upland game birds, small mammals, and small nongame mammals.  It is
rated fair to good in nutritional value for elk and deer [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Heartleaf arnica provides poor cover for wildlife [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Heartleaf arnica has low resistance to repeated human trampling [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Heartleaf arnica showed a substantial increase after heavy thinning of
lodgepole pine stands in Utah.  Production increased from 6.05 pounds
per acre (1.1 kg/ha) before treatment to 83.6 pounds per acre (15.2
kg/ha) 4 years after treatment [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Heartleaf arnica cover increased from 0.3 percent to 5.0 percent
following clearcutting in a subalpine forest in central Colorado [<a href="#11">11</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arnica cordifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Heartleaf arnica is a native, perennial herb 6 to 24 inches (15-60 cm)
tall, with upright stems arising singly from long, slender, creeping
rhizomes [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Rhizomes grow laterally 0.4 to 0.8 inches (1-2 cm) below
the soil surface [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Root depths of 24 inches (60.9 cm) have been
recorded in Montana [<a href="#35">35</a>].

The life span of heartleaf arnica is estimated at 12 years [<a href="#6">6</a>].




<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Heartleaf arnica reproduces by wind-dispersed seed [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].  In
central Idaho, Kramer and Johnson [<a href="#27">27</a>] found 25 percent of heartleaf
arnica seed was in the upper 2 inches (5 cm) of soil, while 75 percent
was 2 to 5 inches (5-10 cm) below the soil surface.

Asexual:  Heartleaf arnica sprouts from rhizomes [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Heartleaf arnica occurs in boreal and cool temperate climates.  It is
commonly found in open-canopy coniferous forests on high elevation
water-shedding sites.  It often inhabits exposed, moderately dry mineral
soils, but occurs on a variety of soil types [<a href="#25">25</a>].  In California it is
found from 3,500 to 10,000 feet (1,050-3,000 m), in dry to moist open or
wooded places [<a href="#33">33</a>].  In Utah it is found from 5,000 to 11,000 feet
(1,525-3,355 m) [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Occurrence increases with elevation.  In the
Madison Range of Montana it is the primary ground cover in subalpine fir
(Abies lasiocarpa) forests above 9,000 feet (2,723 m) [<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Heartleaf arnica is tolerant of both sun and shade, and may be present
from initial to late seres [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Geier-Hayes found it increased the
first 2 years following logging in a Douglas-fir/white spiraea
(Pseudotsuga mensiesii/Spiraea betulifolia) habitat type in central
Idaho [<a href="#17">17</a>].  This was probably due to mass flowering, which occurs 1 to
2 years after disturbance [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Heartleaf arnica importance apparently
decreases within a few years after disturbance-induced mass flowering
and increases again in later seres, possibly through vegetative
reproduction.  Steele and Geier-Hayes [<a href="#46">46</a>] found it reached highest
coverage in late seral stages of the grand fir/globe huckleberry (Abies
grandis/Vaccinium globulare) habitat type of central Idaho.  It is a
near-climax indicator of that habitat type.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Heartleaf arnica flowers from May through August in California [<a href="#33">33</a>] and
May through September in Colorado [<a href="#13">13</a>].  In Montana, flowering begins in
early June, fruits ripen in mid-July, and seeds are dispersed at the end
of July [<a href="#40">40</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arnica cordifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Heartleaf arnica is moderately fire resistant [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>], typically
sprouting from surviving rhizomes after fire [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  It also
regenerates from wind-dispersed seed [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>], and from seed resulting
from mass flowering at postfire year 1 or 2 [<a href="#42">42</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)
   Secondary colonizer - on-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arnica cordifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Heartleaf arnica is top-killed by fire.  Rhizomes often survive.  It is
rated as susceptible [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>] to intermediate [<a href="#24">24</a>] in resistance to fire
damage.  This probably varies according to how far below the soil
surface rhizomes are buried.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Heartleaf arnica is apparently reduced by "high intensity" fires
[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>], but responds to "less intense" fires through rapid initial
vegetative regrowth accompanied by heavy flowering and seedling
establishment [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  This is typically followed by a decline in cover
and frequency within a few years [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Heartleaf arnica had the highest
frequency and cover of all forbs 2 years following a severe fire
(greater than 90 percent mortality of all trees) in a spruce-fir
(Picea-Abies) ecosystem in Wyoming [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Frequency and cover values
increased for 2 years following logging and broadcast burning in a
Douglas-fir habitat type in Idaho.  This trend was followed by a decline
to 0 percent cover by postfire year 10 [<a href="#17">17</a>].

According to Barth, light, moisture, and soil depth are important
factors determining the postfire density of heartleaf arnica [<a href="#4">4</a>].
