<i>Pinus ponderosa</i> var. <i>arizonica</i>
(Engelm.) Shaw&nbsp;(Pinaceae) is the most widely accepted scientific name for
Arizona pine [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>]. It is 1 of 3 varieties
of ponderosa pine (<i>P. ponderosa </i>Laws.): the other 2 are Pacific ponderosa
pine (<i>P. p.</i> var. <i>ponderosa</i>) and interior ponderosa pine (<i>P. p.</i>
var. <i>scopulorum</i>) [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>].&nbsp; The taxonomy of the ponderosa pine
complex is not completely resolved. Although distinct, ponderosa pine infrataxa
show differences on broad latitudinal clines. Dodge [<a href="#45">45</a>] described the species
as &quot;a continuation of a large group of populations from the Central
American Highlands to British Columbia.&quot; There are morphological and
distributional overlaps among the varieties, and disagreement among authorities
regarding the geographical boundaries of ponderosa pine infrataxa including
Arizona pine [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>]. Ponderosa pine populations that extend northward
into western Texas from Coahuila are classified either as <i>P. p.</i> var. <i>scopulorum</i>
 [<a href="#50">50</a>] or <i>P. arizonica</i> var. <i>stormiae</i> Mart. [<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>].

<p>In this summary, &quot;ponderosa pine&quot; refers to the species as a whole.
&quot;Southwestern ponderosa pine&quot; refers to both Arizona pine and interior
ponderosa pine of the Southwest. <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/pinponp/index.html">Pacific
ponderosa pine</a> and <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/pinpons/index.html">interior ponderosa pine</a>
are discussed in separate Fire Effects Information System
summaries. Information on ponderosa pine in Texas is included in the interior ponderosa pine
summary.
</p>

<p>Intraspecies hybridization and introgression occur
between Arizona and interior ponderosa pines. Arizona and interior ponderosa
pines also hybridize and introgress with Apache pine (<i>P. engelmannii</i>);
3-taxa hybrids (interior ponderosa × Arizona × Apache pine) occur occasionally
[<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>].</p>

Arizona pine is a dominant species in ponderosa pine and pine-oak (<i>Pinus-Quercus</i>
spp.)&nbsp;communities of southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico, and northern
Mexico. It is dominant or codominant in higher-elevation, mixed montane
coniferous forests. Madrean oak
woodland species are common plant associates in lower-elevation (<i>&lt;</i> about 6,000 feet (1,800
m)) portions of Arizona pine forest. At higher elevations of Arizona pine
  forest, Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> var. <i>glauca</i>),
Rocky Mountain white fir (<i>Abies concolor</i> var. <i>concolor</i>), and Mexican white pine (<i>P. ayachuite</i>) are common overstory associates.
Arizona pine forest ascends to interior Douglas-fir-white fir forest around 7,500
  feet
(2,300 m) [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>], and fingers into
Madrean oak and pinyon-juniper (<i>Pinus-Juniperus</i> spp.) woodlands and
riparian communities at Arizona pine's lower elevational limits [<a href="#104">104</a>].<p>
In southeastern Arizona, Arizona pine is common in and just above Madrean oak
and pine-juniper woodlands. Madrean hardwood associates include Emory oak
(<i>Q. emoryi</i>), Arizona white oak (<i>Q. arizonica</i>), silverleaf oak (<i>Q.
hypoleucoides</i>), Arizona madrone (<i>Arbutus arizonica</i>), and Arizona
sycamore (<i>Platanus wrightii</i>). Conifer associates include alligator juniper
(<i>Juniperus deppeana</i>), Apache pine (<i>Pinus engelmannii</i>), and Chihuahua pine
(<i>P. leiophylla </i>var.<i> chihuahuana</i>) [<a href="#21">21</a>]. Pointleaf manzanita (<i>Arctostaphylos
pungens</i>) and longtongue muhly (<i>Muhlenbergia longiligula</i>) are common
in the understory [<a href="#26">26</a>].

<p>
In the Chiricahua Mountains of southeastern Arizona, Arizona pine forest lies on elevation and moisture gradients between lower-elevation,
drier
Mexican pinyon (<i>P. cembroides</i>), Chihuahua pine, and Apache pine communities, and moister, higher-elevation
southwestern white pine (<i>P. strobiformis</i>) communities [<a href="#18">18</a>].
Interior ponderosa pine sometimes codominates with Arizona pine.&nbsp; Arizona
 pine is generally more common
at lower elevations, with interior ponderosa pine occupying upper portions of
 ponderosa pine forest [<a href="#104">104</a>]. Brady and Bonham [<a href="#26">26</a>] found that in the Huachuca Mountains, which span the
Arizona-Mexico border, Arizona pine assumed dominance at 7,498 feet (2,285 m). It
codominated with silverleaf oak down to 6,989 feet (2,130 m) elevation, where
silverleaf oak became dominant. Arizona pine became
 subdominant to Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir
above 8,038 feet (2,450 m), and was not reported above 8,531 feet (2,600 m)
elevation. Along with Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, corkbark fir (<i>Abies lasiocarpa</i> var. <i>arizonica</i>)
and/or Engelmann spruce (<i>Picea engelmannii</i>) may co-occur with Arizona
pine in high elevation, mixed-conifer sites [<a href="#98">98</a>].
</p>

<p>In Madrean oak woodland of northern Mexico, Arizona pine
is usually subdominant to oaks. Netleaf oak (<i>Quercus rugosa</i>) and
Chihuahuan oak (<i>Q. chihuahuensis</i>) are the most
common community dominants; Chihuahua and Apache pines share subdominant
status with Arizona pine [<a href="#53">53</a>]. At mid-elevations (5,440-7,250 ft (1,650-2,200
m)), Madrean oak-pine woodland ascends to higher-elevation montane
forest. Handbasin (<i>Q. pennivenia</i>), Mexican white (<i>Q. epileuca</i>), silverleaf, netleaf, and/or Chihuahuan oaks join a
  pine-dominated, mixed formation with Arizona, Chihuahua, Apache, Durango (<i>P. durangensis</i>), and/or
weeping (<i>P. lumholtzii</i>) pines. Arizona cypress (<i>Cupressus arizonica</i>),
Arizona madrone, and Texas madrone (<i>A. texana</i>)
are characteristic community components [<a href="#27">27</a>]. Pure to nearly pure stands of
Arizona pine occur further south in Mexico [<a href="#110">110</a>].

Arizona pine is a native tree. It reaches 75 to 100 feet (23-30 m) in height and 30 to 50 inches
(75-130 cm) in diameter at maturity. The branches
are stout, thick, and self pruning. The trunk is usually devoid of branches
for half or more of its length. The crown is typically open and varies from short
and conical to rounded or flat [<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>]. Bark of mature trees is
about 2 inches (5 cm) thick. Needles are 4 to 9.5 inches (10-24 cm) long. The majority of needles are
4- or 5-fascicled, but some trees are 2- or 3-fascicled [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>].
Average
female cone length (2.5 inches (6.3 cm))
is shorter than other varieties of ponderosa pine. However, there is great
between-population variation in length of Arizona pine cones [<a href="#45">45</a>]: they range from
1.5 to 2.4 inches (5-8 cm) long. Seeds are winged, with the seed
body ranging from 3 to 4 mm in length and the wing extending to 15 mm [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>]. Mature ponderosa pine have deep, extensive root systems
[<a href="#29">29</a>]. Depending on the substrate, roots may penetrate to depths of 33 to 40 feet
(10-12 m). Lateral root development is closely related to crown width and varies
with tree density. Lateral roots may extend 100 feet (30 m) in open stands
[<a href="#118">118</a>].<p> Arizona pine and interior ponderosa pine can be very
similar in appearance. In a study comparing morphological traits
used to
distinguish Arizona and interior ponderosa pines, Dodge [<a href="#45">45</a>] found
considerable overlap between the 2 taxa. He concluded that differences
between the taxa were &quot;minor,&quot; and that between-population
morphological differences
in Arizona pine were at least as pronounced as between-varietal differences in
morphology.&nbsp;Distinguishing the 2 taxa can be further confounded by
their tendency to hybridize. Arizona pine is morphologically distinguished from
interior
ponderosa pine by having shorter needles with a majority of 4- or 5-needled (vs. 2- or 3-needled)
fascicles; smaller cones with incurved (vs. reflected) prickles; thinner bark; a rounder, more open crown; and being shorter and less broad at the base at
maturity [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>]. The <a href="http://hua.huh.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/Flora/flora.pl?FLORA_ID=12395">Flora of North America</a>
provides botanical descriptions and dichotomous keys for Arizona pine and other
varieties of ponderosa pine.</p>

Arizona pine reproduces from seed. It is monoecious, with pollen dispersed by
wind. Ponderosa pine 1st produces cones at 10 to 20 years of age [<a href="#83">83</a>]. Good Arizona pine seed crops are produced
every 2 to 3 years [<a href="#55">55</a>].
High temperatures during strobili formation have been correlated with good
Arizona pine cone
crops [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>]. Ponderosa pine seeds are mostly wind dispersed and do not
usually carry more than 120 feet (37 m) from the parent tree [<a href="#55">55</a>].
Arizona pine seed (collected in Arizona and germinated in the greenhouse) showed
mean viability of 75% [<a href="#83">83</a>]. Southwestern ponderosa pine seed germinates with the
onset of mid-summer rains; germination continues until onset of fall drought. Mid-summer
germinants
show best survivorship, probably because they gain the most growth before onset
of winter dormancy and succeeding spring drought [<a href="#86">86</a>].<p> Best Arizona pine
seedling establishment occurs in early seral communities, and establishment is somewhat
rare [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>]. Several conditions are necessary for successful regeneration
of southwestern ponderosa pine: 1) an adequate seed source, 2) mineral soil with
lowing stocking of competing vegetation, 3) open light, 4) adequate moisture at the right time,
and 5) a low rate of herbivory on seedlings. Co-occurrence of these conditions is irregular
and uncommon [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>]. A warmer than average spring results in good
cone crops [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>].&nbsp; A disturbance such as fire is required to
prepare a bare mineral seedbed and create open-light conditions [<a href="#90">90</a>]. Twenty-seven months after
cone initiation, a wetter than average summer and fall produces good seed
germination [<a href="#29">29</a>]. Seeds appear to require continually moist conditions for at
least 7 days at temperatures above 55 degrees Fahrenheit (13 <sup>o</sup>C)
[<a href="#117">117</a>]. Above-average precipitation the following spring promotes seedling
survival [<a href="#29">29</a>]. A pulse of Arizona pine regeneration occurred from 1910-1930,
when these conditions coincided; such a pulse has not occurred since
[<a href="#114">114</a>].&nbsp;

<br />

In the United States, Arizona pine is the least accessible of the 3 varieties
of&nbsp; ponderosa pine. It occupies slopes, canyons, rims, and tablelands [<a href="#50">50</a>].
Slopes may be steep: Arizona pine sites in the Santa Catalina Mountains of southeastern
Arizona ranged from 10 to 36<sup>o</sup>. In Arizona, Arizona pine
soils are mostly derived from limestone, sandstone, and quartzite overlaying
schist and granite [<a href="#45">45</a>]. Arizona pine is most common between 7,000 and
7,500 feet (2,100-2,300 m), while interior ponderosa pine is more common above
9,000 feet (2,700 m). Elevations between 7,500 and 9,000 feet are occupied by both
varieties, and by their hybrids [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. Overall
elevational range of
Arizona pine by state is:<p>Arizona&nbsp; 6,200 to 9,840 feet (1,900-3,420 m)
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>]<br>
New Mexico&nbsp; 6,900 to 8,000 feet (2,100-2,500 m) [<a href="#50">50</a>]&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Sonora&nbsp; 7,000 to 9,000 feet (2,000-3,000 m) [<a href="#45">45</a>]

<p>
Climate is semi-arid to arid with bimodal rainfall. Winter rains occur from
December through March and are followed by a dry season extending to June. Monsoonal
rains occur from July to September, with greater than 50% of the mean annual rainfall
occurring in August [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].
Total annual rainfall is highly variable, and prolonged drought is common [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Ponderosa pine is shade intolerant [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>], and is often a dominant tree in
southwestern sky island plant communities [<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>]. Muldavin and others [<a href="#100">100</a>]
have identified several Arizona pine habitat types.&nbsp;
<p>Successional pathways in Arizona
pine communities are poorly understood, and further research is needed in this
area. Arizona pine is occasionally seral in white fir habitats [<a href="#98">98</a>]. Arizona
pine may be
a climax species on dry, mid-elevation (6,800
to 8,500 feet (2,000-2,600 m)) sites&nbsp; [<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>]. Arizona pine types also occur on
high-elevation (<u>&lt;</u>9,300 feet (2,800 m)), relatively moist north- and
east-facing slopes [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>] that are maintained by
frequent fire [<a href="#100">100</a>]. These sites may proceed to mixed-conifer forest in the absence of
fire, with Arizona pine being successionally replaced by
Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and/or white fir [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>]. At low elevations (&lt;
6,500 feet (2,000 m)), Arizona pine understories are characterized by Arizona
pine and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir seedlings and saplings, oaks, and junipers
[<a href="#87">87</a>].&nbsp;

<br />

Mean date of pollen spread of Arizona pine in New Mexico was May 22 [<a href="#46">46</a>].
In Arizona, pollination occurred in May, 2nd-year cones ripened in September and
October, and seed dispersed in October [<a href="#83">83</a>]. Southwestern
ponderosa pine seed germinates from summer through fall. October drought initiates
dormancy. Growth begins with the onset of summer rains [<a href="#86">86</a>].

<b><font face="Bell MT">Fire adaptations:</font></b> 
Arizona pine is adapted to survive frequent low- to
moderate-severity surface fires. Mature trees have thick bark, insulated buds, and a high
capacity to recover from crown scorch, all of which confer resistance to surface
fires [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>]. Arizona pine is self pruning, which discourages torching. It
has the most open crown of the 3 varieties of ponderosa pine, also reducing the likelihood of
torching [<a href="#145">145</a>].

<p>Ponderosa pine seedlings establish
on burns from on-site seed, dropped from the crowns of surviving and fire-killed
trees [<a href="#123">123</a>], and from off-site seed borne by wind [<a href="#102">102</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Fire regime:</font></b> 
 The sky islands of southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico have among the
highest incidences of lightning-caused fires in the United States [<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>].  The lightning fire season begins in late April, peaks in June, and runs into October. Maximum lightning fire
incidence is above 6,000 feet (1,800 m), directly within the Arizona pine zone
[<a href="#11">11</a>]. The fire season occurs in late spring and early summer in southeastern Arizona and southwestern New
Mexico. Increasing temperatures and sparse rainfall create extremely dry
conditions in spring. By June, weak storm systems typically bring lightning but
little rain [<a href="#98">98</a>]. Few actual lightning ignitions occur, but these typically
result in large burns. July has a high incidence of lightning-ignited
fires, but total area burned is less compared to June [<a href="#16">16</a>]. By July or August, summer rains usually render fuels too moist to burn
well [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>].</p>

<p> The historical fire regime in Arizona pine forest was primarily frequent surface fire, with occasional
mixed-severity and stand-replacement fires [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#140">140</a>]. 
Southwestern ponderosa pine forests have undergone a shift
in physiognomy since the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Prior to
that time, southwestern ponderosa pines were reported as occurring in open,
parklike stands with&nbsp; thick grass understories [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>]. Fire return intervals
for Arizona pine generally ranged from 2 to 12 years for xeric sites, and up to 15 years for
mesic sites [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>]. Dendrochronological studies in mixed Arizona-Apache-Chihuahua pine gallery forests the
Chiricahua Mountains show a fire interval range of 1 to 9 years (µ=4.2 years)
[<a href="#77">77</a>]. In the Arizona pine and mixed-conifer belts (7,260-8,910 ft (2,200-2,700
m)) of 1 Chiricahua watershed (Mormon Canyon), fire return intervals ranged from
1 to 17 years (µ=3.7 years), with a tendency for wet years to precede
fire years. Lower-elevation, mostly low-severity surface fires were an important
source of ignition in the mixed-confer belt, where high-severity, stand-replacement
fires mixed with low- and moderate-severity surface fires [<a href="#98">98</a>]. These regimes
were probably largely driven by lightning, but it is reported that prior to
European-American settlement, Native Americans ignited fires to drive game, for
warfare, and to bring rain [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>]. Reconstructive
studies show presettlement densities of ponderosa pine forest in Arizona and New Mexico
ranging
from 3 to 66 trees per acre (7-166/ha) [<a href="#34">34</a>].</p>

<p>Fire frequency in Rocky Mountain ponderosa pine-Arizona pine forests in southeastern Arizona was greatly reduced after Euro-American
settlement in the 1870s [<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>]. The explanations for this change include livestock grazing that removed
grassy fuels, fire exclusion, and climatic
factors [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#140">140</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>].
It is likely no single factor is responsible. In ponderosa pine ecosystems of northern Mexico, where fire suppression is rare, mean fire return interval is less than 5
years. On an Arizona pine site in Durango, for example, widespread
fires averaging every 9 years scarred at least 25% of sampled trees [<a href="#51">51</a>].</p>

<p>Today, many acres of
southwestern ponderosa pine forests are overstocked, stagnant, and
accumulating large quantities of litter at the expense of the grassy understory
[<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>]. Fire exclusion has led to the build-up of fuels  and led to severe crown fires in
southwestern ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests. These forests contain an understory of young
southwestern ponderosa pine, Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir,
southwestern white pine, and Gambel oak: species that are less fire-resistant and more shade-tolerant than
southwestern ponderosa pines
[<a href="#12">12</a>].
Bahre [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>] notes that fire frequency in ponderosa
pine in the Chiricahua Mountains of southeastern Arizona has decreased since
European-American settlement. The fire
regime has changed from frequent surface fires to large, infrequent,
stand-replacing crown fires. For example, the 1994 Rattlesnake
Peak Fire burned 27,000 acres (10,800 ha) in southeastern Arizona [<a href="#12">12</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Climate and grazing:</font></b>
 Grazing appears to reduce fire frequency in southwestern ponderosa pine forests
by removing grassy understory fuels. Interactive effects of grazing and climate
on fire frequency are difficult to determine. Savage and Swetnam [<a href="#114">114</a>]
suggest that climatic factors play the larger role in determining both fire
frequency and Arizona stand structure. They attribute a pulse of southwestern
ponderosa pine regeneration in the early 1900's to a favorable climatic sequence, which, when
coupled with the lack of fire to thin the stands, resulted in the overstocked,
stagnant stands found today. In the Chuskas Mountains on the Arizona-New Mexico
border, this pulse of regeneration occurred on both sites with heavy domestic
sheep grazing and on sites where livestock grazing had not been practiced for
decades. In the Chuskas, mean fire frequency dropped dramatically (µ=4.2 years
before 1830; &lt; 3 fires recorded from 1830-1950) on both heavily grazed sites
and on sites that had not experienced grazing for several decades. Likewise, a
strong pulse of southwestern ponderosa pine occurred on both grazed and ungrazed
sites [<a href="#114">114</a>].</p>

<p> <font face="Times New Roman"> Long-term fire history studies on the northern Colorado
Front Range show that interannual variability in soil moisture, rather than
drought alone, is conducive to widespread fire. Fire occurrence, especially
widespread fire, tends to increase 1 to 4 years after above-average moisture
availability in spring-summer [<a href="#136">136</a>]. Similarly, fire occurrence tends
to increase 2 to 3 years after above-average precipitation in winter-spring&nbsp;
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>]. Climatic variation that produces
widespread, stand-replacing fire has been associated with southern oscillation
events. El Nino is associated with greater soil moisture and herbaceous fuel
production in spring, with fire occurrence peaking several years after El Nino
events. La Nina events are associated with dry springs, with fire occurrence
peaking in the same year [<a href="#136">136</a>]. A decline in fire frequency in interior
ponderosa pine forests of the Southwest coincided with reduced El Nino-La Nina
events between 1780 and 1830 [<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#136">136</a>].
Alternating wet and dry years resulting from El Nino-La Nina events in the mid-
to late 1800s increased fire frequency [<a href="#136">136</a>].</p>

</font><p><b><font face="Bell MT">Fire
histories: </font></b>
Prior to the 1880s, surface fires burned through Arizona sky
island southwestern ponderosa pine forests once or twice a decade. Fires were somewhat less frequent in higher-elevation, mixed-conifer forests
[<a href="#126">126</a>]. In the Rincon Mountain
Wilderness, fire regime in Arizona pine forest was mostly large-scale (>500 acre (200 ha)), early-season (May-July) surface fires. Mean fire return interval from 1657 to 1893 was 6.1 years, with a range of 1 to 13 years. Mean fire return interval in the mixed-conifer type from 1748 to 1996 was 9.9 years, with a range of 3 to 19 years
[<a href="#13">13</a>].</p>

<p> Historical fire frequency at the ponderosa pine-oak woodland interface has been documented
at 1 fire or more per
decade [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>]. In
a fire history study of Madrean oak-mixed pine gallery forest in Chiricahua
National Monument, Arizona, Swetnam and others [<a href="#127">127</a>] found an historical (1620-1890) fire
regime characterized by frequent surface fires at intervals ranging from 1 to 38
years. Mean fire interval across the study site was 3.9 years; mean fire return
interval for fires that scarred at least 25% of trees on the study site was 13.2
years. Species composition of the forest was southwestern ponderosa, Chihuahua,
Mexican pinyon, and Apache pines, and canyon live (<i>Quercus chrysolepis</i>), netleaf,
silverleaf, and other oaks. The authors hypothesized that the oak-pine gallery
served as a conduit that allowed fire spread across elevational gradients.

<p> Fule and Covington [<a href="#52">52</a>] found
that in Durango, fire exclusion in Arizona pine-Durango pine-Apache
pine-oak (<i>Quercus</i> spp.) woodland favored sprouting oaks, alders (<i>Alnus</i>
spp.), and madrones (<i>Arbutus</i> spp.) over Arizona and other pines. On sites
where fire exclusion was practiced, a larger proportion of pines was killed by
uncontrollable wildfires due to higher fire severities compared to sites with
uninterrupted fire regimes.</p>

Low-severity surface fires usually kill southwestern ponderosa pine less than 3 to 5 years of age or 
less than 6 inches (15 cm) dbh. Mortality in the 6- to 30-inch (15-76 cm) dbh class is not unusual. Trees in dense stands and trees infected with southwestern dwarf-mistletoe 
are most susceptible to mortality, particularly in the smaller size classes. 
Pole-sized and larger trees are resistant to low-severity surface fires. Severe 
surface or crown fires 
generally kill ponderosa pine of all size classes [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>], although some
&quot;sawtimber-sized&quot; trees may survive severe 
surface fire [<a href="#28">28</a>].&nbsp; Heavy 
accumulations of litter at the base of trees increase the duration and intensity 
of fire, making trees more susceptible to scarring. Resin deposits around an 
old &quot;cat-face&quot; may increase bark flammability and promote further 
injury [<a href="#25">25</a>].

Ponderosa pine can withstand 
extensive scorching as long as buds and twigs, which tolerate higher temperatures 
than needles, are not badly scorched [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>]. Ponderosa pine may 
recover from as much as 90% scorching as long as 50% of buds and twigs survive 
to maintain shoot growth on defoliated branches [<a href="#145">145</a>]. Extensive scorching of ponderosa pine crowns may cause mortality within 3 postfire years
[<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>]. Generally, southwestern ponderosa pine recovery is best 
after dormant-season scorching; trees scorched in the growing season show poorer 
survivorship [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>]. After a growing-season (July) 
wildfire in northern Arizona, Herman [<a href="#72">72</a>] noted at least 65% 
survival for ponderosa pine greater than 8 inches (20 cm) dbh that had less than 60% 
crown scorch. Dieterich [<a href="#43">43</a>] observed 89% recovery of 6 to 14-inch 
(15-36 cm) dbh trees that had been up to 90% scorched by dormant-season 
(November) wildfire on the Coconino National Forest.&nbsp;Studies of postfire 
survivorship after scorching show mixed results, however. Davis and others [<a href="#41">41</a>] reported that more than 75% of 
ponderosa pines (5- to 11-inch (13-28 cm) dbh class) scorched more than 67% died 
within 2 years following a dormant-season (October) prescribed fire on the 
Coconino National Forest.
 
<p> 
Dormant-season studies indicate that bud kill, which is related to fire 
season, is more important than foliage kill in determining chances of southwestern ponderosa 
pine survival after burning [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>,<a href="#138">138</a>]. 
Wagener [<a href="#138">138</a>] and Harrington [<a href="#65">65</a>]&nbsp;found the minimum requirement for ponderosa pine survival was 90% or 
less scorch with 50% or more of buds and twigs remaining. Five years after 
prescribed burning on the San Juan National Forest of Colorado, Harrington [<a href="#65">65</a>] found 
significant (p=0.05) differences in mortality of&nbsp; scorched interior ponderosa pine, depending upon season of burning. Mortality was lowest for 
fall-scorched trees (5%), and spring-scorched trees showed less mortality than 
summer-scorched trees (17 vs. 21%, respectively). Ninety percent of fire-damaged 
ponderosa pine that died had done so by postfire year 4. Most 
trees greater than 7.2 inches (18 cm) diameter survived fall burning even with 
90% scorching. With spring and summer burning, trees less than 4 inches (10 cm) 
diameter died with greater than 50% scorching, while at least 90% scorching was 
required before trees larger than 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter were killed by spring or 
summer fire.</p>

Fire prepares a favorable mineral seedbed for Arizona pine establishment.
Germinants require mineral soil  so the emerging root radicle immediately 
contacts soil moisture [<a href="#145">145</a>]. Seedling density may be great in years when 
favorable precipitation follows fire, resulting in &quot;doghair&quot; thickets if further fire does not reduce the stand [<a href="#63">63</a>].
Thinning by fire results in increased stem growth in remaining trees
[<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>].
Removal of shrubs in southwestern ponderosa pine forests results in an increase in
biomass production of overstory Arizona pines [<a href="#103">103</a>]. <p>Sutherland and others
[<a href="#125">125</a>] present a linear regression
model to predict postfire radial growth of southwestern ponderosa pine after
prescribed fire.

<b><font face="Bell MT">Watershed:</font></b> Improved water availability 
after fire may contribute to postfire growth of Arizona pine [<a href="#58">58</a>]. Alain-Morales
[<a href="#1">1</a>] studied the effects of prescribed
burning on watersheds in an Arizona pine forest in northwestern Chihuahua,
Mexico. Comparing fire effects under fall drought burning, 2nd-year reburning
under fall drought, winter burning, and no burning treatments, he found the most
significant change in water flow occurred with the fall reburn treatment. The
fall reburn showed a large increase in surface water flow relative to the no burn control.

<a name="FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Current fire return intervals are greater than the
historical range of variability for southwestern ponderosa pine forests. Magnitude of fire decline is
greater at lower than higher elevations, which may aid managers in determining
where management actions to reduce fuels and restore more natural fire regimes
might be of highest priority [<a href="#135">135</a>].&nbsp; The expense of excluding fire from
southwestern ponderosa
pine forests in an active fire year can easily exceed a billion dollars, and
these costly attempts at fire suppression are not always successful. In
comparison, treatments to restore southwestern ponderosa pine structure and ecological
processes are modest in cost [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>].&nbsp;<p>Thinning to remove small-diameter trees, accompanied by
prescribed fire, has been suggested as a means of restoring structure and
function to degraded southwestern ponderosa pine ecosystems
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>]. Frequent low-severity surface fires restore
ecosystem function by thinning dense stands and reducing woody debris and other
organic matter on the forest floor. This can result in increased soil moisture,
increased soil temperature (with accompanying rates of increased litter
decomposition, soil nutrient cycling, and fine root growth), increased
productivity of understory herbs and shrubs, increased basal diameter growth of
overstory ponderosa pine, and favorable seedbeds [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>]. Fire pruning of lower pine branches opens the
canopy [<a href="#57">57</a>]. Frequent prescribed fires
reduce fire hazard without damaging overstory ponderosa pine&nbsp;[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>].
Biswell [<a href="#23">23</a>] listed several ways in which prescribed burning reduces wildfire
hazard in ponderosa pine:

<ul>
  <li>
   <font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">
   reduces the volume of dead fuel</font>
  </li>

    stands</font>
  </li>
  <li>
   <font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">
   keeps shade-tolerant trees out of the understory,
    thus destroying ladder fuels</font>
  </li>
  <li>
   <font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">
   raises the height of green foliage level by needle
    scorching, making crown fires less likely to occur</font>
  </li>
  <li>
   <font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">
   allows pine needles to fall to the ground, where
    they compact more closely than when draped over understory vegetation and
    debris that keep them off the ground</font>
  </li>
</ul>

<p> If several fire cycles have been missed,
thinning presettlement trees and manually removing heavy fuels from the base of
large trees may be necessary to in order to protect old growth from severe
scorching or death [<a href="#33">33</a>]. Harrington [<a href="#65">65</a>] recommends growing-season (spring or
summer) burning in southwestern ponderosa pine forests if the management objective is
thinning from below, and fall prescribed burning if stand losses must
be minimized. Weather parameters for prescribed burning in southwestern
ponderosa pine [<a href="#68">68</a>], and a logistic regression model predicting probability of interior ponderosa pine
mortality by tree size, scorch class, and season of
injury are available [<a href="#60">60</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p> Allen and others [<a href="#5">5</a>] provide ecologically based recommendations for
restoring southwestern ponderosa pine. They stress that restoration programs
should include natural variability in southwestern ponderosa pine stands and the
reestablishment of natural processes. Managers are encouraged to fully review
their recommendations. A synopsis of their principles for restoration follows

<p>Prescriptions for mid-summer 
burning in Arizona pine are available in Harrington [<a href="#61">61</a>]. He recommends
burning in summer rather than fall to achieve more complete combustion of fuels
[<a href="#61">61</a>]. This may also reduce effects of&nbsp;
burning on other plants and animals, since natural fires occurred more often in
June and July than in fall [<a href="#21">21</a>]. Prescriptions
for prescribed burning in both open and closed stands of Arizona pine require
measurement of litter and humus layer moisture content, relative humidity, and
wind speed ranges for safe, effective burning. Recommended prescriptions for
summer fires use downslope, backing fires for initial fuel reductions [<a href="#61">61</a>]. Beaufait
[<a href="#20">20</a>] found that backfires in ponderosa pine needles spread more slowly and had less 
flame depth, longer residence time, and a higher rate of energy release than headfires.</p>

<p>Swetnam and Dieterich [<a href="#130">130</a>] recommend allowing large
(&gt; 3000 acres (1200 ha)) prescribed natural surface fires in southwestern ponderosa
pine in wilderness areas such as the Gila Wilderness. Based upon their fire
history research, which showed evidence of mostly extensive but also small
fires, they also recommend allowing small and patchy mixed-severity fires in
approved areas, subject to the limitations of wilderness boundaries, visitor
safety, and management and suppression capabilities.</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Models:</font></b>&nbsp; Fuel moisture ratings for
Arizona pine stands estimated using National Fire Danger Ratings showed good
correlation at the driest levels but showed differences with increasing
precipitation. Empirically derived
equations permit adequate estimates of actual fuel moisture for burning projects. Harrington&nbsp;
[<a href="#62">62</a>] presents a model for estimating moisture of fuels in Arizona
pine. 
</p>


<p>In a comparison of fuel loads on several Arizona
pine sites, Harrington [<a href="#64">64</a>] found large differences between the relationship of
forest floor depth to fuel loading, and cautioned managers against using forest
floor depth:fuel loading regression models to assess fuels without some
site-specific testing. Harrington has developed a model for estimating
forest floor consumption in southwestern ponderosa pine forest based upon
moisture content of the H surface soil layer [<a href="#66">66</a>].&nbsp;
</p>


<p>Mortality: McHugh and Kolb [<a href="#96">96</a>] found a model using total crown damage by
fire (scorch + consumption) and bole char severity as independent variables gave
the best 2-way variable model for predicting individual tree mortality for
prescribed and wildfires in northern Arizona.&nbsp;
</p>

<b><font face="Bell MT">Wildlife:</font></b> Prescribed spring or fall burning on the
Coronado National Forest of southeastern Arizona had no effect on the density of
nesting pairs of 14 species of cavity-nesting birds, despite the fact that the
fires destroyed more large, dead ponderosa pine snags than they created. Density
of 2 species, the northern flicker and the violet-green swallow, was reduced
after fires [<a href="#74">74</a>].

The study stand was predominantly Arizona pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i> var. <i>arizonica</i>) mixed
with southwestern white pine (<i>P. strobiformis</i>), silverleaf oak (<i>Quercus
</i><i>hypoleucoides</i>), and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii </i> var. <i>glauca</i>). Forest structure was uneven-aged stands of even-aged
groups. Two distinct
age classes of Arizona pine occurred on the study
site: open groups with large, old-growth trees, and closed groups of
dense, &quot;doghair&quot; sapling thickets. Arizona pine
comprised 65 and 87% of the trees per acre, respectively, and 91 and 79% of the
basal area, respectively. Southwestern pine was subdominant in both groups and appeared to be
increasing under fire exclusion. Silverleaf oaks and Douglas-firs were more
common in the closed stands. Group characteristics

The smallest trees showed greatest mortality, increasing mean stand diameter.
Greatest mortality occurred in areas that experienced greatest fuel reduction.
In open groups, basal areas decreased only slightly because larger trees did not
succumb to burning. Basal areas were significantly reduced in closed groups due
to high mortality.&nbsp; Seedling and sapling mortality, respectively, was 57%
and 16% on site 1; 96&amp; and 54 % on site 2; and 84% and 43% on site 3.

Summer prescribed burning effectively reduced fuels, and the fires were
completely controllable. Individual or group crowning occurred
mostly in Arizona pine thickets, where thinning may be beneficial. Harrington [<a href="#61">61</a>] provides the following preliminary burning

Ponderosa pine is the most commercially valuable and productive timber tree in
the Southwest [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>]; however, as of this writing (2002), logging of Arizona
pine is limited to hazard tree removal and understory thinning [<a href="#71">71</a>]. 


<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE">

<br />

Ponderosa pine seeds are valuable food for a variety of birds, rodents, and
lagomorphs [<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>].&nbsp; Abert's squirrel, which have been introduced into Arizona pine's range,
are ecologically dependent upon ponderosa pine [<a href="#81">81</a>]. Porcupines and smaller
rodents eat ponderosa pine bark and wood [<a href="#93">93</a>]. Deer eat
ponderosa pine buds early in spring when elongation begins, and occasionally eat
woody shoots [<a href="#106">106</a>].<p>Arizona pine forests are
critical habitat for many bird species, supporting, for example, breeding
populations of Mexican junco and Mexican chickadee. Sky island
populations of Arizona pine play important biogeographic roles in the
distribution and survival of neotropical birds [<a href="#42">42</a>]. Cavity-nesting birds use
southwestern ponderosa pine snags for foraging and roosting as well as nesting [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>]. Reintroduced and rare in
southeastern Arizona, thick-billed parrots are ecologically dependent on
Chihuahua and southwestern ponderosa pines for food and shelter. Pine seeds are their primary
diet item, and the parrots nest in pine snag cavities [<a href="#73">73</a>]. Many bird species use
southwestern ponderosa pine needles for
nesting material [<a href="#93">93</a>].

Mature Arizona pine browse is unpalatable to livestock, although cattle may
browse young trees [<a href="#133">133</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>]. Deer prefer southwestern ponderosa pine
browse, typically selecting it above all other tree forage except quaking aspen
(<i>Populus tremuloides</i>). Southwestern ponderosa pine germinants are browsed by a variety
of bird species [<a href="#75">75</a>].

Southwestern ponderosa pine provides good year-round cover for songbirds, upland gamebirds,
small mammals, carnivores, and ungulates. Many species of birds, including
cavity nesters, use large trees for roosting and nesting cover [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>].

OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Disease agents: Arizona pine is susceptible to several important pathogens,
and to insect infestations. Southwestern pine dwarf-mistletoe (<i>Arceuthobium vaginatum</i>
ssp. <i>cryptopodum</i>) is a serious disease agent of southwestern
ponderosa pine. It has infected as much as 33% of ponderosa pine stands in
Arizona and New Mexico [<a href="#88">88</a>].&nbsp; Bark beetles are also serious
pests. In the Southwest, pine engraver beetles (<i>Ips</i> spp.) often kill more
ponderosa pine than do pine beetles (<i>Dendroctonus </i><i>adjunctus</i>) 
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>].&nbsp;

<p>
Bark beetle (<i>Ips</i> spp. and <i>D</i>. <i>adjunctus</i>) kill has 
escalated greatly in the Southwest. Prolonged drought and high tree density have 
probably increased the susceptibility of southwestern ponderosa pine to attacks. 
A 2002 survey of National Forests in Arizona and New Mexico showed a 4-fold 
increase in ponderosa pine mortality in 2002, with over 2 million pines killed 
on approximately a half-million acres. The extent of defoliation of southwestern 
ponderosa pine on the Coronado National Forest as of 2002 was estimated at 7,451 
acres (2,980 ha) from pine engraver beetles and 6,542 acres (2,617 ha) from 
drought. A combination of  actions 
including removing infested trees, application of insecticide, and thinning is 
recommended for control. Because the beetle outbreak is so large, control efforts are best 
targeted to accessible, high-value areas [<a href="#6">6</a>]. </p>

<p>
The most serious wood-decaying fungi are red rot and western gall rust. 
Shoestring root rot occasionally infects pole-sized and younger trees [<a href="#4">4</a>]. 
Armillaria (<i>Armillaria</i> spp.) is another common fungal pathogen [<a href="#70">70</a>].&nbsp;Management
and harvesting guidelines to minimize armillaria infection are available
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>]. </p>

<p>
Grazing: Southwestern ponderosa pine is resistant to moderate-intensity and
lighter browsing [<a href="#38">38</a>]. Thirteen years after exclosures were built, ponderosa pine in
southeastern Arizona had increased slightly on both ungrazed and grazed plots, at 6% frequency 
and 5% frequency, respectively. Initial frequency was 2% on both plots [<a href="#2">2</a>]. </p>
<p>

Summaries on the silviculture of southwestern ponderosa pine are available
[,69,75,102].
