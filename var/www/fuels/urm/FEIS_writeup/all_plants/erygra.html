<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The current scientific name of glacier lily is Erythronium grandiflorum
Pursh.  Three varieties and one subspecies are currently recognized:

Erythronium grandiflorum var. candidum (Piper) Abrams [<a href="#16">16</a>]
Erythronium grandiflorum var. grandiflorum [<a href="#16">16</a>]
Erythronium grandiflorum var. nudipetalum (Applegate) C. L. Hitchc [<a href="#16">16</a>]
Erythronium grandiflorum ssp. chrysandrum Applegate [<a href="#14">14</a>] 

Erythronium grandiflorum varieties candidum and grandiflorum occur
sympatrically only rarely.  Allopatric crosses of the two varieties are
infertile, while attempts at sympatric crosses are incompatible,
suggesting that E. g. var. candidum may qualify as a separate species [<a href="#12">12</a>].

<b>OTHER STATUS : </b>
A variety of glacier lily known as the white glacier lily (Erythronium
grandiflorum var. candidum) is a regional endemic [<a href="#21">21</a>].  It occurs only
in a few disjunct populations in northeastern Washington, northern
Idaho, and northwestern Montana [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Glacier lily is an important forage for grizzly bears, which dig for the
corms in spring [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Ground squirrels will also feed on corms.
Foliage is grazed by large ungulates such as sheep and cattle [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].
In an Idaho study, glacier lily made up the bulk of mule deer diets
during May [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
In Idaho, mule deer ate disproportionate amounts of glacier lily
compared to its availability, suggesting there was some preference for
the lily [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Bears will stray from their normal course of travel
along ridges to seek out glacier lily corms [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Glacier lily provides fair to poor forage for cattle, sheep, and horses,
and fair graze for small mammals, deer, and elk [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Glacier lily was only an occasional food source for Native Americans.
The deep-seated corms are difficult to dig.  The corms and flower buds
may be eaten raw or boiled.  The leaves may be used as salad greens or
as a potherb [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Native Americans crushed the root and used it as a
poultice for boils [<a href="#32">32</a>].  However, the plant is probably more important
for its aesthetic value, due to its large, showy flowers.  It may grow
in gardens, but it is difficult to maintain and does much better in the
wild [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Glacier lily was present in small amounts on ungrazed, and moderately
and heavily grazed sites in Utah [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Frequency increased on an
18-year grazing exclosure [<a href="#9">9</a>].  The species showed no great fluctuations
in percent cover after various disturbances, such as clearcutting [<a href="#31">31</a>].
After severe overgrazing in Utah, glacier lily was a component of an
ephemeral community that withered early in the summer, leaving the area
subject to flooding and erosion later in the summer [<a href="#10">10</a>].

The rare, white variety of glacier lily should be protected.  Some of
its former habitat in Glacier National Park has been destroyed by road
maintenance work [<a href="#21">21</a>].  A recent study showed that white glacier lily is
not limited by failure to attract pollinators, low fertility, or
differential survivorship of seedlings.  It did at least as well as
Erythronium grandiflorum var. grandiflorum in each of those categories
[<a href="#12">12</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Erythronium grandiflorum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Glacier lily is a member of the Liliaceae family and has an elongate,
deep-seated corm.  It has two basal leaves which will grow 4 to 10
inches (10-25 cm) long.  One to five flowering stems will arise from
these and grow 6 to 15 inches (15-40 cm) tall.  The nodding, yellow
flowers are large, with petals between 1 and 2 inches (3-4 cm) long
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  These flowers are radial, perfect, and choripetalous [<a href="#25">25</a>].
There are six large anthers which may be colored white, yellow, pink,
red, or deep reddish-purple [<a href="#16">16</a>].  The fruit is a three-angled capsule
between 1 and 2 inches (3-4 cm) long [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Flowers of glacier lily are mainly pollinated by bumblebees, although
other bees are also important.  They are occasionally pollinated by
hummingbirds [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Glacier lily has been found to be self-compatible in
Colorado, although fewer seeds were produced after selfing than after
outcrosses [<a href="#6">6</a>].  In Montana, both Erythronium grandiflorum var. candidum
and var. grandiflorum were found to be obligate outcrossers [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Once
the fruit matures and dehisces, seeds fall to the ground gradually as
the fruit is disturbed by wind or possibly animals [<a href="#12">12</a>].  The seeds
require 100 days of cold stratification before germination [<a href="#12">12</a>].  The
plant may also sprout from the corm [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Some individuals of
Erythronium spp. have been known to take up to 8 years to reach
reproductive maturity [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Glacier lily grows on moist slopes and in shaded areas [<a href="#14">14</a>].  It grows
in mountain brush, sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), aspen (Populus
tremuloides), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), spruce-fir, or wet meadow
zones [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  It grows on fertile soils with high
moisture-holding capacity [<a href="#1">1</a>].  This species may often be found near
streams, lakes, seeps, bogs, snowchutes, or late-lying snowbanks.  The
last is an especially common site for glacier lily [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  It is
more common on cooler, moister north slopes than south slopes [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Some elevational ranges for glacier lily are as follows [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].

      6,500 to 11,000 feet (2,100-3,700 m) in CO
      3,300 feet (1,100 m) in ID
      3,400 to 7,000 feet (1,100-2,300 m) in MT
      5,000 to 9,000 feet (1,675-3,115 m) in UT
      9,500 feet (2,900 m) in WY

The white glacier lily grows at elevations up to 6,462 feet (2,154 m) but
is usually found below 4,245 feet (1,415 m) [<a href="#12">12</a>].

In Utah, glacier lily is found in the mountain shrub zone with Gambel
oak (Quercus gambelii) and bigtooth maple (Acer grandidentatum).  In
Montana, Idaho, and Washington, it is often found in lodgepole pine and
spruce-fir forests with Englemann spruce (Picea englemannii), white
spruce (P. glauca), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), or grand fir (A.
grandis) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  In these areas, glacier lily is
commonly found with species such as baldhip rose (Rosa gymnocarpa),
white spirea (Spirea betulifolia), common snowberry (Symphoricarpos
albus), Rocky Mountain maple (Acer glabrum), Nuttall violet (Viola
nuttallii), springbeauty (Claytonia lanceolata), lupine (Lupinus spp.),
and huckleberry (Vaccinium spp.)  [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Glacier lily is present in early, mid-, or late seres.  It was present
on an Idaho stand 5 years following a fire [<a href="#8">8</a>].  It has also been found
in an 88-year-old Montana forest stand [<a href="#17">17</a>].  In Utah, glacier lily was
present in early as well as mid-successional communities [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Data
from a study in Idaho showed it was more common in old-growth forests
than in areas with recent wildfires [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Glacier lily is a vernal species, emerging very soon after snowmelt
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Anthesis will occur anywhere between March and August depending
on the elevation [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  It is an ephemeral species, generally
having only 10 weeks between first emergence and leaf fall [<a href="#24">24</a>].  The
fruit matures and dehisces approximately 2 months after pollination
[<a href="#12">12</a>].  The plant overwinters as a corm [<a href="#6">6</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Glacier lily has a deep-seated corm, generally 5 to 7 inches (13-18 cm)
below the soil surface, that escapes damage by fire.  The plant
resprouts from the corm the following season [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Glacier lily is
commonly found on moist sites that are less subject to burning [<a href="#28">28</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Erythronium grandiflorum

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
The top portion of glacier lily is killed by fire.  Usually, the top
is withered by the time of the summer dry season [<a href="#10">10</a>].



<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Glacier lily sprouts from the corm in first postfire growing season
[<a href="#28">28</a>].  Most likely, a fire would destroy the year's seed, preventing
new plant establishment during the first postfire year [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Glacier lily is fire resistant, but frequent fires would probably
suppress the species by eliminating the seed crop.
