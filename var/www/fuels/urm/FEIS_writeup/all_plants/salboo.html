<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Livestock:  Dense stands of Booth willow can be inaccessible to
livestock.  Cattle will utilize Booth willow if accessible [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].

Wildlife:  Booth willow is an important source of browse for deer, elk,
moose, and small mammals [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Moose utilize Booth willow stands
extensively in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Many avian
species nest and feed in Booth willow stands [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].

  


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Booth willow is highly palatable to deer, elk, beaver, and moose in
eastern Oregon [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Booth willow is less palatable to livestock and
ungulates than Geyer willow (Salix geyeriana), a frequent codominant.
Palatability of willows (Salix spp.) increases as the season progresses
[<a href="#35">35</a>].  Palatability of Booth willow to livestock and wildlife in several
western states has been rated as follows [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>]:

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Booth willow has been rated as fair in energy value and poor in protein
value [<a href="#13">13</a>].  


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Booth willow provides cover and protection for many birds and mammals.
It also provides shade for fish in streams and ponds [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  The
degree to which Booth willow provides environmental protection for
wildlife species during one or more seasons has been rated as follows
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>]:

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Booth willow is useful in stabilizing streambanks and providing erosion
control on severely disturbed sites [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  It is valuable in
revegetating disturbed riparian sites having high water tables and low
elevations [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Booth willow is capable of colonizing a wide range of
riparian sites such as rocky or gravelly sites near the water table to
drier benches with deep fine-textured soils [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Planting willow stem
cuttings has been recognized as a valuable tool for restoring riparian
habitats [<a href="#26">26</a>].  The use of willow in rehabilitation should be emphasized
[<a href="#13">13</a>].
    


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
All willows produce salacin, which is closely related chemically to
salicylic acid, the active ingredient in aspirin.  Native Americans used
the leaves of willows to treat mosquito bites, bee stings, and stomach
aches and used the stems for implements such as baskets, arrow shafts,
scoops, and fish traps. [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].
 


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Winter willow (Salix spp.) browsing by ungulates limits seed production
by (1) removing flower buds developed the previous fall; (2) stimulating
the plants to increase production of vegetative growth, thereby
allocating resources needed for reproductive growth to vegetative
growth; and (3) limiting the size of plants, which limits the number of
seeds produced.  In Yellowstone National Park, ungulate browsing has
almost eliminated willow seed production and, therefore, almost
eliminated willow populations.  Protection from browsing for at least 3
years is essential for the establishment of Booth willow [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Overgrazing by livestock can threaten riparian ecosystems unless
management practices favor their protection [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Soil surfaces may be
churned by livestock when moist, resulting in soil compaction,
streambank sloughing, and damage to vegetation [<a href="#13">13</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix boothii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Booth willow is a native, multibranched, rounded shrub typically between
9 and 18 feet (3 and 6 m) tall [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  On well-drained soils in Oregon,
Booth willow is broadly rounded and has many stems, but in bogs it is
dwarfed and has few stems [<a href="#20">20</a>].  At 10 years of age, Booth willow
reaches a height of approximately 8 feet (2.5 m).  Stems reach
senescence between the ages of 15 and 20 years [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Male and female
flowers occur on separate plants in 0.5- to 1.5-inch-long (1-1.5 cm),
erect catkins [<a href="#12">12</a>].
  


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction:  Booth willow is dioecious.  The fruit is contained
in a dehiscent capsule that releases many seeds.  Seeds are dispersed by
wind or water.  Optimum seed production occurs between 2 and 10 years
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  The seeds of Booth willow are short-lived and require newly
deposited or recently scoured sand or gravel bars for germination [<a href="#16">16</a>].
Germination is inhibited on sites with a continuous cover of tree litter
or those with indirect sunlight [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Seed germination occurs over a
broad temperature range, 41 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit (5-25 deg C).  This
appears to be a compensatory mechanism because of the short seed life
[<a href="#3">3</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Booth willow sprouts readily from the root
crown or basal stem.  Booth willow will sprout vigorously following
cutting regardless of cutting season, but vigor is more pronounced if
cutting occurs during the dormant season [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Booth willow is highly
tolerant of frost and flooding.  One adaptation under these conditions
is the formation of a soft, spongy tissue called aerenchyma.  This
tissue enlarges the lenticels in the stems and permits more efficient
gas exchange and regeneration of roots.  Growth is severely limited when
water levels are maintained at or above the root crown.  Adventitious
rooting will occur above the flooded soil [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
High moisture requirements limit Booth willow to riparian and lacustrine
areas, and in bottomlands with a high water table, such as wet meadows,
fens, bogs, and swamps [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Booth willow is best represented in
riparian communities within the Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) zone
and sagebrush/grass valley habitats.  It is also found in Engelmann
spruce (Picea engelmanii) dominated streambottoms in the upper
Douglas-fir zone [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Booth willow is a transitional species between
low-middle and middle elevations and between middle and middle-high
elevations [<a href="#1">1</a>]. It can be found intermittently in the lower subalpine
zone [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Booth willow is shade intolerant and grows best in full
sunlight [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].

Elevational range:  The elevational range for Booth willow in several
states is as follows [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>]:  

           Utah:  5,300 to 10,300 feet (1,615-3,140 m)
           Idaho:  7,400 to 8,800 feet (2,255-2,685 m)
           Wyoming:  5,900 to 7,800 feet (1,800-2,380 m)
           Nevada:  5,800 to 8,300 feet (1,770-2,532 m)

Soils:  Booth willow is usually found on moist sandy or gravelly soils
but is adapted to a wide variety of soil textures [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  The general
soil pH range for willows is 5.5 to 7.5.  Booth willow will tolerate
moderately alkaline soils but does poorly in strongly acidic or alkaline
conditions [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Growth of Booth willow is severely reduced when water
levels are maintained at or above the root crown for extended periods.

Plant associates:  Booth willow is commonly associated with the
following species:  Geyer willow, Drummond willow (Salix drummondiana),
thinleaf alder (Alnus tenuifolia), redosier dogwood (Cornus
stolonifera), water birch (Betula occidentalis), beaked sedge (Carex
rostrata), water sedge (C. aquatilis), bluejoint reedgrass
(Calamagrostis canadensis), mountain big sagebrush (Artemesia tridentata
ssp. vaseyana), bearberry honeysuckle (Lonicera involucrata), wood's
rose (Rosa woodsii), false-Solomons-seal (Smilacina stellata), field
horsetail (Equisetum arvense), bluegrass (Poa spp.), and sweet scented
bedstraw (Gallium triflorum) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

Booth willow is found in early to mid seral plant communities.  It is a
pioneer species on recent alluvial deposits and on recently disturbed
sites [<a href="#34">34</a>].  In Montana, the successional trend on former beaver ponds
or stream channels is from open water to beaked sedge or water sedge
communities to eventual codominance by Booth willow and other willow
species.  If the stand dries out, Booth willow will be replaced by
species better adapted to more xeric conditions [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Booth willow has
low shade tolerance and therefore loses dominance on sites that are
heavily forested or succeeded by more shade-tolerant species [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Booth willow flowers in late spring or midsummer, from May to June.  The
fruit ripens soon after plant flowering, followed by seed dispersal in
late July and early August [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix boothii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Booth willow is a fire-tolerant shrub.  It sprouts readily from the root
and root crown following top-kill by fire, especially in wetter stands
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  It produces numerous, minute seeds that are dispersed by wind,
and are important in colonizing recently burned areas [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Slow-moving
fires are more damaging to the roots and root crown of Booth willow than
are quick, hot fires; therefore the latter result in more sprouts [<a href="#13">13</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix boothii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Light to moderate fires top-kill Booth willow.  Severe fires can kill
willows completely by removing soil organic layers and charring the
roots [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Booth willow is a fire-tolerant shrub that has a short postfire
regeneration period [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Its seeds need a nutrient-rich mineral
seedbed to germinate.  The chance of Booth willow establishing after a
fire lessens as available mineral soil seedbeds become occupied by
faster growing herbaceous species and mosses [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Fire severity affects
the mode of willow postfire recovery.  Following light-severity fires
most willows recover quickly, sending up new shoots from undamaged root
crowns.  Few, if any , seedlings establish following this type of fire
because the partially consumed organic soil layers comprise an
unfavorable seedbed.  Following severe fire, however, the primary mode
of recovery is seedling establishment.  Severe fires that burn into
organic soils kill willows, but expose mineral soils which provide
excellent seedbeds [<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Prescribed burning of Booth willow stands is an effective method of
rejuvenating decadent clumps and stimulating sprouting [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Fires
increase the amount of browse available for herbivores because browse
species such as willow proliferate in early postfire succession [<a href="#14">14</a>].
