<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of alpine larch is Larix lyallii
Parl [<a href="#20">20</a>].  There are no recognized subspecies, varieties, or forms of
alpine larch.  Hybridization with western larch (Larix occidentalis) 
results in a genetically different tree [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].  Although these hybrids
occupy a similar geographic area, they inhabit different altitudinal
zones, separated from each other by 500 to 1,000 feet (150-300 m) [<a href="#2">2</a>].  
Differentiation between alpine larch and hybrids can be determined by 
analyzing the foliar terpenes and volatiles [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].

<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Larix lyallii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Alpine larch occupies two mountain systems:  the northern Rockies and
northern Cascades [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  It can be found on high mountains in southern
British Columbia and Alberta, north-central Washington, north-central
and east-central Idaho, and western Montana [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Alpine larch
exhibits a highly discontinuous distribution, which is believed to be a
remnant of a continuous range existing at a time when cooler, more
extensive timberline habitat existed [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>].  Typical alpine larch stands
are often isolated pockets of open, parklike groves, less than 0.05 acre
(0.2 ha) [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Alpine larch is a dominant species occupying the timberline habitat type
within the subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) series [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Principal
associates include whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), subalpine fir, and
Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Major undergrowth species
include mountain-heather (Phyllodoce empetriformis), smooth woodrush
(Luzula hitchcockii), and grouse whortleberry (Vaccinium scoparium)
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  See successional status for more information.

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Larix lyallii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Alpine larch wood has no potential commercial value [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].  No site
index or yield data have been developed for alpine larch stands.  Annual
yield capability has been estimated to be only 10 to 20 cubic feet per
acre (0.7-1.4 m3/ha) on sites having better than average productivity
[<a href="#23">23</a>].  Defect is very high, and no commercial timber harvesting has been
reported, or is likely [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Many timberline bird and mammal species are associated with alpine larch
communities.  Mountain goat, bighorn sheep, hoary marmot, pika, mule
deer, elk, black and grizzly bear, red squirrel, and snowshoe hare
are among the mammals that feed in alpine larch stands.  Blue grouse
feed heavily on the needles.  Two studies suggest that alpine larch
foliage may be one of the most important summer foods for blue grouse
[<a href="#3">3</a>].



<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Big mammals do not heavily browse alpine larch branches, twigs, or
foliage.  The primary consumers of needles are upland game birds such as
the blue grouse.


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Alpine larch provides concealment and thermal cover in an otherwise open
habitat.  Woodpeckers and other cavity nesters utilize the hollowed-out
portions of larger trees.  Larger mammals may utilize alpine larch
stands as windbreaks or burrows [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Grizzly bears often den in alpine
larch stands in Banff National Park [<a href="#2">2</a>].



<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Alpine larch contributes to watershed protection by stabilizing snow
loads on steep northern slopes, and thus reducing the threat of
avalanches.  Alpine larch is considered useful for high-elevation
reclamation projects [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Alpine larch communities are valued as wildlife habitat, and for outdoor
recreation and esthetics [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Photographers and hikers appreciate the
changing colors of alpine larch, which is a translucent bright green in
summer, and lemon yellow and gold in fall.  Dendrochronologists have
found alpine larch to be an excellent indicator of climatic variability
[<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Alpine larch is generally not placed under active management.  Disease
or insects cause little damage to this tree.  Occasionally, damage may
occur by an unidentified fly larvae (Diptera), which destroyed a heavy
seed crop in north-central Washington [<a href="#3">3</a>].  It is suspected that the
larch case bearer (Coleophora laricella) will eventually spread from
lower western larch stands to alpine larch stands [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Brown heart rot
caused by Quinine fungus (Fomes officinales) is often found in alpine
larch, but not often enough to be considered prevalent.  Needle blight
(Sarcotrochila alpina) and cast fungi (Hypodermella laricis) severely
infected many stands of alpine larch in British Columbia.  The most
common fungus infecting alpine larch is an unidentified canker, similar
to the European larch canker (Dasyscypha willkommii).  This fungus
creates noticeable swellings in young and mature twigs.  These fungi
weaken but usually do not kill the tree [<a href="#3">3</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Larix lyallii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Alpine larch is an intolerant, native, deciduous, coniferous tree
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  Dominant alpine larch usually live 400 to 500 years, but many
trees reach 700 years, and the oldest individuals may live up to 1,000
years [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Alpine larch generally has one erect bole, with a braided
stem.  It rarely grows as krummholz because its leaves are deciduous and
its buds are woody and protected [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Young alpine larch have very
flexible boles, which allow them to occupy snowslide and snow creep
sites [<a href="#3">3</a>].  As a high-elevation species, it averages 40 to 50 feet
(12-15 m) in height and 12 to 24 inches (30-60 cm) in d.b.h. on
north-facing slopes.  The largest recorded alpine larch, found in the
Cascade range of Washington, is 95 feet (29 m) tall and 79 inches (201
cm) d.b.h.

Alpine larch produces a coating of white tomentum on its growing shoots.
This 'wool' remains present for at least 1 year and is believed to
decrease water loss from these shoots by increasing the boundary layer
[<a href="#25">25</a>].  The leaves are grouped into clusters of 30 to 40 rigid needles,
borne on short, light bluish-green spurs, 1 to 2 inches (2-4 cm) long.
The bark is thin (generally less than 1 inch), initially smooth,
becoming more deeply furrowed with age.  Cones are reddish-yellow to
purple-green and 1 to 2 inches (3-5 cm) long.  The bracts are much
longer than the cone scales [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Alpine larch trees are generally
deeply rooted on poor soils.  They are well anchored by a large taproot
and long, continuous lateral roots [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte (mesophanerophyte)
   Phanerophyte (microphanerophyte)
   Therophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Flowering and fruiting:  Alpine larch can begin producing cones when
they are 100 years old, but generally do not produce seed in quantity
until they reach 200 years of age [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Alpine larch are monoecious.
Pollen is wind-dispersed from the male strobili in June, and by
September, small purplish cones 1.5 to 2.0 inches (4-5 cm) long emerge.
Low cone production can be attributed to late season frost damage.
Other factors limiting fertilization, pollination, and seed maturation
are unknown [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Seed production and dissemination:  Large seed crops are infrequent,
occurring only 1 year out of 10 in Montana.  Seeds are winged and are
usually wind-disseminated in September.  Snowslides have been known to
transport seeds to lower elevations [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Cleaned seed number between
105,000 and 163,000 per pound (231-359 500/kg).  Seed destruction by
fungi and larvae are discussed under management considerations.

Seedling establishment:  Studies have shown that without seed
scarification, germination rates are poor.  Dry winds and high
temperatures on southern slopes probably contribute to poor germination
[<a href="#3">3</a>].  Soaking seeds for 24 hours in 3 percent hydrogen peroxide solution
can improve seed germination [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Alpine larch seedlings generally
have five cotyledons, although four or six may appear.  They are narrow,
pointed, and 0.4 to 0.6 inch (1.0-1.5 cm) long.  Germination is epigeal.
Successful germination takes place mostly on moist mineral soil surfaces
on northern aspects.  Richards [<a href="#25">25</a>], however, found that height and
diameter growth for young alpine larch was 1.5 times greater on southern
exposures than on northern.  Seeds of alpine larch germinate in July,
soon after snowmelt; they require full light and low temperatures for
germination [<a href="#2">2</a>].

For the first 20 to 25 years, growth is typically very slow.  This
strategy allows for extensive establishment of the root system and
decreases the probably of top-kill from windthrow or heavy snowpack [<a href="#2">2</a>].
Alpine larch apparently become deeply rooted; thus, soil moisture near
the surface seems to have no influence on their growth [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Seedlings
16 to 25 years old and only 8 to 16 inches (20-40 cm) tall had taproots
penetrating 16 to 24 inches (20-40 cm) and laterals 8 to 24 inches
(20-60 cm) beneath the surface [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Alpine larch seedlings and
saplings up to 3 or 4 feet (1.00-1.25 m) tall exhibit evergreen basal
limbs.  This foliage lasts for two summers and helps establish alpine
larch on severe sites [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Hybridization is known to occur between alpine larch and western larch
[<a href="#17">17</a>].  Areas most likely to support hybrid populations are those that
have experienced natural disturbances, such as snow or rock slides.  The
creation of such microsites may allow these species to intermingle
because of their varying successional adaptabilities [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Alpine larch does not reproduce from sprouts.
Layering has been known to occur only in a few severely stunted trees or
krummholz [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Climate:  Alpine larch is most commonly found in very cold, moist, high
altitude sites.  Altitudinal limits are approximately 5,800 to 9,900
feet (1,770-3,010 m) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  The mean temperatures are below freezing
for 6 months [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Mean annual precipitation on most alpine larch sites
is between 32 and 75 inches (800 and 1,900 mm), occurring principally in
the form of snow and sleet.  Periods of drought do occur in late summer
but have minor effects on tree vigor.  Violent winds are very common,
often reaching hurricane velocity of 73 miles per hour (117 km/h).

Soils:  Alpine larch commonly grows on slopes covered with granite or
quartzite talus, not previously occupied by vascular plants.  This tree
will also establish itself in cracks between big boulders [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Soil
development on alpine larch sites is extremely poor due to low
temperatures and short growing seasons, which retard microbial and
chemical activity [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>].  The rocky shallow soils are generally very
gravelly loams, ranging in pH from 3.9 to 5.7 [<a href="#24">24</a>].  General
classification of apline larch soils are in fragmental, and loamy
skeletal families within the order Entisols (cryorthents) [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Alpine larch is an intolerant seral species that will decrease when
shaded by more shade-tolerant conifers [<a href="#11">11</a>].  This long-lived dominant
often forms pure stands 500 to 1,000 feet (150-300 m) above the
elevational limits of other conifers.  Alpine larch is generally
classified as an associate species within the whitebark pine, Engelmann
spruce, subalpine fir, and mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) habitat
types.  In higher elevation sites, alpine larch is classified under the
alpine larch/subalpine fir hts; while in lower elevation sites, it is
categorized more broadly into the subalpine fir/smooth woodrush hts
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

Alpine larch can be thought of as a pioneer species, establishing itself
on rocky surfaces.  It also proliferates after fire, avalanche, or other
site disturbances.  On some occasions, alpine larch will regenerate on
burned areas within the subalpine fir zone, 330 to 490 feet (100-150 m)
below its usual elevational limits [<a href="#2">2</a>].  This regenerative trend is more
dominant on northern exposures and at high elevations [<a href="#3">3</a>].  At the
highest timberline elevations, alpine larch fills a vacant niche
representing the potential climax.  Its ability to grow at higher
elevations than other conifers relates to its superior resistance to
winter dessication [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
The growing season for alpine larch lasts approximately 90 days.  Bud
development is triggered by rising mean air temperature to about 39
degrees Fahrenheit (4 deg C) and can be normally expected to begin the
end of May.  Shoot growth occurs mostly in July and progresses rapidly.
The height growth of a small alpine larch will average approximately 0.6
inch (1.5 cm) a year during the first 25 years.  Leaf fall and dormancy
are controlled by photoperiod.  Late summer drought, however, has been
shown to induce early yellowing [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Alpine larch far outlives its
associated conifer species and usually dies as a result of being
windblown after pronounced heart rot.  If lower limbs remain on the
stump, the tree can remain alive for many more decades [<a href="#3">3</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Alpine larch is a thin-barked species easily damaged by fire [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].
It does not usually suffer from fire effects because the tree tends to
occupy remote, rocky, cold sites where fire does not spread well [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].
Fire appears to have an important influence on the establishment of
alpine larch by creating mineral soil seedbeds [<a href="#5">5</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
On the occasion fire does reach alpine larch stands, the tree will not
do favorably under those of high intensity.  Pure stands of alpine
larch, particularly if krummholtz, have a high surface area that becomes
extremely flammable.  Low-intensity fires, however, may be beneficial to
open stands by consuming ground debris, or by reducing insects and
disease [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Being highly suseptible to fire, alpine larch's only defense seems to be
isolation on high rocky sites, and long life spans which result in thick
bark, self-pruning, and heavy seed crops.  Seedling establishment is
very successful on scarified sites because seedlings are able to anchor
quickly and mature in barren conditions, while out-living competitors by
hundreds of years [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>].
