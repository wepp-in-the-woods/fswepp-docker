<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Alnus rugosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Speckled alder is most common in the region surrounding the Great Lakes
and the St. Lawrence Seaway, including east-cental Canada, the Maritime
Provinces, and the Northeast and Lake States.  It is listed as the most
prominent (in biomass) understory shrub in Michigan's Upper Peninsula
[<a href="#44">44</a>].  In addition, speckled alder occurs sporadically throughout all
the remaining Canadian provinces and south along the Appalachian
Mountians to West Virginia and Maryland.  It is restricted to higher
elevations at the southern limit of its range [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Speckled alder is frequently found in riparian, bog, and nutrient-rich
swamp communities [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  It often dominates the understory shrub
layer in lowland stands of balsam fir (Abies balsamea), red spruce
(Picea rubens), northern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis), red maple
(Acer rubrum), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), tamarack (Larix laricina),
balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera), aspen (Populus spp.), birch (Betula
spp.), and black spruce (Picea mariana) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].
Other associates include cinnamon fern (Osmunda cinnamonea), high-bush
blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum), Sphagnum spp., and Carex spp. [<a href="#17">17</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Alnus rugosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Because of its coarse, shrubby growth-habit the wood of speckled alder
has no commercial value.  It is used locally for fuel [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  Mattson
and Winsaur [<a href="#40">40</a>] evaluated the potential for commercially harvesting
speckled alder for fuel and found that due to the lack of an efficient
way to handle small stems, commercial harvest of speckled alder is not
cost-effective.  Speckled alder supports symbiotic nitrogen-fixing
bacteria in root nodules.  The yields of timber-producing trees in the
genera Fraxinus, Liquidamber, Liriodendron, Picea, Pinus, Platanus,
Populus, and Pseudotsuga can be enhanced when these trees are grown
in association with speckled alder [<a href="#54">54</a>].




<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Moose, muskrats, beavers, cottontail rabbits, and snow-shoe hares feed
on the twigs and foliage of speckled alder [<a href="#25">25</a>].  In most cases its food
value is thought to be minor.  Speckled alder is considered
low-preference white-tailed deer browse [<a href="#25">25</a>] and is avoided by moose in
the Lake Superior region [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>], although reportedly important to
Fortune Bay moose in Newfoundland [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Songbirds, including redpolls
and goldfinches, feed on speckled alder seeds.  Woodcock and grouse eat
the buds and catkins as well [<a href="#25">25</a>].  In Wisconsin, the shade from
streamside alder thickets inhibited the growth of aquatic macrophytes,
which reduced the standing crop of stream invertebrates, and in turn
reducing wild brook-trout production [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The structural features of speckled alder thickets provide hiding cover
to moose and white-tailed deer, and drumming sites to woodcock and
grouse [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Beavers build dams and lodges with speckled alder.



<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Speckled alder's early seral nature, rapid release, and acceptance of a
wide variety of soils (described in Site Characteristics slot) make it a
good choice for disturbed site rehabilitation.  Its affinity for wet
sites makes it valuable for watershed management, providing stream-bank
stability and erosion control [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].

Seed and seedling stock are seldom available commercially.  Seed are
easily shaken from dried conelets collected during September and
October.  In the nursery, fresh seed should be broadcast and drilled
into washed sand or a washed sand-humus mixture.  Seedbeds should be
mulched for overwinter protection, although mulch should be removed
prior to germination in the spring.  Spring planting requires
stratification in moist sand or vermiculite for 60 to 90 days.  Seedbeds
should be kept moist and shaded until late in the summer.  Two- or
three-year-old seedlings should be used for field planting.  Site
preparation requires sod layer removal to prevent herbaceous competition
[<a href="#25">25</a>].

The presence of nitrogen-fixing, symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules
makes speckled alder valuable for soil conditioning.  Average annual
nitrogen accretion in an alder-dominated ecosystem in Connecticut was
74.6 pounds per acre (85 kg/ha), comparable to that of the leguminous
crops used in agriculture [<a href="#59">59</a>].  Various alder species have been used to
reclaim mining spoils in Great Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, and
the United States; and have improved soil fertility in the U.S.S.R.,
Italy, Denmark, Japan, and Taiwan [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  Planting trials in
copper-mine tailings suggest that speckled alder may not be a good
choice for the rehabilitation of this particular waste [<a href="#61">61</a>].  Managers
should recognize that the nitrogen-enhancing effects of speckled alder
are local and resricted to plants in the immediate vicinity [<a href="#40">40</a>].



<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Managers wishing to cultivate speckled alder for wildlife cover should
note the following recommendations:

        (1)  Cutting schemes should be designed to provide patches of
             various age classes.
        (2)  Overmature stands should be opened by clear-cutting.
        (3)  Spring and winter cutting produces the most rapid sprout
             growth.
        (4)  Thinning is best done in July or August.
        (5)  Speckled alder may out-compete native conifers.

Conifer competition can be reduced by controlling alder with basal
stump or foliage sprays of 2-4-5 T, and 2-4-D.  Proper guidelines for
the use of these chemicals must be followed [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Alder eradication
through burning is unlikely [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Speckled alder is sensitive to prolonged flooding above the root crown
[<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>] and may be sensitive to acid precipitation [<a href="#12">12</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Alnus rugosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Speckled alder, alternately described as a small tree and a large shrub
[<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>], is a locally common, deciduous, thicket-forming, woody plant.
It can grow as tall as 20 to 30 feet (6.1-9.2 m) with a 6-inch (15 cm)
diameter stem, although most specimens are not this large [<a href="#56">56</a>].
 
Speckled alder bark is thin and smooth and conspicuously marked with
orange lenticils, hence the name [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  Leaves are 2 to 4 inches long
(5-10 cm).

Speckled alders are monoecious.  The inflorescence is cymose and open.
Staminate catkins are 1.6 to 3.5 inches (4-9 cm) long.  Pistillate
catkins are sessile, cylindric, and 0.16 inch (5-6 mm) long [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].

The fruit of the speckled alder is an oval, 0.63 by 0.31 inch (16 by 8
mm), winged nutlet borne in egg-shaped conelets [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Twigs are
moderately slender.  Buds contain two or three bud scales.



<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (Microphanerophyte)
   Burned or Clipped state:  Chamaephyte
   Burned or Clipped state:  Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction:  Speckled alders are wind pollinated.  The winged
seeds ripen during late August and September and are dispersed by the
wind through April.  Little is known about seed-bearing age, seeds
produced per plant, or seed dispersal distances [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Germination
usually requires exposed mineral soil [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>], which may need to be
saturated [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Vegetative reproduction, rather than seedling
recruitment, provides most of the new stems in established alder stands
[<a href="#29">29</a>].  Vegetative reproduction occurs primarily via sprouting; but also
through layers, suckers, and underground stems [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Sprouting is
independent of stem damage.  Burgason [<a href="#9">9</a>] noted an equal number of
sprouts from the underground stems of burned and unburned speckled
alder.  Speckled alder is clonal and may form impenetrable thickets.
With conifer competition, local distribution is more diffuse.  Release
after removal of overstory competition is immediate [<a href="#58">58</a>].  Isolated
clumps expand radially and coalesce [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Scarification and mild intensity burning encourage speckled alder
regeneration [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>]. 



<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Speckled alder is a species of moist lowlands.  It frequently borders
streams and lakes.  It is common in swamps and the older zones of bogs
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  Throughout its range, speckled alder often dominates black
spruce, jack pine, tamarack, northern white-cedar, and birch-aspen
understories on nutient-rich, mesic sites [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  Where
speckled alder's range overlaps that of its close relative, American
green alder (Alnus crispa), it tends to be found on lowland sites and
American green alder tends to be found on upland sites [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Soils:  Speckled alder adapts to a variety of soils provided they are
moist and nutient-rich.  In Wisconsin, speckled alder grows in mucky
soils, which are relatively shallow over glacial till or deep over
lacustrine peat [<a href="#15">15</a>].  It also grows in sandy loams, grey forest soils,
minerotropic peatlands, alluvial soils, and ericaceous bogs
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  Speckled alder has been described growing on both
poorly drained [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>] and well-drained [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>] sites.  Soil pH
varies between 4.8 and 7.7 [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].

Shade tolerance:  Although prevalent as an understory shrub, speckled
alder grows more vigorously in the full sunlight of forest openings and
sparsely stocked stands.  It shows rapid release upon removal of the
overstory and is decribed as shade intolerant to intermediately shade
intolerant [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].




<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Speckled alder is an early seral species that quickly invades forest
openings created by fire and/or logging.  It is an early colonizer of
gaps in wetland forests [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Exposure of the mineral soil creates
optimal seedbeds and speeds speckled alder's invasion of a site
[<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  Historically, speckled alder may have been an early
colonizer of recently deglaciated areas in North America [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Although present at low densities in some stands, overstory removal can
trigger a rapid increase in speckled alder.  After logging black spruce
from nutrient-rich peatland, speckled alder may form nearly pure
thickets, outcompeting black spruce seedlings and effectively arresting
succession [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Speckled alder eventually gives way to conifers on
most sites [<a href="#21">21</a>].



<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Speckled alder is deciduous.  Flowers appear late in summer and become
functional the following May or April [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Fruit ripens from
late August through September [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  The seeds are dispersed by wind
through the following April [<a href="#42">42</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Alnus rugosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Speckled alders survive fire through persistent root crowns.  Sprouting
occurs from underground stems at or within 2 inches (5 cm) of the soil
surface [<a href="#9">9</a>].



<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex






</pre>

<pre>
<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Alnus rugosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire kills the aboveground portion of the plant.  Root crowns in the
mineral soil burn only under the most severe burning conditions, but
they can be killed by the heat generated during a fire.  Severe fires
that remove the organic layer and expose and char root crowns can
completely eliminate sprouting in speckled alder [<a href="#63">63</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
Open-growing alders are generally more vulnerable to fire than
thicket-growing alders because very little understory fuel accumulates
in speckled alder thickets.  In a New York study, 71 percent of the
open-growing alder were killed compared to only 33 percent of the
thicket-growing alder (55 percent overall).  Burn intensity was not
reported [<a href="#9">9</a>].



<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Following mild fires, speckled alder sprouts quickly from persistent
root crowns.  An able competitor, it can outcompete some crop-tree
species and delay or arrest succesion [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Severe fires delay alder
regeneration.  Speckled alders in the Lake States reach peak abundance
10 years after fire [<a href="#47">47</a>].



<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
In Minnesota, cutting and burning reduced alder cover but resulted in
substantial increases in other tall shrubs and graminoids.  Low
temperatures, high humidity, and high fuel moisture characterized less
severe burns that did not inhibit alders.  Other tall shrubs showed an
opposite trend--more severe fires favored gramanoids and tall shrubs.
Severe burns reduce alder but, because alder increases significantly
with time after cutting and burning, its reduction is temporary.
Eventually speckled alder supplements the other tall shrub growth [<a href="#2">2</a>].



<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Information on the postfire response of speckled alder comes from
studies of crop-tree silviculture in the boreal region where speckled
alder is a common understory species.  Postfire competition by speckled
alder sprouts can inhibit crop-tree regeneration [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].

Where speckled alder is present, fire and most logging practices will
favor it over competing species [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Speckled alder releases quickly
after overstory removal and readily invades disturbed sites.  Fire
suppression favors the continued growth of alder and other tall shrubs
in boreal forest understories (typically fir, spruce, and cedar).
Ladder fuels form which can carry fire to overstory crowns, destroying
conifer seed production [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  Bergason [<a href="#9">9</a>] recommends 9-year fire
intervals to keep speckled alder stands at an early succesional stage.
Longer fire intervals may encourage the expansion of alder thickets at
the expense of other forest types [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Mild spring and early summer fires which kill only the aerial portion of
the stem are recommended for speckled alder regeneration, although
resprouting is not as vigorous after repeated fires [<a href="#8">8</a>].

The timing of a prescribed burn is important when managing alder
ecosystems for wildlife.  A May burn of a speckled alder understory in
Manitoba caused the loss of an entire ruffed grouse cohort when nests
burned [<a href="#20">20</a>].
