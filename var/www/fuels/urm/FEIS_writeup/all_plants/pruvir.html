Chokecherry is widely distributed throughout southern Canada and much of
the United States.  It occurs from Newfoundland to British Columbia and
south to North Carolina, Tennessee, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas,
New Mexico, California, and northern Mexico.  Plants showing a gradation from black chokecherry to common chokecherry occur in Kansas and Nebraska.  The three varieties are distributed as follows [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>]:<br><br>

common chokecherry - eastern variety; occurs 
     from Saskatchewan to Newfoundland southward to Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee
     and North Carolina<br><br>
black chokecherry - restricted to the western
     portion of North America; occurs in southern Canada from eastern British
     Columbia to Alberta and the Dakotas; southward throughout the Rocky
     Mountains to New Mexico; and along the east slope of the Cascade Range to 
     northern California<br><br>
western chokecherry - occurs from British Columbia southward into northern Mexico, Texas, and California (except the coast and Central Valley)

The 3 chokecherry varieties occur in numerous habitat types and plant communities. Chokecherry often forms mixed stands with other tall shrubs.  Common plant associates of chokecherry in some areas are listed below by state or province.<br><br>  

<b>Idaho</b>:  Associated tall shrubs on logged sites in a northern Idaho western redcedar-western hemlock (<i>Thuja plicata-Tsuga heterophylla</i>) zone include Rocky Mountain maple (<i>Acer glabrum</i>), Saskatoon serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier alnifolia</i>), redstem ceanothus (<i>Ceanothus sanguineus</i>), snowbrush ceanothus (<i>C. velutinus</i>), dogwood (<i>Cornus</i> spp.), oceanspray (<i>Holodiscus discolor</i>), mockorange (<i>Philadelphus lewisii</i>), ninebark (<i>Physocarpus malvaceus</i>), bitter cherry (<i>Prunus emarginata</i>), cascara (<i>Rhamnus purshiana</i>), Scouler willow (<i>Salix scouleriana</i>), and red elderberry (<i>Sambucus racemosa</i>) [<a href="#173">173</a>]. In southern and central Idaho, chokecherry occurs in a number of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> var. <i>glauca</i>) habitat types, along with Pacific ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i> var. <i>ponderosa</i>), Rocky Mountain maple and quaking aspen (<i>Populus tremuloides</i>) [<a href="#143">143</a>].<br><br>

<b>Michigan</b>:  Chokecherry occurs in northern Lake Michigan coastal sand dune communities that range from 175 to 835 years old, but is most prevalent in communities 225 to 400 years old. Associated overstory dominants in mixed-pine forests in a similar 200-400 year range include balsam fir (<i>Abies balsamifera</i>), paper birch (<i>Betula papyrifera</i>), red pine (<i>Pinus resinosa</i>), white pine (<i>Pinus strobus</i>), white spruce (<i>Picea strobus</i>), and northern white-cedar (<i>Thuja occidentalis</i>) [<a href="#99">99</a>]. In northern white-cedar forests in lower northern Michigan, important plant associates are sugar maple (<i>Acer saccharum</i>), white ash (<i>Fraxinus americana</i>), mountain maple (<i>Acer spicatum</i>), paper birch, basswood (<i>Tilia americana</i>), alternate-leaved dogwood (<i>C. alternifolia</i>), ironwood (<i>Ostrya virginiana</i>) and balsam fir [<a href="#3">3</a>].  <br><br>

<b>Minnesota</b>: Northeastern forests: overstory species include quaking aspen, bigtooth aspen (<i>Populus grandidentata</i>), red pine, and jack pine (<i>Pinus banksiana</i>).  Common tall shrub species include mountain maple, American green alder (<i>Alnus viridis</i> ssp. <i>crispa</i>), alternate-leaf dogwood, round-leaved dogwood (<i>C. rugosa</i>) and serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier</i> spp.) [<a href="#13">13</a>].<br><br>

In the northwestern forest and transition zones of Minnesota, overstory associates include bur oak (<i>Quercus macrocarpa</i>), American elm (<i>Ulmus americana</i>), basswood, sugar maple, green ash, quaking aspen, paper birch, ironwood, and balsam poplar (<i>Populus balsamifera</i>). Common shrub associates include smooth sumac (<i>Rhus glabra</i>), dogwood (<i>Cornus</i> spp.), black cherry (<i>Prunus serotina</i>), and sugar maple. [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].<br><br>

In Minnesota oak (<i>Quercus</i> spp.) savanna overstory dominants include bur oak and pin oak (<i>Q. ellipsoidalis</i>). Shrubs commonly associated with chokecherry include smooth sumac and American hazel (<i>Corylus americana</i>) [<a href="#169">169</a>].<br><br>

<b>Montana</b>:  Plant associates in riparian sites in western and central Montana include Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, Rocky Mountain juniper (<i>Juniperus scopulorum</i>), Pacific ponderosa pine, big sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i>), western snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos occidentalis</i>) and ninebark [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>]. In eastern Montana hardwood forests that extend into the Dakotas, chokecherry occurs commonly with green ash, plains cottonwood (<i>Populus deltoides</i> var. <i>monilifera</i>), American elm, and box elder (<i>Acer negundo</i>) [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>]. <br><br>


<b>Nevada and Utah</b>;  Dominant associated shrubs in sagebrush (<i>Artemisia</i> spp.) rangelands in northeastern Nevada and mountain brush communities in Utah include Saskatoon serviceberry,  shadscale (<i>Atriplex confertifolia</i>), rubber rabbitbrush (<i>Chrysothamnus nauseosus</i>), green rabbitbrush (<i>C. viscidiflorus</i>), antelope bitterbrush  (<i>Purshia tridentata</i>), mountain snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos oreophilus</i>), Gambel oak (<i>Quercus gambelii</i>), Wood's rose (<i>Rosa woodsii</i>), ninebark, curlleaf mountain-mahogany (<i>Cercocarpus ledifolius</i>), Rocky Mountain juniper, Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, and white fir (<i>Abies concolor</i>).  [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>].<br><br>

<b>North Carolina</b>:  In a red spruce-Fraser fir (<i>Picea rubens-Abies fraseri</i>) forest in the Plott Balsam Mountains, chokecherry occurs with pin cherry, American mountain-ash (<i>Sorbus americana</i>), mountain maple, alternate-leaf dogwood, red maple (<i>Acer rubrum</i>), and willow (<i>Salix</i> spp.) species [<a href="#128">128</a>].<br><br>

<b>North Dakota</b>: Chokecherry occurs in Missouri river slopes, floodplains, and also western woodlands. Tree associates are green ash (<i>Fraxinus pennsylvanica</i>), box elder, American elm, bur oak, basswood, quaking aspen, paper birch,  Rocky  Mountain juniper, ponderosa pine, and limber pine (<i>Pinus flexilus</i>).  Common shrubs and woody vines in the floodplains include peach-leaved willow (<i>S. amygdaloides</i>),  dogwood, western snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos occidentalis</i>), eastern poison-ivy (<i>Toxicodendron radicans</i>), Saskatoon serviceberry, woodbine (<i>Parthenocissus inserta</i>), and frost grape (<i>Vitis vulpina</i>) [<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#171">171</a>].<br><br>

<b>Pennsylvania</b>:  In central Pennsylvania mixed-oak valley floor forests, dominant species associated with chokecherry are white oak (<i>Q. alba</i>), red oak (Q<i>. rubra</i>),  black oak (<i>Q. velutina</i>) and black cherry [<a href="#2">2</a>].<br><br>

<b>South Dakota and Wyoming</b>: Hoffman and Alexander [<a href="#77">77</a>] describe a ponderosa pine (<i>P. ponderosa</i> var. <i>scopulorum</i>/chokecherry community type occurring on the Black Hills National Forest. Important associates in this community are Saskatoon serviceberry, white spirea (<i>Spirea betulifolia</i>), and Oregon-grape (<i>Mahonia repens</i>). The authors list chokecherry as an important component in bur oak, ponderosa pine and quaking aspen series of habitat types. River drainage species in green ash/chokecherry habitats are similar to those listed for North Dakota.<br><br>

<b>Vermont</b>: In the Green Mountains chokecherry occurs where common overstory trees are sugar maple, American beech (<i>Fagus grandifolia</i>), yellow birch (<i>Betula alleghaniensis</i>), red spruce, and balsam fir.  Abundant understory shrub associates include striped maple (<i>Acer pensylvanicum</i>), mountain maple, pin cherry (<i>P. pensylvanica</i>), and American mountain-ash [<a href="#136">136</a>].<br><br>

<b>Wisconsin</b>:  In southwestern oak-hickory (<i>Quercus-Carya</i> spp.) forests (where replacement of oaks by others species is a recognized problem), chokecherry occurs where dominant overstory species include sugar maple, green ash, and slippery elm (<i>Ulmus rubra</i>) [<a href="#100">100</a>].<br><br>

Chokecherry exhibited salt tolerance in a greenhouse study [<a href="#155">155</a>]. 
<p> 

Chokecherry can be propagated from seed or rhizome cuttings [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>,<a href="#166">166</a>].  
About half of unstratified seed germinates within 60 days of collection; delayed germination can occur up to 120 days of sowing [<a href="#166">166</a>].  More consistent germination is achieved following cool, moist stratification lasting from 120 to 160 days at 36 to 41 degrees Fahrenheit (2.2-5

<p>

Nursery-grown seedlings of chokecherry establish satisfactorily if planted free of competition on sites with at least 15 inches (38 cm) of annual precipitation.  Young plants are not tolerant of competing vegetation for 2 to 3 years following planting [<a href="#110">110</a>].</p>

Chokecherry plants are widely used as ornamentals.  Chokecherry produces
an abundance of attractive white flowers characterized by a strong,
sweet, almondlike fragrance. This species is also valued for its
fruit.  Plantings increase habitat and natural food
supplies for birds frequenting residential areas.  Chokecherry is
extensively planted for windbreaks in the prairie, plains, and western
mountains [<a href="#166">166</a>].

Chokecherries are edible and, although somewhat astringent, are
relatively sweet when fully ripe.  Fruits are used to make wines,
syrups, jellies, and jams.  Indigenous peoples gathered chokecherries
and used them to make pemmican and treat cold sores [<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>].  The Paiutes
made a medicinal tea from the leaves and twigs to treat colds and
rheumatism [<a href="#113">113</a>].

<p class="subframeText">

Grazing:  Chokecherry is moderately tolerant of browsing [<a href="#66">66</a>], but heavy grazing by livestock and wild ungulates has impacted populations in many areas, especially the northern Great Plains [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#179">179</a>].
<p>

Chokecherry foliage can be poisonous to grazing livestock [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>].  Research has identified the toxic compound in chokecherry as the cyanogenic glycoside prunasin [<a href="#101">101</a>].  One-half gram of prunasin can produce approximately 46 mg of hydrogen cyanide (HCN); daily doses of 50 mg HCN/1 kg body weight are considered dangerous.  Hydrogen cyanide is liberated either in the
plant as a result of frost damage or in the animal during digestion.
Results of that study indicated that prunasin concentrations are highest (5%) in the new stems and newly initiated leaves of chokecherry.
Elevated levels (greater than 2.5%) are maintained in the leaves throughout
the summer, but prunasin content of new twigs gradually diminishes over
the season.  The previous season's growth is generally not as toxic
(1.2 to 2.2%) [<a href="#166">166</a>].</p>
<p>Pest management concerns: Chokecherry can be controlled by herbicides or plowing [<a href="#116">116</a>]. In the northeastern United
States chokecherry is a primary host of the eastern tent caterpillar
[<a href="#164">164</a>].</p>
<p>

Chokecherry is susceptible to attack by the fungus <i>Plowrightia
stansburiana</i>, which causes knotlike cankers to develop on stems.  This
condition eventually kills infected stems [<a href="#92">92</a>].  Afflicted plants
usually have a shortened life span [<a href="#166">166</a>].

Chokecherry is a native, deciduous, thicket-forming erect shrub or small
tree.  Stems are numerous and slender, either branching from the base or
with main branches upright and spreading [<a href="#166">166</a>].  Heights vary
considerably according to variety and site quality, ranging from 3 to
19.5 feet (1-6 m) [<a href="#73">73</a>].  In the Great Basin,
chokecherry may grow to almost 40 feet (12 m) with trunk diameters of
approximately 8 inches (20 cm) [<a href="#92">92</a>].  Perfect
flowers are borne on leafy twigs of the season.  Fruits are drupes, each
containing a small stone [<a href="#73">73</a>].  Chokecherries have a network of
rhizomes and a deep root system established at
intervals along the rhizomes [<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#140">140</a>,<a href="#175">175</a>].  Roots may extend laterally more than 35 feet (10.6 m) and vertically more than 6 feet (1.8 m) [<a href="#175">175</a>].  Rhizomes range from 0.4 to 0.8 inch (1-2 cm) in diameter [<a href="#129">129</a>]. <br><br>

Chokecherry reproduces sexually and vegetatively. In laboratory
experiments involving excised rhizomes which were approximately 11 years
of age, Schier [<a href="#129">129</a>] observed that chokecherry rhizomes sprouted at a faster
rate and had higher sprouting percentages than Gambel oak (<i>Quercus
gambelii</i>) rhizomes. <br><br>

Seed crops are typically regular and viable [<a href="#111">111</a>], with seed-producing
capacity higher in plants on open sites [<a href="#166">166</a>]. Seeds are surrounded by a
stony endocarp that may offer some resistance to germination but is
permeable to moisture.  Chokecherry has seed dormancy; an after-ripening
period in the presence of oxygen and moisture is necessary for adequate
germination [<a href="#60">60</a>]. <br><br>

Rogers and Applegate [<a href="#124">124</a>] reported significantly (<i>P</i> <0.01) enhanced germination  in chokecherry seeds ingested by black bears in Minnesota and attributed this to acid and mechanical scarification of seeds in the digestive tract. <br><br> 

Although large numbers of chokecherry seeds may be deposited beneath parent
plants, long-distance dispersal also occurs via frugivorous birds
and mammals [<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>,<a href="#170">170</a>,<a href="#172">172</a>].  Meyer and Witmer [<a href="#107">107</a>] studied the effect of gut-scarification on chokecherry seeds fed to captive frugivorous birds.  Removal of fruit pulp was critical for germination, but they found no differences in germination success between seeds manually cleaned of pulp and bird-passed seeds lacking pulp.  Seeds of chokecherry that were defecated and planted with feces, mimicking natural deposition, had reduced germination relative to manually cleaned seeds.  Artificial seed treatments to enhance germination are discussed in the Value and Use section of this report.<br><br>

Viable seed persists in the soil seedbank.  In a closed-canopy forest in northern Idaho, chokecherry seeds were found in soil samples taken at depths of up to 4 inches (10 cm); overall seed viability equaled approximately 27% [<a href="#86">86</a>].

In the western United States, chokecherry grows at low to mid-elevations in positions in the landscape where combinations of soil and topography permit greater than average accumulation of moisture.  These sites include riparian areas, wooded draws, and steep ravines [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#149">149</a>,<a href="#163">163</a>].  Soils supporting chokecherry are variable, ranging from Entisols to Mollisols, and soil texture ranges from silt to sandy loam.  Chokecherry can tolerate weakly saline soils but is intolerant of poor drainage and prolonged flooding [<a href="#66">66</a>]. <br><br>

Chokecherry grows in very acid to moderately alkaline soils.  In the green ash/chokecherry habitat type in the northern Great Plains, pH ranged from 6.0 to 7.6 in loam, clay, and clay loam [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#163">163</a>]. In deciduous forests in Vermont, glacial till soils supporting chokecherry  had a pH ranging from 3.5 to 5.5 [<a href="#136">136</a>].  Where chokecherry occurred in forests growing on coastal Lake Michigan sand dunes, pH ranged from approximately 4.0 to 6.0 [<a href="#99">99</a>].

Because chokecherry occurs so widely, it is reported in numerous habitat types and plant associations that range from post-disturbance invaders to early-successional to climax or stable. It grows in sparse stands, dense thickets, and under open forest canopies [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>].  It is shade tolerant [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>], but reaches its greatest density near forest edges [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>]. Plant association descriptions for most the studies discussed below appear in the Distribution and Occurrence section of this species report.<br><br>


EASTERN AND CENTRAL REGION<br><br>

In the eastern and central region of the U.S. and Canada, chokecherry occurs in a broad range of successional habitats.  It been studied in both seral and climax or stable communities. It resprouts readily and also persists under open and closed forest canopies.<br><br>  

Chokecherry was characterized as early-successional following logging and (or) burning in northern white-cedar and jack pine forests in Michigan [<a href="#1">1</a>]. Chokecherry was mid-successional in coastal Lake Michigan chronosequences that focused on long-term vegetation succession on sand dunes, reaching its greatest abundance after pine and oak cover was well developed  [<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>].<br><br>  

In Pennsylvania mixed-oak forests chokecherry was described as a later-successional understory species where the overstory is dominated by oak and pine [<a href="#2">2</a>].<br><br>

In a 1924 study of succession in northwestern Minnesota chokecherry was prominent in non-climax brush stands in ecotones between prairie and deciduous forests [<a href="#47">47</a>]. In a 1951 study in northern Minnesota chokecherry was noted as a major component in the sparse shrub layer of a climax maple-basswood forest.  The maple-basswood forest was characterized as having light penetration of less than 5%, indicating shade tolerance, at least in  mature chokecherry [<a href="#31">31</a>]. <br><br> 

In a 1964 study in Vermont, chokecherry was one of 14 shrub species documented in the understory of an old, undisturbed remnant of northern hardwood forest.  Sugar maple, beech, and white ash were overstory dominants.  The authors predicted that this assemblage replaces itself in forest succession, creating a stable overstory community [<a href="#23">23</a>].<br><br>

In Ontario, following forest clearcutting and brush removal for a utility right-of-way, chokecherry was a prominent initial colonizer.  The original forest cover was dominated by sugar maple, white ash, quaking aspen and black cherry.  In addition to abundant chokecherry seedlings, raspberry  (<i>Rubus</i> spp.) seedlings and sprouts, and sprouts from quaking aspen were also prolific initial colonizers. After 6 years chokecherry and quaking aspen stems had declined and white ash stems had become most numerous.  The author indicated that rapid invasion by chokecherry and raspberry, followed by replacement with more shade-tolerant species was a common pattern of secondary succession [<a href="#27">27</a>].<br><br> 

In southern and western North Dakota chokecherry is an indicator species for the green ash/chokecherry woodland habitat type [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].  This habitat type is characterized as a topographic climax.  Where disturbance from livestock grazing is heavy, shrub cover is greatly reduced and unpalatable western snowberry  becomes dominant.  Tree seedlings and saplings decline, leaving only older trees and an open understory [<a href="#65">65</a>]. In southern North Dakota chokecherry is an indicator species for the interior ponderosa pine/chokecherry habitat type, determined to be an edaphic climax.  In undisturbed vegetation of this type, ponderosa pine forms a closed overstory and chokecherry shrubs reach about 3.28 feet (1 m) in height.  Chokecherry responds to fire in these stands by resprouting vegetatively, and as succession advances following fire, chokecherry gradually increases while other shrubs decrease [<a href="#64">64</a>]. The green ash/chokecherry and interior ponderosa pine/chokecherry habitat types also occur in South Dakota and eastern Montana [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>].<br><br>


WESTERN STATES<br><br>

In the western United States, chokecherry is usually identified as seral but persists under closed canopies in mature conifer forests and in riparian areas. Central Rocky Mountain quaking aspen stands, where chokecherry is prevalent in the tall shrub layer, are thought to be a regional transition zone between sporadic groves and extensive forests.  The quaking aspen/chokecherry community is categorized as seral [<a href="#114">114</a>].<br><br>

In a classification of forest habitats of Montana [<a href="#119">119</a>], chokecherry is  documented in numerous habitat types within forest climax series for limber pine, ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, and Engelmann spruce.  In that classification it is also an indicator species for a ponderosa pine/chokecherry type present in eastern Montana (see discussion in North Dakota section above). In river drainages of central Montana,  Eichorn and Watts [<a href="#46">46</a>] studied succession following wildfire.  In burned north-slope sites characterized by a Douglas-fir/common juniper association, chokecherry, snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos</i> spp.) and rose (<i>Rosa</i> spp.) were predominant among shrubs that increased significantly (<i>P</i><0.05) in years 5 through 28 following burning. In Douglas-fir habitat types in western Montana, chokecherry becomes common after stand-replacing wildfires and clearcuts with or without subsequent broadcast burns [<a href="#8">8</a>]. <br><br>

In central Idaho chokecherry is classified by Steele and Geier-Hayes [<a href="#143">143</a>] as mid-seral in 7 Douglas-fir habitat types.  Though seral to Douglas-fir climax forests, these sites may be dominated by open-canopy stands of fire-maintained ponderosa pine.  Chokecherry may regenerate vegetatively or by seed following logging or burning, depending on the type and severity of the disturbance.<br><br>

In a central Utah study, Christensen [<a href="#33">33</a>] reported that although mountain brush stands are often interpreted as stable, chokecherry was among 10 shrub species in a mountain brush stand undergoing transition to a conifer stand dominated by white fir and Douglas-fir.  The author interpreted the transition as primary succession because no evidence was found of disturbance by livestock use, fire or logging. Chokecherry is common in Gambel oak communities in Utah, which Kunzler and others [<a href="#90">90</a>] predicted might succeed to ponderosa pine, bigtooth maple (<i>Acer grandidentatum</i>), or white fir and Douglas-fir, depending on site conditions.  Chokecherry is common in northern Utah quaking aspen stands, which are reported to succeed to conifer stands [<a href="#14">14</a>].  In a study of early succession following clearcutting of quaking aspen, chokecherry and snowberry were "by far" the most dominant shrubs in uncut control plots.  In the 4 years following clearcutting, percent composition of chokecherry in the undergrowth increased by much as 5 times over that in the control plots.  The authors did not indicate the method of chokecherry regeneration in the clearcuts [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Chokecherry is well adapted to disturbance by fire [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#174">174</a>,<a href="#177">177</a>].  Although susceptible to to top-kill by fire, it resprouts rapidly and prolifically from surviving root crowns and rhizomes [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>,<a href="#166">166</a>]. 
Several studies reporting chokecherry recovery by sprouting are discussed in the Fire Effects section of this report. Seed germination improves with heat treatment, suggesting scarification by fire is an important adaptation [<a href="#127">127</a>]. Postfire regeneration probably also involves the germination of off-site seed dispersed by mammals and birds [<a href="#162">162</a>].<br><br> 

No data were found for natural intervals of fire in stands that consist mainly of chokecherry.  Gartner [<a href="#52">52</a>] provides a description of pre and post-settlement accounts of fire in the grasslands and ponderosa forests of the Black Hills of South Dakota. The historical information is detailed, but  fire return intervals are not given. Hansen [<a href="#63">63</a>] provides limited historical and fire interval information for Minnesota forests in Isle Royale National Park, Itasca State Park, and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area. Twenty-six lighting fires were recorded on Isle Royale from 1965 to 1949.  In Itasca State Park the incidence of fires caused by lighting or set by Indians before 1859 averaged about one fire every 12 years.  In the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, major fires recurred at 5- to 50-year intervals from 1600 to 1920.   <br><br>


Fire regimes for other plant communities in which chokecherry occurs are summarized below.

Fire often kills aboveground chokecherry stems and foliage, but it quickly resprouts, either the same year following a spring burn, or by the next growing season [<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>,<a href="#166">166</a>,<a href="#177">177</a>].  In the South Dakota Black Hills chokecherry sprouts were double the preburn numbers within 2 months of an early May burn [<a href="#51">51</a>].  Conversely, in an early May prescribed burn in central Alberta quaking aspen parkland, chokecherry shrubs did not resprout within the first 3 months following burning [<a href="#63">63</a>]. Fire intensity was not described for either study.<br><br>  

A prescribed fire study was conducted in northern Idaho to test the effect of spring versus fall burning on elk browse. Measurements were made of crown diameter, crown height, number of basal sprouts, and sprout height before and after each burn.  Postfire measurements were made on 11 shrubs the first growing season after the fall burns. Seasonal fire effects were similar for chokecherry crown diameter, crown height, and sprout height. Though not statistically significant (at <i>P</i> = 0.05), the number of chokecherry basal sprouts was somewhat higher after the spring burn, suggesting that spring burning may be more conducive to the rapid recovery of chokecherry
than fall burning [<a href="#97">97</a>].<br>

Most studies report either an increase in chokecherry in the years following fire, or an increase followed by a return to prefire numbers. After wildfires in the oakbrush zone in Utah, McKell [<a href="#105">105</a>] reported twice as many chokecherry stems sprouting from root crowns on 1-year-old burns than on adjacent unburned sites.  A reduction to prefire densities occurred within 18 years.<br><br>  

Following wildfires in Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir/Rocky Mountain juniper/Wyoming big sagebrush associations in the Missouri Breaks area of central Montana, chokecherry canopy cover increased consistently for 13 years, then stabilized [<a href="#46">46</a>].<br><br>

Bock and Bock [<a href="#22">22</a>] compared data from prescribed  October burns in 1974 and 1979 in the South Dakota Black Hills. The 1974 burn escaped and became a crown fire, killing ponderosa pines of all sizes. The 1979 fire remained a controlled understory fire.  When measured in 1981, the 1974 burn site supported higher densities of all woody taxa except chokecherry and western poison-ivy <i>(Toxicodendron rydbergii)</i>.  There was no significant difference (<i>P</i> = 0.71) in numbers of chokecherry plants between the 2 burn sites.  Measurements taken within the 1979 surface fire site (prefire, postfire yr 1, and postfire yr 2) showed that chokecherry stems were not significantly (<i>P</i> = 0.75) reduced by the fire. <br><br> 

Geier-Hayes [<a href="#53">53</a>] included chokecherry in a study of vegetation response to helicopter logging and broadcast burning in an Idaho Douglas-fir forest.  Data were collected in 3 cutting units prior to burning and 1,2,5 and 10 years after. Fire severity was higher in 2 of the units and altered the vegetation from the original.  Fires classed at a severity level of 2M [<a href="#126">126</a>] were less severe and had  little or no impact on chokecherry percent cover and root frequency.  2M fires are characterized as having a flame length of 2 to 4 feet (0.6-1.2 m) and a corresponding crown scorch height of 9 to 24 feet (2.7-7.3 m), with moderate ground charring.  The units that burned hotter, having a severity rating of 3M had markedly less chokecherry cover and root frequency during all postburn years measured.  3M fires have flame lengths of 8 to 12 feet (2.4-3.7 m), corresponding crown scorch to 64 feet (20 m), with moderate ground charring.<br><br> 

Following a September prescribed burn in a quaking aspen stand in Idaho, chokecherry biomass exceeded preburn biomass within 2 seasons and was double preburn biomass after 5 seasons [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Biomass was computed using weight versus stem diameter relationships [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Details of fuel conditions are provided: litter and woody material moisture content was 8 to 9% and herbaceous vegetation was 40 to 50% cured.  Fire severity was rated as moderate to high [<a href="#126">126</a>]. <br><br> 

After 24 years of annual early spring burning in quaking aspen parklands in Alberta,  chokecherry percent cover had decreased but the number of stems increased in density from 6% to 15% [<a href="#5">5</a>]. <br><br>

In a 20-year study of the effects of fire frequency on Minnesota oak savanna herbs and shrubs, Tester [<a href="#150">150</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>] determined that increased fire frequency tended to increase the density of native, true prairie shrubs and decrease the density of native, non-prairie shrubs (including chokecherry). Chokecherry cover estimates were negatively correlated with burn frequency (<i>r</i> = -0.51, <i>P</i> = 0.09).<br><br>

Chokecherry is a component of persistent, fire-maintained seral shrubfields on steep slopes in Northern Idaho.  Fuels in shrubfields differ in quantity and distribution from those on forested sites.  Herbaceous and large woody fuels are relatively light.  Live and dead shrub biomass, which includes chokecherry, can reach nearly 20 tons per acre.  After fires, which are severe during summer drought conditions, dense shrub cover regenerates within 10 years.  Trees regenerate slowly or not at all on these dry sites, because of erosion, depleted soil organic matter, high soil temperatures, and lack of seed [<a href="#138">138</a>].<br><br>  

Arno [<a href="#7">7</a>] hypothesized that relatively frequent fires set by Native Americans in western grassland and sagebrush communities, where chokecherry occurs, favored expansion of grasslands into adjacent shrub or tree communities.  In recent times shrub and tree communities have developed in former grasslands due to fire exclusion and grazing.  Arno argues that baseline information on Native American use of fire will aid land managers in predicting vegetative development under different fire regimes. <br><br> 

Morber and Miyanishi [<a href="#112">112</a>] studied fire as a tool for controlling chokecherry and black cherry in Ontario oak savanna.  A controlled spring burn had no effect on chokecherry seedlings. Postfire seedling emergence was concluded to be largely dependent on postfire seed production or seed influx from adjacent unburned areas, because there was no viable soil seedbank.
