<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Northern rattlesnake plantain is a shade-loving species found in cool,
coniferous forests, usually with a mossy understory [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  It is not
a community dominant and has not been listed as an indicator species.

<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Northern rattlesnake plantain appears to be very sensitive to
disturbance.  The species was one of just a few plant species to drop
out of a community in Alaska after logging and was still not present two
growing seasons after the disturbance [<a href="#3">3</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Goodyera repens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Northern rattlesnake plantain is a native, perennial orchid.  It grows 3
to 14 inches (7-35 cm) tall.  The deciduous, green and white-mottled
leaves are 0.4 to 0.8 inch (1-2 cm) long, and the fruit is a capsule,
not quite 0.5 inch (1 cm) long.  The plant has thick, fiberous rhizomes
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].

The flowers grow on a one-sided raceme, 1 to 3.5 inches (2-9 cm) long.
The perfect, zygomorphic flowers are white to pale green and only 4 to 5
mm long [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Northern rattlesnake plantain reproduces sexually by seed and
vegetatively by rhizomes [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Seeds require a mycorrhizal endophytic
fungus, (Ceratobasidium cornigerum) or (Rhizoctonia
goodyearae-repentis), to develop in the wild.  Noninfected plants will
grow in the laboratory if provided with sugar, but both nutrient uptake
and growth are more rapid in plants that are infected.  If a fungicide
is present, these rates decrease.  Mature plants seem to be independent
of the mycorrhizal relationship [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Northern rattlesnake plantain is found in cool, shady, moist coniferous
forests with a mossy component to the understory [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  In Glacier
National Park, it is found in a mossy, open western larch (Larix
occidenatalis) forest at 4,400 feet (1340 m) [<a href="#13">13</a>].  In Colorado, it is
found at elevations of 8,000 to 9,500 feet (2700 to 3200 m) [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Other common associates of northern rattlesnake plantain are paper birch
(Betula papyrifera), prickly rose (Rosa acicularis), mountain cranberry
(Vaccinium vitis-idaea), bluejoint reedgrass (Calamogrostis canadensis),
bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), northern twinflower (Linneae borealis),
panicle bluebells (Mertensia paniculata), and feathermoss (Hyloconium
splendens) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Climax Species

Northern rattlesnake plantain is a late-seral or climax species.  It is
normally found in stands 95 to 350 years in age [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Northern rattlesnake plantain flowers in late July and early August in
Montana [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Goodyera repens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Northern rattlesnake plantain is killed by fire.  It has rhizomes, but
these apparently do not survive burning [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
In Alaska, northern rattlesnake plantain had not reappeared by 2 years
after clearcutting with a prescribed fire [<a href="#3">3</a>].  In a Minnesota study,
during 5 years of monitoring plant biomass after a fire, only one
northern rattlesnake plantain specimen was observed (3 years after the
burn) [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Northern rattlesnake plantain appears to be a fire-sensitive species.
It prefers the shade of older forests and does not reinvade areas that
have been opened up by fire [<a href="#3">3</a>].
