<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In the Vancouver Forest District, British Columbia, little prince's pine
is used as an indicator species in several biogeoclimatic units for which
guidelines for site diagnosis, tree species selection, and slash burning
have been developed [<a href="#10">10</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Chimaphila menziesii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Little prince's pine is a native, evergreen, low rhizomatous shrub or
perennial forb.  The woody stems are usually 2 to 6 inches (5-15 cm)
tall and the leathery, whorled leaves are sharply serrate.  The plant
has one to three flowers.  Fruits are depressed, globose capsules that
often persist through the winter [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Little prince's pine reproduces both sexually and vegetatively.  It
develops numerous, minute seeds [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Their dispersal mechanism has not
been documented.  

Little prince's pine rhizomes have not been described in the literature.
They are probably, however, like those of prince's pine, confined to the
duff near or above the mineral soil surface [<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Little prince's pine is found in montane to subalpine coniferous forests
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  In coastal regions of British Columbia little
prince's pine is an indicator of moderately dry to moist soils within
maritime to submaritime, cool mesothermal climates [<a href="#19">19</a>].  On peaks of
the Santa Lucia and Diablo ranges of California, little prince's pine is
confined to steep, rocky slopes above 4,000 feet (1,200 m) [<a href="#11">11</a>].  On the
Mount Hood and Willamette National Forests, it occurs on moist to wet,
imperfectly to well-drained sites at elevations from 2,700 to 6,100 feet
(800-1,850 m).  Soils range from deep sandy, silty, or clay loams
developed from volcanic tephra to shallow, stony loams developed from
colluvium or glacial till [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Little prince's pine is present in all stages of succession [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].
It is shade tolerant [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>] and is an indicator of low light levels in
some plant associations of the southern Oregon Cascade Mountain Province
[<a href="#2">2</a>].  It occurs in the late stages of postfire succession in white fir
(Abies concolor) stands of the northern Sierra Nevada, probably in
response to low light levels [<a href="#4">4</a>].  In mixed conifer stands in the
Siskiyou Mountains of southwestern Oregon, little prince's pine develops
highest cover at intermediate light levels [<a href="#6">6</a>].



<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Little prince's pine flowers from June to August in California [<a href="#24">24</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Chimaphila menziesii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Since little prince's pine is similar to prince's pine, it probably is a
fire-sensitive species that is very susceptible to damage and usually
shows a strong decline following fire [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  Survival is most
likely dependent on depth of rhizomes, fire severity, and consumption of
duff [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  Postfire vegetative recovery probably depends primarily
on scattered individuals surviving in undisturbed microsites [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous low woody plant, rhizome in organic mantle
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Chimaphila menziesii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Most little prince's pine is probably killed by fire, although
low-severity fire may only top-kill it.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Woodard [<a href="#41">41</a>] stated that little prince's pine is known to grow from deep
rhizomes or to sprout following fire.  He found that it was absent,
however, 1 year after a prescribed crown fire in an old stand dominated
by Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) and subalpine fir (Abies
lasiocarpa) in eastern Washington.  It was still present in the unburned
control [<a href="#41">41</a>].

No other information was found regarding specific responses of little
prince's pine to fire.  


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Little prince's pine was not present on burned or unburned clearcut
sites in grand fir (Abies grandis)/pachistima (Pachistima myrsinites)
habitat types in Oregon.  It was present, however, in 175-year-old,
unlogged, adjacent stands [<a href="#5">5</a>].  In the same habitat type in Idaho,
prince's pine was present in 70 percent of near-climax control stands
but only 10 percent of 1-year-old clearcut and burned stands.  It was
also absent from 3, 8, 12, and 23-year-old clearcut and burned stands
[<a href="#42">42</a>].
