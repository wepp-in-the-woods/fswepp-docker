<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Torreya taxifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Florida torreya is endemic to three counties in northern Florida
(Liberty, Gadsden, and Jackson) and extends 1 mile into Decatur County,
Georgia [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].  The natural range of this species extends along the
limestone bluffs on the eastern bank of the Apalachicola River and its
tributaries for a 40-mile (64-km) stretch [<a href="#14">14</a>].  There is a small colony
of 60 trees approximately 6 miles west of the river at a site known as
Dog Pond in Jackson County [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].  Florida torreya is not an abundant
species, and local occurrence is widely scattered along the Apalachicola
River [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].  There is a small, introduced population of trees located
in Asheville, North Carolina, on the Biltmore Estate [<a href="#14">14</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Torreya taxifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Commercial harvesting of Florida torreya is nonexistant due to scant
availablility [<a href="#11">11</a>].  The fine-grained yellow wood is, however, highly
attractive and of good quality [<a href="#2">2</a>].  It is lightweight, hard, strong,
and highly durable [<a href="#14">14</a>].  The wood was historically used for making
cabinets and fenceposts [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Fences made of Florida torreya 60 years
ago are still sound [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Florida torreya was also used for Christmas
trees [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Various animals eat Florida torreya seeds [<a href="#14">14</a>].

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Florida torreya was planted as an ornamental on the Biltmore Estate,
Asheville, North Carolina [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Florida torreya is almost extinct in its natural range [<a href="#9">9</a>].  In 1988 the
Center for Plant Conservation stated that Florida torreya faces such a
serious and immediate threat of extinction that it will be gone in 10
years unless concerted conservation steps are taken [<a href="#4">4</a>].  An intricate
array of circumstances threatens Florida torreya.  The population is
reduced because of habitat destruction by inundation and logging and
fungal pathogens that kill young trees before they reach sexual maturity
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].

Disease:  Florida torreya populations are drastically reduced by stem
and needle blights [<a href="#2">2</a>].  The fungi responsible for these blights have
been identified as members of the genera Physalospora and Macrophoma.
As many as 11 species of fungi attack Florida torreya [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  How the
infection begins is unknown.  It may begin with fungi attacking the tree
while the fungi are in their sexual reproductive cycle [<a href="#14">14</a>].  

Sudden exposure to full sunlight following logging of other tree species
may stress Florida torreya, leading to susceptibility to fungal invasion
[<a href="#12">12</a>].

Fungicide:  Infected Florida torreya trees treated with the commercial
fungicide Maneb recovered markedly and produced new growth with little
or no infection [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].

Pests:  Feral pigs uproot and destroy Florida torreya seedlings [<a href="#20">20</a>].
Deer preferrentially select Florida torreya saplings as antler rubbing
posts, and sometimes kill saplings while rubbing their antlers [<a href="#21">21</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Torreya taxifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Florida torreya is a dioecious native evergreen tree, typically from 30
to 40 feet (9-12 m) tall and 12 to 20 inches (30-50 cm) in diameter
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  The largest living specimen is in North Carolina, and measures
about 45 feet (14 m) in height and 35 inches (89 cm) d.b.h.  Florida
torreya bark is only about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) thick on mature trees,
and is irregularly divided by shallow fissures.  The ovules or arils are
1.2 to 1.6 inches (3-4 cm) long.  They are fleshy, turning leathery at
maturity.  The seeds have a woody seed coat [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Male Florida torreya bear their microsporophylls within strobili.  In
contrast, the ovules of female trees are not contained within strobili
but are solitary [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Male strobili begin growth the year prior to
flowering, while female trees develop ovules in one growing season
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Florida torreya produces male and female cones at the age of
20 [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Torreya species are wind pollinated.  Seeds mature in 2 years
[<a href="#15">15</a>].  At Maclay State Gardens, some germination occurred when seeds
were placed in rich, damp topsoil.  Of 35 seeds planted in wet spaghnum
moss, 80 percent germinated.  Germination is hypogeal, and seeds require
afterripening [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Viable seeds are rock hard when ripe.  Seeds
collected from diseased trees are soft and crumble easily [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Because
of fungal infection, sexual reproduction has virtually stopped in this
species.  Infected trees seldom bear reproductive structures.
Consequently, few trees can be identified as either male or female [<a href="#21">21</a>].
Few seedlings have been found in the wild since the late 1950's [<a href="#14">14</a>],
and current reproduction is almost solely vegetative [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].

Florida torreya sprouts from the roots, bole, and root crown following
damage to aboveground portions of the tree [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Numerous
sprouts are produced at the base of the parent tree, although only one
sprout usually survives after several years [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Basal sprouts grow
several feet before succumbing to infection [<a href="#15">15</a>].
 
Florida torreya is propagated with stem cuttings [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Florida torreya occurs mainly on steep, deeply shaded limestone slopes,
bluffs, and wooded ravines, but is not confined to them [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  It
also occurs in forest hammocks and on slopes of ravines cutting through
sandhills.  The population in Jackson County, Florida, occurs on gently
rolling hills [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Soils are well drained [<a href="#21">21</a>], with a pH range from
4.0 to 8.0 [<a href="#8">8</a>].  The climate is subtropical, with wet summers and dry
winters.  The average annual precipitation is 56 inches (1,420 mm), and
the average growing season is 270 days [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Florida torreya
transplants grow on southern aspects of the Appalachian Mountains,
suggesting the species is more cold tolerant than its present range
indicates [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Common overstory associates not listed under Distribution and Occurrence
include spruce pine (P. glabra), southern red oak (Quercus falcata),
American beech (Fagus grandifolia), magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora),
American holly (Ilex opaca), Florida maple (Acer barbatum), basswood
(Tilia americana var. heterophylla), Florida yew (Taxus floridana), and
eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana).  Understory associates include
poison-ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), greenbriar (Smilax spp.), crossvine
(Bignonia capreolata), oak-leaf hydrangea (Hydrangea quercifolia), grape
(Vitis rotundifolia), climbing hydrangea (Decumaria barbara), French
mulberry (Callicarpa americana), woodbine (Parthenocissus), yaupon (Ilex
vomitoria), blackberry (Rubus spp.), sedges (Carex spp.), panicgrass
(Panicum spp.), partridgeberry (Mitchella repens), little sweet Betsy
(Trillium cuneatum), cane (Arundinaria gigantea), and American climbing
fern (Lygodium palmatum) [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Florida torreya is shade tolerant and is found in late seral and climax
communities [<a href="#8">8</a>].  It grows better in full sunlight at Maclay State
Gardens than in the dense shade of its natural habitat [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Seedlings,
however, tolerate the deep shade of pines and hardwoods [<a href="#14">14</a>], and
are probably more successful competitors on shady sites in their natural
habitat [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Reproductive structures emerge in March and April [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Seeds ripen
from August to October and are released from September to November
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Midsummer aril ripening has been reported for Florida torreya,
but is not typical [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Needles persist for 3 to 4 years [<a href="#20">20</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Published research on fire adaptations of Florida torreya is lacking.
A related species, California torreya (Torreya californica), sprouts
from the roots, root crown, and bole following fire (see FEIS literature
summary for Torreya californica).  Florida torreya probably also sprouts
from the roots, root crown, and bole after fire.

<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Because sprouting from the roots, bole, and root crown are natural
methods of regeneration in this species [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>], Florida
torreya probably sprouts from those organs after fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Schwartz, a biologist with the Florida Nature Conservancy, suggested
that in the past, smoke may have acted as a natural fungicide,
suppressing the fungi now infecting Forida torreya.  Ground fires
resulting from lightning strikes were a constant feature of the region's
longleaf pine forests until recently.  Smoke drifting from these upland
fires settled in the ravines where Florida torreya grew.  This may have
kept the fungal spore load low.  After fire suppression, the spore load
may have reached a critical mass, resulting in the present outbreak
[<a href="#21">21</a>].  In August and October of 1987, 2,670 acres (1,080 ha) of a
longleaf pine-slash pine (P. elliottii) forest were burned.  Two of the
eleven fungal pathogens identified in stricken Florida torreya were
suppressed by smoke [<a href="#13">13</a>].  The Tall Timbers Research Station in
Tallahassee, Florida, is currently researching the effects of smoke on
the fungi that infect Florida torreya.  The research is as yet
unpublished [<a href="#23">23</a>].
