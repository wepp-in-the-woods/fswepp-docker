<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Schreber's moss typically occurs as a dominant or codominant ground
cover in stands dominanted by white spruce (Picea glauca) or black
spruce (P. mariana).  The black spruce-Schreber's moss forest community
described by Foster [<a href="#13">13</a>] is the most widespread vegetation type in
southern Labrador and occupies a wide range of sites from poorly drained
outwash plains to convex slopes and hill crests.  In the black spruce/
bog blueberry (Vaccinium uliginosum)-bog Labrador tea (Ledum
groenlandium)/Schreber's moss community type described by Foote [<a href="#12">12</a>],
Schreber's moss commonly covers about half of the forest floor.
Published classification schemes idenitifying Schreber's moss as a
ground cover dominant or codominant are as follows:

  environmental factors [<a href="#7">7</a>].

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
In the past, Schreber's moss was collected and used to block chinks in
the walls of homes in Scandinavia.  It is still used for chinking log
homes in Russia.  It was also used for lining fruit and vegetable
storage boxes [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Schreber's moss is used as an indicator of heavy metal deposition
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  It is often used in locating pollution sources and determining
levels of pollution of heavy metals in the environment.  It absorbs
metals over its entire surface and is little influenced by variations in
substrate mineralization.  Close to the source, this moss accumulates
high levels of metals [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Schreber's moss is known to efficiently intercept nutrients contained in
precipitation and throughfall.  It therefore can prevent rapid leaching
of nutrients to lower horizons of the soil.  In view of its storage
capacity, the moss carpet can act as a reservoir in which a large
proportion of the potentially available nutrients found in the ecosytem
is sequestered.  However, it has also been recognized that mechanisms
may exist for the transfer of nutrients from the moss carpet to the
trees.  Mycorrhizal roots of some trees grow in close association with
mosses such as Schreber's moss.  Phosphate (32P) and carbon (14C)
applied to Schreber's moss shoots were absorbed by mycorrhizal mycelia
and transferred to infected lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) roots and
then to their shoots [<a href="#4">4</a>].

In 100-year-old stands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), artifical acid
rain with a pH of 2.5 to 3.0 caused severe damage to Schreber's moss
[<a href="#27">27</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pleurozium schreberi
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Schreber's moss is a perennial, relatively large, robust moss with a
weave growth form.  It is usually prostrate or partly erect, freely
branched, and grows in mats rather than tufts [<a href="#24">24</a>].  The stems are 2.4
to 4.5 inches (6-15 cm) long, and the leaves loosely imbricate [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction:  Schreber's moss is a dioecious, pleurocarpous
(producing the sporophytes laterally from short, lateral, specialized
branches rather that at the stem tip) moss.  The spores are shed 9 to 12
months after fertilization [<a href="#24">24</a>].  The period of gametangial (structure
containing the gametes) development in Schreber's moss is approximately
7 months for archegonia (female gametophyte) and 9 months for antheridia
(male gametophtye).  The timing of gametangial development in spring may
be influenced by the duration or severity of the winter [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Schreber's moss reproduces vegetatively by
branching laterally.  The main stems of this moss are perennial and
appear to be capable of indefinite growth.  There is a growth resting
phase in the winter [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Schreber's moss often occurs in closed to semi-open coniferous forests
predominantly in boreal and cool temperate climates.  It also occurs in
damp woods, swamps, or margins of bogs.  Although Schreber's moss is
most abundant in old, closed, mesic stands, it is also found in dry,
nutrient-poor, open, black spruce-lichen stands in suitable areas at the
base of birch (Betula spp.) and black spruce [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  In Alabama,
Schreber's moss is found growing abundantly on a large soil island over
granite beneath Georgia oak (Quercus georgiana) [<a href="#35">35</a>].

Soils:  Schreber's moss occurs on humus and exposed mineral soil and
coarse fragments or rocks [<a href="#21">21</a>].  It is often abundant on nitrogen-poor,
acidic soils throughout much of its range and is sometimes used as an
indicator of acidic soils [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  The pH at one Schreber moss site is
5.7 [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Soil textures range from course to fine sand, loam, or
clay-loam [<a href="#17">17</a>].  It normally does not grow on calcareous soils [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Plant associates:  Schreber's moss is often associated with the
following species:  mountain fern moss (Hylocomium splendens), salal
(Gaultheria shallon), big huckleberry (Vaccinium membranaceum),
pachistima (Pachistima myrsinites), queencup beadlily (Clintonia
uniflora), ptilium (Ptilium crista-castrensis), Labrador-tea, mountain
cranberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea minus), bog blueberry, black crowberry
(Empetrum nigra), and peat mosses (Sphagnum spp.) [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Climax Species

Schreber's moss is very shade tolerant and typically occurs in stable
late stages of succession.  After the canopy closes, Schreber's moss
will generally form a continuous carpet on the forest floor [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Given
a shady, humid, high-nutrient environment as is found on the cool, basal
slopes of black spruce-white spruce-feather moss stands, Schreber's moss
is a very effective competitor against other species.  It can quickly
spread over and eliminate other ground cover such as lichens [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
The beginning of blooming in mosses occurs when one or two archegonia
open.  In North America, Schreber's moss blooms in August and September
[<a href="#24">24</a>].  The gametangial develop in spring of the following year.  In
Germany, fertilization generally occurs in May, while in Sweden it is
delayed until July.  The spores are shed throughout the year following
fertilization.  The dates given for capsule dehiscence in three
countries are as follows [<a href="#24">24</a>]:

        Sweden: May
        Holland: February to May
        Germany: February to March or March to April

Capsules may persist on stems for at least twelve months after dehiscing
[<a href="#24">24</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pleurozium schreberi
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Schreber's moss is not well adapted to fire.  It typically occurs in wet
stands of white or black spruce that have a fire regime of 200 to 400
years [<a href="#34">34</a>].  When they do burn, the moss/lichen layer provide the major
source of fuels.  These fuels take only minutes to reach equilibrium
moisture content when the relative humidity changes; therefore, they are
very flammable [<a href="#36">36</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pleurozium schreberi
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Schreber's moss is generally killed by fire because it often lacks
connection with the substrate [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Some moss species can survive on
burned sites as fragments in the soil [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>



<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Schreber's moss recovery after fire is very slow [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  It is not
until favorable edaphic conditions and a closed or nearly closed canopy
is established that Schreber's moss can spread and form a continuous
moss cover.  It therefore often takes several decades before Schreber's
moss will recover to preburn densities [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Twenty-four years after a fire in a northern Swedish forest, Schreber's
moss was still very rare in the severely burned areas [<a href="#32">32</a>].  The percent
cover values of Schreber's moss in a jack pine (Pinus banksiana)-black
spruce forest in northeastern Minnesota at different intervals after
fire were as follows [<a href="#1">1</a>]:
                        Years after fire
               	1-4     5    10   15   20   30   50   80
