<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Wintergreen is commonly found in the understory of pine (Pinus spp.) and
hardwood forests of New England.  In western Nova Scotia and the Great
Lake States, it occurs in jack pine (P. banksiana) and spruce-larch
(Picea spp.-Larix spp.) forests [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  It is a common understory
species in maple-oak (Acer spp.-Quercus spp.) forests of upper Michigan
[<a href="#52">52</a>].  It is a dominant understory shrub of oak-poplar/fern (Quercus
spp.-Populus spp./Pteridium spp.) communities of southern New York [<a href="#60">60</a>].

Wintergreen is named as a dominant or codominant understory species in
the following classifications:

Understory species commonly associated with wintergreen include
huckleberries (Gaylussacia spp.), blueberries (Vaccinium spp.),
rasberries (Rubus spp.), grapes (Vitis spp.), mountain-laurel (Kalmia
latifolia), Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), witchhazel
(Hamamelis virginiana), bog Labrador tea (Ledum groenlandicum),
partridgeberry (Mitchella repens), and lily-of-the-valley (Maianthemum
canadense), [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Wintergreen is not taken in large quantities by any species of wildlife,
but the regularity of its use enhances its importance.  Its fruit
persists through the winter and it is one of the few sources of green
leaves in winter [<a href="#32">32</a>].  White-tailed deer browse wintergreen throughout
its range, and in some localities it is an important winter food.  Other
animals that eat wintergeen are wild turkey, sharp-tailed grouse,
northern bobwhite, ring-necked pheasant, black bear, white-footed mouse,
and red fox.  Wintergreen is a favorite food of the eastern chipmunk, and
the leaves are a minor winter food of the gray squirrel in Virginia
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The leaves of wintergreen are used to make oil of wintergreen [<a href="#27">27</a>]


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Wintergreen is ordinarily plentiful in the woodlands of the Northeast,
and no special care is needed to perpetuate it.  Seedlings or clones are
established by plantings beneath taller shrubs or in other partially
shaded sites.  When plants have established, fruit production is
stimulated by thinning timber stands and removing overtopping vegetation
[<a href="#32">32</a>].

Wintergreen can be controlled by phenoxy herbicides [<a href="#32">32</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Gaultheria procumbens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Wintergreen is a spreading, evergreen, rhizomatous shrub which grows 4
to 8 inches (10-20 cm) tall [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Wintergreen creeps along the
ground, forming a dense carpet of shiny leaves that are 2 to 6 inches
(5-15 cm) long.  The small flowers are less than 0.5 inches (1.2 cm)
long and are borne at the base of the leaves [<a href="#27">27</a>].  The fruit is
berrylike capsule with a large fleshy calyx [<a href="#45">45</a>].  The roots are 1 inch
(2.5 cm) or less in depth [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Reproduction in wintergreen is both sexual and asexual.  It typically
reproduces vegetatively from rhizomes.  Vegetative growth is initiated
as additional branching on old stems, or as new stems on creeping
rhizomes [<a href="#55">55</a>].  The long, infrequently branching rhizomes distribute
ramets over large areas; it exploits gaps in litter for clonal
propagation [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Bird-disseminated seeds are probably the source of
new plants colonizing old fields [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].

In the oak-pine upland forest of the Pine Barrens of New Jersey,
wintergreen occurrence was positively correlated (p<0.05) with the
presence of litter and dead wood [<a href="#50">50</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
As long as the soil is acidic, wintergreen grows well on many substrates
including peat, sand, sandy loam, and coal spoils.  It has been found
growing where soil pH ranged from 3.5 to 6.9 on the surface to 4.0 to
6.9 below the surface.  However, a pH of 4.5 to 6.0 has been reported as
optimum for growth, with 7.0 the maximum wintergreen tolerates.
Wintergreen mainly occurs on moist sites but tolerates moisture
conditions ranging from dry to poorly drained [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].

In jack pine communities in upper Michigan, wintergreen was present on
xeric, transitional, and mesic sites with frequencies of 11, 62, and 86
percent, respectively [<a href="#3">3</a>].  In Nova Scotia, wintergreen is found on the
tops of ridges and knolls in very shallow soil [<a href="#58">58</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Wintergreen is shade tolerant.  Fruiting, however, usually occurs in
openings [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  It is a commonl understory species in the
Northeast [<a href="#9">9</a>].  In a Minnesota Norway pine (P. resinosa) forest,
wintergreen had greatest abundance of cover under intermediate light
intensities [<a href="#56">56</a>].

Wintergreen is found in the oldest vegetation in Grass River Bog, an
undrained sand plain in the Adirondacks [<a href="#43">43</a>].

Wintergreen is part of the understory vegetation in climax pine forests
of northern Minnesota [<a href="#57">57</a>].

In eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) climax forest in northeastern
Pennyslvania, wintergreen frequency ranged from 0 to 6 percent [<a href="#47">47</a>].
 
In the Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, wintergreen was present in
early and climax stages of forest succession [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Frequency in the
birch-poplar (Betula spp.-Populus spp.) stage was 58 percent; it was
"abundant" in the pine stage.  Frequency was 36 percent in the
fir-spruce (Abies spp.-Picea spp.) stage.  Wintergreen was not present
in the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) stage, but frequency was 14 percent
in eastern hemlock climax forest [<a href="#49">49</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Wintergreen flowers from the end of May to September depending on
geographic location [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  In Illinois, wintergreen flowers initiated
during June open in mid-July, with the fruit maturing in September [<a href="#45">45</a>].
In New Jersey and Pennsylvia, the flowering period is from mid-July
through early August [<a href="#55">55</a>].  The leaves usually persist throughout the
winter [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  The fruit may remain attached till the following spring
[<a href="#45">45</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Gaultheria procumbens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Wintergreen is not well-adapted to fire that removes litter and/or the
organic layer of soil.  Rhizomes are restricted to the upper 0.8 to 1.2
inches (2-3 cm) of the organic layer, and wintergreen usually does not
survive if the organic layer is removed by fire [<a href="#15">15</a>].  The rhizomes are
especially vulnerable to severe fire [<a href="#54">54</a>].  If wintergreen survives, the
fire was probably of short duration or light enough that the fire
removed only aboveground vegetation and little litter [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Wintergreen rhizomes can tolerate brief exposure to high temperatures.
In one study its rhizomes were collected in spring, summer, and fall and
subjected to wet heat.  Maximum shoot growth and number of stems
occurred after spring-collected rhizomes were placed in a water bath at
131 degrees Fahrenheit (55 deg C) for 5 minutes.  Rhizomes died when
subjected to a 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 deg C) bath for 5 minutes
[<a href="#14">14</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Gaultheria procumbens

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire top-kills wintergreen [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Surviving rhizomes may sprout
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].
 


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
The response of wintergreen to fire and its role in fire related
succession seems to be highly variable. 

In southwestern Nova Scotia, wintergreen survived a July fire.  The
following summer density (stems/9 sq ft) and frequency (%) on covered
and uncovered quadrats were as follows [<a href="#26">26</a>]:

               covered           exposed
   Density       0.3                0
   Frequency    20                  0

In southeast Manitoba, five plots were burned in April.  No prefire data
were given.  Results from the end of August showed the average frequency
of wintergreen was 54 percent and the average cover was 3.8 percent.
Different levels of shade (0-100 %) had little or no effect [<a href="#46">46</a>].

Percent frequency of wintergreen was monitored for 2 years after a fall
(September) prescribed fire on a jack pine clearcut in northern
Michigan.  Little change occured, at least in the first year.  Results
are given [<a href="#1">1</a>]:

          Unburned blocks         Burned blocks

            % frequency           % frequency
   1980          5.6                   5.4
   1981          4.6                   0.8

Some research indicates that intergreen is sensitive to fire.  A spring
controlled fire was conducted on bracken fern (Pteridium
aquilinum)-grassland in Wisconsin.  Sampling was done in July and August
of the year of the fire.  The average frequency of wintergreen decreased
by 25.8 percent [<a href="#38">38</a>].  In the Pine Barrens of northern Wisconsin,
wintergreen average frequency decreased from 28 to 14 percent 1 year
after a spring fire [<a href="#39">39</a>].  In the New Jersey Pine Barrens, wintergreen
became less important with increasing fire frequencies.  Fire
frequencies ranged from annual to 15-year intervals [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Wintergreen
in this area exploit fire-generated gaps in litter through clonal
propagation [<a href="#50">50</a>].

Other studies indicate that fire may favor wintergreen.  In northwest
Minnesota, a severe May fire burned only the uppermost centimeters of
the forest floor.  Wintergreen cover in unburned stands was 0 to 5
percent.  After fire it was present in several associations and
increased through the sixth year following fire to a maximum cover of
6.2 percent.  Biomass increased after fire, more in dry than moist
stands, but leveled off after the second year, perhaps because of the
low-bush growth form of wintergreen [<a href="#51">51</a>].
 
In a survey of the burned-over forest lands in southwestern Nova Scotia,
frequencies of wintergreen related to years since fire were as follows
[<a href="#48">48</a>]:

   postfire yr      % frequency
       1                10.5
       2                16.6
       9                 4.0
      22                40
      29                48.2
