<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of California red fir is Abies
magnifica A. Murr. [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  Recognized varieties are as follows
[<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>]:

  Abies magnifica var. magnifica (typical variety)
  Abies magnifica var. shastensis Lemm. (Shasta red fir)

California red fir hybridizes with noble fir (A. procera) where they
occur together [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  These hybrids are similar to Shasta red fir,
which increases taxonomic confusion of the California red fir-noble fir
complex in the Klamath region [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].
    
The information in this report pertains to California red fir unless

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
California red fir occurs in pure, dense forests between the lower
montane white fir (Abies concolor) or mixed-conifer forests and the
upper montane or subalpine lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. murryana)
and mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) forests [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  In the
upper montane coniferous forests, California red fir is an overstory
dominant on mesic sites [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>].  Canopies can be open or closed, and
understory vegetation is variable but generally sparse [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].

</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
The wood of California red fir is straight-grained, light and soft but
stronger than the wood of other firs, and has a low specific gravity
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  California red fir often has sweep in the butt [<a href="#60">60</a>]. The
wood is used for fuel, coarse lumber, quality veneer, solid framing,
plywood, printing paper, and high-quality wrapping paper, and is
preferred for pulping (sulphite and thermomechanical) [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Old-growth forests of California red fir provide important habitat for
many animals, some of which are sensitive, rare, and/or endangered [<a href="#44">44</a>].
Marten prefer large snags, stumps, and logs in closed canopies of these
forests for den sites [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  Other animals that use California red
fir forests include fisher, wolverine, black bear, squirrels, chickadee,
pileated woodpecker, great gray owl, Williamson's sapsucker, and pocket
gopher [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].  The cones are cut and cached by squirrels.  Deer
browse new growth in the spring [<a href="#43">43</a>].

Climax communities of California red fir support birds that forage for
insects in the foliage of conifers [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Mountain beaver use California
red fir for food and thermal and escape cover [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
California red fir is used for Christmas trees [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. 

High-elevation California red fir stands are frequently used as
recreational sites [<a href="#44">44</a>].
 


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Together, California red fir and white fir produce one-fourth of
California's timber volume [<a href="#31">31</a>].  After partial cutting, California red
fir is susceptible to windthrow [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Unmanaged, even-aged,
well-stocked stands tend to mature in approximately 140 years [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].
Shasta red fir grows in dense stands that are highly productive [<a href="#25">25</a>].
Southern aspects that dry early in the growing season and flat surfaces
associated with frost are the most difficult for Shasta red fir
reforestation [<a href="#2">2</a>].

California red fir is an important tree for watershed protection because
of the large amounts of snow that accumulate in these stands during the
winter [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

Fir dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium abietinum ssp. magnificae) causes a
significant amount of damage and occurs throughout the range of
California red fir [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  Infected trees show less growth and vigor
and produce fewer seeds with lower viability [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].  When infected,
California red fir is more susceptible to secondary attack by insects
and fungi, which most commonly results in death of the tree
[<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].  The wood of infected trees has decreased strength and
value for pulp [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Dense stands make it easy for fir dwarf mistletoe
to spread from crown to crown [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Management of infected stands is
discussed in the literature [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].  California red fir does not
respond well to thinning because of its susceptibility to infestation
after mechanical wounding [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Annosus root rot (Heterobasidion annosum) also causes significant losses
[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  Infection is most common on the east side of the Sierra Nevada
and in relatively pure stands or dense stands with a history of logging
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  Infected California red fir are vulnerable to windthrow and
secondary attack by insects and other fungi [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  The
occurrence and management of other fungi that damage California red fir
are discussed in the literature [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].

The major insect pest of California red fir is fir engraver beetle
(Scolytus ventralis) [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Abies magnifica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
California red fir is a native, long-lived conifer that ranges between
66 and 198 feet (20-60 m) in height [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].  Mature trees can
grow to a d.b.h. of 8.5 feet (2.6 m) [<a href="#1">1</a>].  The bark of young trees is
thin but becomes thick and roughly fissured with age [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  The
needles are 0.8 to 1.4 inches (2.0-3.5 cm) long [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Cones are upright
on the upper branches and are up to 9 inches (23 cm) long [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].
California red fir has short branches and a narrow crown [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].

California red fir has a high frost tolerance.  California red and
Shasta red fir have a low drought tolerance [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].
  


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
California red fir does not reproduce vegetatively [<a href="#43">43</a>].

The minimum seed-bearing age for California red fir is 35 to 45 years of
age and 30 to 40 for Shasta red fir [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  Good seed crops are
produced at 2- to 6-year intervals [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Seed is disseminated
by wind a distance of approximately 1 to 1.5 tree heights from the
parent [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  The average germination rate of California red fir
seeds is 30 to 43 percent [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Insects account for 18 to 45
percent of annual seed loss [<a href="#64">64</a>].

Initial seedling establishment is best in bare mineral soil or light
litter [5,,24,41,44].  Seeds of California red fir usually germinate the
first spring after they are shed and are not stored in the forest floor
[<a href="#31">31</a>].  After the first year, seedling survival was higher in seedbeds
with heavier litter than those seedbeds without litter [<a href="#30">30</a>].
Competition and shading from shrubs and grasses and frost damage inhibit
establishment and growth of California red fir [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].  Seedlings
near stand edges had lower survival rates than those farther away from
the edge [<a href="#30">30</a>].

Mortality is greatest soon after the tree reaches 12 inches (30 cm) in
height and is usually attributed to pocket gophers damaging seedling
roots and deer clipping new foliage [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Initial growth is best in dense shade with medium litter on the soil,
but when seedlings get older, growth is best in full sunlight
[<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  Initial growth of California red fir seedlings is slow, 4
to 6 inches (10-15 cm) in the first 2 to 4 years [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  Laacke [<a href="#43">43</a>]
stated that the long-standing assumption of slow growth for the first 20
to 30 years may be invalid.  It can take between 10 and 25 years for
California red fir to reach breast height [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Following the initial
slow juvenile growth stage is a fairly long period of rapid growth and,
eventually, an extended period of slower growth [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Saplings greater
than 10 years of age reach full growth potential after release from
suppression [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
California red fir grows best in areas with cold, wet winters and warm,
dry summers [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  The growing season is short, with snow often on
the ground in July [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  Annual precipitation ranges from 33 to
64 inches (820-1,600 mm), most of which occurs between October and March
as snow [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  Snowpack is usually between 8 and 13 feet (2.5-4
m) [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].

California red fir commonly grows on soils with a pH range of 5.0 to 6.1
[<a href="#50">50</a>].  It occurs on deep sandy loams and shallower soils of moraines
[<a href="#5">5</a>].  California red fir will sometimes grow on nutrient-poor Entisols
or Inceptisols but usually grows on soils that are more nutrient-rich,
coarse, and well-drained but moist [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].  California red fir is
sensitive to poorly drained soils [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Shasta red fir is more common
on northern aspects but occurs equally on all slopes [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Shasta red fir occupies the elevational zone below mountain hemlock and
above white fir [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  The elevations at which California red fir
occurs in different parts of its range are listed below [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>]:

Location                          feet              meters
Klamath and Coast ranges       4,500-5,500        1,370-1,675
Siskiyou Mountains
  and southern Cascade Range   4,590-5,900        1,400-1,800
northern Sierra Nevada         5,940-7,920        1,800-2,400
southern Sierra Nevada         7,000-9,000        2,200-3,000

Canopy associates of California or Shasta red fir not mentioned in
Distribution and Occurrence are giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron
giganteum), Alaska-cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis), sugar pine (Pinus
lambertiana), western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis), Brewer spruce
(Picea breweriana), Washoe pine (Pinus washoensis), noble fir, and
foxtail pine (Pinus balfouriana) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  Understory species
differ greatly in different habitats [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Associated shrubs include
thinleaf huckleberry (Vaccinium membranaceum), currant (Ribes spp.),
twinflower (Linnaea borealis), mountain snowberry (Symphoricarpos
oreophilius), huckleberry oak (Quercus vaccinifolia), Sadler oak
(Quercus sadleriana), and pinemat manzanita (Arctostaphylos nevadensis)
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  Associated herbaceous species include sedges (Carex
spp.), lupine (Lupinus spp.), beargrass (Xerophyllum tenax), Brewer's
goldaster (Chrysopsis breweri), lousewort (Pedicularis semibarbata),
hairstem gayophytum (Gayophytum ramosissimum), whitevein pyrola (Pyrola
picta), and monardella (Monardella spp.) [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  Lichens (Evernia
and Vulpina spp.) also occur in California red fir forests [<a href="#50">50</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Climax Species

Stands of California red fir are typically even-aged [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].

California red fir forests are a climax vegetation type [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  In
areas where California red fir grows under a closed canopy of lodgepole
pine, it eventually becomes the climax species [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Shasta red fir is a
late seral or climax community dominant, depending on its associates
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].

In mixed conifer forests, California red fir establishes well in
openings and after disturbances [<a href="#65">65</a>].  Natural regeneration or seedling
or sapling release from suppression occurs in small openings created by
the death of a few trees or in large openings created by fire, insects,
or wind [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].  California and Shasta red fir are moderately shade
tolerant [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].



<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
California red fir cones open and are pollinated in May and early June
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].  Cones ripen in August [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].  Seed dispersal occurs in
mid-October when cones begin to disintegrate [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].  The large,
winged seeds are released through the fall and winter [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].

Shasta red fir cones open and are pollinated in mid- to late June, and
cones ripen in late September.  Seed dispersal occurs in late September
to mid-October [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Abies magnifica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fires in high-elevation California red fir forests are generally not as
intense as those in the Rocky Mountains [<a href="#38">38</a>] and are typically less
intense than those at lower elevations [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].  This may be a result of
low annual fuel accumulation because of the short growing season
[<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Fire has an important role in Sierra Nevada conifer forests,
particularly in the successional relationship between California red fir
and lodgepole pine [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  Fire creates canopy openings by killing
mature lodgepole pine and some mature California red fir.  Where
lodgepole pine occurs under a California red fir canopy, it is
eventually succeeded by California red fir [<a href="#5">5</a>].  The estimated fire
frequency ranges from 10 to 65 years [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].

Crown fires are uncommon in California red fir stands [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Fires
normally spread slowly and are seldom very destructive because of the
nature of surface fuels and the prevalence of natural terrain breaks
[<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].  The fire hazard in California red fir forests is lower than
in middle elevation, mixed-conifer forests [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Erosion problems did
not occur after a prescribed burn in a high-elevation California red fir
stand at Kings Canyon National Park [<a href="#37">37</a>].

The bark of older California red fir is thick and fire resistant [<a href="#41">41</a>].
The needles and branch tips are resistant to fire [<a href="#30">30</a>].

The fire interval for Shasta red fir is 70 to 130 years [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Fires are
usually patchy and of low severity.  Stand-replacing fires are rare [<a href="#2">2</a>].
Shasta red fir can tolerate occasional light fires [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Shasta red fir
retains its lower branches when not shaded out, which increases the risk
of crown fires [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Shasta red fir sheds its needles and naturally
prunes its branches where mountain hemlock is the successional climax
[<a href="#3">3</a>].  Fuel accumulation varies, but decomposition and drying are slow
[<a href="#2">2</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Seedlings of California red fir are easily killed by fire [<a href="#71">71</a>].
Seedlings and saplings are killed by relatively low-intensity fires, but
few older California red fir are affected [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  Larger California
red fir are killed by severe fires [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].

Shasta red fir sustains moderate damage from light-severity fires but is
often killed by moderate-severity fires [<a href="#3">3</a>].

<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Lightning-ignited fires in higher elevation Sierra Nevada forests are
usually less than 1 acre (0.4 ha) in size and burn for only a few days.
There have been several fires, however, that burned considerable acreage
over the course of several months.  None of these fires became a control
problem or burned intensely [<a href="#38">38</a>].
