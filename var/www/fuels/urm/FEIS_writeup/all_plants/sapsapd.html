<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
Several taxonomic treatments have been proposed for western soapberry.
Some authorities consider western soapberry and wingleaf soapberry to be
discrete species (Sapindus drummondii and S. saponaria, respectively)
[<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  However, many others now regard these entities as varieties
of a single species (Sapindus saponaria) [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Still other
taxonomists recognize only a single, although highly variable, species
(Sapindus saponaria L.) [<a href="#13">13</a>].  The currently preferred scientific name
of western soapberry is Sapindus saponaria var. drummondii (Hook and
Arn.) L. Benson [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

Western soapberry is a member of the primarily tropical family
Sapindaceae, which comprises nearly 1,000 species [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Western
soapberry differs from the closely related wingleaf soapberry (Sapindus
saponaria var. saponaria) in various morphological characteristics and
in geographical distribution [<a href="#17">17</a>].

<pre><center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Sapindus saponaria var. drummondii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Wood of western soapberry is light brown or yellowish with lighter
sapwood [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  The wood is hard, strong, close-grained, and heavy
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  It averages 51 pounds per cubic foot [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Western soapberry
wood splits easily into thin strips which can be used to make frames,
boxes, and baskets [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Wood formerly received local use for
cotton baskets, crates, pack saddles, and fuel [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  In some areas it
is still used as firewood [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Although western soapberry wood
"finishes nicely," it has little or no commercial value [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Western soapberry browse contains poisonous saponins and is rarely eaten
by domestic livestock [<a href="#40">40</a>].  It occasionally receives slight cattle use
where other forage is scarce or unavailable [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Berries are not
eaten by livestock [<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Western soapberry foliage is apparently of low palatability to domestic
livestock.  Mature leaves are unpalatable to foraging ants [<a href="#45">45</a>].

Berries contain poisonous saponins which render them objectionable in
taste [<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Western soapberry provides hiding or resting cover for a variety of game
species [<a href="#19">19</a>].  It also furnishes nesting sites for doves and many
songbirds [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Western soapberry has been widely planted in shelterbelts throughout the
southern Great Plains [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Its ability to persist on dry, windy,
infertile sites suggests potential value for use on some disturbed
sites.  Plants may be propagated through seed or stem cuttings [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].

Approximately 100 pounds (45 kg) of fruit yields 30 to 35 pounds (14-16
kg) of cleaned seed [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Fruit can be collected during late fall or
winter [<a href="#47">47</a>].  Properly pretreated seed can be planted in the spring at a
depth of 0.75 inch (19 mm) [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Detailed information is available on
seed collection, storage, and planting techniques [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].

Western soapberry can also be propagated through hardwood or softwood
cuttings [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Cuttings often root poorly, but the use of auxins can
effectively stimulate root formation [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Cuttings taken in May, June,
or July can root in 5 to 6 weeks if properly treated [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Success
depends largely on climate, the genetic stock used, and the season in
which cuttings are obtained [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Vegetative propagation has been
examined in detail [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Western soapberry is attractive and tolerant of poor soil and harsh
urban growing conditions [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Consequently, it is well suited for
use as a shade tree or ornamental in landscape plantings.  It has been
cultivated since 1900 [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Western soapberry casts light shade and
makes a good patio tree [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Its attractive, persistent fruit and
unique bark make it visually appealing during the winter [<a href="#34">34</a>].  It is
extremely wind resistant and hardy to zone 5 [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Berries contain approximately 37 percent saponin and were crushed to
make cleaners and soaps by Native American peoples and early settlers
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Western soapberry can, however, cause contact dermatitis in
susceptible people [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Although the berries are somewhat poisonous,
preparations made from them have been used to treat fevers, rheumatism,
and kidney problems [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  The closely related wingleaf soapberry
(Sapindus saponaria var. saponaria) has been widely used in parts of the
Old World to treat ulcers, joint pain, epilepsy, cataracts, bronchial
asthma, and "uterus pain" [<a href="#44">44</a>].  It has reportedly produced good results
in the treatment of psoriasis, jaundice, and pellagra [<a href="#44">44</a>].  The inner
bark of western soapberry has been used in home remedies as an
astringent [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Seeds of western soapberry have been used to make
buttons and necklaces [<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Many unique bottomland communities of south-central Oklahoma, in which western
soapberry occurs as a prominent species, are being threatened by agro-
industrial activities [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Experts estimate that if present trends continue,
these communities will soon be completely eliminated [<a href="#25">25</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Sapindus saponaria var. drummondii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Western soapberry is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree which
reaches 20 to 50 feet (6-15 m) in height [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Crown spread can reach
25 to 30 feet (7-9 m) [<a href="#16">16</a>], and trunk diameter can reach 1 to 2 feet
(0.3-0.6 m) [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Branches are commonly erect and form a rounded crown
[<a href="#41">41</a>].  Twigs are brittle, moderately stout, yellowish-gray to gray-brown
and pubescent to glabrous [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  The thin bark is split by deep
fissures into long narrow plates [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Bark is grayish to
reddish-brown and scaly [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Western soapberry is described as
moderately slow growing [<a href="#16">16</a>].

The alternate leaves are pinnately compound [<a href="#33">33</a>].  The 4 to 10 pairs of
leaflets are oblong to elliptic-lanceolate and entire and 1.5 to 3.2
inches (4-9 cm) in length [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Leaflets are glossy-green and
glabrous above and soft pubescent or glabrous beneath [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Leaves
turn a yellow-gold in fall [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Western soapberry is dioecious [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Small, yellowish-white flowers are
borne in large terminal or axillary panicles on new growth [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].
Panicles are 5 to 10 inches (13-25 cm) in length [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Fruit is a
fleshy, translucent yellow-orange drupe [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  The
leathery-skinned drupes are somewhat wrinkled and are borne in clusters
of 10 to 30 [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Fruit is persistent but shrivels and blackens by
spring [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Each drupe averages 0.5 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter [<a href="#34">34</a>] and
generally contains a single seed, although drupes may sometimes contain
as many as two or three seeds [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Obovoid seeds are dark brown or
black and semiglossy [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Seeds have a hard seed coat, and although
the surface appears smooth, it is minutely pitted [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (microphanerophyte)
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (mesophanerophyte)
   Burned or Clipped State:  Cryptophyte (geophyte)


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Seed:  Western soapberry produces an abundance of seed annually [<a href="#29">29</a>].
Seed soundness averages approximately 77 percent [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Seedcoat
structure and seed response to pregermination treatments vary greatly
[<a href="#29">29</a>].

Germination:  Germination of western soapberry is often difficult
because of embryo dormancy and an impermeable seed coat [<a href="#29">29</a>].  In
laboratory tests at alternating day (86 degrees F [30 degrees C]) and
night (68 degrees F [20 degrees C]) temperatures, germination capacity
of western soapberry ranged from 7 to 68 percent [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Germination can
generally be improved by soaking seeds in sulfuric acid for 2 hours or
more, and then stratifying seeds in moist sand at 35 to 45 degrees F
(2-7 degrees C) for 90 days [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Vora [<a href="#42">42</a>] reported increased
germination after acid soaks of 45 minutes or more; greatest germination
(71 percent) occurred after acid soaks of 120 minutes.  However, Munson
[<a href="#23">23</a>] observed better germination after soaking seeds in acid for 60 to
90 minutes than after soaking for either 30 or 120 minutes.  In general,
stratification can increase germination by up to 25 percent [<a href="#23">23</a>].

In some instances, freshly collected seed may germinate well without
pretreatment [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Generally, if seeds absorb water after 5 to 7
days of soaking, they can be planted without further treatment [<a href="#29">29</a>].
However, if seeds remain small and hard, they should be scarified and
stratified prior to planting [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Dried fruit can be stratified at 70
to 85 decrees F (21-29 degrees C) for 6 to 10 weeks followed by low
temperature stratification for 90 days [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Germination of western
soapberry has been examined in detail [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].

Seedling establishment:  Initial top growth of seedlings is typically
slow [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Early height growth has been reported as follows [<a href="#42">42</a>]:

                            height (cm)

    date planted      (days after emergence)

    June 1986           -       -       80

Vegetative response:  Western soapberry reportedly spreads by
underground rhizomes [<a href="#32">32</a>].  However, little is known about vegetative
regeneration of this species.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Western soapberry grows along rivers and canyon sides, and in desert
washes, arroyos, and dry watercourses [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  It also grows
singly or in thickets in foothills and uplands, at the margins of woods,
and in pasture ravines on waste ground [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Western soapberry is
a common component of upper desert scrub, desert and semidesert
grasslands, tropical and subtropical scrublands, and oak-woodland
communities [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  It is particularly well represented in many
riparian woodland communities.

Plant associates:  Common associates in Arizona gallery or canyon
forests near streamcourses include netleaf hackberry (Celtis
reticulata), Texas mulberry (Morus microphylla), Goodding willow (Salix
gooddingii), velvet ash (Fraxinus velutina), Arizona sycamore (Platanus
wrightii), burrowbrush (Hymenoclea spp.), seepwillow (Baccharis
glutinosa), walnut (Juglans spp.), skunkbush sumac (Rhus trilobata), and
poison ivy (R. toxicodendron) [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  Netleaf hackberry, American elm
(Ulmus americana), boxelder (Acer negundo), indian-currant coralberry
(Symphoricarpos orbiculatus), post oak (Quercus stellata), and blackjack
oak (Q. marilandica) occur with western soapberry in bottomland forests
of south-central and southwestern Oklahoma [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  On floodplain
bottoms and river terrace communities of Texas, pecan (Carya
illinoensis), live oak (Quercus virginiana), hackberry (Celtis spp.),
Mexican ash, cedar elm, Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana), and honey
mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) are often well represented [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].

Soils:  Western soapberry commonly grows on highly calcareous or clayey
soils [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  It occurs on heavy clay, silty clay, and other soil
types [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Western soapberry is highly tolerant of soils with limited
moisture [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>] and grows well on dry, well drained sites [<a href="#40">40</a>].
However, it also thrives on many moist soils [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Plants grow well on
infertile soils [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Western soapberry occurs on soils derived from
a variety of parent materials including sandstone, but it is most often
associated with limestone soils [<a href="#32">32</a>].

Climate:  Western soapberry is tolerant of low to high humidity and
rainfall [<a href="#32">32</a>].  It grows naturally in subhumid to semiarid mesothermal
climates [<a href="#39">39</a>].  On the Edwards Plateau of southern Texas, annual
precipitation can range from 16 to 33 inches (38-84 cm) [<a href="#39">39</a>].

Elevation:  Generalized elevational range by geographic location is as
follows [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>]:

      location                      elevation

      Trans-Pecos, TX               1,100 to 6,500 feet (335-1,981 m)   


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Western soapberry is a prominent member of mature bottomland forests of
south-central Oklahoma [<a href="#25">25</a>].  These climax stands can persist for
hundreds of years and are characterized by an extensive colonization
period [<a href="#25">25</a>].  In floodplain bottomlands of south Texas, species such as
retama (Cercidium spp.), dry-land willow (Baccharis neglecta), huisache
(Acacia smallii), and Texas prickly pear (Opuntia lindheimeri) dominate
earliest successional stages [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Common overstory species in
subsequent successional stages include retama, sugarberry (Celtis
laevigata), and cedar elm, with Texas persimmon, spiny hackberry (Celtis
pallida), Wright acadia (Acacia wrightii), and anacua (Ehretia anacua)
occurring as understory dominants.  In later successional stands,
western soapberry assumes prominence in the overstory canopy with cedar
elm, great leadtree (Leucaena pulverulenta), sugarberry, honey mesquite
(Prosopis glandulosa), and anacua [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Western soapberry occurs in
many southwestern riparian woodlands which are considered climax or
postclimax communities [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Western soapberry also grows well on infertile waste ground and may
occur in some early seral communities.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Fruits and flowers develop annually in a "characteristic growth flush"
[<a href="#34">34</a>].  New vegetative shoots subsequently arise from an axillary bud
located behind the site of the previous year's flowers and fruit [<a href="#34">34</a>].
Fruit ripens during September and October [<a href="#40">40</a>] and commonly persists
until late winter or spring [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Generalized flowering and fruiting
dates of western soapberry by geographic location are as follows:

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Most Southwestern riparian woodlands presumably burn infrequently.
Recurrent fires in adjacent upland desert communities may eliminate or
reduce invading shrubs such as western soapberry [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Specific adaptations to fire have not been identified in western
soapberry.  Plants may reoccupy a site through seed transported from
adjacent unburned areas by birds.  Postfire sprouting from underground
rhizomes is possible but has not been documented.

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Little documentation exists on the effect of fire on western soapberry.
However, Simpson [<a href="#32">32</a>] reported that this species can spread through
underground rhizomes.  These underground regenerative portions of the
plant could presumably survive even if aboveground foliage is consumed
by fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>

<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Postfire response of western soapberry has not been documented.
Postfire sprouting from underground rhizomes may occur.  Western
soapberry produces an abundance of seed annually [<a href="#29">29</a>], and establishment
through off-site seed is also possible.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Bock and Bock [<a href="#2">2</a>] reported that prescribed fire is "difficult to manage
and potentially very destructive" in established riparian woodlands of
the Southwest.  These relatively rare and fragile areas provide
important food and cover for desert wildlife [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Because browse and
cover are often limited in these areas, burning is not generally
recommended [<a href="#30">30</a>].
