<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
Flowering dogwood is a member of the subgenus Cynoxylon within the
family Cornaceae [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  The currently accepted scientific name is
Cornus florida L. [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Earlier taxonomists recognized several
subspecies or varieties, but most are no longer accepted.  The following
varieties are currently recognized by many authorities [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>]:

            Cornus florida var. urbiniana Wang.
            Cornus florida var. florida
            Cornus florida var. pringlei

These varieties are distinguished primarily on the basis of differences
in floral and vegetative morphology.  Several forms, including those
with pink or yellow flowers and red or yellow fruit, have been
identified [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  Commonly recognized forms are as follows [<a href="#79">79</a>]:

            Cornus florida f. rubra (Weston) Palmer & Steyeim.
            Cornus florida f. xanthocarpa Rehder
            Cornus florida f. pendula (Dipp.) Schelle
            Cornus florida f. pluribracteata Rehder

Flowering dogwood is not known to hybridize with any other species [<a href="#65">65</a>].

</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
The brownish wood of flowering dogwood is hard, strong, heavy, fine
grained, and shock resistant [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>].  It was formerly used for
shuttles in the textile industry, and has also been used for tool
handles, charcoal, wheel cogs, mauls, hay forks, and pulleys [<a href="#61">61</a>].  The
wood is occasionally used to make specialty items such as golf club
heads, turnery, roller-skate wheels, jeweler's blocks, knitting needles,
and woodcut blocks [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Fruit:  Flowering dogwood is a valuable species for wildlife.  Its fruit
is readily eaten by many songbirds including the hermit, olive-back, and
gray-cheeked thrushes, veery, northern cardinal, white-throated sparrow,
tufted titmouse, towhees, grosbeaks, thrashers, bluebirds, and juncos
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>].  The fruit is particularly important to the American
robin.  Flocks often move from the forest edge to the interior as
berries are depleted [<a href="#4">4</a>].  The pileated woodpecker, red-headed
woodpecker, red-bellied woodpecker, common crow, common grackle, and
starling also seek out flowering dogwood fruit [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Value of fruit to
upland game birds is rated as good [<a href="#13">13</a>].  In the Missouri Ozarks,
flowering dogwood fruit is particularly important to the wild turkey
from September to February [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Berries are readily eaten by the
eastern chipmunk, white-footed mouse, gray fox, gray squirrel, black
bear, beaver, white-tailed deer, skunks, and other mammals [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>].

Browse:  Beaver occasionally feed on flowering dogwood browse [<a href="#31">31</a>] and
sprouts are often heavily browsed by rabbits [<a href="#65">65</a>].  In southwestern
Michigan, browse is preferred by cottontail rabbits during the winter
[<a href="#31">31</a>] and in parts of Pennsylvania, flowering dogwood is considered an
important deer browse [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Deer utilization has reached 25 to 35
percent in parts of southeastern Texas [<a href="#55">55</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Flowering dogwood is fairly palatable to deer in southeastern Texas
[<a href="#54">54</a>].  Palatability may be somewhat higher in parts of Pennsylvania
[<a href="#12">12</a>].  The fruit of flowering dogwood is highly palatable to a wide
variety of birds and mammals.


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The nutrient value of flowering dogwood varies significantly by plant
part, site history [see Fire Management Considerations], phenology, and
soil moisture levels [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].

Browse:  Leaves of flowering dogwood are high in calcium, fat, and
fluorine [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].  Leaves were found to contain 1.72 percent calcium,
and twigs 1.44 percent [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Fluorine content of leaves was 72 p/m in
June but increased to 103 p/m by October [<a href="#65">65</a>].  Selected nutrient values
for flowering dogwood browse on unburned sites were reported as follows
[<a href="#54">54</a>]:

Fruit:  Fruit of flowering dogwood is high in calcium and fats [<a href="#65">65</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Flowering dogwood provides good cover for many wildlife species [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Flowering has been planted on strip-mined lands in Indiana [<a href="#10">10</a>] and
grows as volunteers on surface-mined lands in Missouri, Kansas, and
Oklahoma [<a href="#92">92</a>].

Flowering dogwood can be propagated by seed, root cuttings, layering,
and grafting [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Seed may be planted immediately or stratified for
spring plantings [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Cleaned seed averages approximately 4,500 per
pound (9,920/kg) [<a href="#65">65</a>].  Summer softwood cuttings, winter hardwood
cuttings, grafts, suckers, and budding can be used to propagate
flowering dogwood [<a href="#65">65</a>].  Flowering dogwood can be difficult to
transplant [<a href="#91">91</a>].  Seedlings with a root ball are preferred over bareroot
transplants; plants at the beginning of the third growing season are
generally best suited for transplanting [<a href="#65">65</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Flowering dogwood is highly valued as an ornamental and was first
cultivated in 1731 [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Showy blossoms and attractive fall foliage
contribute to its year-round beauty.  It is widely used in landscaping
and street plantings [<a href="#87">87</a>].  At least 20 cultivars are now available
[<a href="#65">65</a>].  Popular cultivars include 'Sweetwater Red,' 'Silveredge,' 'White
Cloud,' 'Spring Song,' 'Gigantea' [<a href="#61">61</a>], and 'Welchii' which is
characterized by unique yellow and red variegated leaves [<a href="#65">65</a>].

Some Native American peoples made a scarlet dye from the roots of
flowering dogwood [<a href="#61">61</a>].  Teas and quinine substitutes were made from the
bark [<a href="#61">61</a>].  Plants contain cornine which is used medicinally in parts of
Mexico [<a href="#27">27</a>].  The bright red fruits are poisonous to humans [<a href="#65">65</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Chemical control:  Flowering dogwood is moderately difficult to kill
with herbicides [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>].  It is intermediately resistant to
glyphosate [<a href="#95">95</a>].  Winter treatments are generally less effective than
summer treatments [<a href="#51">51</a>].  Good results have been obtained with directed
sprays of Garlon.

Mechanical treatment:  Flowering dogwood typically sprouts vigorously
after stems are cut [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Plants cut in July or early August tend to
produce the shortest sprouts and smallest sprout clumps.  Three years
after treatment, sprout clumps originating from midsummer cuts averaged
2.5 feet (0.8 m) shorter and 1.5 feet (0.5 m) narrower than those from
winter cuts [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Silviculture:  Flowering dogwood is typically more abundant in lightly
cut stands than in clearcuts [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Loftis [<a href="#58">58</a>] reported increases in
numbers following shelterwood treatments.  In upland oak forests,
greatest abundance is often reached in unthinned stands [<a href="#42">42</a>].

Damage:  Flowering dogwood can be killed by drought or flooding [<a href="#31">31</a>].
It is potentially sensitive to ozone damage [<a href="#78">78</a>].

Insects/diseases:  Flowering dogwood is susceptible to many insects,
including the dogwood borer, flat-headed borer, dogwood twig borer, twig
girdler, and dogwood scale [<a href="#65">65</a>].  Flowering dogwood is now seriously
threatened by dogwood blight, also known as dogwood decline [<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>],
which has affected large numbers of trees from New England to Virginia
[<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>].  The primary cause is believed to be the dogwood anthracnose
fungus, although a combination of factors may be involved [<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].
Unfavorable environmental factors such as drought or acid rain may
weaken trees, predisposing them to dogwood decline [<a href="#104">104</a>].  The dogwood
borer may play a similar role [<a href="#94">94</a>].  Some experts see little hope of
saving flowering dogwood in the wild [<a href="#85">85</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cornus florida
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Flowering dogwood is a multibranched shrub or small tree that commonly
reaches 16 to 49 feet (5-15 m) in height [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>].  In the South, plants
may grow 40 feet (12 m) tall with a d.b.h. of 18 inches (46 cm) [<a href="#61">61</a>],
but in the North, flowering dogwood more often grows as a multibranched
shrub, reaching heights of 10 to 13 feet (3-4 m) [<a href="#86">86</a>].  Flowering
dogwood is characterized by a broad, rounded crown [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Several
trunks may develop from a single root crown [<a href="#76">76</a>].  Rooting depths are
generally shallow and often less than 3 feet (1 m) [<a href="#1">1</a>].  The large,
simple, opposite leaves generally average 2 to 6 inches (5-15 cm) in
length [<a href="#61">61</a>].

Fruit is a glabrous, smooth, yellow to red, berrylike drupe [<a href="#87">87</a>] that
averages 0.6 inch (1.5 cm) in length and are borne in clusters of two to
six [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>].  Flowering dogwood fruit tends to be heavier at higher
latitudes [<a href="#99">99</a>].  Each drupe contains one to two cream-colored, ellipsoid
seeds averaging 0.3 to 0.4 inch (7-9 mm) in length [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>].

Important distinctions between commonly recognized varieties and forms
are summarized below [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>]:

            var. urbiniana - bracts narrower, twigs grayer, with
                           larger drupes.
            var. pringlei - bracts fused.
            f. xanthocarpa -  drupes yellow.
            f. rubra - red involucral bracts.   


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (mesophanerophyte)
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (microphanerophyte)
   Burned or Clipped State:  Chamaephyte
   Burned or Clipped State:  Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Flowering dogwood reproduces through seed as well as by vegetative
means.

Seed:  Plants grown from seed often produce seed as early as 6 years of
age [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>].  Six-year old sprouts with a diameter of 0.75 inch (19
mm) and height of 4 feet (1.2 m) have also reportedly produced seed
[<a href="#65">65</a>].  Good seed crops are produced every 2 years, with crop failures
likely in 1 of 4 years [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Pack [<a href="#71">71</a>] reported that 71 percent of all
plants bore fruit during a single year, with average yields of 0.50
quart (0.4 l).  An annual average of 1,417 fruits per acre (3,500/ha)
was reported in oak-hickory stands and up to 27,530 per acre (68,000/ha)
in openings [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Flowers are pollinated by beetles, bees, butterflies,
and flies [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Seeds are dispersed by birds, mammals, and gravity
[<a href="#65">65</a>].

Germination:  Flowering dogwood is characterized by delayed germination
due to embryo dormancy [<a href="#65">65</a>].  Under natural conditions, seeds overwinter
before germination occurs [<a href="#72">72</a>], and some seeds do not germinate until
the second spring [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Warm, moist stratification for 60 days followed
by long periods (120 days) of cold temperatures increases germination
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  Chemical or mechanical scarification can also promote
germination.  Results of specific germination tests are as follows [<a href="#9">9</a>]:

      test conditions               germ. energy         germ. 
light       duration          amount      period         capacity             

8 hrs.      60 days           14-45%      15-20 days     35 %

Seedling establishment:  Adequate soil moisture is necessary for
successful establishment and growth of flowering dogwood seedlings [<a href="#44">44</a>].
Seedling survival is generally best on moist, rich, well-drained soils
[<a href="#56">56</a>] and at stand margins [<a href="#65">65</a>].

Vegetative regeneration:  Flowering dogwood often sprouts vigorously
after plants are cut or burned.  Plants sprout best after winter
fellings; those cut in midsummer produce the fewest stump sprouts
[<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>] [see Management Considerations - mechanical treatment].  Greater
sprout height growth has been correlated with increasing stump diameter
[<a href="#65">65</a>].  An increase of 0.3 feet (9 cm) has been reported for every 1 inch
(2.5 cm) increase in stump diameter.

Sprouting from the root crown has been reported after fire.  Multiple
stems commonly develop from a single surviving root crown [<a href="#33">33</a>].
Flowering dogwood also reproduces through layering [<a href="#65">65</a>].  Epicormic
branching has been reported [<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Flowering dogwood grows in mesic deciduous woods, on floodplains,
slopes, bluffs, and in ravines [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].  It also occurs in gum
swamps, along fencerows, and in oldfield communities [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Growth is
often poor on dry, upland slopes and ridges [<a href="#65">65</a>].  Flowering dogwood
grows as an understory associate in many hardwood and conifer forests
throughout eastern North America [<a href="#65">65</a>].

Plant associates:  In addition to those identified in the Distribution
and Occurrence slot, common overstory associates include scarlet oak
(Quercus coccinea), southern red oak (Q. falcata), post oak (Q.
stellata), pitch pine (Pinus rigida), slash pine (P. elliottii),
Virginia pine (P.  virginiana), black gum (Nyssa sylvatica), sweetgum
(Liquidambar styraciflua), yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipfera),
sassafras (Sassafras albidum), persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), red
maple (Acer rubrum) [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].  Understory associates are numerous and
often include serviceberry (Amelanchier spp.), blueberries (Vaccinium
spp.), and brambles (Rubus spp.) [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].

Soils:  Flowering dogwood occurs on soils that vary from moist, deep
soils to light-textured, well-drained upland soils [<a href="#65">65</a>] but most
commonly occurs on coarse to medium-textured acidic soils [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].
Abundance generally increases with better drainage and lighter soil
textures.  It is often virtually absent on heavy, poorly drained soils
[<a href="#65">65</a>].  Soil pH generally ranges from 6 to 7 [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Common parent
materials include gravel, sandstone, and limestone [<a href="#87">87</a>].

Elevation:  In the southern Appalachians, flowering dogwood grows from
sea level to 4,931 feet (0-1,500 m) [<a href="#22">22</a>] but does best on flats and
lower or middle slopes from 1,000 to 4,000 feet (304-1,219 m) in
elevation [<a href="#28">28</a>].  In the Great Smoky Mountains flowering dogwood grows
below 3,000 feet (<914 m) [<a href="#96">96</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Flowering dogwood is very tolerant of shade and is capable of persisting
beneath a forest canopy [<a href="#65">65</a>].  Although it commonly grows as a
suppressed understory tree, it is also important in gap closure and
grows in several strata in stands with a multicanopied structure [<a href="#93">93</a>].
Flowering dogwood is physiologically plastic [<a href="#93">93</a>] and can also occupy
seral communities such as certain clearcuts and oldfield communities
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].  It also grows in seral, fire-maintained sandhill communities
[<a href="#67">67</a>].  McDonnell [<a href="#64">64</a>] observed that flowering dogwood was absent until
the third year after fields were abandoned but continued to invade
through the twelfth year of the study.  Scattered patches of flowering
dogwood are common in young fields [<a href="#64">64</a>].  Because seed is primarily
bird-dispersed, seedling concentrations often occur beneath powerlines
and poles.

Flowering dogwood occurs in climax magnolia-beech, magnolia-holly
hammock communities, and southern mixed hardwood stands in the South
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>].  It is present in old-growth white oak forests of
southwestern Pennsylvania and in old-growth beech-oak stands of South
Carolina [<a href="#47">47</a>].  In parts of the South, flowering dogwood commonly grows
in pine stands which are seral to climax hardwood forests [<a href="#28">28</a>].
Billings [<a href="#7">7</a>] reported that it commonly appears when shortleaf pine
stands are 40 to 50 years old.  Flowering dogwood is typically an
important transitional species as pine is replaced by hardwoods in
southern mixed hardwood forests, but has been slow to reinvade these
types of stands in central Florida [<a href="#41">41</a>].



<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Vegetatative growth occurs throughout most of the summer but may cease
during periods of adverse weather conditions [<a href="#56">56</a>].  In a Massachusetts
study, seedlings grew from April 24 through September 4, although 90
percent of the total growth took place from May 15 through August 18
[<a href="#65">65</a>].  Growth was most rapid during the first week of August [<a href="#65">65</a>].
Laboratory tests indicate that short day lengths can force plants into
premature dormancy [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Rapid diameter growth typically lasts 80 to 90
days [<a href="#28">28</a>].  New floral and vegetative buds become evident in August,
develop somewhat during the summer months, remain dormant through the
winter, and expand the following spring [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Flowers develop with
[<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>] or before the leaves [<a href="#61">61</a>].  In Ohio, Gorchov [<a href="#103">103</a>] reported a
mean average of 138 days between flowering and fruit ripening.
Flowering typically occurs in mid-March in the South and as late as May
in the North [<a href="#65">65</a>].  Flowering and fruiting dates by geographic location
are as follows:

Location          Flowering               Fruiting    Authority

Seed dispersal occurs from mid-October to November or later [<a href="#56">56</a>].  In
West Virginia, latest fruit persistence was recorded on December 2; in
Texas, some seed persisted until January [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Leaves turn a deep red
in late September [<a href="#87">87</a>] and leaf fall occurs from early October to early
November [<a href="#28">28</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Flowering dogwood is well adapted to periodic fire [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Plants
commonly sprout from the root crown after aboveground vegetation is
damaged or destroyed.  Seedling establishment by means of bird and
mammal-dispersed seed is also commonly observed.

Flowering dogwood can persist in some fire-maintained seral communities
[<a href="#67">67</a>].  In the southern Appalachians, vegetative shifts toward scarlet
oak, hickories, red maple, sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum), and flowering
dogwood have been reported after fire where preburn communities were
dominated by yellow poplar, chestnut oak, northern red oak (Quercus
rubra), and white oak [<a href="#29">29</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cornus florida
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Flowering dogwood has been variously described as a fire-tolerant [<a href="#53">53</a>]
and fire-intolerant species [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Its bark is among the thinnest of all
eastern trees [<a href="#40">40</a>], and mature individuals are readily damaged by fire
[<a href="#65">65</a>].  Approximately 50 percent of all flowering dogwood stems were
top-killed by fire in south-central New York [<a href="#89">89</a>] and 58 percent
mortality was reported after a prescribed burn in a 22-year old loblolly
pine plantation in Tennessee [<a href="#101">101</a>].  All aboveground portions of the
plants died within 1 year of a fire in the Northeast [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
Hodgkins [<a href="#43">43</a>] observed that fire-caused mortality in small hardwoods is
related to diameter, season of burn, weather, frequency of fire, and the
amount of heat received at the ground line.  In relatively hot, dry
portions of eastern Texas, flowering dogwood was killed by winter,
spring, and fall burns repeated after 2 years [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Hot annual summer
fires may be necessary to kill small hardwoods in moist areas of the
Southeast.  Gill and Healy [<a href="#31">31</a>] reported that flowering dogwood can
survive infrequent low severity winter fires when plants are at least 10
to 15 feet (3-5 m) in height.

Fire-caused mortality of flowering dogwood is correlated with the amount
of heat received at the cambium.  The mean time required for the cambium
to reach lethal temperatures (approximately 140 degrees F [60 degrees
C]) has been reported as follows [<a href="#39">39</a>]:

      bark thickness                      seconds required for cambium
      (in inches)                               to reach 140 degrees F

      0.20                                      30.4
      0.30                                      59.4
      0.40                                     126.2


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Flowering dogwood usually sprouts profusely from the stump or root crown
after plants are top-killed or damaged by fire [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].  Specific
postfire response is related to fire severity and intensity, season of
burn, site factors, and fire frequency.  Postfire recovery is generally
more rapid after surface fires than after crown fires [<a href="#70">70</a>] [see
Qualification and Discussion of Plant Response to Fire].

In south-central New York, Swan [<a href="#89">89</a>] reported an average of 7.2 sprouts
per top-killed stem.  Postfire increases in sprout numbers have been
reported in oak-hickory stands of Missouri and in upland hardwood stands
of northern Alabama [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].  Prefire frequency of flowering dogwood
was measured at 1, with stem densities of 153 per acre (378/ha).  Ten
years after fire, frequency had climbed to 9, with stem densities of 267
per acre (660/ha) [<a href="#59">59</a>].  Increases in stem density were recorded after 2
burns in an oak-pine stand of Kentucky [<a href="#98">98</a>].  However, frequent fires at
short intervals can reduce the relative number of flowering dogwood
stems.  Comparisons of flowering dogwood on an annually burned plot and
on an adjacent plot left undisturbed for 15 years are as follows [<a href="#23">23</a>]:

         # stems/acre        rel. dom. %       rel. dens. %    freq. %

15 yr.        115               2                      73       5
annual burn     8               < 1                    13       7



<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Cover:  The cover of flowering dogwood was estimated at 33.7 percent of
the total basal area on unburned plots in a loblolly pine community of
North Carolina [<a href="#70">70</a>].  After a surface fire, crown cover was reduced to
14.6 percent of the total basal area and accounted for only 10.2 percent
after a crown fire.  Specific results are as follows [<a href="#70">70</a>]:

                  density %         freq. %           basal area

unburned          13.1              100               4.47
surface fire       7.3               80               0.80
crown fire        10.6               90               0.70 

Fruit/seed production:  Landers [<a href="#53">53</a>] reported that fruit production may
be greater during the first year after fire.  Average fruit yields were
as follows after a winter prescribed burn in the Southeast [<a href="#88">88</a>]:

                1973            1975
                (preburn)       (1 yr. after burn)

burn            0.86            30.75
control         1.12             9.21

Cushwa and others [<a href="#17">17</a>] reported postfire decreases in seed production in
Georgia.
