<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Oplopanax horridus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Devil's club is distributed from south-central Alaska south along the
Pacific Coast and the western slope of the Cascade Range to southern
Oregon and east to southwestern Yukon Territory, Idaho, and western
Montana.  Disjunct populations occur on several islands of northern Lake
Superior, including Isle Royale and Passage Island, Michigan, and
Porphyry and Slate islands, Ontario [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  Some authorities [<a href="#23">23</a>]
extend its distribution to eastern Asia.  Voss [<a href="#46">46</a>], however, recognized
the Asian plants as a distinct species, Oplopanax elatus (Nakai) Nakai.

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Devil's club is a dominant component of understories of various Pacific
Northwest and western boreal forests where moist to wet soil conditions
prevail.  Devil's club is an indicator of numerous habitat types; some
commonly occurring ones are western redcedar (Thuja plicata)/devil's
club, western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla)/devil's club, Sitka spruce
(Picea sitchensis)-western hemlock/devil's club, subalpine fir (Abies
lasiocarpa)/devil's club, and Pacific silver fir (A. amabilis)/devil's
club [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  Understories of various forest/devil's club types are
sometimes nearly pure, dense stands of devil's club.  Other understories
dominated by devil's club, however, are species rich, involving mixed
shrub, shrub-fern, or shrub-forb associations [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].

A comprehensive list of publications naming devil's club as a dominant
or indicator species would be prohibitively long.  A geographically
representative selection of such publications is listed below:

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Oplopanax horridus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Devil's club is not preferred by browsing animals, probably because of
its prickly leaves and stems.  Black-tailed deer, white-tailed deer, and
elk utilize it lightly in spring and summer [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]; in one study, it
comprised an average of 3.4 percent of the summer diet of Roosevelt elk
at widely distributed sites on the Pacific Northwest Coast [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Moose
on Isle Royale, Michigan do not browse it [<a href="#46">46</a>].

Devil's club growing on banks of stream channels provides shade cover
for salmonoid fishes and their eggs.  Bear prefer such areas because of
the readily available sources of fish and devil's club berries [<a href="#14">14</a>].
Grizzly and black bear also consume devil's club seeds, leaves, and
stems [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Mean value of in-vitro dry-matter digestibility of devil's club for
white-tailed deer is 73.3 percent for leaves and 53.7 percent for stems.
Percentage composition of macro- and micronutrients in devil's club
leaves and stems are available [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Devil's club provides hiding, escape, and thermal cover for various
birds, rodents, and the vagrant shrew [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Oplopanax horridus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Devil's club is a native, erect to slightly spreading, deciduous shrub
from 3.3 to 10 feet (1-3 m) in height.  It is sparsely branched with
sharp, dense prickles on stems and prominent leaf veins [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  The
fruit is a drupe with two to three seeds [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  Cooper and others
[<a href="#11">11</a>] noted that this species is rhizotomous; other researchers have yet
to confirm this.  Devil's club is drought intolerant [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Information on devil's club regeneration is scant.  Seedling growth is
apparently slow [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Devil's club reproduces vegetatively, but the
method is uncertain.  Vegetative reproduction may be accomplished by
rhizomes [<a href="#11">11</a>] and/or layering [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Stickney [<a href="#42">42</a>] tentatively listed it
as a root crown sprouter.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Devil's club is a wet-site indicator [<a href="#38">38</a>].  It grows on moderately
well-drained to poorly drained, shaded sites.  It is commonly found near
springs and streams and in drainage, seepage, and wet bottom areas
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  It occurs on variable aspects [<a href="#9">9</a>], growing in soils that are
sandy, loamy, or silty in texture.  Devil's club-supporting soils are
sometimes skeletal.  Soils are derived from quartzite or from fluvial,
colluvial, glaciolacustrine, or morainal deposits [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Soil pH is
acid.  It ranges from 4.5 to 6.0 in the western redcedar/devil's club
type of northern Idaho [<a href="#11">11</a>], and was measured at 3.8 in the Sitka alder
(Alnus viridis spp. sinuata)/devil's club type of southern Alaska [<a href="#39">39</a>].
Soil nutrient levels are medium to very rich [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Climate varies from
maritime, submarine, and continental types [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Elevational ranges for
devil's club in several locations are as follows:

                             feet             meters

northwestern Montana     3,900-5,000     1,189-1,524 [<a href="#8">8</a>]
Oregon                   1,300-4,600       396-1,402 [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>]
northern Idaho           1,500-4,900       460-1,495 [<a href="#11">11</a>]
southeastern Alaska          0-1,700         0-  518 [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>]


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Climax Species

Devil's club is moderately shade tolerant [<a href="#24">24</a>] and is primarily found in
understories of late seral, climax, and old-growth forests.  Best growth
is attained in climax (mature) forests [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].  Average devil's club
biomass at widely located sites in western hemlock-western redcedar and
Sitka spruce-western hemlock forests of southeastern Alaska was as
follows [<a href="#3">3</a>]:

clearcut sites:                 0.00 lb/acre 
young (30- to 100-year-old):    0.09 lb/acre  (0.1 kg/ha)
mature (100- to 250-year old):  4.80 lb/acre  (5.4 kg/ha)
old-growth (250+ years):        2.90 lb/acre  (3.3 kg/ha)


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Devil's club flowers in late spring to midsummer, depending upon
location.  Plants in southeastern Alaska bloom in June [<a href="#45">45</a>], while
plants on the Lake Superior islands bloom in mid-July.  Fruits ripen
approximately 4 weeks after flowering and persist over winter [<a href="#46">46</a>].
Leaves are dropped within a few days of the first fall frost.  In the
Cascade Range of Oregon, leaf abscission occurs in October or November
[<a href="#10">10</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Oplopanax horridus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Sites where devil's club occurs burn infrequently.  Wildfire is uncommon
in various forest-devil's club types of southeastern Alaska [<a href="#28">28</a>].
Typically, the moist ravines and streamside areas serve as a fire break
to low- and moderate-severity ground fires.  The return interval for
such fires ranges from 50 to 100 years in the western redcedar/devil's
club type of western Montana.  Less often, this type undergoes severe,
stand-replacing fire, regressing the site to pioneer conditions.
Stand-replacing fires in the western redcedar/devil's club type of
western Montana have historically occurred at intervals ranging from 150
to more than 500 years [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Devil's club adaptations to fire are not well documented.  It may sprout
from the root crown [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Sprouting from rhizomes may also occur [<a href="#11">11</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Oplopanax horridus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Devil's club is susceptible to fire-kill [<a href="#18">18</a>], but its susceptibility by
class of fire severity is unknown.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Postfire recovery of understory species, presumably including devil's
club, in forest/devil's club types of British Columbia is more rapid
than in other forest types.  Researchers credit this to the generally
lower fire intensity.  Devil's club frequency at widely scattered sites
in British Columbia that had burned less than 10 years prior to sampling
was from 61 to 80 percent [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Extrapolating from Alaback's [<a href="#3">3</a>] data (see Successional Status), devil's
club is probably absent from burn sites for decades following
stand-replacing fire.  Presumably, devil's club establishes on these
sites from animal-dispersed seed after the canopy has closed enough to
shade this light-sensitive species.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Overall fire potential is rated as low in western redcedar/devil's club
habitat types of western Montana [<a href="#17">17</a>].
