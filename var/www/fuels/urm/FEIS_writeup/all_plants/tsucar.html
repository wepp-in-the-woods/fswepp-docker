<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Tsuga caroliniana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Carolina hemlock has a very limited distribution.  It occurs along the
slopes of the Appalachian Mountains from southwestern Virginia and
western North Carolina into South Carolina and northern Georgia
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Tsuga caroliniana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
The wood of Carolina hemlock can be used for lumber or pulpwood, but the
species is so limited in extent that it is not considered commercially
important [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
The seeds of Carolina hemlock are an important food for a number of
birds and mammals.  Beaver, and occasionally porcupine and rabbit, eat
the bark [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  The foliage is occasionally browsed by white-tailed
deer in the winter [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Carolina hemlock and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) stands are
considered essential for shelter and bedding of white-tailed deer during
the winter [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Carolina hemlock is often planted as an ornamental.  Tannin from the
bark of Carolina hemlock was formerly extracted for use in processing
leather [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Information concerning management practices for Carolina hemlock is
lacking.  However, management practices for the very similair species
eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) have been outlined [<a href="#6">6</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Tsuga caroliniana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Carolina hemlock is a native, slow-growing, coniferous, evergreen tree
usually 40 to 70 feet (12-21 m) tall and 8 to 12 inches (20-30 cm) in
d.b.h. [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Heights of 150 to 180 feet (46-55 m) and diameters of
5 to 6 feet (1.5-1.8 m) have been reported [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Carolina hemlock has a long slender trunk and a narrow crown of slightly
drooping branches.  The leaf blades spread from the twig in all
directions.  The cones are 1.0 to 1.5 inches (2.5-3.8 cm) long, and the
seeds are the longest of any of the native hemlocks [<a href="#18">18</a>].  The bark on
younger trees is flaky and scaly and on older trees, deeply furrowed.
The root system is shallow and spreading [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Seed production and dissemination:  Carolina hemlock begins producing
seed at about age 20, but good crops do not occur until the trees are
are 25 and 30 years.  The lightweight seed are wind dispersed.  Carolina
hemlock seed averages of 187,000 seeds per pound (415,000/kg) [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].

Vegetative Reproduction:  Like other hemlocks Carolina hemlock does not
sprout and only rarely layers.  Vegetative propagation by cuttings and
grafting are limited to ornamental production [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Carolina hemlock is common on rocky slopes and ridges of the Appalachian
Mountains at elevations between 2,100 and 4,000 feet (400-1,220 m)
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].  Typically, most soils are very acidic (between 3.5-4.5 pH), but
some are near neutral.  The heavy, slowly decomposing litter fosters
podzolization as the stand increases in age [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].

Other associates of Carolina hemlock in addition to the cover type
species are eastern hemlock (T. canadensis), Carolina silverbell
(Halesia carolina), American holly (Ilex opaca), mountain rosebay
(Rhododendron catawbiense), mountain-laurel (Kalmia latifolia), and oak
(Quercus spp.) [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Climax Species

Carolina hemlock is very shade tolerant.  It will gradually replace
earlier established species and become dominant in very late stages of
succession.  Carolina hemlock can be considered a climax species because
it is difficult for other species to invade and grow under its canopy [<a href="#7">7</a>].



<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Carolina hemlock pollination occurs from March to the end of April.  The
cones ripen from late August to late September of the next year; the
seed is dispersed from September through the winter [<a href="#18">18</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Tsuga caroliniana

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Currently, very little information on the fire ecology of Carolina
hemlock is available in the literature.  Starker [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>] lists other
species of hemlock as having an intermediate resistance to fire.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tree without adventitious-bud root crown
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Tsuga caroliniana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Presumably, seedlings and saplings of Carolina hemlock are killed by
fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>



<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Carolina hemlock is favored by fire suppression.  Humphrey [<a href="#7">7</a>] reports
that the slow-growing Carolina hemlock will have time to develop a
mature population only on sites where fire is infrequent.
