<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name for Shumard oak is Quercus
shumardii Buckl.  It is a member of the red oak group (subgenus
Erythrobalanus) [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  There are no accepted subspecies or forms.
Some authorities recognize the following varieties [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>]:

      Quercus shumardii var. shumardii
      Quercus shumardii var. texana (Buckl.) Ashe      (Texas oak)
      Quercus shumardii var. schneckii (Britt.) Sarg.  (Schneck oak)

A new variety, Q. s. var. stenocarpa, with very narrow and shallow acorn
cups, has been reported in the Midwest [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Maple-leaf oak, which was
formerly accepted as a variety of Shumard oak (as Q. s. var. acerifolia),
has been elevated to species status as Q. acerifolia Stoynoff & Hess [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].

Shumard oak forms hybrids with nine other species of oaks [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  It
is most closely related to blackjack oak (Q. marilandica) and black oak
(Q. velutina), as determined by electrophoresis [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>LIFE FORM : </b>
Tree

<b>FEDERAL LEGAL STATUS : </b>
See OTHER STATUS

<b>OTHER STATUS : </b>
Shumard oak is listed as vulnerable in Ontario [<a href="#51">51</a>].

Quercus acerifolia is treated as a distinct species and therefore not
discussed in the write-up.  It is, however, listed as a Category 2 plant
under the former name Q. shumardii var. acerifolia [<a href="#49">49</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus shumardii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Shumard oak occurs on the Atlantic Coastal Plain from North Carolina
south to northern Florida; west to central Texas; north to central
Oklahoma, eastern Kansas, Missouri, southern Illinois, western and
southern Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee.  It occurs locally north to
southern Michigan, and southern Pennsylvania [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Specimens have
been collected from extreme southwestern Ontario and the eastern Niagara
peninsula [<a href="#38">38</a>].

The status of Shumard oak in Maryland is uncertain.  It has been
reported in Maryland by reliable sources [<a href="#9">9</a>], but specimens were not
located by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Fish and Wildlife Service
survey [<a href="#47">47</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus shumardii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Shumard oak wood is close-grained, hard, strong, and heavy [<a href="#45">45</a>].  This
wood is superior to that of other red oaks; it is marketed as "red oak",
and is not distinguished commercially from red oak species.  The wood is
used for veneer, cabinets, furniture, flooring, interior trim, and
lumber [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
In Texas, Shumard oak is preferred browse for white-tailed deer in Ashe
juniper (Juniperus ashei) woodlands [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Shumard oak acorns are excellent food for wildlife; they are consumed by
songbirds, wild turkeys, waterfowl, white-tailed deer, and various
species of squirrels [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Shumard oak acorns were intermediate in palatability to fox squirrels
when compared with those of eight other southern oaks [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Nutritional values (percent dry weight) for Shumard oak acorns are as
follows [<a href="#8">8</a>]:

crude fat               9.8
total carbohydrates    29.3
total protein           3.8
phosphorus              0.06
calcium                 0.27
magnesium               0.06



<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Shumard oak had one of the highest survival rates of nine oak species
planted on minespoils in Illinois [<a href="#4">4</a>].  It exhibited outstanding growth
on cast overburden in Illinois and Indiana [<a href="#37">37</a>].  In Mississippi,
reforestation of agricultural lands to bottomland hardwoods was
successful with direct-seeded Shumard oak (in addition to other
species).  Sites were seeded without preparation.  Weeds were controlled
on one site, where Shumard oak had better growth and survivorship than
at the other sites [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Shumard oak seedlings have been planted successfully in reforestation
projects on eroded ridgetops in Mississippi [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Shumard oak is planted as an ornamental [<a href="#38">38</a>].

Shumard oak acorns are bitter, but are edible if the tannins are leached
out.  They can be ground and used as flour, roasted and ground to make
coffee, or eaten whole [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Native Americans had many uses for the
bark and acorns of oaks, probably including Shumard oak [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Shumard oak can be successfully direct seeded or planted as seedlings
[<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Soil fertilization does not improve establishment success
[<a href="#39">39</a>].  Height growth of direct-seeded Shumard oaks is slow compared to
that of planted stock; growth rates are sufficient to achieve wildlife
habitat management objectives but not for timber production [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Acorns with a moisture content below 20 to 30 percent are not likely to
germinate [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Seed moisture for Shumard oaks can be measured by using
microwave ovens [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Diseases of Shumard oak include oakleaf blister, oak wilt, and various
wood rotting fungi (Fomes spp., Polyporus spp., and Stereum spp.)  [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Insect defoliators that attack Shumard oak, but are not species
specific, include June beetles, orange-striped oakworms, cankerworms,
forest tent caterpillars, yellow-necked caterpillars, variable oakleaf
caterpillars, and red-humped oakworms [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Shumard oak acorns are
subject to attack by acorn weevils [<a href="#26">26</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus shumardii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Shumard oak is a large, deciduous, native tree.  It ranges up to 120
feet (40 m) in height, with trunk diameters of up to 80 inches (200 cm)
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  The crown is open and wide spreading, with massive,
ascending branches.  The trunk of older trees is heavily buttressed.
The bark is furrowed, with broken ridges [<a href="#38">38</a>].  The leaves are
five-lobed to nine-lobed.  Shumard oak acorns are egg-shaped,
approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) long, and enclosed in a thick, flat,
saucer-shaped cup with pubescent scales [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Shumard oak is long-lived; the oldest Shumard oak found on a blue
ash (Fraxinus quadrangulata) savanna was 480 years of age [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Minimum seed-bearing age for Shumard oak is 25 years.  Optimum seed
production occurs at about 50 years of age.  Good seed crops are
produced every 2 to 3 years [<a href="#11">11</a>].  The acorns are frequently multiseeded
(an unusual trait).  Seeds are dispersed by seedhoarding mammals (mainly
squirrels) [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Acorns exhibit internal dormancy, which is broken by
cold, moist conditions.  Moist stratification at 36 degrees Fahrenheit
(2 deg C) for 8 to 12 weeks breaks dormancy.  The acorns typically
contain about 40 percent moisture at maturity [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Factors affecting
seed germination and seedling establishment include microclimate
conditions, soil moisture, and stand variables.  The limiting factor
appears to be seed supply, which may be affected by seed predation
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Full light is required for good seedling establishment and
growth [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Shumard oak sprouts from the roots when top-killed [<a href="#3">3</a>].  This ability is
more pronounced in younger individuals.  Shumard oak is not a prolific
sprouter on moist sites; more sprouts are found on dry sites.  It is
difficult to propagate by cuttings [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Shumard oak grows best on moist, well-drained loamy soils on terraces,
colluvial sites, and adjacent bluffs associated with large and small
streams.  Shumard oak also occurs in Coastal Plains hammocks [<a href="#26">26</a>].
Shumard oak is intolerant or only weakly tolerant of flooding [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>],
and does not usually occur on the lowest river bottoms [<a href="#18">18</a>].  It is
fairly drought tolerant, and is tolerant of alkaline soils and their
associated nutrient deficiency [<a href="#11">11</a>].  It can be planted in soils with pH
greater than 7.5 [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  In central Texas, it occurs on dry, low
limestone hills.  In the south-central United States, it occurs on dry
uplands and ridges [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Shumard oak is intolerant of shade but is rare in early successional
stands.  It often occurs in climax forests.  Since Shumard oak is shade
intolerant and requires openings in which to establish, it is not
considered a true climax species [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Monk [<a href="#27">27</a>] classifies Shumard oak
as a climax exclusive:  a species which occupies specific environmental
situations in the climax community and is rarely encountered in
successional stands.  It is likely that Shumard oak colonizes gaps in
mature forests.  In Florida, Shumard oak occurs in climax magnolia-beech
forests [<a href="#15">15</a>].  In Missouri, it occurs as an overstory associate on river
bottom ridges occupied by sugar maple (Acer saccharum), pawpaw (Asimina
triloba), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and swamp chestnut oak
(Quercus michauxii).  There were no Shumard oak seedlings or saplings in
these stands [<a href="#31">31</a>].  In Texas, Shumard oak was found in 47-year-old
bottomland hardwood stands and undisturbed adjacent forest, but not in
early successional stands [<a href="#29">29</a>].

It is likely that mature Shumard oak produces allelopathic substances [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Shumard oak flowers from March to April, and as late as June in some
parts of its range [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].  Acorns ripen from September to October of
their second year [<a href="#11">11</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus shumardii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Specific information on the relationship of Shumard oak and fire was not
found in the literature.  Shumard oak occurs in bottomland hardwood
forests which are dependent on fire exclusion [<a href="#43">43</a>].  It also occurs in
post oak (Quercus stellata)-blackjack oak communities which, though they
can be damaged by fire, are fire resistant [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Shumard oak occurs in
blue ash savannas, which are maintained by a combination of factors
including fire [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Shumard oak is probably moderately resistant to immediate fire damage,
but, like many hardwoods, is subject to attack by disease when wounded
by fire.  Basal wounding usually results in at least top-kill of such
trees, either by girdling the tree or by creating avenues for infection
by wood-rotting fungi.  Top-killed Shumard oak produce root sprouts [<a href="#40">40</a>].

Shumard oak is not usually found in early seral communities and is
therefore unlikely to colonize early postfire communities.

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus shumardii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Information concerning fire severity and damage to Shumard oak is
lacking in the literature.  Mature trees are probably intermediate in
resistance to low- and moderate-severity fires.  Severe fires would
probably top-kill or kill mature trees.  Seedlings and saplings are
likely to be killed by any fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Hot fires will stimulate root sprouting in Shumard oak, presumably after
top-kill [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Management of Shumard oak as deer browse in Ashe juniper woodlands
includes prescribed burning of previously chained sites.  These sites
should be burned with hot fires, with intervals of at least 7 to 10
years between fires [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Prescribed fire on chained Ashe juniper sites
removed dead Ashe juniper debris and killed young Ashe juniper trees.
Over 10 years, Shumard oak was one of three dominant secondary species
which provided browse and cover for game birds and white-tailed deer
[<a href="#40">40</a>].

Shumard oak occurs in bottomland hardwood forests, which are not usually
subjected to prescribed fires since the risk of fire damage is high.  It
also occurs on sites where pines, particularly loblolly pine (Pinus
taeda) and shortleaf pine (P. echinata), are the desired species.
Prescribed fire is used to control hardwoods on these sites when the
pines have reached pole size or larger [<a href="#43">43</a>].
