The scientific name of silver sagebrush is <i> Artemisia cana</i> Pursh (Asteraceae)
[<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#191">191</a>]. Based upon  differences in morphology and ploidy level [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>], 
some systematists recognize 3 subspecies:

<p> <i> Artemisia cana</i> spp. <i> bolanderi</i> (Gray) G.H. Ward [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>]&nbsp; &nbsp;
Bolander silver sagebrush<br>
<i> Artemisia cana</i> ssp. <i> cana</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; plains silver sagebrush<br>
<i> Artemisia cana</i> ssp. <i> viscidula</i> (Osterh.) Beetle [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>]&nbsp; &nbsp;mountain silver sagebrush</p>

<p>Within this summary, &quot;silver sagebrush&quot; refers to the species as a whole.
Infrataxa are referred to by the 3 common names listed above. Not all authorities 
 
recognize infrataxa within silver sagebrush [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#190">190</a>]. </p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Hybrids:</b></font> The sagebrush genus is evolving rapidly, and hybridization is an
  important factor in its evolution
  [<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#188">188</a>]. Silver sagebrush readily hybridizes with other woody sagebrush species
  (<i>Artemisia</i> subgenus
  <i>Tridentatae</i>) 
including threetip sagebrush (<i>A. tripartita</i>), big sagebrush (<i>A. tridentata</i>)
  [<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#188">188</a>,<a href="#190">190</a>,<a href="#191">191</a>],
and low sagebrush (<i>A. arbuscula</i>) [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#190">190</a>]. Silver sagebrush ×
  mountain big sagebrush (<i>A. t</i>. ssp. <i>vaseyana</i>) and silver
  sagebrush × Lahontan sagebrush (<i>A</i>. <i>a</i>. ssp. <i>longicaulis</i>) hybrids
  form stable, self-reproducing populations that some authorities classify as distinct
  taxonomic entities (snowfield sagebrush (<i>A.
spiciformis </i>Osterh.) and coaltown sagebrush (<i>A. argilosa</i> Beetle),
  respectively) [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#163">163</a>].
  Silver sagebrush infrataxa also hybridize with each other, although  Bolander silver sagebrush
  is geographically isolated from the other 2 subspecies and does not do 
  so naturally [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>]. Sagebrush
  hybrids are important ecologically as well as evolutionarily, often tolerating
  a broader range of ecological conditions than either parent [<a href="#116">116</a>].

<br />


<font face="Bell MT"><b>Species:</b></font> Silver sagebrush is widely 
distributed across western North America. It occurs from southern British 
Columbia east to southwestern Manitoba and south to Minnesota, Nebraska, northern 
New Mexico and Arizona, and southern California [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>]. Distributed over 53,221 mi<sup>2</sup> 
(137,800  km<sup>2</sup>) of the western United States, it is 2nd only to big sagebrush in total area occupied
by a sagebrush species [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>]. Silver sagebrush is most common in the northern
Great Plains, Rocky Mountain, and Intermountain regions [<a href="#198">198</a>]. It
is relatively uncommon in the Great Basin [<a href="#126">126</a>]. It is rare in Utah, British Columbia, and Manitoba, and  absent from Washington [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>].&nbsp; <a href="http://plants.usda.gov/">Plants database</a> provides
maps showing the overall distribution of silver sagebrush and distributions of
the subspecies.

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Subspecies:</b></font> Bolander silver sagebrush occurs from
north-central Oregon, where it occurs in
montane meadows of the Ochoco and Blue mountains and on the eastern slope of the
Cascade Range [<a href="#37">37</a>], south through mountainous regions and the eastern edge of
the Great Basin to Inyo and Tulare counties, California, and east to
Humboldt and Washoe counties, Nevada. Bolander silver sagebrush populations are disjunct from
the other 2 subspecies [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>].</p>

<p> Plains silver sagebrush occurs from southern  British Columbia east to
southwestern Manitoba and
south to western Nebraska, eastern Colorado, central Wyoming, and south-central
Montana [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#190">190</a>]. Most common east of the Continental
Divide, it is widely distributed in the northern Great Plains. Common in
Saskatchewan, it becomes increasingly sparse to the south except along watercourses and
bottomlands, where it may be locally abundant&nbsp; [<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>]. Distributions of plains and mountain silver sagebrush overlap in
eastern Idaho, western Montana, across Wyoming, and in north-central Colorado.
Outlying populations occur in west-central Colorado and the eastern Dakotas [<a href="#71">71</a>].</p>

<p> Mountain silver sagebrush is most common west of the Continental Divide. It
is distributed from central Idaho and western Montana east to
central Colorado, south to northeastern New Mexico and north-central Arizona, and
west to central Nevada and eastern Oregon [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>,<a href="#190">190</a>].</p>

Composition of silver sagebrush communities is variable across the species' broad 
geographical range. The communities are often compositionally and 
structurally simple, but are sometimes diverse, especially  in riparian zones [<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#177">177</a>,<a href="#198">198</a>]. 
Brief descriptions of common codominants and associates are presented below by 
subspecies. More detailed descriptions of silver sagebrush-dominated plant 
communities are available in the publications listed at the end of this section.<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Bolander silver sagebrush:</b></font> There are few descriptions of Bolander silver sagebrush 
communities in the literature. Bolander silver sagebrush types on the Toiyabe 
National Forest of west-central Nevada and&nbsp; east-central California are codominated by Douglas' sedge (<i>Carex douglasii</i>) and/or 
Baltic rush (<i>Juncus balticus</i>) [<a href="#110">110</a>]. Descriptions of Bolander silver 
sagebrush communities in California are 
particularly sparse, although a community codominated by mat muhly (<i>Muhlenbergia richardsonis</i>) 
has been documented in Lassen County [<a href="#202">202</a>]. In nearby Plumas County,
Bolander silver sagebrush co-occurs with mountain big sagebrush, Nebraska sedge
(<i>Carex nebrascensis</i>), and tufted hairgrass (<i>Deschampsia cespitosa</i>) 
[<a href="#32">32</a>]. In central Oregon, Bolander silver sagebrush/mat muhly communities occur 
on seasonal ponds, expanding and contracting as climate drives water levels. Big 
sagebrush,
Sierra  lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i> var. <i>murrayana</i>), and quaking aspen 
(<i>Populus tremuloides</i>) border and may invade the community [<a href="#40">40</a>]. In 
meadows of the Ochoco and Blue mountains, Bolander silver sagebrush often 
codominates with big sagebrush. Cusick's bluegrass usually dominates
the understory; western yarrow (<i>Achillea millefolium</i>) is a constant associate [<a href="#98">98</a>]. Bolander
silver sagebrush is classified as a major indicator shrub for riparian zones in
central Oregon [<a href="#100">100</a>]. </p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Plains silver sagebrush:</b></font> Species diversity tends to be low in plains silver sagebrush communities [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#177">177</a>].
There are few other shrub species; the communities are mostly composed of silver
sagebrush,  bunchgrasses, and other graminoid associates. Forbs are typically infrequent
[<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#177">177</a>] but  occasionally important. Nelson [<a href="#127">127</a>] reported 20% forb cover in a
plains silver sagebrush community in the Badlands of North Dakota.
In Saskatchewan, plains silver sagebrush dominates sandhill prairies, and is 
common in the blue grama-green needlegrass (<i>Bouteloua gracilis-Nassella viridula</i>) 
association [<a href="#88">88</a>]. Plains silver sagebrush dominates mesic mountain

steppes in the northwestern portion of its range, often mixed with Wyoming big
sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i> var. <i>wyomingensis</i>). It merges with and associates in western wheatgrass-Idaho 
fescue 
(<i>Pascopyrum smithii-Festuca idahoensis</i>) and bluebunch wheatgrass <i>(Pseudoroegneria spicata)</i>-Idaho fescue mountain grasslands [<a href="#71">71</a>] and 
in black
greasewood (<i>Sarcobatus vermiculatus</i>) communities [<a href="#3">3</a>]. Plains silver
sagebrush-dominated communities are often
upslope from black cottonwood (<i>Populus balsamifera</i> ssp. <i>trichocarpa</i>)
floodplains throughout the subspecies' distribution [<a href="#80">80</a>], and may
codominate with willow (<i>Salix</i>) species on meandering drainages [<a href="#158">158</a>]. Plains silver
sagebrush  sometimes dominates  understories of open narrowleaf cottonwood (<i>Populus
angustifolia</i>) stands [<a href="#31">31</a>]. In the
shortgrass prairie, plains silver sagebrush communities occur on or upslope from
floodplains. Western wheatgrass is the most common codominant; other frequently
codominating or associated grasses include green needlegrass,
prairie sandreed (<i>Calamovilfa longifolia</i>), and blue grama [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#177">177</a>].
Nelson [<a href="#127">127</a>] found blue grama codominated upland sites in the Badlands of North
Dakota, while a plains silver sagebrush-western snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos 
occidentalis</i>)/western wheatgrass formation
occurred on bottomlands. Japanese brome (<i>Bromus japonicus</i>) and cheatgrass (<i>B. tectorum</i>) 
are fairly constant invaders in plains silver sagebrush communities [<a href="#177">177</a>]. 
Thatcher [<a href="#176">176</a>] reported that plains silver sagebrush in eastern Wyoming was the 
only woody sagebrush species growing in association with basin wildrye.</p>

<p> <font face="Bell MT"><b>Mountain silver sagebrush</b></font> typically occurs in steppe vegetation. Species diversity and community production can be great in  mountain silver sagebrush communities, 
which often border riparian zones and moist mountain meadows. The most common understory dominants in mountain silver sagebrush communities
of Wyoming and  Montana are tufted hairgrass  and Idaho fescue [<a href="#198">198</a>]. 
In the Gros Ventre area of Wyoming, high-elevation (&gt; 7,000 ft. (2,000 m)) 
mountain silver sagebrush/Idaho fescue communities occur on moraines and 
landslides [<a href="#20">20</a>]. Lower-elevation mountain silver sagebrush
communities of Wyoming may be dominated by bluegrasses (<i>Poa</i> spp.) and bromes
(<i>Bromus</i> spp.) [<a href="#143">143</a>]. Shrubby cinquefoil (<i>Dasiphora floribunda</i>) is 
a common associate in mountain silver sagebrush communities, and usually the only other 
shrub present [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. Shrubby cinquefoil is the only constant shrub
associate in mountain silver sagebrush/Thurber fescue (<i>F. thurberi</i>) 
steppes of Colorado [<a href="#176">176</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>] and in mountain silver
sagebrush/Idaho fescue steppes of central and eastern Idaho [<a href="#155">155</a>].&nbsp;Mountain silver sagebrush is locally dominant on mountain grassland clay soils 
of central Idaho, where it forms the &quot;Camas Prairie&quot; association with
common camas (<i>Camassia quamash</i>) [<a href="#149">149</a>].  Mountain silver sagebrush steppes in northern Utah
and southern Idaho are codominated by tufted hairgrass, sheep fescue (<i>F. ovina</i>), and Kentucky
bluegrass (<i>P. pratensis</i>). Mountain silver sagebrush/Kentucky bluegrass is probably a sere induced by heavy grazing [<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>].
Mountain silver sagebrush communities of Utah merge into open quaking
aspen-Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii </i>var.<i> glauca</i>) parklands, 
where mountain silver sagebrush becomes an understory component
[<a href="#166">166</a>]. In eastern Oregon,&nbsp;Douglas' sedge and 
Cusick's bluegrass dominate mountain silver sagebrush understories. The 
mountain silver sagebrush community merges into upland mountain big sagebrush and streamside Kentucky bluegrass or sedge (<i>Carex</i>
spp.) communities [<a href="#132">132</a>]. In Nevada,
mountain silver sagebrush steppes are codominated by slender wheatgrass 
(<i>Elymus trachycaulus</i>), Idaho fescue, beardless wildrye (<i>Leymus triticoides)</i>, 
sedges, and Baltic rush [<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>]. </p>

GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Silver sagebrush is a native shrub with semiwoody to woody stems [<a href="#92">92</a>].
Mature plants generally range from 1.3 to 3.3 feet (0.4-1 m) in height and are densely
branched [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#168">168</a>]. Plants on upland sites tend to be smaller than
plants on bottomlands and other moist sites [<a href="#176">176</a>]. The lanceolate leaves are thin and narrow, ranging from 0.8 to 3.5 inches (2-9 cm) in
length [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#168">168</a>]. Plants with lobed leaves are probably
showing introgression with big sagebrush [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#188">188</a>]. Vegetative shoots are evergreen and perennial; floral
shoots are annual but somewhat persistent after drying [<a href="#72">72</a>]. The inflorescence is a
panicle of 
perfect disc flowers [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>]. The fruit is
a small (~ 2.5 × 1 mm), sticky-walled <a href="../../../glossary.html#CYPSELA:">cypsela</a> 
bearing a single, tiny seed [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#168">168</a>,<a href="#171">171</a>,<a href="#191">191</a>]. Harvey [<a href="#71">71</a>] reported
mean mass, length, and width of plains silver sagebrush seed from Montana at 680
µg, 2.1 mm, and 0.90 mm, respectively. The root system consists of a taproot
with lateral roots [<a href="#71">71</a>]. Plants in Saskatchewan had deep taproots (7-10+ ft.
(2-4+ m)) without much lateral branching in upper soil layers [<a href="#36">36</a>].
Silver sagebrush is rhizomatous; rhizomes are generally located within a few
inches of the soil surface [<a href="#71">71</a>]. Rhizome length of plains silver sagebrush in
eastern Montana averaged 3.4 feet (1.1 m): 3.3 times more than  mean 
plant height of 13 inches (32 cm). Individual rhizomes bore 1 to 52 sprouts [<a href="#187">187</a>].

<p>Plant descriptions provided in this section present information relevant to 
fire ecology and are
not meant as  identification keys. Several florae [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#168">168</a>,<a href="#191">191</a>] 
provide keys for identifying silver sagebrush. </p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Subspecies:</b></font> 
Infrataxa are morphologically
distinguished by plant height and relative leaf size, color,
and hairiness of
herbage [<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#191">191</a>]. Distinctions are not clear-cut, and there is 
considerable overlap in the subspecies' characteristics [<a href="#38">38</a>]. Beetle [<a href="#12">12</a>] 
and Winward [<a href="#198">198</a>] provide keys for distinguishing silver sagebrush 
infrataxa.&nbsp;Gross differences in the subspecies' morphology follow.</p>

<p>Bolander silver sagebrush is a relatively low, thickly branched, round shrub
[<a href="#91">91</a>]. It is less than 3 feet (0.9 m) in height. Stems are
woody at the base and bear relatively small (1- to 2-inch-long (3-5 cm)), narrow
leaves. Fruits are less than 1.2 mm in length, and resinous [<a href="#75">75</a>]. Bolander silver sagebrush
is easily distinguished because of its restricted range [<a href="#12">12</a>].
</p>

<p>Plains silver sagebrush is the tallest of the subspecies. It has an erect,
freely branching growth form, typically reaching 3 to 4 feet (0.9-1 m) in height
at maturity but sometimes as much as 4.9 to 6.6 feet (1.5-2 m) [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#168">168</a>]. It has relatively larger, wider leaves (2-4 inches × 0.4 inch (4-9
× 1 cm)) with a denser, whiter covering of tomentum [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>]
compared to mountain silver sagebrush.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Mountain silver sagebrush is erect and freely branching in form [<a href="#90">90</a>].
It grows from 0.3 to 1 foot (0.1-0.3 m) in height. It is
differentiated from plains silver sagebrush by its relatively shorter stature, smaller (0.8-5.3 cm long),
narrower,
more strongly lobed leaves, and less silvery-white (often dark green) herbage
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#191">191</a>].
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Species' stand/age class structure:</b></font> Silver 
sagebrush communities are usually structurally simple, consisting of silver 
sagebrush and an understory of graminoids. Silver sagebrush is often the only 
shrub [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>,<a href="#155">155</a>,<a href="#203">203</a>], and forb cover is usually sparse [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>]. Spacing 
varies from widely spaced silver sagebrush plants or clustered colonies to a 
close arrangement of shrubs [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>]. Silver sagebrush in late 
succession can form nearly closed cover [<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#198">198</a>].
Hirsch [<a href="#78">78</a>] found a range of 674 to 4,519
silver sagebrush per hectare in a plains silver sagebrush-western wheatgrass
community in southwestern North Dakota. Another western North Dakota study
showed the few forbs in the community were most abundant near plains silver
sagebrush, while bunchgrasses were more plentiful in shrub interspaces [<a href="#73">73</a>].
Bare ground and biological soil crust cover
tend to be low in undisturbed silver sagebrush communities [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>]. On a mountain silver sagebrush community in eastern
Oregon, mean bare ground and litter cover on undisturbed soils were &lt; 3% and
80%, respectively. Maximum bare ground cover on disturbed soils was 17%
[<a href="#132">132</a>].</p>

<p>Woody sagebrush species are long lived, with some species exceeding 100 years
of age [<a href="#193">193</a>]. As a cloning species, however, silver sagebrush probably does not
fit this general pattern. Maximum life span and
typical age class structure of silver sagebrush
need further investigation. Wambolt and others [<a href="#187">187</a>] found age class structure of plains silver sagebrush in 
eastern Montana was as follows:</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Physiology:</b></font><br>

<font face="Bell MT">Flooding -</font>  
Silver sagebrush has superior flooding tolerance compared to other woody sagebrush
species [<a href="#157">157</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Drought -</font>  
Drought tolerance of silver sagebrush is uncertain. The species is markedly
sensitive to water stress in the seedling stage [<a href="#186">186</a>,<a href="#187">187</a>], and has been noted as
either drought intolerant [<a href="#112">112</a>] or tolerant [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>]
at maturity. Within the species, plains,
mountain, and Bolander silver sagebrush have been ranked least to
most drought tolerant, respectively [<a href="#163">163</a>]. Anecdotal evidence from northern Great Plains
studies during and after the &quot;dust bowl&quot; era (1937-1943) suggests that
silver sagebrush is well adapted to survive severe, prolonged drought. On study
sites across the northern Great Plains, adult postdrought survivorship of silver sagebrush
was comparable to big sagebrush, and silver sagebrush showed better 
seedling establishment than big sagebrush after the drought had ended [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>].</p>

REGENERATION PROCESSES:</a>

<br />

Silver sagebrush reproduces from seed and by sprouting and&nbsp;layering [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Breeding system:</font></b> Silver sagebrush's 
perfect flowers are uniformly fertile [<a href="#111">111</a>]. Most breeding is
accomplished by outcrossing, although some selfing occurs [<a href="#112">112</a>]. DNA
studies of plains silver sagebrush showed evidence of interpopulation
outcrossing, but differences in genetic diversity among populations were not
great. McArthur and others [<a href="#115">115</a>] state that large population sizes and
wind-effected pollination tend to minimize between-population differences in silver
sagebrush.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Pollination:</b></font> Pollen is mostly spread by 
wind. Since bees, beetles, and flies regularly visit silver sagebrush flowers, 
some insect-mediated pollination probably occurs [<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#182">182</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Seed production:</font> </b> 
Sagebrush species tend to have high fruit set, seed set, and germination rates. High
seed production and germination rates help offset the genus' generally low rate
of seedling establishment (see &quot;Seedling establishment&quot; discussion below) [<a href="#182">182</a>]. Although a 
good fruit and seed producer, silver
sagebrush has a lower rate of seed production than other species in its
subgenus, with fruit set 18% lower than big sagebrush
[<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#179">179</a>]. Silver
sagebrush 1st starts producing seed at about 4 years of age [<a href="#147">147</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed dispersal:</b></font> 
 At time of dispersal, the involucral bracts spread and release the ripe fruits
[<a href="#168">168</a>]. The single seed remains contained within the fruit,  which falls beneath or slightly downwind of the parent plant. Some
long-distance  dispersal probably occurs when the sticky fruits adhere to passing animals
[<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>]. Wind and water  also disperse seed away from the parent plant
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#187">187</a>]. Fruits that fall on crusted snow may be moved
long distances by wind. Sagebrush seeds float, and water currents may also carry
seeds considerable distances [<a href="#159">159</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed banking:</b></font> 
Studies on potential seed 
banking of silver sagebrush are sparse, but a few studies suggest that silver 
sagebrush may build up a short-term seed bank.&nbsp; Silver sagebrush seed 
retains its ability to geminate when stored under cool, dry conditions, but 
looses germinative capacity rapidly when exposed to unfavorable conditions. Eddleman [<a href="#45">45</a>] obtained better 
(73%) and faster germination from stratified, year-old seed than from 
unstratified 2-month-old seed (26% germination) in the laboratory. However, Romo and 
Young [<a href="#148">148</a>] found plains silver sagebrush  seed rapidly lost its ability to 
germinate when exposed to field environments in Saskatchewan. Spring-sown seed 
showed significantly better emergence than fall-sown seed, which was more likely 
to be killed by fungi or drastic fluctuations in temperature. Some seeds that 
failed to germinate within the 1st year were still viable, and the authors 
suggest that silver sagebrush may have a small soil seed bank reserve on safe 
sites. Further studies are needed to determine ability of silver sagebrush to 
establish from soil-stored seed.</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Germination:</font></b> Silver sagebrush seed is 
immediately germinable, although best germination occurs when seeds are retained 
on the parent plant long enough to experience cold temperatures [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>]. Seed 
germinates with or without light [<a href="#184">184</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>] over a wide range of temperatures 
[<a href="#186">186</a>]. Plains silver sagebrush seed collected in Montana, stored at room 
temperature for 2 years, and sown in the greenhouse showed 51% and 64% 
germination on filter paper (without and with fungicide treatment, 
respectively). Optimum germination appears to occur with persistently cool soil 
temperatures. When&nbsp;sown in the greenhouse, seeds showed 93% germination at 68 <sup>o</sup>Fahrenheit (20
<sup>o</sup>C) and 97% germination at 59 <sup>o</sup>Fahrenheit (15 <sup>o</sup>C)
[<a href="#71">71</a>]. A Saskatchewan study found best germination of plains silver sagebrush occurred with stratification (<u>&gt;</u> 28
days' duration) around 50 <sup>o</sup>Fahrenheit (10 <sup>o</sup>C). Temperature range
for germination was 41-77 <sup>o</sup>Fahrenheit (5-25 <sup>o</sup>C) [<a href="#146">146</a>]. In the 
Montana study, exposure to relatively high temperatures (86 <sup>o</sup>Fahrenheit (30 <sup>o</sup>C)
for 14 days) prior to planting resulted in loss of seed viability. Germination
rates were best for seed planted 2.5 mm below the soil surface. No germination
occurred in seed more than 7.5 mm below the soil surface. Seeds sown on the soil
surface germinated readily but were highly susceptible to desiccation [<a href="#71">71</a>].&nbsp;</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seedling establishment/growth:</b></font>
 Although silver sagebrush seed production is high, few plants survive the germination and
seedling stages [<a href="#185">185</a>]. Artificial plains silver sagebrush regeneration, 
established in southern Montana by seeding-in, showed&nbsp; mean 1st-year 
survivorship of 3.4% [<a href="#71">71</a>]. Seedlings require open ground that is free from competition  [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>], and they are rare in undisturbed to lightly disturbed, mature stands [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>]. 
On undisturbed steppes in the Badlands of North Dakota, plains silver sagebrush 
comprised 100% of total shrub cover, only 4% of which was seedlings [<a href="#186">186</a>]. Good establishment occurs on soils
disturbed by animal burrowing or tilling [<a href="#147">147</a>]; the incidence of postfire
seedling establishment needs further study. Silver sagebrush seedling mortality 
is greatest in the 1st year, tending to level out after that [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>]. 
Investigators in Saskatchewan [<a href="#83">83</a>] found that up to a critical mass, seedling 
establishment and growth rates of plains silver sagebrush seedlings increased 
with increasing weight of their originating seeds; however,
plants from seeds weighting <u>&gt;</u> 0.57 mg showed poor germination,
and growth of seedlings from the heaviest seeds was slow. In a Saskatchewan study, Romo and Grilz [<a href="#147">147</a>] found that only 5-6% of
sown silver sagebrush seed produced seedlings, but 85% of
seedlings that survived their 1st year also survived their 2nd. Drought is the primary cause of seedling
death. Seedlings require
moist soil for establishment and growth [<a href="#186">186</a>,<a href="#187">187</a>], and pulses of seedling
establishment have been noted in years of above-average precipitation [<a href="#187">187</a>].

</p>

<p>Acclimated seedlings are
cold-hardy. Plains silver sagebrush seedlings from Saskatchewan survived
exposure to -38 <sup>o</sup>Fahrenheit (-39 <sup>o</sup>C) temperatures after hardening-off, while nonacclimated seedlings 
did not survive exposure to 
7 <sup>o</sup>Fahrenheit (-14 <sup>o</sup>C) temperatures. The
researchers suggested that seedlings germinating early in spring may show better
winter survivorship than later-germinating seedlings, as older seedlings that
have gradually acclimated to cooling temperatures have had more time to develop 
protection from freezing by lignifying cell walls and expanding twig buds [<a href="#82">82</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Asexual regeneration:</b></font> Cloning is silver 
sagebrush's most common method of reproduction [<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#187">187</a>]. With 3 methods of 
sprouting and the ability to

silver sagebrush is the strongest sprouter in its subgenus [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>,<a href="#200">200</a>]. It sprouts from the roots 
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>], rhizomes [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#171">171</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>], and the root 
crown [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#152">152</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>] after disturbance damages stem tissue [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>] and 
removes apical dominance. A strong sprouting response from buried organs 
increases silver sagebrush's ability to survive flood, ice scour, drought, and 
even severe fire damage [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>,<a href="#187">187</a>]. Enlargement of colonies via sprouting and 
layering is nearly the sole method of silver sagebrush regeneration in the 
absence of disturbance; both seedlings and sprouts may occur on disturbed sites. 
Origin of excavated plains silver sagebrush plants in Montana was approximately 
37% from seed (no connecting rhizomes) and 63% from sprouts (plants connected by 
rhizomes). An excavated colony consisted of 15 individuals, all connected by
a rhizome running within 2 inches (5 cm) of the soil surface. Each plant  had its own root system.
Soil texture may affect ability to clone: the only sites where
plants established from seed outnumbered those originating from rhizomes were
those with very
gravelly or very clayey soils [<a href="#71">71</a>]. Similarly, another Montana study of
plains silver sagebrush regeneration found plants started from seed  outnumbered cloned plants 
only on sites with clay pans underlaid with gravel. Typical rates of
establishment were 1/3rd from seed and 2/3rds from cloning [<a href="#187">187</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harvey [<a href="#71">71</a>] found layering was an important means of regeneration for silver 
sagebrush in eroded gullies. Stems that
had been buried in silt by periodic floods were producing adventitious roots
and sprouting; rhizomes were also producing sprouts.</p>

<p>Sprouting from the root crown is less frequently reported in the literature
than sprouting from roots or rhizomes, but root crown sprouting may be an important adaptive response to
drought and browsing. Approximately 3/5ths of the plains silver sagebrush plants on an eastern
Montana site gradually died back to the root crown during the severe drought of the
early1930s,
sprouting back from the root crown in the spring of 1935. The remaining 2/5ths did not
recover [<a href="#47">47</a>]. In a study of the response of native shrubs to
pruning (a surrogate for browsing), silver sagebrush responded to annual pruning
to a height of 0.5 foot (0.2 m ) by &quot;vigorous&quot; sprouting from the root
crown. The sprouts grew quickly: after 3 years of treatment, there was no
difference in mean height between pruned and unpruned silver sagebrush plants
(3 feet (0.9 m)), although crown area was significantly less in pruned vs. unpruned
plants (03.2 vs. 42.4 ft<sup>2</sup> (2.81 vs. 3.91 m<sup>2)</sup>, respectively; p = 0.05). [<a href="#152">152</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Hybrids:</b></font> 
Silver sagebrush hybrids may
inherit  ability to sprout and layer [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>]. For example, a natural mountain silver sagebrush ×

Silver sagebrush  requires more moisture than most sagebrush species, growing in
areas that receive <u>&gt;</u> 10 inches (250 mm) mean annual precipitation and have
a water table within 3 feet (1 m) of the soil surface [<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>]. 
For example, a Bolander silver sagebrush/Sandberg bluegrass community in Plumas
County, California, occurred on streamside soils with a mean July moisture
content of 36% and a mean water table depth of 47.6 inches (121 cm) [<a href="#173">173</a>]. Because
it requires moist soils, silver
sagebrush typically grows on the edges of
streambanks and drainages and on floodplains, bottomlands, and moist meadows [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#190">190</a>,<a href="#190">190</a>].

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Soils:</font></b> Silver sagebrush occupies moister, 
colder soils than any other woody sagebrush species in North America [<a href="#193">193</a>]. Soil 
drainage is often slow. Silver sagebrush communities are also common on 
transitional wet-to-dryland sites [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>] where soils dry by late summer. A 
mountain silver sagebrush/tufted hairgrass community in Yellowstone National 
Park was described as &quot;the driest wetland community type&quot; within the Park [<a href="#24">24</a>]. 
Phosphorus, potassium, nitrogen, organic matter, and cation exchange capacity 
are often lower in silver sagebrush soils than in soils of
surrounding communities. Silver sagebrush cannot tolerate strongly saline or calcareous
soils [<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>]. Soil pH ranges from slightly acidic to
strongly alkaline (6.0-8.5)
[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>]. Parent materials of soils 
supporting silver sagebrush include sandstones, shales, and granites [<a href="#130">130</a>]; 
soil textures include clay, silt, loam, sand, and gravel [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#187">187</a>]. Silver sagebrush in
Wyoming occurred on shallow to deep soil profiles, being most common (9/14
sites) in deep soils (depths of <u>&gt;</u> 3 feet (1 m)) [<a href="#176">176</a>]. Best growth occurs on well-drained,
coarse-textured, alluvial soils that are moist in the upper 6 inches (20 cm) of
the soil profile [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>].</p>

<p> <font face="Bell MT"><b>Elevation:</b></font> Silver sagebrush's overall elevational range is from 5,000 to nearly 
11,000 feet 
(2,000-3,000 m) elevation
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#198">198</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Subspecies:</b></font><br>
Bolander silver sagebrush is most common on pluvial lakebeds, internally drained 
basins with alkaline soils, and in snow catchments with granitic soils 
[<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#163">163</a>,<a href="#203">203</a>]. It also grows on 
meadows, streambanks, and moist, gravelly soils 
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>]. It is the only sagebrush in North America 
that can tolerate temporary inundation [<a href="#182">182</a>]. Bolander silver 
sagebrush occurs from 4,400 to 11,000 feet (1,300-3,400 m) elevation [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>]. In the Ochoco
Mountains, it occurs on the margins of mid-elevation meadows (4,400-5,600 ft. 
(1,300-1,700 m))
and on lower-elevation, inactive floodplains [<a href="#98">98</a>]. It occurs from 5,000 to 9,600 feet 
(1,500-2,900 m) elevation in Nevada [<a href="#93">93</a>].</p>

<p>Plains silver sagebrush occurs on low hillsides, riparian zones, and in valleys.
Ranging from 4,000 to 7,000 feet (1,000-2,000 m) elevation, it is
most common below 5,000 feet (1,550 m) on moist, sandy soil bordering prairie creeks,
ephemeral water courses, and the bottoms of
eroded hills [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#168">168</a>]. Topography is usually flat to gently
sloping [<a href="#127">127</a>]. Scattered plants may occur on upland sites [<a href="#14">14</a>].</p>

<p>Mountain silver sagebrush is most common on mountain meadows, stream
terraces, basins, and areas of heavy winter snowpack throughout its distribution. It is occasionally
found on moist upland slopes [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#191">191</a>].&nbsp; In the Southwest it is most 
common in the mountains but also occurs on plains and in valleys [<a href="#111">111</a>]. Mountain silver sagebrush is common on limestone-derived
soils [<a href="#163">163</a>]. It occurs from 6,000 to 10,000 feet (2,100-3,050 m)
elevation across its range [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#191">191</a>]. Ranges for mountain

Silver sagebrush occurs in early to late stages of succession [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>].
Reed [<a href="#143">143</a>] reported mountain silver sagebrush invading abandoned
hayfields in the Jackson Hole Wildlife Park of Wyoming. These silver  sagebrush steppes were sometimes stable, and 
sometimes succeeded
to quaking aspen. Silver sagebrush prefers open sites, and is intolerant of all but light shade [<a href="#189">189</a>]. 
It grows on newly exposed soils and can survive fire, browsing, and short 
periods of flooding disturbance [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>]. 
Researchers in
Montana have documented a riparian sere on the Yellowstone River that begins on bare, disturbed sandbars, progresses 
through development of plains
cottonwood/sandbar willow (<i>Salix exigua</i>) gallery to a Wood's rose-western snowberry 
(<i>Rosa woodsii-Symphoricarpos occidentalis</i>) shrubland 
stage as trees age and die out,
and climaxes in a plains silver sagebrush-western wheatgrass-prairie sandreed
steppe [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]. Hansen and others [<a href="#67">67</a>] suggest this riverside plains silver
sagebrush steppe may be a zootic disclimax induced by cattle overbrowsing the riparian zone. Nelson [<a href="#127">127</a>] noted 
a different successional trajectory in the Badlands
of North Dakota. There was no evidence of shrubland and climax steppe vegetation 
phases after tree death; instead, plains silver sagebrush invaded open plains cottonwood (<i>Populus
deltoides</i> ssp. <i>monilifera</i>) galleries, sometimes dominating the 
understory.


<p>Silver sagebrush may invade overgrazed mountain meadows [<a href="#142">142</a>]. 
Silver sagebrush steppes of Utah occur on mountain rangelands disturbed by heavy 
grazing; the steppes are usually codominated by herbaceous invaders. In the 
absence of disturbance, the silver sagebrush steppes progress to stable, 
late-successional seres codominated by bunchgrasses [<a href="#131">131</a>]. </p>


<p>Jakubos and Romme [<a href="#"></a>] noted invasion of Rocky Mountain
lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i> var. <i>latifolia</i>) into big sagebrush-silver sagebrush/sedge meadows in Yellowstone
National Park. The authors attributed the tree invasion to a trend towards
warmer climate since the late 1880s.</p>


<span class="subframeName">

SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:</a>

<br />

Although classified as evergreen, silver sagebrush sheds many of its leaves in winter [<a href="#75">75</a>], 
retaining a few
until spring regrowth [<a href="#168">168</a>]. Leaves may drop early in response to drought [<a href="#47">47</a>]. 
Seedlings emerge and new growth of older plants starts from March to June, depending upon 
latitude and elevation [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>]. In southern Montana, established plants initiate growth in
late March, with seedlings emerging
from mid-April to mid-June [<a href="#71">71</a>]. Flowering occurs in
July and August in California and Oregon [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>], from July through September in 
New Mexico [<a href="#111">111</a>], and in August and
September in the Great Basin, northern Great Plains, and the interior Pacific 
Northwest [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>].
The tomentum tends to thin around flowering time [<a href="#38">38</a>]. Seed dispersal is 
prolonged from early fall through the following spring [<a href="#148">148</a>]. Fruit and seed
disperse as a unit, with most seed shattering from September
through November [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>]. Some fruits are retained on the parent 
plant until winter or spring [<a href="#148">148</a>].<p>Phenology of plains silver sagebrush on 6 sites across southern Montana was

FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font> 
 Silver sagebrush has a strong sprouting response after top-kill by fire [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#199">199</a>,<a href="#200">200</a>]. 
Because it possesses several organs capable of regeneration, including roots and rhizomes that are protected by soil, it is not as susceptible to fire mortality as most woody sagebrush species [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>,<a href="#187">187</a>].

<p>Although sprouting is silver sagebrush's primary method of postfire
regeneration, some seedling establishment can occur if early postfire years are favorably wet during the growing season [<a href="#187">187</a>]. 
Time required for postfire sprouts to begin seed production is undocumented, but given silver 
sagebrush's rapid rate of sprout growth [<a href="#152">152</a>], sprouting stems 
probably fruit and seed within 2 or 3 postfire years. Seeds produced from 
postfire sprouts 
are the most likely sources of  seedling establishment, but wind, water, 
and animal transport of seed onto burns may also contribute to postfire seedling 
establishment [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>,<a href="#187">187</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Fuels:</font> Occupying bottomlands and other areas that
are wetter than surrounding vegetation, silver sagebrush communities
often have heavier litter and vertical fuel loads than surrounding plant 
communities [<a href="#132">132</a>,<a href="#177">177</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>].
Fires tend to carry into and spread in silver sagebrush unless the community has
been overgrazed [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>]. Heavy litter build-up tends to decrease 
rhizomatous sprouting in silver sagebrush colonies, while removal of the litter 
by fire or other means encourages silver sagebrush sprouting and colonial 
expansion [<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#187">187</a>].
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font> Silver sagebrush steppes 
experience stand-replacement fires [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>,<a href="#195">195</a>]. 
Fire frequencies are uncertain: fire histories for silver sagebrush communities are sparse to altogether 
lacking. Since plant productivity and community structure vary across the species' 
wide geographical distribution [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>], historic fire  intervals were 
probably similarly varied.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Bolander silver sagebrush: </font>As of this writing 
(2002), there are no published fire history studies on Bolander silver sagebrush 
communities. Bolander silver sagebrush grows on sites with widely varying 
characteristics, including fuel loads. Fire was probably rare in <font face="Bell MT">
Bolander silver sagebrush </font>communities on alkali sinks in the rain shadow of 
the Sierra Nevada, and  frequent on
<font face="Bell MT">Bolander silver sagebrush </font>meadows of the Ochoco and 
Blue mountains. Since even plant community composition, structure, and 
production are poorly described in the literature, a great deal of research is needed to 
understand fire effects and historic fire regimes for Bolander silver sagebrush 
communities. Fire and rangeland managers with experience in this type are 
encouraged to share their findings with Fire Effects Information System staff.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Plains silver sagebrush:</font> Fire history studies of 
plains silver sagebrush-grama-needlegrass steppes of the northern Great Plains 
are based on  historic records and
tree fire scars obtained from adjacent, coniferous communities and a few lone, 
on-site conifers. These studies suggest that stand-replacement fires occurred frequently in 
plains silver sagebrush steppes. Wright and Bailey
[<a href="#199">199</a>] estimated fire frequencies of 5 to 10 years on rolling-to-level topography, 
where plains silver sagebrush mostly occurs as widely scattered plants in a 
landscape dominated by mixed grasses [<a href="#71">71</a>]. On topography dissected with breaks and rivers, 
where silver sagebrush is most common, they estimated fire 
return intervals of 20 to 30 years. Other researchers report similar fire 
return intervals for plains grassland steppes [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#192">192</a>]. For example,&nbsp;fire 
return intervals range from 16 to 47+ years in relict western wheatgrass-green 
needlegrass-plains silver sagebrush communities of western 
North Dakota [<a href="#137">137</a>].
</p>

<p>Most plains grassland fires historically occurred in summer or fall, with 
lightning and human ignition sources. Lightning-caused ignitions were most common in July and August. Sieg [<a href="#165">165</a>] 
suggests that for the northern Great Plains, the natural fire regime of low 
draws that were vegetated with sprouting species such as silver sagebrush was 
mostly late-growing-season fire, ignited after fine fuels had cured and dried. 
Late-season fires were probably &quot;intense,&quot; but because natural fires also 
occurred in other seasons, the overall fire regime was highly variable.&nbsp; 
Native Americans traditionally set fires throughout the year, although April, 
September, and October were their peak ignition times [<a href="#76">76</a>]. 
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Mountain silver sagebrush:</font> The cool, moist 
montane sites supporting mountain silver sagebrush can be highly productive, 
with graminoids providing ample flashy fuels to carry fire [<a href="#197">197</a>]. Fire 
ecologists estimate frequent stand-replacement fires in this type, with mean 
fire return intervals ranging from 3 to 45+ years [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>]. Houston [<a href="#84">84</a>] 
estimated on Snake River Plains of Idaho, fires probably cycled about every 25 
years in the wetter areas favored by mountain silver sagebrush.</p>

<p>The following table provides some fire regime intervals for plant communities 
and ecosystems where silver sagebrush is a dominant or important component of 
the vegetation. For further information on these fire regimes, see the FEIS species summaries on the community and ecosystem 
dominants listed below.</p>

Surface fire top-kills silver sagebrush [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>,<a href="#195">195</a>]. 
Because perennating buds on  rhizomes and roots are protected by soil, silver sagebrush
ordinarily survives even severe surface fire [<a href="#98">98</a>]. Fuel loads in most silver sagebrush communities are 
usually sufficient to ensure 
a high rate of top-kill. The foliage is moderately flammable, and silver 
sagebrush litter is highly
flammable when dry [<a href="#124">124</a>]. Fires usually spread in silver sagebrush
communities during dry seasons [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#200">200</a>].

Fall burning under dry conditions may result in greater mortality compared to spring burning 
due to internal water stress of silver sagebrush plants [<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#195">195</a>].
The <a href="fire_case_studies.html">Fire Case Studies</a> section of this report summarizes a study on seasonal
differences in fire effects on silver sagebrush.

<p>Ground fires are rarely reported in silver sagebrush steppes; however, in
Saskatchewan, Rowe [<a href="#151">151</a>] noted a September, lightning-ignited ground fire in a silver
sagebrush/green needlegrass-blue grama-western wheatgrass association. In some 
spots, the fire burned into the taproots of silver sagebrush plants and killed them.

PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:</a>

<br />

Silver sagebrush has the strongest sprouting response of any woody sagebrush 
species in North America [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#199">199</a>]. It sprouts from the root 
crown [<a href="#134">134</a>], rhizomes 
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#187">187</a>], and 
roots [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>] after 
top-kill by fire [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#198">198</a>,<a href="#200">200</a>]. Because of its strong 
postfire sprouting response, fire
on a 5 to 20-year rotation promotes silver sagebrush [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#187">187</a>]. It can return to or exceed canopy coverage 
in 4 to
6 postfire years [<a href="#198">198</a>]. For example, fall prescribed burning of a  Bolander silver sagebrush/Baltic 
rush wet meadow in Inyo National
Forest, California, produced no significant change in postfire silver sagebrush
cover (measured for 4 postfire years) compared to prefire cover [<a href="#70">70</a>]. Dry 
weather and fuel conditions before fire can reduce the number of sprouts silver 
sagebrush produces after fire [<a href="#195">195</a>]. Very frequent fire tends to 
favor associated bunchgrasses over silver sagebrush [<a href="#98">98</a>].

<p>Silver sagebrush requires an open, disturbed seedbed [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>], and fire may 
prepare a favorable site for seedling establishment. In eastern Montana, plains 
silver sagebrush seedling establishment has been documented on sites disturbed 
by fire or ice scouring. Rhizome sprouting was more common, however 
(approximately 1 seedling per 3 sprouts) [<a href="#187">187</a>]. In a rehabilitation study using 
artificial regeneration, mixed sagebrush
steppe in Wyoming was treated to control invading Utah juniper (<i>Juniperus osteosperma</i>). 
Control methods included herbicide (picloram) application, bulldozing, tree 
harvest, and a fortuitous wildfire. After the treatments and the wildfire, 
native species including silver, big, and black (<i>Artemisia nova</i>) sagebrush were seeded in, with 
time of seeding (spring vs. fall) and seeding method (furrow&nbsp;vs. broadcast 
seeding) evaluated. All sagebrush species
established best on burned plots compared to unburned plots; fall planting and
broadcasting also favored the sagebrushes compared to spring seeding and
furrowing [<a href="#53">53</a>]. </p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Hybrids:</b></font> Silver sagebrush hybrids may 
inherit the ability to sprout after fire and other top-killing events. Silver 
sagebrush × mountain big sagebrush and silver sagebrush × threetip sagebrush hybrids both sprout after fire [<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>]. Inadequately
studied, postfire sprouting response of silver × threetip sagebrush hybrids is probably strong
because each parent has  genetic ability to sprout. Silver and threetip sagebrushes were once assumed
to be closely related due to common sprouting ability [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>]; however, 
DNA-based phylogenetic studies show a close genetic relationship among black
sagebrush, low sagebrush, and silver sagebrush infrataxa (the silver sagebrush lineage)&nbsp; 
[<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>], and a more distant genetic 
relationship between the silver sagebrush lineage and the big sagebrush lineage 
(which includes threetip sagebrush and big
sagebrush infrataxa) [<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>]. Studies on
the sprouting ability of silver, black, and low sagebrush combinations are
lacking, but such studies might provide insight into the genetic basis for sprouting
in woody sagebrushes and ultimately, produce woody sagebrush plants that can 
survive on sites where exotic annual grasses have altered fire regimes. Sprouting, drought-tolerant sagebrush hybrids may
be useful in rehabilitating sagebrush rangelands that have converted to annual 
grasslands dominated by cheatgrass or medusahead (<i>Taeniatherum caput-medusae)
</i>after repeated, short-interval 
fires. Big and threetip sagebrush seedlings are more drought 
tolerant than silver sagebrush seedlings. Crosses among silver, big, and threetip sagebrush may
produce sprouting plants that can survive on dry sites prone to reburns [<a href="#112">112</a>]. McArthur 
and others [<a href="#115">115</a>] have produced a plains silver sagebrush × Wyoming big sagebrush 
hybrid with apparently fertile seed. </p>

A late summer wildfire promoted plains silver sagebrush on an Alberta western 
wheatgrass-blue grama prairie. The grassland, used as a cattle range, was in 
excellent condition prior to the wildfire. Three successive years of drought 
followed the wildfire, and cattle were allowed free access to burned and 
unburned portions of the range. Stocking rate was 
0.64 <a href="../../../glossary.html#ANIMAL-UNIT MONTH (AUM):">AUM</a>/ha. Plains silver 
sagebrush was the most common shrub in the postfire plant community, and its 
biomass was greater on burned than on unburned plots on both upland and 
bottomland sites [<a href="#48">48</a>].<br>

<p>Fire also favored silver sagebrush on the Grand Mesa National Forest,
Colorado. A Gambel oak/common snowberry-Saskatoon serviceberry community (<i>Quercus 
gambelii/Symphoricarpos albus-Amelanchier alnifolia</i>) was
prescribed burned, sprayed, and/or chained to reduce density and height of  big game and cattle 
browse. Production of silver sagebrush (kg/ha) before
and after treatments is given below [<a href="#102">102</a>].</p>

Beetle and Johnson [<a href="#14">14</a>] recommend prescribed fire to increase silver sagebrush
density on rangelands. Blaisdell and others [<a href="#17">17</a>] provide general guidelines for
burning in sagebrush-grasslands.<br><br>

A variety of fire treatments may be needed to mimic historic fire regimes. 
Because the fire regime of the northern Great Plains was highly variable, Sieg
[<a href="#165">165</a>] recommends  varying fire intensities and seasons, including use of mid-summer 
fire,
to restore natural disturbance patterns. Howe [<a href="#87">87</a>] stated &quot;the strategy
should avoid a uniformity of timing of burns or in intervals between burns that
artificially simplifies what was probably a more complex system.&quot;

Spring burning was conducted in mid-April of 1977, shortly after spring run-off. 
Soil moisture was near field capacity. A headfire was used.

<p>Fall burning was 
conducted in early October of 1979, after summer drought &quot;substantially reduced soil moisture 
throughout the soil profile.&quot; A backfire was used.</p>


<p>Fuel loadings and weather conditions were similar on the spring- and 
fall-burned sites. Fuel loads ranged from 300 kg/ha pm plains silver 
sagebrush/blue grama sites to more than 1,000 kg/ha on plains silver 
sagebrush/western wheatgrass sites. Temperature averaged 21 <sup>o</sup>C and wind speed was less than 8 km/hr. </p>

Plant measurements were taken the July after burning (n=210 plants). Fire 
effects were classified in 3 progressively severe groups: foliage consumed; 
foliage and twigs consumed with main stems remaining; and entire plant burned to 
the root crown (top-kill). Silver sagebrush survivorship, number of sprouts, height of 
sprouts at plant center, and an index of canopy cover* were measured. Mean annual 
precipitation was below normal throughout the study period.<br>
<font size="1">*Model based upon linear intercept of foliage as measured on 
major and minor plant axes of the plant's elliptical area</font>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Immediate fire effect:</font></b> The fires 
accomplished partial to complete top-kill as described in the severity groups 
above. Silver sagebrush mortality was dependent upon fire severity and season. 
The spring fire killed approximately 1/3rd of the plants that were completely 
burned. Plants that were not completely top-killed sustained mortalities of less 
than 10%. The fall fire killed about 3/4ths of the completely burned plants, 
with 40% mortality of incompletely consumed plants. Mortality differences were 
highly significant (p&lt;0.01) between seasons.</p>

<b><font face="Bell MT">Plant response to fire:</font></b> Prefire plant size 
had no significant effect (p &lt; 0.05) on either fire survival or postfire growth. 
Severe fire  reduced height growth of postfire sprouts 
on top-killed plants compared to fires that only partially consumed plants. Plants that had only 
foliage removed tended to sprout more quickly than those also losing branches. 
Spring burning resulted in plants with relatively fewer sprouts, superior height 
growth, and greater canopy indices&nbsp; compared to fall burning. For 
spring-burned silver sagebrush, height growth by the next July was <u>&gt;</u> 20 cm for top-killed 
plants, and <u>&gt;</u> 30 cm for partially consumed plants. Canopy indices* 
(see above) were &gt; 
350 mm. For the fall burns, incompletely burned plants usually had &gt; 10 sprouts 
per plant, and the sprouts were &lt; 20 cm in height by the next July. Top-killed 
plants averaged 4 sprouts per plant, with sprouts &lt; 4 cm in height by the next 
July. Mortality and postfire growth data are given below.

Prescribed burning can be used to alter silver sagebrush communities. Burning 
under favorable spring moisture conditions, before silver sagebrush stem elongation occurs, results 
in relatively low silver sagebrush mortality and vigorous postfire sprouting. In 
this study, silver sagebrush cover was nearly back to prefire levels the 1st growing season after 
the spring fire. Burning in fall, just before onset of dormancy, results in 
relatively high mortality, less vigorous sprouting, and reduced canopy cover.

IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Silver sagebrush  provides valuable habitat and forage for wildlife. Deer, elk, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, and sage-grouse
browse the foliage [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#198">198</a>].&nbsp;Voles (<i>Microtus</i> spp.) feed
on silver sagebrush roots and rhizomes [<a href="#186">186</a>]. On the Great Plains,<b> </b>
browsing ungulates<b> </b>generally make little use of silver sagebrush foliage 
in summer [<a href="#14">14</a>], but use plains silver 
sagebrush habitats all year due to their relatively mesic conditions. Bison and 
mule deer, for example, make heavy year-round use of use of plains silver 
sagebrush/western wheatgrass steppes of Theodore Roosevelt National Park, North
Dakota [<a href="#65">65</a>]. Mule deer may browse silver sagebrush heavily when other 
forage is dormant [<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>]. 
 
Silver sagebrush is 
also important on fall and winter
ranges
[<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#171">171</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>]. Bolander silver sagebrush/bottlebrush squirreltail (<i>Elymus elymoides</i>) 
communities were rated as highest-use areas for mule deer on the Silver 
Lake-Fort Rock winter range of Lake County, Oregon, from November through May 
[<a href="#106">106</a>]. On the Missouri River Breaks of Montana, Rocky Mountain mule deer 
made greatest use of silver sagebrush in winter; it was a minor component of 
their  spring and fall diets. Silver sagebrush on the Missouri River Breaks composed 
33% total volume of&nbsp; elk rumens (n=12) from  fall samples; however, it was 
only present in trace amounts in samples from a preceding year. It was not found 
in rumen samples from cattle [<a href="#108">108</a>].

<p>In regions with dry summers, livestock and wildlife may browse silver
sagebrush when upland
vegetation has already dried. In Modoc
County of northeastern California, Bolander silver sagebrush communities were preferred
summer-use areas for pronghorn, feral horses, and cattle [<a href="#153">153</a>].&nbsp;Although a 
common staple for wildlife, livestock use of silver sagebrush is 
variable depending upon
availability of palatable herbs [<a href="#186">186</a>]. Domestic sheep generally browse silver 
sagebrush more heavily than cattle [<a href="#14">14</a>]. Cattle may prefer grazing in silver
sagebrush steppes, however, because their relatively mesic soils promotes 
heavier grass cover than in adjacent communities, especially in summer [<a href="#95">95</a>]. 
Livestock may actually make greater use of silver sagebrush when there is ample 
grass to go with it [<a href="#198">198</a>]. </p>

<p>Silver sagebrush steppes are important habitat for wildlife. For example, 
they are the 2nd-most used habitat for sharp-tailed grouse in eastern Montana; 
the birds used only upland western wheatgrass-blue grama grassland habitats more than 
plains silver sagebrush steppes [<a href="#174">174</a>]. Silver sagebrush communities also provide 
important corridors for wildlife traveling from riparian zones to forested or 
grassland communities [<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>]. 
Three wildlife species, pronghorn, sage-grouse, and a native grasshopper, 
sometimes rely on silver sagebrush steppes as their primary habitat, and on 
silver sagebrush browse as their primary forage.</p>

<p>Silver sagebrush is used as an indicator species in pronghorn habitat 
suitability index models [<a href="#3">3</a>].&nbsp;It provides winter maintenance and emergency forage  [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#172">172</a>]. Pronghorn also use silver sagebrush in the fall,
particularly when vegetation on less mesic sites has  dried
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>]. For example, stomach samples of pronghorn taken during
hunting season (Sept.-Oct.) in southeastern Montana were primarily sagebrush
(plains silver and big sagebrush); several samples contained no other forage [<a href="#34">34</a>].
Pronghorn in Saskatchewan were concentrated on fall rangelands where plains silver
sagebrush and creeping juniper (<i>Juniperus horizontalis</i>) were available  [<a href="#43">43</a>].  
  
Heavy livestock grazing can degrade silver sagebrush 
habitat conditions for pronghorn [<a href="#66">66</a>].

Fires that top-kill large patches of silver sagebrush can adversely affect
pronghorn habitat [<a href="#9">9</a>] until sprouts have attained a few years'
growth. </p>

<p> When plentiful, silver sagebrush is important in the diet of
sage-grouse [<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#140">140</a>]. Where it is the primary sagebrush 
cover, silver sagebrush communities are critical sage-grouse habitat [<a href="#1">1</a>].
Crop analysis of adult sage-grouse in White Pine County,
Nevada, showed the birds were consuming almost nothing but mountain
silver sagebrush [<a href="#59">59</a>]. Sage-grouse populations at the northern and eastern
boundaries of the bird's distribution are most likely to be ecologically
dependant on silver sagebrush [<a href="#23">23</a>]. Sage-grouse in southeastern Alberta -- where
other woody

almost exclusively, and silver sagebrush is their primary diet item [<a href="#1">1</a>].
</p>

<p>Silver or sand sagebrush are the primary diet items of the sagebrush
grasshopper (<i>Melanoplus bowditchi</i>). A North Dakota study showed crop 
contents of sagebrush grasshoppers were 97% silver sagebrush. High densities of 
sagebrush grasshoppers have never been recorded, suggesting few economic impacts 
and little damage to silver sagebrush populations are caused by the insect. 
However, little is known of the ecology and life history of sagebrush 
grasshopper, and further studies are needed to assess the ecological and 
economic impacts of the grasshopper [<a href="#135">135</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Palatability:</b></font> Silver sagebrush is 1 of the 
more palatable and nutritious sagebrush species [<a href="#181">181</a>,<a href="#198">198</a>]. With a mean of 11%, winter (Jan.-March) crude protein content of Bolander
silver sagebrush on the Fort Rock-Silver Lake winter mule deer range in central 
Oregon exceeded that of either low or big sagebrush [<a href="#181">181</a>]. Mule deer, fed 7 
sagebrush taxa collected from the Silver Lake Range in fall and winter, showed 
highest relative preference* for Bolander silver, low, and mountain big 
sagebrush in both fall and winter feeding trials. Domestic sheep showed moderate 
preference (browsed but did not prefer) for Bolander silver and mountain 
big sagebrush in fall, and showed highest preference for Bolander silver, low, and 
mountain big sagebrush in winter. Area of collection did not affect the animals' choices,
while taxa consistently did [<a href="#161">161</a>].<br>

<p> Walton [<a href="#186">186</a>] has ranked Bolander, mountain, and plains silver sagebrush as most to least

<p>Based upon nutritional content (protein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamin, and
mineral ), palatability, and dependability of supply on rangelands, silver
sagebrush is rated low to fair forage for cattle, fair to good for domestic sheep, 
and good for pronghorn, elk, and deer [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Cover value:</font></b> 
 Silver sagebrush provides thermal and hiding cover for small mammals,  small nongame birds, 
and game birds [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].
At the lower end of its elevational
range, it provides important sage-grouse nesting cover  [<a href="#198">198</a>].</p>

<br />

Silver sagebrush has potential as a soil stabilizer and for use in rangeland, 
wildlife, and riparian restoration projects [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#136">136</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>,<a href="#198">198</a>]. 
It is established from seed,
containerized stock, and nursery-grown cuttings [<a href="#136">136</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>]. 
Due to the species' strong tendency to layer, stem cuttings root easily [<a href="#71">71</a>]. Transplants have shown good growth on favorably moist sites. Plains
silver sagebrush cuttings, used as part of an upland game bird habitat
improvement project on the Snake River Plain of southern Idaho, showed 95%
survival and good growth 5 years after transplanting [<a href="#160">160</a>]. Silver
sagebrush also regenerates when seeded on moist sites, and is
recommended for inclusion in range seeding mixtures. Seeding-in is not recommended
on dry sites [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#136">136</a>,<a href="#198">198</a>]; however, silver sagebrush
seed can germinate on soils with low water potentials due to dissolved salts
[<a href="#45">45</a>]. Spring sowing is recommended
[<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>]. The seed is commercially available [<a href="#138">138</a>].

<p>Rehabilitation projects  show variability in silver sagebrush's 
ability to establish on coal mine spoils. In southern
Montana, silver sagebrush sown on coal mine spoils showed poor survivorship and seedling growth compared to 
germinants on unmined plots [<a href="#71">71</a>]. However, silver sagebrush cuttings 
transplanted on coal mine sites in Wyoming and Colorado showed good to excellent
survivorship in their 1st year. Transplants on 2 Wyoming sites treated with
topsoil showed 100% survivorship. In Colorado, transplants showed 50%
survivorship on sites treated with topsoil and 100% survivorship on untreated
coal mine spoils. Neither the Wyoming nor the Colorado coal mine sites were
irrigated after transplanting [<a href="#86">86</a>]. Poor results on some sites may be 
due to toxic soil contaminants and/or dry soils. Further information is needed 
on ability of silver sagebrush to establish on contaminated soils.</p>

<p>Information on seed collection, processing, storage, and planting is 
available for silver sagebrush [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>].</p>

<a name="OTHER USES">
OTHER USES:</a>
</span>
<br />

Native Americans of the northern Rocky Mountains used a decoction of silver
sagebrush leaves as a general tonic, and chewed the  leaves to quench thirst.
Blackfoot and Lakota used silver sagebrush as winter horse browse, and
considered it the best sagebrush  browse available for big game species. Tribes
of the Great Basin used silver sagebrush branches as a fuelbed for roasting
pinyon (<i>Cembra</i>) pinecones [<a href="#123">123</a>]. Many tribes use the branches in
ceremonial rites [<a href="#56">56</a>].

<p>Silver sagebrush is listed as a  heat and drought tolerant plant
suitable for xeriscaping [<a href="#60">60</a>]. Since young plants are not drought tolerant [<a href="#186">186</a>,<a href="#187">187</a>], 
generous dry-season irrigation is probably warranted for their 1st few years 
until 
plants establish a deep root system.</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Rangelands:</b></font>  Occupying mesic to moist sites with good graminoid
coverage, silver sagebrush communities are often highly productive. A plains silver sagebrush/western wheatgrass 
community in Theodore Roosevelt
National Park, North Dakota, averaged 85% grass and 9% forb coverage
[<a href="#65">65</a>]. Dry mass
production of herbs may reach 2,000 lbs/acre [<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#197">197</a>]. Silver sagebrush tends to increase at the 
expense of grasses
on overgrazed rangelands [<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>,<a href="#171">171</a>]. Due to its 
palatability, however, it too can be
overused [<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#171">171</a>]. In eastern Montana, a plains
silver sagebrush riparian community with a long-term history of year-round
cattle grazing was changed to a rest-rotation grazing system. Seventeen years
later, silver sagebrush cover had significantly increased (p&gt;0.01) from 10 to
85%. The authors attributed the increase to a combination of increased
precipitation and decreased browsing pressure [<a href="#22">22</a>].
Smoliak and
others [<a href="#167">167</a>] recommend
that no more than 40% of&nbsp; silver sagebrush's annual production be browsed in order to
maintain silver sagebrush health and productivity. Winward [<a href="#198">198</a>] gives the following recommendations for managing
silver and other sagebrush rangelands:

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Times New Roman">Because sagebrush
      retains its leaves throughout the year, it is capable of photosynthesizing
      any time the temperature is above freezing. This gives it a tremendous
      advantage over other species that lose their leaves during winter months.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Times New Roman">There is no one good time to measure sagebrush production because there is a gradual,
      continuous leaf drop and they continue to grow leaves, stems, and seeds
      throughout the year.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Times New Roman">The greatest
      canopy cover of sagebrush occurs in the absence of fire and with high
      levels of grazing.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Times New Roman">If your primary
      purpose in treating sagebrush is to improve ecological conditions (rather
      than simply increasing forage production for livestock grazing), then
      
      longer periods of rest are required than what we have tended to do
      (closer to 3-4 years than to 2 years).</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Times New Roman">Once plants become
      established and canopy cover is maximized, succession will not be reversed until
      the area is either burned or there is a natural disease outbreak (or it is
      severely overgrazed)</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Times New Roman">Variations in soil
      characteristics result in variations in potential sagebrush density and
      canopy cover.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Times New Roman">Approximately 
    20-25% of any given landscape may not burn naturally because of natural 
    barriers such as rocky soils. Treating about 1-3% of the
      remaining 75% is about right in order to reach a desirable mix of
      age classes in sagebrush.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Times New Roman">It is probably
      better to have more small patches when treating sagebrush, than fewer
      large patches, but total acres treated in any one geographic area should
      be large enough to sustain foraging animals after treatments.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Times New Roman">Soils dry up at
      least one month earlier under dense canopy cover of sagebrush (and
      juniper). Conversely, there is at least 1 more month of green-up of
      associated herbaceous species that can occur under open sagebrush
      canopies.</font></li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>Cunningham [<a href="#39">39</a>] found that productivity of silver sagebrush in northwestern
Colorado was negatively correlated (r=-0.52, p<u>&lt;</u>0.01) with productivity of associated graminoids; forbs were not correlated with silver sagebrush growth. Presence of extractable
magnesium in the 12- to 24-inch (30-60 cm) soil layer increased silver sagebrush
productivity (r=0.47, p<u>&lt;</u>0.05), as did rock and gravel in the soil profile (r=0.25, 
p<u>&lt;</u>0.05). A
high percentage of sand in the 12- to 24-inch soil layer negatively affected
growth (r=-0.15, p<u>&lt;</u>0.01). Harvey [<a href="#71">71</a>] provides a model for predicting silver sagebrush productivity
based upon leaf and woody tissue measurements.</p>

<p>Silver sagebrush may allelopathically inhibit germination of some herbaceous 
species, as well as its own seed. Aqueous extracts of silver sagebrush leaves 
reduced germination of 6 mixed-grass species, including silver sagebrush.
Laboratory results using extracts do not necessarily indicate allelopathy under
field conditions; however, a field study of plant species distributional
patterns in western North Dakota suggests that some forb species are more likely to
associate beneath or&nbsp;nearby silver sagebrush canopies. Other
species, especially bunchgrasses, tend to segregate away from silver sagebrush [<a href="#73">73</a>].
Possible allelopathy of silver sagebrush, and its effects on plant community
composition and structure, need further investigation.</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Control:</font></b> Since silver sagebrush provides important wildlife forage and cover, 
controlling it is not
generally recommended [<a href="#134">134</a>,<a href="#198">198</a>]. Silver sagebrush can obtain nearly 
  closed cover on some sites [<a href="#69">69</a>], however, and control may be desired if silver
  sagebrush is so dense that it is excluding perennial grasses.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Chemical:</font> Silver sagebrush can be controlled
with 2,4-D or picloram [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>,<a href="#194">194</a>]; 2-,4-D is most effective
  [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#196">196</a>]. Follow-up
spraying may be necessary to control sprouts [<a href="#33">33</a>].&nbsp;Mechanical 
controls such as plowing, disking,
  and chaining are not recommended for mature plants because they are likely to 
promote sprouting [<a href="#134">134</a>]. They may be effective for young plants. White and
  Currie [<a href="#194">194</a>] obtained up to 67% control by plowing silver sagebrush less
  than 1 m<sup>3</sup> in size.</p>

<font face="Bell MT">Fire:</font> A single application of prescribed fire is not
  recommended for control, as it is likely to promote sprouting [<a href="#134">134</a>].
  Used in sequence, prescribed fire and herbicides may reduce silver sagebrush
  to desired levels. Using various combinations and rates of herbicides, Whitson
  and others [<a href="#196">196</a>] obtained a range of 8-91% control with fall prescribed fire
  followed by July application of herbicides to sprouts. Frequent reburning
  may also reduce silver sagebrush cover, and further studies are needed on the 
  possibility of reduced silver sagebrush using repeated fires. Blaisdell and others [<a href="#17">17</a>] provide general 
  guidelines for managing
sagebrush-grass rangelands, including assessment of rangeland condition and
recommendations for burning. See <a href="fire_effects.html#FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">Fire Management Considerations</a>
