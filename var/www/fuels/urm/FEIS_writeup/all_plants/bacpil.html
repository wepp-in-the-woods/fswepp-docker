The currently recognized scientific name of coyote bush is
<i>Baccharis pilularis</i> DC. (Asteraceae) [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>]. The species is
polymorphic, with a coastal prostrate form previously known as <i>B. p</i>. ssp.
<i>pilularis </i>and a more widespread erect form
previously known as <i>B. p</i>. ssp. <i>consanguinea</i> (DC.) C.B. Wolf [<a href="#32">32</a>]. 
The most recent taxonomic
treatment of the genus has eliminated subspecies distinctions for coyote bush
because the 2 forms intergrade completely [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. In this summary, where information is pertinent to only 1 former
subspecies, the entity will be described as either the erect or prostrate form.

Coyote bush is a dominant shrub in northern coastal scrub
communities and a minor component of coastal beach communities, coastal sage
scrub, chaparral, foothill woodlands, closed-cone pine forests, and
mixed-evergreen forests. Coyote bush grows in prostrate form in northern coastal scrub,
a vegetation type present from southern Oregon to San Mateo County, California. Associated

Coyote bush is a native evergreen shrub that grows in prostrate form on dunes and coastal areas with onshore
winds and salt spray and in erect form at higher elevations inland [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. Both forms are much-branched
[<a href="#11">11</a>]. The matted growth
form ranges from 4 to 6 inches&nbsp; (10-15 cm) in height and 3 to 12 feet (1-4 m) wide
[<a href="#47">47</a>]. The arborescent form grows up to 12 feet (4 m) high [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>]. The prostrate form has
smaller leaves with fewer dentations, but the forms are otherwise similar [<a href="#47">47</a>].&nbsp;Female flowerheads are discoid and
many flowered, without
ray florets. They are 0.16 to 0.25 inch (0.4-0.63 cm) long, and clustered at branch tips or in leaf axils.
Male flowers are slightly smaller [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>]. Achenes are 0.039 to 0.079 inch (1-2 mm) long with a 0.24 to 0.39
inch- (6-10 mm) long pappus [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>]. Seeds are very light, weighing on the order of
10<sup>-4</sup>  grams [<a href="#12">12</a>].<p>Coyote bush grows a taproot up to approximately 10.5
feet (3.2 m) long;
lateral roots are also well developed [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>]. Individuals live 10 to 15 years, but basal sprouting and
layering may
extend this lifespan [<a href="#30">30</a>].

male and female flowers in late September and early October. The most abundant
species included Argentine ants (<i>Linepithema humile)</i>, parasitic
hymenoptera (<i>Agathis gibbosa</i>, <i>Synopeas</i> spp., and <i>Dolichogenidea</i>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Germination:</font></b> 
Coyote bush seed germinates well on
mineral soil and has no stratification or temperature requirement. Most germination
occurs within about 15 to 30 days; germination rates within this time frame ranged from 40 to 92%
in the greenhouse [<a href="#48">48</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seedling establishment/growth:</b></font>
Coyote bush
seedling growth is rapid during spring; high root growth rates continue as long
as the taproot grows faster than moisture recedes.&nbsp;Mortality often results
if roots fail to
reach adequate moisture, so best establishment of coyote bush in grasslands
occurs in wet years [<a href="#68">68</a>].
Seedling establishment is best on
mineral soil; coyote bush is excluded or reduced by competition from grasses and other species
that have larger seeds with more carbohydrate storage. DaSilva and Bartolome [<a href="#12">12</a>] found
high soft chess (<i>Bromus hordeaceus</i>) seedling
density reduced survivorship and growth of coyote bush seedlings, particularly
under low-moisture, controlled conditions. Growth rates over the 1st 9
weeks of life showed coyote bush's high root:shoot ratio, typical of taprooted shrubs
in dry
areas. Results are summarized below (data are means).</p>

Coastal populations of the prostrate form of coyote bush experience moderate
temperatures with summer fog, seaspray, and heavy onshore winds [<a href="#45">45</a>]. Annual precipitation ranges from 9.8 to 17.7 inches
(250-450 mm), with most falling between November and April [<a href="#36">36</a>]. Inland populations, which occur up to
2,460 feet (750 m) (occasionally up to 4,920 feet (1500 m)), are exposed to colder winters and hotter summers.
Annual precipitation in these habitats ranges from 12 to 30 inches (305-762 mm)
[<a href="#45">45</a>].

<p>Coyote bush occurs on a range of soil types but is best adapted to medium- to
coarse-textured soils [<a href="#63">63</a>].</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SUCCESSIONAL STATUS">
SUCCESSIONAL STATUS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Coyote bush is a shade-intolerant species. Along with other small-seeded coastal
sage shrubs, it colonizes actively eroding or alluviating areas such as dunes and
gravel bars. Exposed mineral soil gives coyote bush an advantage over perennial
grasses and chaparral shrubs [<a href="#36">36</a>]. Coyote bush's successional status varies with
habitat type [<a href="#68">68</a>]. In California grasslands, it is a late seral
species that invades and increases in the absence of fire or grazing [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>]. The rate of invasion is generally positively correlated with
the amount of spring rainfall, because wet springs maximize early root growth. Coyote
bush invasion of grasslands is of structural importance
because it facilitates the establishment of other coastal sage species. Shrub cover
subsequently increases numbers of rabbits and small mammals that reduce herbaceous
vegetation and favor shrub development [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>]. Thus, well-established coyote bush stands
generally have depauperate understories [<a href="#30">30</a>].
Coyote bush is a common dominant in coastal sage scrub, but because seedling growth
is poor in shade, coyote bush does not regenerate under a closed shrub canopy
[<a href="#68">68</a>].&nbsp; Coast live oak, California bay, or other shade tolerant
species replace coastal sage scrub and other coyote bush-dominated areas,
particularly when fire and grazing are excluded [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].

<p>Generally coyote bush-dominated scrub transition to mixed evergreen forest
takes place in about 50 years and is reversible with periodic fire [<a href="#27">27</a>]. Coyote bush can be a small component of early successional
communities following clearcuts of tanoak, coast Douglas-fir, Pacific ponderosa pine,
Pacific madrone, oak,
incense cedar (<i>Calocedrus decurrens</i>), Pacific yew (<i>Taxus brevifolia</i>),
and/or canyon live oak [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>]</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT">SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Coyote bush seed is generally dispersed
from October to January. Germination occurs after late fall or early winter
rains [<a href="#12">12</a>]. Coyote bush growth is slow until about March,
when root and shoot growth rates increase
with warmer temperatures and spring rains. Growth slows with declining soil moisture in
late May [<a href="#68">68</a>]. Plants flower from
July to October, and fruit ripens from September to November [<a href="#12">12</a>].&nbsp; Rains in September typically allow a high rate of leaf
addition [<a href="#30">30</a>].
Seasonal development is slightly later in inland than in coastal populations [<a href="#48">48</a>].

FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font>   
Coyote bush is
moderately fire tolerant [<a href="#63">63</a>]. In areas of high shrub density,
heat at coyote bush root crowns is often too low to cause mortality, and coyote bush is able
to resprout from the root crown and roots [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>]. Fires in such communities reduce crown cover but are not likely to
reduce shrub density [<a href="#42">42</a>]. Fires that occur in areas with low shrub
density and high herbaceous biomass create enough heat at the root crown to girdle
and kill plants [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>]. In oak woodlands
and chaparral, most postfire recovery of coyote bush and other dominants is by
sprouting. In coastal sage scrub,
fire creates canopy gaps with exposed mineral soil that allow coyote bush and
other coastal sage scrub species (most of which also have small, light seeds) to
establish from seed and outcompete herbaceous vegetation [<a href="#36">36</a>]. Postfire
sprouting of is also an important method of regeneration in coastal sage scrub
dominates such as coyote bush and California sagebrush [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font>   
Fire frequency largely determines the extent of grasslands, coastal sage scrub, chaparral, and oak
woodlands and whether coyote bush is present in each of these types. In grasslands, low fire frequency permits establishment of coyote bush
and the gradual exclusion of herbaceous species [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>]. In coastal sage scrub, chaparral, and oak
woodland, decreasing fire frequency
allows coyote bush to be replaced by more shade-tolerant species [<a href="#64">64</a>]. In mixed evergreen forests, closed-cone pine stands, and coast Douglas-fir stands, 
coyote bush is
only important in early seral vegetation after fire or logging [<a href="#27">27</a>]. Transition from coyote bush scrub to
mixed evergreen
forest can occur in 50 years without fire. In some cases, however, tree
recruitment is limited by crown closure, and fire
exclusion does not result in type conversion but rather maintenance of a dynamic mosaic wherein reversion and
succession allow both vegetation types to persist [<a href="#8">8</a>].</p>

<p> One study of vegetation dynamics in
coastal sage scrub, grassland, and oak woodland
near Santa Barbara found without fire or livestock grazing, coastal sage scrub
was replaced by oak woodland at a rate of 0.3% annually. Grassland to coastal sage scrub
transition occurred at a rate of 0.69%
per year, and oak woodland reverted to grassland at a rate of 0.08% per year. On burned
areas without
livestock grazing or on unburned sites with livestock grazing, rates of
transition of grassland to coastal scrub and coastal scrub to oak woodland were lower.
On areas burned without grazing or grazed without burning the rate of oak
woodland reversion to grassland was higher than on areas with neither burning
nor grazing [<a href="#8">8</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Coastal sage and coastal scrub:</font> 
These community types are fire-dependent, with prominent
shrubs establishing by seed and sprouting [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]. It is a flammable
vegetation type that may burn 1 to 2
years after fire if dry conditions exist. With fire in less than 5-year intervals, or with overgrazing,
coastal scrub generally reverts to annual nonnative
grassland&nbsp; [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].
Fire exclusion in coastal sage scrub and mesic chaparral communities allows
coast live oak, California bay, and other shade tolerant species to increase in density and reduce understory diversity and
abundance [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>]. In the absence of fire,
coast live oak recruitment in chaparral and grassland is commensurate with their
aerial extents; in coastal sage scrub, however,
coast live oak recruitment exceeds that
expected by chance alone. This is primarily because coyote bush is a nurse shrub
for shade-tolerant tree seedlings, particularly coast live
oak and California bay. With tree development, coyote
bush is reduced or excluded [<a href="#8">8</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Chaparral:</font> 
Coyote bush is generally absent from mature chaparral, but after
fire it occurs with other relatively short-lived shrubs and sub-shrubs including
California sagebrush, rabbitbrush (<i>Chrysothamnus</i>  spp.), California
brittlebrush, yerba santa (<i>Eriodictyon</i> spp.), eastern Mojave buckwheat,
golden-yarrow,&nbsp; monkeyflower (<i>Mimulus</i>  spp.), and others [<a href="#26">26</a>]. Shade
created by abundant sprouting of chaparral shrubs limits coyote bush seedling
establishment; seedlings are most abundant in gaps where
nonsprouting shrubs are
eliminated and mineral soil is exposed [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>]. As in coast scrub
associations, high fire frequency can create annual grasslands of
native and nonnative species [<a href="#34">34</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Coastal prairie:</font> 
Fire exclusion in coastal prairie allows coyote bush
establishment, with best establishment in wet years [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>]. Complete conversion of purple needlegrass
(<i>Nassella pulchra</i>) tussock grassland to coyote bush/ripgut brome (<i>Bromus</i>
<i> diandrus</i>) stands has been observed with 24 years of fire exclusion [<a href="#39">39</a>]. Coyote bush forms a closed canopy in about 2 to 3
years after invasion [<a href="#30">30</a>]. Keeley [<a href="#34">34</a>] maintains that California prairies that
have been invaded by shrubs were, in most cases, disclimaxes maintained by fires set by Native Americans.</p>

<p>Greenlee and Langenheim [<a href="#23">23</a>] described fire regimes of potential coyote bush
habitats in the Monterey Bay area; their results are summarized below. In all
habitats there was a large decrease of fire frequency in the recent era,
beginning in 1929 with restrictions against burning. &quot;Probable mean fire
interval&quot; refers to estimates of fire intervals that are derived from
historical or very limited physical evidence.</p>

IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Fire is most detrimental to coyote bush when high temperatures are present at
stem bases. These conditions girdle and kill root crowns, particularly those less than 1 inch
(2.5 cm) in diameter. Conversely, fires with peak temperatures at canopy
height only top-kill coyote bush. McBride and Heady [<a href="#42">42</a>]
compared the effects of 2 types of fire on coyote bush: 1 group had
aerial portions burned, simulating a crown fire in a mature shrub community, and 1
group had bases burned, simulating a prairie fire with herbaceous fuels.
All 11 individuals exposed to simulated crown fire sprouted from
the root crown within 5 weeks. Of 11 individuals exposed to simulated
prairie fire, 8 died, and small-diameter stems were most
susceptible to fire. The authors stated fire could be effective in reducing coyote
bush invasion of grasslands when succession was in early stages, but mature coyote bush stands
could not be removed
by fire. A field study, however, found
prescribed fire in mixed native and nonnative grassland was ineffective in
reducing coyote bush invasion. Coyote bush cover and litter (as well as those of
associated shrubs) were reduced, but shrub density was unchanged [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Coyote bush sprouts from the root crown&nbsp; and roots after top-kill by fire [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].
If communities burn during recovery, coyote bush can be nearly
eliminated, as sprouting ability is lessened with reburning [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].&nbsp;<p>Coyote bush establishes well from seed following fire.
The seeds are
light, easily dispersed, and germinate well on mineral soil [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>]. One study of coastal chaparral near Santa Barbara found
postfire
seedling density of coyote bush averaged 1,787 per acre (4,425/ha)
1 year after fire [<a href="#69">69</a>].

FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Prescribed fire in coastal sage scrub has been recommended to reduce fuel
loading and risk of property-damaging wildfire, and to reduce establishment of
coast live oak and other trees [<a href="#64">64</a>]. Prescribed
burning has been used in coastal prairie to reduce invasion of
coyote bush and other shrubs [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>]. Fire managers in southern California have made fire control lines in
riparian woodlands when planning broadcast burning of adjacent
chaparral and coastal scrub. Control lines are burned to create a fuelbreak [<a href="#13">13</a>].
Green's [<a href="#22">22</a>] 1981 report offers much information on prescribed fire planning,
fuels, ignition techniques, and fire behavior in California shrub communities.

<p> Beyers and Wirtz [<a href="#6">6</a>] suggested the endangered California gnatcatcher could potentially be adversely affected by
prescribed burning in coastal sage scrub. The species requires approximately 50% shrub cover and over 3.3 feet
(1 m) in shrub height for nesting territories. Under optimal conditions, this
stand structure may be achieved
in 4 or 5 years after fire. If connectivity exists between burned and unburned habitats,
prescribed fire can be used without adverse impact. The authors recommend maintaining
both mature and
burned scrub areas to reduce fuel loads while mitigating impacts to
shrub-dependent species such as the California gnatcatcher.</p>

From the perspective of protecting property from fire, fuel modification is of greatest
value in the immediate area around development. Recommendations for property
protection include: planting trees away from
structures, trimming low branches, selecting less flammable landscaping species, using nonflammable
construction materials, and, where trees already grow near homes, removing
overhanging branches [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>]. See the <a href="http://www.firewise.org">Firewise</a>
website for specific
recommendations. Domestic goat grazing (at a rate of 240 goats/acre (600 goats/ha) for 1 day),
in conjunction with prescribed fire, has been used to reduce fuel loading and
continuity in dense shrub communities housing developments [<a href="#62">62</a>].

Livestock seldom browse mature coyote bush, but cattle sometimes
uproot seedlings [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>]. Trampling and grazing
generally limit coyote bush establishment in grasslands. Fencelines often become ecotones
between grasslands and coyote bush scrub [<a href="#42">42</a>].

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Palatability/nutritional value:</b></font>   
Coyote bush
has low protein value and low palatability to grazers and browsers [<a href="#63">63</a>].
Little evidence is found of livestock browsing mature shrubs [<a href="#42">42</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Cover value:</font></b>
Coyote bush establishment in grasslands improves cover for
rabbits and other small mammals that graze herbaceous biomass.
Increasing small mammal populations thus facilitate shrub development and/or
establishment and reduce the rate of reversion to grassland. Coyote
bush/grassland ecotones often have a boundary of bare ground maintained by small
mammal grazing [<a href="#41">41</a>].</p>

Coyote bush has been used
for restoration and erosion control projects. It can be established from seed, bare root
plantings, and containerized stock&nbsp; [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>]. Restoration projects&nbsp;where coyote bush is planted from containers
are most successful in the long term if a sex ratio of 1:5 (males
to females) is used [<a href="#15">15</a>]. If adjacent sites have viable populations, natural establishment can
be as effective as seeding [<a href="#10">10</a>].
The dwarf form of coyote bush is most commonly used as a hardy cover shrub on
slopes [<a href="#11">11</a>].

<p>Seed can be collected with a cloth and
is best if dried in a warm ventilated room
or in sun without wind. Sometimes the pappus is removed before planting. In
nurseries, seeds are sown in fall or early spring using sandy soil or a vermiculite,
perlite, and sphagnum moss mix [<a href="#48">48</a>].</p>

Coastal sage scrub is present in about 15% of its former habitat, primarily
because of agricultural, industrial, and residential development [<a href="#59">59</a>]. Mature
coyote bush stands in coastal sage scrub are generally replaced by shade-tolerant species, and maintenance of
coast scrub, if desired, requires periodic disturbance [<a href="#68">68</a>].&nbsp;

<p>Coyote bush facilitates coastal scrub development in grassland. Grazing and/or prescribed
fire have been recommended where the management objective is grassland maintenance
[<a href="#68">68</a>].</p>

<p>Coyote bush is susceptible to 2,4-D [<a href="#50">50</a>].</p>

Coyote bush commonly supports galls created by the host- specific midge <i>
Rhopalomyia californica</i>  [<a href="#45">45</a>].
