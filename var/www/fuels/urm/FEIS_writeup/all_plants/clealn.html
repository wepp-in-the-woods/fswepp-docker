<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Sweet pepperbush is very seldom a dominant species in plant communities.

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Clethra alnifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>



<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Sweet pepperbush is of little value as a livestock or wildlife forage.
It is eaten by deer and cattle when other forage is limited [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability of sweet pepperbush to white-tailed deer is considered
poor [<a href="#18">18</a>].
 


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Sweet pepperbush is sometimes used to arrest succession of tall trees
along pathways.  It has been planted after herbicide application along
electrical transmission , telephone, railroad, roadside, and pipeline
right of ways, where low-growth woody vegetation does not interfere with
general operation [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Sweet pepperbush has often been planted as an ornamental because of its
attractive and fragrant white flowers [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Clethra alnifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sweet pepperbush is a native, large, deciduous shrub that grows up to 8
feet (2.5 m) tall [<a href="#8">8</a>].  It has woody twigs and stoloniferous roots.  The
bark is reddish-brown.  The fruit is a capsule divided into three
sections [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (nanophanerophyte)
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (microphanerophyte)
   Burned or Clipped State:  Cryptophyte (geophyte)


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Vegetative:  Sweet pepperbush sprouts from stolons [<a href="#4">4</a>].  

Sexual:  The flower of sweet pepperbush is insect pollinated; the fruit
is probably distributed by animals [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sweet peperbush grows in humid, tropical to temperate climates [<a href="#3">3</a>].  It
is found on moderate to poorly drained sites, in acid swamps or in sandy
soils [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Common overstory associates include cypress (Taxodium
spp.), Atlantic white-cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides), loblolly pine
(Pinus elliottii), slash pine (P. taeda), pitch pine (P. rigida),
eastern white pine (P. strobus), pond pine (P. serotina), spruce pine
(P. glabra), red maple (Acer rubrum), magnolia (Magnolia spp.), and
beech (Fagus grandifolia).  Common understory associates include
laurelleaf greenbrier (Smilax laurifolia), switchcane (Arundinaria
tecta), inkberry (Ilex glabra), large gallberry (I. coriacea), zenobia
(Zenobia pulverulenta), swamp cyrilla (Cyrilla racemiflora), southern
bayberry (Myrica cerifera), and saw-palmetto (Serenoa repens) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Sweet pepperbush is a shade-tolerant understory shrub.  It is a mid to
late seral species.  It grows under the canopy of old-growth trees
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Sweet pepperbush either does not become a dominant shrub or
does not dominate for very long.  Other shrubs such as switchcane
(Arundinaria tecta) dominate, with sweet pepperbush reduced to a
subordinate [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Sweet pepperbush flowers between July and August; the fruit ripens from
September to October [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Clethra alnifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Sweet pepperbush is not well adapted to fire.  It probably survives by
sprouting from on-site surviving stolons [<a href="#25">25</a>].



<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving rhizomes
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by animals or water; postfire yr 1&2

<pre>
<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Clethra alnifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Most fires probably top-kill sweet pepperbush.  Its stolons may be
killed by fires severe enough to consume the organic soil.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Sweet pepperbush will probably sprout after fire.  Severe fire or
regular prescribed burning greatly reduces sweet pepperbush and other
common associate shrubs [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  In National Forest lands in South
Carolina, sweet pepperbush gradually increased in areas that had not
been burned for 3 years [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Sweet pepperbush can build up and create a fire hazard [<a href="#28">28</a>].  It can be
controlled with regular prescribed burning [<a href="#25">25</a>].
