<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
Catclaw mimosa is a legume a and member of the Mimosa Family,
Mimosaceae.  Its currently accepted scientific name is Mimosa biuncifera
Benth.  [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

Catclaw mimosa exhibits a high degree of phenotypic variation and is
often confused with, or mistaken for, other mimosas of the American
Southwest.  The taxonomy of catclaw mimosa and closely related species
has been variously interpreted.  The most recent taxonomic reevaluation
has split catclaw mimosa into two species based on armature of the stem
and pubescence of the corolla [<a href="#2">2</a>].  These two species and their synonyms
are presented below [<a href="#2">2</a>]:

  Mimosa biuncifera Benth. = Mimosopsis biuncifera (Benth.) Britt. &
Rose = Mimosa lindheimeri A. Gray = Mimosa biuncifera var. lindheimeri
(A. Gray) B. L. Robinson = Mimosopsis lindheimeri (A. Gray) Britt. &
Rose = Mimosa warnockii B. L. Turner.

  Mimosa texana (A. Gray) Small = Mimosa borealis var. texana A. Gray =

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Catclaw mimosa occurs in many vegetation types, generally as scattered
plants intermixed with numerous other shrubs.  It is occasionally the
most abundant shrub.  In low elevation desert grassland and shrub-steppe
types, catclaw mimosa is often associated with other shrubby species,
including mesquites (Prosopis spp.), redberry juniper, oneseed juniper
(Juniperus monosperma), allthorn (Koeberlimia spinosa), catclaw acacia
(Acacia greggii), larchleaf goldenweed (Haplopappus laricifolius),
smooth sotol (Dasylirion leiophyllum), Wheeler sotol (D. wheeleri),
lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla), and goldeneye (Viguiera stenoloba)
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  Catclaw mimosa is a common plant in the lower elevations
of Arizona chaparral.  Catclaw acacia and catclaw mimosa sometimes
become abundant on drier, rockier, more open sites in Arizona chaparral
[<a href="#30">30</a>].  Catclaw mimosa occurs as scattered individuals in oak, oak-pine,
and evergreen woodlands with an overstory made up of one or more of the
following trees: gray oak (Quercus grisea), Arizona white oak (Q.
arizonica), Emory oak (Q. emoryi), Mohr's oak (Q. mohriana), Mexican
pinyon (Pinus cembroides), pinyon pine (P. edulis), and alligator
juniper (Juniperus deppeana) [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Associated shrubs in
woodlands include fragrant sumac (Rhus aromatica), skunkbush sumac (R.
trilobata), beargrass (Nolina microcarpa, N. erumperus), birchleaf
mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus betuloides), Wright silktassel (Garrya
wrightii), yerba-de-pasmo (Baccharis pteronoides), and desert broom
(Baccharis sarothroides) [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Mimosa biuncifera
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Livestock seldom browse catclaw mimosa; however, it may be used lightly
if other forage is scarce [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Livestock eat the pods [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Scaled
and Gambel's quail eat the seeds [<a href="#16">16</a>].  It is of minor importance as a
browse plant for deer and pronghorn [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Catclaw mimosa has dense prickles and a tangled growth form which may
account for its relatively low palatability to livestock [<a href="#10">10</a>].  The pods
are highly palatable to cattle, and the seeds are highly palatable to
quail [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  In western Texas, the palatability of catclaw mimosa has
been rated good for pronghorn but poor for cattle and sheep [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Catclaw mimosa has a tendency to form thickets, which presumably provide
hiding and thermal cover for a variety of small wildlife species.  Quail
use such thickets [<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Catclaw mimosa shows potential for erosion control.  Plants have a
tendency to form thickets which effectively bind soil [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Catclaw mimosa flowers provide a good source of nectar for honey bees
[<a href="#39">39</a>]. 

This plant has been studied as a source of biomass for the production of
fuels and chemicals.  In comparison with 100 other plant species
examined, it yielded substantial amounts of oils, polyphenols, and
hydrocarbons [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Catclaw mimosa is moderately resistant to phenoxy herbicides [<a href="#19">19</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Mimosa biuncifera
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Catclaw mimosa is a relatively short, straggling, thicket-forming,
deciduous shrub.  It is usually not more than 3 feet (0.9 m) tall but
occasionally grows up to about 8 feet (2.4 m) [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  The pubescent,
slender, straight to zig-zagging stems are armed with solitary or
paired, stout, recurved spines [<a href="#39">39</a>].  The bipinnately compound leaves
contain 3 to 9 pair of pinnae with 8 to 14 pairs of obtuse, linear to
oblong, 0.04 to 0.17 inch (1.0-4.2 mm) long leaflets [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Numerous
pale to whitish flowers occur in globose heads.  The fruit is a curved
or straight legume, 0.75 to 1.5 inch (1.9-3.8 cm) long, 0.13 to 0.17
inch (3.2-4.2 mm) wide, and is constricted between the seeds.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophtye


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Catclaw mimosa produces abundant seed.  Seeds are encased within small,
narrow pods that split open after ripening [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Primary dispersal
agents have not been identified, but seed is probably dispersed by
animals that eat the pods or seeds.  Catclaw mimosa seeds exhibit high
germination rates and germinate over a wide range of temperatures [<a href="#22">22</a>].
On the High Plains of west Texas, redberry juniper (Juniperus
pinchottii) acts as a nurse plant for catclaw mimosa.  The closed canopy
and heavy mulch layer associated with redberry juniper apparently
provides a favorable microenvironment for catclaw mimosa seedling
establishment [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Catclaw mimosa sprouts from the root crown following damage to the
aboveground portion of the plant, such as by fire or herbicides [19[.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Catclaw mimosa occurs on gravelly flats, mesas, and rocky slopes in
desert grass, desert shrub, interior chaparral, pinyon-juniper, open
oak, and pine-oak communities [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  

Soils:  In western Texas, catclaw mimosa often occupies soils derived
from limestone or igneous rock [<a href="#34">34</a>].  

Elevation:  Elevational ranges are presented below [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>]:

from 2,000 to 5,000 feet (610-1,524 m) in w TX
     3,000 to 6,000 feet (914-1,829 m) in AZ
     4,300 to 5,600 feet (1,311-1,707 m) in the Rincon Mtns, se AZ 


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Catclaw mimosa is a common component of interior chaparral, a vegetation
type considered to be a true climatic climax susceptible to large-scale
burning [<a href="#6">6</a>].  This plant's sprouting ability allows it to become a part
of the immediate postfire community.  Individual plants may live to be
very old, although the aboveground portion may date back only to the
last fire [<a href="#33">33</a>].

Catclaw mimosa is considered an invader of desert and semiarid
grasslands [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Fire suppression and livestock grazing are thought
to be responsible for the spread of shrubs into what is considered to
have been relatively shrub-free grasslands of the Southwest [<a href="#41">41</a>].
Although catclaw mimosa is fire tolerant and a high percentage of plants
survive fire, a combination of frequent fires, droughts, competition,
and browsing by rodents and lagomorphs may have suppressed plants in
presettlement times [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Cattle reportedly "devour the pods" [<a href="#10">10</a>].
This undoubtedly has aided the spread of catclaw mimosa into grasslands
because seeds are probably scarified as they pass through the digestive
tract and are then deposited in nutrient-rich dung, which aids
germination.

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Mimosa biuncifera
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Catclaw mimosa is able to sprout from the root crown following top-kill
by fire [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  Hibbert and others [<a href="#19">19</a>] report that catclaw mimosa is
fire tolerant and can rapidly recover by sprouting, even after repeated
burns.

Catclaw mimosa is common in Arizona chaparral.  Severe wildfires are
common in this vegetation type as a result of heavy fuel accumulation
and scant early summer rainfall [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Fire frequencies are generally
between 20 to 80 or 100 years, although some stands may experience
longer fire-free intervals [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Most chaparral species are well adapted
to fire and recover quickly.  It takes at least 20 years before enough
fuel accumulates to support a repeat fire, unless the area has been
grass seeded [<a href="#6">6</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Mimosa biuncifera
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fires generally top-kill catclaw mimosa.  By itself, it provides little
fuel because of its open growth form and because its small leaves
contribute very little to ground fuels when they drop [<a href="#25">25</a>].  However,
the fuel of surrounding plants is often enough to ignite catclaw mimosa
and cause its stems to burn off [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Catclaw mimosa commonly occurs in
Arizona chaparral where wildfires are often severe, defoliating all
aboveground vegetation and leaving only charred stems and a layer of ash
over mineral soil [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Following top-kill by fire, catclaw mimosa survives by producing
numerous sprouts from the root crown [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  Because plants usually
survive fire, density is generally not affected by burning.

Although catclaw mimosa was not abundant in a study in desert
mountain shrub vegetation in the Guadalupe Mountains, sampling of
several 3- to 7-year-old burns showed that its frequency was greater on
burned than on unburned sites [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Rapid regrowth allows plants to fully recover preburn cover within about
5 years [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Regrowth of top-killed catclaw mimosa plants was
observed following several lightning- and man-caused fires in and near
Carlsbad Caverns National Park, New Mexico.  Here, top-killed plants
sprouted and grew 8 to 10 inches (20-25 cm) in one growing season [<a href="#25">25</a>].
Following prescribed spring burns in desert grasslands and oak woodlands
in southeastern Arizona, sprouts of catclaw mimosa regained 58 to 67
percent of plant preburn heights within two growing seasons as
summarized below [<a href="#3">3</a>].
