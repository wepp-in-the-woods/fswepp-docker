<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Alaska blueberry occurs as an understory dominant or codominant in many
habitats within its range.  It is most often associated with Pacific
silver fir (Abies amabilis), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla),
mountain hemlock (T. mertensiana), and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis).
The Pacific silver fir/Alaska blueberry community type occurs over large
areas of land from northern Oregon to southern British Columbia.  It may
be the most widely represented community type within the Cascade Range
[<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].

Other commonly associated species include noble fir (Abies procera),
Alaska-cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis), salal (Gaultheria shallon),
rusty menziesia (Menziesia ferruginea), beargrass (Xerophyllum tenax),
bunchberry dogwood (Cornus canadensis), Oregon grape (Berberis nervosa),
Pacific rhododendron (Rhododendron macrophyllum), devil's club
(Oplopanax horridum), skunk cabbage (Veratrum californicum), and various
gooseberries (Ribes spp.), and blackberries (Rubus spp.). [also see SAF
cover types]

Published classification schemes identifying Alaska blueberry as a major
component of plant associations (pas), community types (cts), or habitat
types (hts) are as follows:

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vaccinium alaskensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Alaska blueberry fruits are utilized by many species of wildlife
including songbirds, gamebirds, mice, chipmunks, squirrels, raccoons,
and black bears [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  Along the coast of British Columbia, grizzly
bears consume the berries [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Twigs and foliage are used as browse by rabbit, snowshoe hare, bear,
goat, elk, and deer [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].

Alaska blueberry is very important as winter browse because it is often
found in older stands with shallow snowpack, making it more accessible
to wildlife.  Utilization may also increase in early winter in open
areas when lower growing vegetation becomes covered with snow.


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability of Vaccinium species as browse is rated at fair to moderate
[<a href="#12">12</a>].

Alaska blueberry leaves found in forested areas are more palatable to
deer than those found in clearcuts [<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Alaska blueberry leaves collected in clearcuts differ in nutrient
content from leaves collected in older stands.  In older stands, leaves
have a higher concentration of nitrogen and percentage of digestible
protein.  However, leaves from clearcut areas are higher in overall
digestible dry matter.  Values for digestible protein (DP) and
digestible dry matter (DDM) are as follows:

                           DP (% dry weight)      DDM (% dry weight)
               clearcut          4.8                     57.8 
                forest          11.2                     54.7

Van Horne [<a href="#52">52</a>] found that phosphorous and potassium concentrations are
also greater in leaves from older stands.  These concentrations decrease
sharply from spring to fall.  Nutrient concentrations (percent dry
weight) are as follows:
                                  May        October

                 nitrogen         5.79         1.54
              phosphorous         0.81         0.14
                potassium         1.93         0.73

Vaccinium species in general have sweet berries that contain high
concentrations of mono- and di- saccharides [<a href="#48">48</a>].  They are rich in
vitamin C and high in energy content, but low in fat [<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Alaska blueberry presumably provides cover for a variety of wildlife
species.  It often forms a dense understory layer that may serve as
hiding, resting, or nesting sites for many smaller birds and mammals.


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Much of the natural disturbance in areas that Alaska blueberry occupies
is a result of windthrow.  Alaska blueberry readily colonizes sites
where trees have been blown down, the canopy has opened up, and sunlight
has been made available [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>].

After the eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington, Alaska blueberry
plants did not develop adventitious root systems or change the
orientation of their rhizomes in order to recover from burial by tephra
(volcanic ejecta), although many other species did [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Alaska blueberry fruits are edible and sweet [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  They are used in
jams and jellies, and along with ovalleaf blueberry, constitute the
majority of blueberries picked along coastal Alaska [<a href="#55">55</a>].  Alaska
blueberry may produce up to 100 berries per bush, making commercial
collection very time efficient and profitable.  The berries have been an
important traditional food source for Native Americans including the
Nuxalk of the Bella Coola region of British Columbia [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Blueberry
(Vaccinium spp.) leaves, flowers, and rhizomes have also been used for
medicinal purposes [<a href="#53">53</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Alaska blueberry rapidly sprouts from underground stems or establishes
by seed within 3 years of clearcutting [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Desired commercial tree
species should be established as soon as possible after timber harvest
because Alaska blueberry may provide competition to tree seedlings.
However, most western blueberry species are severely damaged by
postlogging treatments such as mechanical piling that include harsh
scarification [<a href="#39">39</a>].

Alaska blueberry in old spruce-hemlock stands in central Oregon
responded best to heavy or extreme thinning treatments [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Net biomass production of Alaska blueberry differs drastically in
different habitats.  In hemlock-spruce types, Alaska blueberry produced
98.6 pounds per acre (110.5 kg/ha) of biomass when associated with skunk
cabbage but only 8.66 pounds per acre (9.7 kg/ha) when associated with
bunchberry dogwood [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Values for available biomass in four forest types are as follows [<a href="#2">2</a>]:

    FOREST TYPE         STAND AGE          BIOMASS AVAILABLE
     clearcut             1-25 yrs.       740 lbs/acre (829 kg/ha)
dense, even-aged        26-150 yrs.        15 lbs/acre (16 kg/ha)
mature, even-aged      150-250 yrs.        62 lbs/acre (69 kg/ha)
    old-growth            >250 yrs.       337 lbs/acre (378 kg/ha)

Blueberries (Vaccinium spp.) are not actively cultivated in the
Northwest, but they do produce a profitable and highly demanded crop.
Most of the naturally occurring blueberry fields in Oregon and
Washington are seral and have originated from wildfire.  Succession must
be delayed in order to preserve areas where blueberry production is the
most important land use.  Burning every 2 to 3 years and chemical or
mechanical weeding may help maintain these areas of high berry
production [<a href="#40">40</a>].

Management techniques for cultivation of western Vaccinium species have
not been well documented, although eastern blueberries have been
cultivated successfully for years.  Vacciniums are most often propogated
by hardwood cuttings but also can be grown from seed.  In general, the
seeds should be planted in a mixture of sand and peat.  Seedlings grown
in the greenhouse can be transplanted 6 to 7 weeks after emergence but
should not be transferred to the field until after the first growing
season [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Vaccinium spp. can be controlled by applying 2,4-D or 2,4,5-T to
foliage, stems, or basal areas [<a href="#24">24</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vaccinium alaskensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Alaska blueberry is a spreading to erect shrub reaching 6 feet (2 m) in
height.  Leaves are elliptic to obovate. The thin twigs are yellow green
but become gray with age.  The urn-shaped, bronzy-pink flowers are borne
singly in leaf axils when the leaves are partially developed.  The fruit
is a globose blue-black to purple berry that may or may not have a bloom
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].

The plant is rhizomatous and generally has shallow roots.

Alaska blueberry is easily confused with ovalleaf blueberry.  These two
species can be distinguished by the fact that Alaska blueberry is taller
and has larger leaves than ovalleaf blueberry, and the latter flowers
before or with the leaves.  Alaska blueberry is also more shade tolerant
than ovalleaf blueberry [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Alaska blueberry is capable of reproducing by seed or by vegetative
means.  Vegetative reproduction is of primary importance to most western
Vaccinium species [<a href="#39">39</a>].

Seeds of most Vacciniums are not dormant and require no pretreatment for
germination [<a href="#11">11</a>].  A single Alaska blueberry fruit may have up to 100 or
more seeds [<a href="#49">49</a>]. The seeds germinate well, but seedling emergence and
survival are strongly correlated with the amount of available light
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  Seedling emergence in one study was 45 percent in
light-limited young stands, and 73 percent in older stands [<a href="#49">49</a>].
Germination on nurse logs is common [<a href="#47">47</a>].

Seeds are readily dispersed by the many birds and mammals that eat
Alaska blueberry fruits [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Most Vacciniums regenerate from basal sprouts,
roots, or rhizomes [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Sprouting from branches or stems may also
occur after fire or herbivory.  Rhizome spreading allows for clonal
expansion, even in the absence of disturbance [<a href="#49">49</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Alaska blueberry occupies a variety of different land forms from valley
bottoms to mountain slopes [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  It is most often found in
cool, moist sites in montane forests [<a href="#26">26</a>].  These sites are generally
classified as moderately productive [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Alaska blueberry is
abundant on sites with minimal soil disturbance [<a href="#2">2</a>].  It is found at
elevations ranging from sea level to around 6,000 feet (1,800 m).
Aspect is variable [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Alaska blueberry can tolerate a wide range
of soil moisture conditions and is found in well-drained to poorly
drained sites [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  Alaska blueberry has been classified as an
indicator of hypermaritime to maritime climates, and moist to very
moist, nitrogen-poor soils [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Alaska blueberry generally occurs in sandy, silt, or clay loams
developed in tephra and colluvial, morainal, or glacial till
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Alaska blueberry is capable of surviving many types of disturbance and
can be important in certain seral communities.  It can be an early
colonizer in clearcuts, burned areas, and in areas of windthrow [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].
However, as stands become dense and even-aged (stand age 25-150 years),
Alaska blueberry decreases drastically in frequency and abundance.  As
the stand continues to mature (stand age 150-250 years) and begins to
self-thin, Alaska blueberry again increases and forms a low, highly
branched layer [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Alaska blueberry is most often associated with
these late seral or climax community types.  It occurs frequently in
mature-climax western hemlock, Sitka spruce-western hemlock, coastal
true fir-hemlock, and Douglas-fir types [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Alaska blueberry flowers emerge from April to May after the leaves are
partially developed.  Berries ripen from mid-July to mid-August [<a href="#55">55</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vaccinium alaskensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Alaska blueberry sprouts from rhizomes after burning [<a href="#49">49</a>].  It may also
sprout from roots and underground stems like other Vacciniums
[<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Seedling establishment in most western Vacciniums is not
common but may occur as birds and animals disperse seeds from off-site
sources [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Seral blueberry fields in Oregon and Washington are most
likely the result of wildfires [<a href="#40">40</a>].  These fields are dwindling in size
as a result of decades of fire suppresion.  Fire has apparently been
used in the past by Native Americans of the Northwest to enhance or
maintain Vaccinium fruit production [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Alaska blueberry primarily
occurs in cool-moist forests that have very long fire intervals (perhaps
400-500 years).


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex
   survivor species; on-site surviving rhizomes
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by animals or water; postfire yr 1&2

<pre>
<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vaccinium alaskensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire top-kills Alaska blueberry.  Moderate- to high-severity fires also
kill underground vegetative portions.

Seeds of most western Vaccinium spp. are susceptible to heat and are
killed by fire [<a href="#39">39</a>].



<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Fire severity significantly influences vegetative response and plants
may not sprout on heavily burned sites where underground regenerative
structures have been damaged or destroyed.

Clearcutting and subsequent burning increased the vigor of Alaska
blueberry in southeast Alaska.  Within 4 years the number of aerial
stems sprouting from rhizomes in clearcut and burned areas was twice the
number found in old stands [<a href="#49">49</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
In a study at the Sawtooth Huckleberry Field near Mount Adams,
Washington, Vaccinium species sprouted in burned areas by the first
postfire growing season.  However, no flowers or berries were produced
by the plants for 3 years following the fire.  Significant berry
production was delayed 5 years [<a href="#41">41</a>].  On some sites, production may be
reduced for 20 to 30 years or longer [<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Flower buds tend to be more numerous on new shoots and periodic removal
of old shoots can increase flower production in many Vacciniums.
Prescribed fire has long been used to rejuvenate commercial low sweet
blueberry (V. angustifolium) fields and to increase fruit production.
Spring burns, conducted when the soil is moist, are generally most
effective in promoting blueberry fruit development [<a href="#39">39</a>].
