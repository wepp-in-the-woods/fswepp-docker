<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Chihuahua pine commonly occurs in mixed forests and woodlands composed
of evergreen conifers and oaks (Quercus spp.) [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  It occurs in
or just above the Madrean evergreen woodlands and pygmy conifer-oak
woodlands [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  Chihuahua pine extends upward in elevation into the
mixed pine (Pinus spp.) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].

Pine-oak woodlands have a diagnostic understory of evergreen oaks with
emergent pines over 16.4 feet (5 m) tall such as Chihuahua pine and
Mexican pinyon (Pinus cembroides) [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].  These woodlands are
climax over a wide area from southern Arizona to Mexico [<a href="#41">41</a>].

Chihuahua pine occurs as scattered individuals in pine forests, often
with Arizona pine (Pinus ponderosa var. arizonica), interior ponderosa
pine (P. p. var. scopulorum), and Apache pine (P. engelmannii) [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].

Chihuahua pine is the principal tree in the Chihuahua pine series
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Minor climax species or codominants with Chihuahua
pine in some areas are Arizona pine, Mexican pinyon, Arizona cypress
(Cupressus arizonica), and junipers (Juniperus spp.)  [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].
Chihuahua pine is subdominant in Apache pine/silverleaf oak (Quercus
hypoleucoides) habitat types and white fir (Abies concolor) forests
[<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].

Chihuahua pine is found as scattered individuals in encinal oak
woodlands such as Arizona white oak (Q. arizonica)-silverleaf oak and
Arizona white oak-Emory oak (Q. emoryi) community types [13,20,29,
32,59].  It is a characteristic species in Mexican blue oak (Q.
oblongifolia) communities [<a href="#42">42</a>].

Infrequently, Chihuahua pine occurs in interior chaparral community
types such as pointleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos pungens)-silverleaf
oak and pointleaf manzanita-Toumey oak (Q. toumeyi) [<a href="#59">59</a>].

Chihuahua pine is a common tree in riparian associations in various
communities such as the Arizona sycamore (Platanus wrightii) series and
Arizona cypress associations [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].

Chihuahua pine is listed as a dominant or indicator species in the
following publications:

       Arizona and New Mexico [<a href="#1">1</a>]
(2)  Forest and woodland habitat types (plant associations) of Arizona

<pre><center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus leiophylla var. chihuahuana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Although of minor commercial importance due to its limited distribution,
Chihuahua pine is used for lumber [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  The best grades of
Chihuahua pine are as good as ponderosa pine for commercial purposes
[<a href="#30">30</a>].  The wood of Chihuahua pine is durable but not strong, soft to
hard, light, and straight-grained [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
In oak-juniper-pinyon woodland of southeastern Arizona, 36 breeding bird
species foraged for insects on Chihuahua pine and Mexican pinyon
needles; this level of use was higher than would have been expected from
random foraging patterns [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].

Chihuahua pine seeds are eaten by thick-billed parrots [<a href="#68">68</a>].

Chihuahua pine is codominant with Arizona walnut in open riparian
communities in southeastern Arizona, which acorn woodpeckers use for
nesting [<a href="#52">52</a>].

Mexican spotted owls are yearlong residents of oak-pine forests, in
which Chihuahua pine occurs [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Chihuahua pine was planted with 37 other pine species in trials on
sandhill sites in northwestern Florida.  It did not survive [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Chihuahua pine was evaluated for suitability as a timber tree at the
Wind River Arboretum in Wyoming.  It was winter-killed after 5 years [<a href="#60">60</a>].

Different Chihuahua pine habitat types have differing productivity.
Types located in well-watered positions such as on lower slopes or
alluvial terraces achieve maximum productivity at 80 years.  Drier
habitat types reach maximum productivity at about 100 years [<a href="#50">50</a>].

Equations to estimate understory production have been developed for the
oak-pine forests in which Chihuahua pine occurs [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Sampling methods that classify riparian communities to which Chihuahua
pine belongs are discussed in the literature [<a href="#65">65</a>].

Chihuahua pine was included in a breeding program that studied pollen
production at the Eddy Arboretum in California.  Chihuahua pine produced
pollen during May for 1 year [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Chihuahua pine is susceptible to dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium gillii
ssp. gillii).  Dwarf mistletoe infection of Chihuahua pine causes
reduced growth rates, increased mortality, and reduced seed production,
and predisposes Chihuahua pine to attack by insects and fungi [<a href="#31">31</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus leiophylla var. chihuahuana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Chihuahua pine is a native, small to medium, monoecious tree that grows
35 to 60 feet (10.7-18.3 m) tall and 1 to 2 feet (0.3-0.6 m) in trunk
diameter [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].  Large branches form a narrow crown.  The
bark of Chihuahua pine is 0.9 to 1.5 inches (2.3-3.8 cm) thick [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].
The evergreen needles are in bundles of three, are 2 to 4.7 inches (5-12
cm) long, and persist for 3 or more years [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].  The cones
are 1.5 to 2.7 inches (3.8-7 cm) long and persist for 5 or more years
[<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  The seeds of Chihuahua pine are 0.13 inch (0.33 cm) long
with large (0.33 inch [0.84 cm]) wings [<a href="#70">70</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Chihuahua pine sprouts from cut stumps or from the root crown [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].

The minimum seed-bearing age of Chihuahua pine is 28 to 30 years [<a href="#35">35</a>].
It has persistent, serotinous and semiserotinous (delayed dispersal)
cones that may remain closed for 5 or more years [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  Reports of
cone crop size are variable.  While some cones mature every year,
Chihuahua pine produces large seed crops about every other year [<a href="#30">30</a>];
however, Krugman and Jenkinson [<a href="#35">35</a>] report that intervals between large
seed crops are 3 to 4 years.  Cone and seed collection and seed
germination procedures are discussed in the literature [<a href="#35">35</a>].

The small seeds of Chihuahua pine weigh an average of 0.003 ounce (0.01
g) and are wind dispersed [<a href="#66">66</a>].  Recruitment is often sparse in
undisturbed stands which may be partly due to closed cones that delay
seed dispersal [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Birds consume Chihuahua pine seeds, but it is not
known whether they facilitate Chihuahua pine dispersal and establishment
[<a href="#45">45</a>].

Chihuahua pine seedlings are sensitive to intense light and heat [<a href="#30">30</a>].
Deep litter reduces Chihuahua pine seedling emergence [<a href="#6">6</a>].  In a study
that evaluated relative drought resistance, Chihuahua pine established
beneath nurse plants such as older trees and shrubs, and beneath logs
and boulders [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].

Near the lower elevation limit of this species, Chihuahua pine seedlings
occur in relatively moist microsites.  Just below the lowest elevational
limit, Chihuahua pine seedlings die from water stress [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Chihuahua
pine seedlings were less drought tolerant than Mexican pinyon seedlings
and more drought tolerant than Apache pine seedlings [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Humphrey [<a href="#33">33</a>] suggested that a 100-year drought from 1869 to 1956 was
responsible for high Chihuahua pine mortality during the 1950's in
southeastern Arizona.



<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Chihuahua pine grows in climates that range from semiarid with bimodal
precipitation to temperate-subhumid with most precipitation falling in
summer [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].  

Chihuahua pine is common on upland slopes, mesas, canyon bottoms,
alluvial terraces, and intermittent washes [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  Chihuahua pine
occurs at elevations from 4,920 to 7,800 feet (1,500-2,377 m) throughout
its range [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].

Chihuahua pine occurs on soils of varying textures ranging from sandy to
clayey sand with gravel [<a href="#69">69</a>].  Soils are often shallow and cobbly
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].  Parent materials are igneous, rhyolite, basalt, or schist [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].

Along a moisture gradient from mesic to xeric sites in Arizona,
Chihuahua pine was not present at the most mesic or xeric ends of the
gradient.  It had 50 to 100 stems per hectare at the midmesic point [<a href="#71">71</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Chihuahua pine is climax in pine-oak woodlands and forests [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  

Young Chihuahua pine is shade tolerant beneath oaks and junipers.
Depending on the site characteristics, Chihuahua pine may become
dominant and replace the oaks and junipers [<a href="#20">20</a>].  It is seral in white
fir forests [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Chihuahua pine becomes shade intolerant after it is
about 20 feet (6.1 m) tall [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Chihuahua pine requires 3 years for cones to mature [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].
Reproductive buds are initiated in the summer of the first year [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].
Pollination occurs in spring or early summer of the second year
[<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].  Fertilization occurs the following spring.  Seeds mature in
the fall of the third year [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  Some seeds may disperse December
through January [<a href="#35">35</a>].

<pre><center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus leiophylla var. chihuahuana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Chihuahua pine has fire-associated regeneration [<a href="#6">6</a>].  It endures and
regenerates after fire due to abundant seed production, delayed seed
release from some serotinous cones, and sprouting potential, even in
mature trees [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  When pine-oak woodland is burned, fire-enduring
species such as Chihuahua pine survive to become dominant since the less
tolerant species are eliminated [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Fire frequencies in Chihuahua pine forests have not been studied.
Stand-replacing fires may encourage the growth of competing vegetation;
oak and alligator juniper (Juniperus deppeana) sprout, and manzanita
(Arctostaphylos spp.) and ceanothus (Ceanothus spp.) seeds germinate
after stand-replacing fires [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Chihuahua pine grows in oak-pine woodlands; these are probably
fire-tolerant, fire-maintained communities, although their fire regime
is not well understood [<a href="#62">62</a>].  Chihuahua pine occurs in the oak-pine
forest and adjacent conifer gallery forest in Rhyolite Canyon in the
Chiricahua National Monument, Arizona.  Historically, surface fires
occurred every 1 to 38 years [<a href="#63">63</a>].  Based on the fire scars of
cooccurring Apache pine, the mean fire interval from 1655 to 1924 was
12.5 years in the lower canyon area [<a href="#62">62</a>].  In this and similar areas,
fire intervals increased with livestock grazing and the subsequent
reduction in surface fuels [<a href="#63">63</a>].

Fire is characteristic of interior ponderosa pine forests.  Fires from
these communities may extend downward into mixed pine or oak-pine
forests in which Chihuahua pine occurs.  In the Rincon Mountains close
to the northern latitudinal limits of Chihuahua pine, the estimated mean
fire intervals from 1757 to 1983 for Arizona pine communities ranged
from 1 to 13 years, based on fire-scarred trees [<a href="#3">3</a>].

<pre><center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus leiophylla var. chihuahuana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
The immediate effects of fire on Chihuahua pine were not described in
the literature.  Chihuahua pine saplings and pole trees are probably
top-killed by fire and may be killed by severe fires.  Mature trees with
thick bark are probably unaffected by most fires.  Fire generally opens
serotinous and semiserotinous cones, and seed is released.  Root crowns
protected from fire by soil and surviving stumps probably sprout.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Chihuahua pine established quickly from seed in recently burned oak
woodlands in Arizona [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Establishment may be delayed if moist and
protected microsites provided by nurse plants or other cover are not
available following severe fire.

Regeneration rates are increased by vigorous sprouting of surviving
Chihuahua pine.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fire suppression has created crowded, stunted Chihuahua pine stands with
high amounts of tree litter and dead fuel in oak-pine communities of
Arizona.  Increased grazing has removed light surface fuels such as
grasses.  The potential for severe fire hazard exits in these
communities [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Dwarf mistletoe infection in Chihuahua pine may increase fire hazard
conditions partly due to increased numbers of dead trees [<a href="#31">31</a>].
