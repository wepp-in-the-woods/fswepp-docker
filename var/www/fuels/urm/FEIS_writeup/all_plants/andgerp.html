<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
Currently there is considerable disagreement over the taxonomic
treatment of the grasses traditionally known as sand bluestem
(Andropogon hallii Hack.) and big bluestem (A. gerardii Vitman).
Various authorities have recognized these two bluestems either as
distinct species [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>] or as varieties within a single species
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  Artificial hybridization experiments have shown that these
two bluestems are completely interfertile [<a href="#44">44</a>], with offspring showing
intermediate morphological characteristics [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  These bluestems,
however, show clear ecological differences:  big bluestem is widely
distributed in North America on moist prairie sites, while sand bluestem
is restricted to drier, sandy soils in the Great Plains [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Where
their ranges overlap, they freely interbreed.  In the Nebraska
Sandhills, sand bluestem is restricted to upland sand dunes, while big
bluestem occurs only in low meadows.  Hybrids with intermediate
morphological characteristics are found in narrow zones 16 to 33 feet
(5-10 m) wide at the dune-meadow interface [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Because both bluestems
are morphologically similar and are able to cross-pollinate to produce
intergrades, some authorities have recently recognized these entities as
two varieties of a single species [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  This write-up follows
their treatment; thus the fully documented scientific name of sand
bluestem is Andropogon gerardii Vitman var. paucipilus (Nash) Fern.

</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Sand bluestem is a valuable forage grass because of its palatability and
high yield.  It is highly preferred by livestock, especially cattle
which tend to seek it out during the summer [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  In the
Sandhills of Nebraska, sand bluestem is a palatable and nutritious
component of upland hay [<a href="#53">53</a>].  Plants are eaten by small mammals, and
the seeds are consumed by upland game birds and songbirds [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  In
Texas, sand bluestem is an important local food source for mule deer
[<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Sand bluestem is highly palatable.  Livestock, especially cattle, tend
to seek it out during the summer growing season [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Sand bluestem is
most palatable in spring and summer during the green growth stage.  It
becomes tough and coarse at maturity; in Nebraska, however, it is
reportedly highly palatable throughout the year [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  Sand
bluestem cures well and is utilized by horses and cattle in the winter
[<a href="#32">32</a>].  The relish and degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife
species for sand bluestem for several states has been rated as follows
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>]:

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Nutritive value of sand bluestem varies with season [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].
Digestibility decreases with maturity but remains high enough to make
sand bluestem a fair winter forage.  Sand bluestem is more digestible
throughout the growing season than either prairie sandreed or little
bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) [<a href="#13">13</a>].  It has higher protein levels
than prairie sandreed, little bluestem, or sand lovegrass (Eragrostis
trichodes) but lower protein levels than switchgrass (Panicum virgatum)
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  Sand bluestem may be somewhat deficient in phosphorus
[<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  Sand bluestem is considered a superior quality summer forage,
however, because of the combination of its high palatability and
chemical composition.


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Sand bluestem often grows in large patches which retain an upright
vegetative structure.  These provide good protective cover for smaller
wildlife species.  When growing with other tall grasses, sand bluestem
provides essential nesting cover for prairie chickens, other upland game
birds, small nongame birds, and small mammals.

The degree to which sand bluestem provides environmental protection
during one or more seasons for wildlife species has been rated as
follows [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>]:

                         KS     ND     NM     UT     WY

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Sand bluestem is currently used to revegetate disturbed sites with sandy
soil because its extensive system of roots and rhizomes allows it to
quickly stabilize such sites.  Sand bluestem has been used for
rehabilitation of (1) sandy rangelands plowed and later abandoned, (2)
sand dune "blowouts", and (3) mined lands.  Sand bluestem can be
established by broadcast seeding [<a href="#34">34</a>], with hay mulch underseeded with
sand bluestem and other grasses [<a href="#37">37</a>], or by transplanting sod [<a href="#61">61</a>].
Seeds of sand bluestem exhibit a number of characteristics which
indicate good potential for use in reclamation:  good seed fill, broad
range of optimal germination temperatures, and pronounced seedling
vigor, even in drought conditions [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Seed generally should be planted in early spring to take advantage of
soil moisture.  Seed can also be planted in fall if moisture is
sufficient; the warm soil temperatures during fall may promote maximum
germination, while the decreasing soil temperature as the season
progresses may favor seedling survival [<a href="#52">52</a>].  Sand bluestem is
recommended for seeding where mean annual precipitation (MAP) exceeds 14
inches (35.5 cm) [<a href="#55">55</a>].  Several cultivars are available, including
'Elida', 'Garden', 'Goldstrike', and 'Woodward [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Sand bluestem is an indicator of range in good condition [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  It is
classified as a decreaser but can withstand considerable grazing because
of its rhizomatous habit.  With continued heavy grazing, however, it
loses vigor, develops a prostrate growth habit, and is eventually
replaced by less desirable grasses such as prairie sandreed [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].
In Nebraska sand bluestem increased in abundance and vigor following the
cessation of intensive livestock grazing.  Annual biomass significantly
increased despite below average precipitation.  The increase was
successively greater each of the 4 years of the study [<a href="#45">45</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Andropogon gerardii var. paucipilus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sand bluestem is a native, warm-season, perennial, rhizomatous tallgrass
that grows 3 to 6 feet (1-2 m) tall.  Well-developed rhizomes reach
lengths of 4 to 8 inches (10-20 cm) in climax stands but only about 4
inches (10 cm) in recently vegetated shifting sands [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  Root
depths vary from 6 to 10 feet (1.8-3 m) [<a href="#61">61</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Cryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sand bluestem is a poor seed producer. Tolstead [<a href="#58">58</a>] noted that in
Nebraska seeds seldom formed even in well-developed communities.  Sims
and others [<a href="#51">51</a>] observed that only 36 percent of shoots of the cultivar
'Elida' developed seed heads.  In sand bluestem stands in Kansas,
Cornelius [<a href="#15">15</a>] observed that only 13.3 percent of florets contained
caryopses.  Seed does not require cold treatment to germinate [<a href="#56">56</a>].
Seeds germinate in the fall and overwinter as seedlings.  Stubbendieck
and McCully [<a href="#52">52</a>] noted that although high temperatures favored
germination, lower temperatures favored seedling survival.

Most reproduction in sand bluestem occurs via rhizomes.  Rhizomes grow
from axillary buds during June and July, turn upward in late summer, and
then remain dormant, ready for shoot growth the following spring [<a href="#51">51</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sand bluestem is found almost exclusively on sandy soils.  It is most
common on sandhills, windblown sand dunes, and high and low sandy
plains.  It is only occasionally found on moderately coarse soils [<a href="#53">53</a>].
In the Northern and Central Great Plains, sand bluestem appears to be
restricted to the upper and middle elevations of sand dunes and
sandhills [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  This preference is apparently related to soil
moisture.  In sandhills, there is very little soil development because
of wind erosion.  Here coarse-textured sands are found at the tops of
dunes, and the finer sands near the bottom.  The sandy characteristic of
the soil at the upper reaches of the sand dunes allows for deep water
percolation with very little runnoff.  This water is stored at depths
below 23.5 inches (60 cm) and is available to deeply rooted species such
as sand bluestem throughout the growing season, even during dry summer
periods [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Sand bluestem's importance in a plant community tends to decrease as
sand content of the soil decreases.  Finer textured soils do not absorb
water as efficiently, nor does the water percolate as deeply, as in
sandy soils.  On these sites, sand bluestem must compete with
shallow-rooted grasses, such as Stipa, Agropyron, and Bouteloua spp.,
which are better able to extract moisture in this soil type.  Barnes and
Harrison [<a href="#4">4</a>] observed that sand bluestem plants growing on fine-textured
soils at the lower slopes of sand dunes experienced greater water stress
than plants growing at mid or upper slopes.

Elevational ranges for sand bluestem in several western states are as
follows [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>]:

     under 5,000 feet (1,524 m) in the Rincon Mountains, AZ
     from  3,500 to 5,200 feet (1,067-1,585 m) in CO
           3,000 to 7,000 feet ( 914-2,134 m) in NM
           2,800 to 3,800 feet ( 853-1,158 m) in MT
           4,100 to 4,800 feet (1,250-1,463 m) in WY
           4,600 to 5,800 feet (1,400-1,770 m) in UT


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Sand bluestem occurs in a variety of successional stages, from recently
vegetated shifting sands to climax grassland communities [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  It
is a pioneer on sand blowouts where it often dominates with blowout
grass (Redfieldia flexuosa), prairie dropseed (Sporobolus heterolepis),
and hairy prairie clover (Helianthus periolaris) [<a href="#12">12</a>].  In more mature
stands it is often found with prairie sandreed, sandhill lovegrass
(Eragrostis trichodes), sand dropseed, sandhill muhley (Muhlenbergia
pungens), and needle-and-thread grass (Stipa comata) [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Regrowth of sand bluestem occurs in late spring.  Shoots originate
primarily from axillary buds and apical meristems of short, terminal
rhizomes [<a href="#51">51</a>].  Studying the growth of the cultivar 'Elida in eastern
Colorado, Sims and others [<a href="#51">51</a>] observed that 26 percent of blade growth
occurred by May 29, 81 percent by June 30, and 99 percent by July 28.
Most of the leaves were dry by September 5, and all were dry by October
14.

Sand bluestem exhibits ecotypic variation in relation to the time of
flowering and maturity.  Plants from the northern and western areas of
its range flower earlier than plants growing in the southern and eastern
portion of its range [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Flowering dates in several states was
reported as follows [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>]:

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Native warm-season grasses, such as sand bluestem, are generally
considered to be tolerant of fire if burned when dormant [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  The
well-developed rhizomes of sand bluestem are apparently deep enough in

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Sand bluestem's response to fire is not well documented. Warm-season
grasses generally are more harmed by fires that occur during active
growth stages than by those that occur during periods of dormancy [<a href="#18">18</a>].
Results from a study comparing grass composition of areas in Nebraska
burned in May and June with that of adjacent unburned areas showed that
sand bluestem cover values decreased by about 2 percent [<a href="#9">9</a>].  In this
study, sand bluestem plants were probably in an early growth stage when
burned, which may account for the slight decrease in cover.  In this
same area of Nebraska, an October fire caused by lightning strikes
resulted in no change in sand bluestem phytomass 1 year later [<a href="#39">39</a>].

Annual burning in April in a shinnery oak (Quercus havardi) community in
Oklahoma resulted in increased forage production of sand bluestem [<a href="#64">64</a>].
Burning in April in Kansas caused an increase in the number of
inflorescences of sand bluestem [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fire has the potential to remove the protective vegetation in sandhills,
thereby increasing the frequency of blowout formation [<a href="#39">39</a>].  If
prescribed fires are planned in areas with unstable sandhills, they
should be conducted just before the warm-season grasses present on the
site break dormancy.  This will leave the soil unprotected for the least
amount of time.
