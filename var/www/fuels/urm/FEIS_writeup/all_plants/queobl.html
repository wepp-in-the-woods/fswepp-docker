<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Mexican blue oak is dominant in pure or mixed stands in lower elevation
(less than 5,200 feet [1,585 m]), open, evergreen oak woodlands.  In
encinal communities Arizona white oak (Quercus arizonica) and Emory oak
(Q. emoryi) are codominant with Mexican blue oak and replace it at
higher elevations [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  The Mexican blue oak habitat series
is transitional into semidesert grasslands.  Juniper (Juniperus spp.)
and pinyon (Pinus spp.) occur occasionally in communities where Mexican
blue oak is dominant [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Mexican blue oak is a climax understory
species in the Chihuahua pine (Pinus leiophylla var. chihuahuana) series
[<a href="#24">24</a>].  In the mesic canyons of the southern Trans-Pecos area of Texas,
Mexican blue oak is a characteristic member of the gray oak (Quercus
grisea) series [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Mexican blue oak is listed as a dominant or
indicator species in the following publications:

(1)  Forest and woodland habitat types (plant associations) of Arizona
      south of the Mogollon Rim and southwestern New Mexico [<a href="#3">3</a>]
(2)  Preliminary classification for the coniferous forest and woodland
      series of Arizona and New Mexico [<a href="#24">24</a>]
(3)  Vegetation of the Santa Catalina Mountains: community types and
      dynamics [<a href="#33">33</a>]
(4)  Riparian forest and scrubland community types of Arizona and New
      Mexico [<a href="#40">40</a>]
(5)  Plant communites of Texas (Series level) [<a href="#41">41</a>].

Species associated with Mexican blue oak that were not previously
mentioned in the Distribution and Occurrence information are Arizona
rosewood (Vauquelinia californica), shrubby buckwheat (Eriogonum
wrightii), catclaw mimosa (Mimosa biuncifera), bullgrass (Muhlenbergia
emersleyi), plains lovegrass (Eragrostis intermedia), fendlerbush
(Fendlera rupicola), and wolftail (Lycurus pheleoides) [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus oblongifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Mexican blue oak has hard, strong wood that is brittle and heavy
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  The wood checks severely when drying [<a href="#6">6</a>].  It is used in small
amounts for fuel and furniture production [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Mexican blue oak provides food and cover for livestock and wildlife.  It
is browsed by white-tailed and mule deer [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  In the Pusch Ridge
Wilderness, Arizona, Mexican blue oak is a major browse species for
bighorn sheep [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Acorns are consumed by cattle and wildlife such as
deer, collared peccary, squirrels, and other rodents [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].
Numerous amphibians and reptiles use the communities in which Mexican
blue oak occurs [<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Mexican blue oak leaves are highly palatable yearlong to white-tailed
and mule deer [<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The habitat in which Mexican blue oak is dominant provides important
cover for mule deer [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
On the lower slopes of Santa Catalina Mountains, Arizona, Mexican blue
oak is codominant with Emory oak in a mixed oak woodland.  In this
community ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) has very low primary
productivity per year (5.7 mg/ha/yr) [<a href="#18">18</a>].  These woodlands are
noncommercial and have low net primary productivity [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Biomass and
volume equations have been developed for Mexican blue oak stand
assessments [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].

In open oak woodlands or savannas where Mexican blue oak occurs, oak
establishment should increase if grasses are preferentially consumed by
livestock [<a href="#31">31</a>].

In Arizona riparian woodlands at lower elevations, Mexican blue oak has
about 10 to 20 percent canopy cover [<a href="#33">33</a>].  At elevations where it is a
community dominant, Mexican blue oak has a density of 9.3 stems per acre
(23 stems/ha) and frequency of 21 percent.  At higher elevations it has
densities of 1.2 to 2.8 (rarely 8) stems per acre (3-7 [rarely 20]
stems/ha) and frequency of 9 percent [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Mexican blue oak is susceptible to the wood-decay fungus Inonotus
andersonii.  In the beginning stages of infection rotted branches drop
off, creating cavities which provide habitat for cavity nesting birds
and other wildlife.  Advanced decay results in the death of older trees
[<a href="#48">48</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus oblongifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Mexican blue oak is a native, evergreen, small tree that grows 16 to 26
feet (5-8 m) tall and 1.5 feet (0.5 m) in diameter with a broadly
spreading crown [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  At higher elevations, its habit is a
shrub [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  The bark is about 1.2 inches (3 cm) thick [<a href="#6">6</a>].  The
leaves are oblong and small, 1 to 2 inches (2.2-5 cm) long, with entire
margins [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Mexican blue oak has solitary or paired pistillate
flowers; the numerous staminate flowers are in catkins [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Acorns
are 0.5 to 0.7 inch (1.2-1.8 cm) long [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  The acorn shell is
very thin and surrounds one seed [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte
   


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Asexual reproduction:  Mexican blue oak sprouts abundantly after the
stem is killed [<a href="#33">33</a>].

Sexual reproduction:  No information on Mexican blue oak acorn
production or germination was found in the literature.  Information is
available for two oak species, Arizona white oak and Emory oak, that
often occur with and may be representative of Mexican blue oak.  Annual
acorn production is highly variable for these two species:  0 to 60
percent of the trees may produce acorns during a growing season.  These
oaks have no seed dormancy.  Most germination occurs within 30 days
after the acorns drop.  Buried acorns germinate more successfully than
acorns lying on the soil surface.  Vertebrates and invertebrates may
consume from 30 to 75 percent of the acorns produced [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Reproductive rates vary among Mexican blue oak populations.  In riparian
canyons in the encinal region of the Santa Catalina Mountains of
Arizona, a Mexican blue oak population exhibited good reproduction with
size classes from seedlings through 23.6 to 35.4 inches (60-90 cm)
d.b.h. present [<a href="#33">33</a>].  In a remnant oak woodland in the San Cayetano
Mountains of Arizona, Mexican blue oak populations were declining.  No
Mexican blue oak seedlings were found, and reproduction was poor.  Of
the trees examined, 94 percent were in older age classes and were
greater than 7.9 feet (2.4 m) tall [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Growth rates of southwestern
oak species are usually slow [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Mexican blue oak is common in foothills, mountains, and canyons from the
upper edge of desert grasslands extending up to pine woodlands
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  It occurs from 4,000 to 6,000 feet (1,219-1,829 m) in
elevation [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  At lower elevations from 2,625 to 3,281 feet
(800-1,000 m), Mexican blue oak fingers into riparian communities
[<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].

Mexican blue oak occurs in semiarid to arid climates with biseasonal
rainfall [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  It is found on soils that are often thin, sandy,
rocky, and poorly developed [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Mexican blue oak may grow on
soils derived from granitic parent materials or mixed alluvium-colluvium
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  It occurs on 15 to 80 percent slopes of all aspects, depending
on moisture availability [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Climax Species

Mexican blue oak is a dominant climax species in lower, open oak
woodlands [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  It is a climax understory species in pine and
pinyon-juniper communities [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Mexican blue oak occasionally
occurs in climax riparian communities [<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Mexican blue oak flowers from March to May as the leaves emerge [6,
12,46].  Fruits mature the autumn after flowering [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Leaves persist
during winter and drop in spring when the new leaves open [<a href="#6">6</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus oblongifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Mexican blue oak is generally top-killed by fire; surviving Mexican blue
oak sprouts [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Oaks generally survive low intensity, fast fires [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Mexican blue oak
may also survive high intensity fires of short duration [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Fires
that occur in closed-canopy oak woodlands are probably high intensity,
stand replacement fires [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Prior to settlement, fire return intervals may have been from 10 to 20
years.  Currently, fire return intervals are longer due to overgrazing
and fire suppression [<a href="#47">47</a>]. 


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tree with adventitious-bud root crown/soboliferous species root sucker
   Tall shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus oblongifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Mexican blue oak is top-killed by fire.  Surviving individuals sprout
prolifically [<a href="#31">31</a>].  The thin shelled acorns probably are killed by fire.
Acorns covered by an insulating layer of soil may survive a low-severity
fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Data from 1963 recorded that Mexican blue oak had sprouted abundantly
after stems were killed by a fire in southeastern Arizona [<a href="#33">33</a>].  The
year the fire occurred was not mentioned by the authors.

In 1983, a wildfire swept through a Madrean evergreen oak woodland with
grass understory in the Santa Catalina Mountains, Arizona.  Burned and
unburned plots were compared 2 years later.  Most Mexican blue oak of
large (greater than 30 cm) size classes survived; only 14.2 percent
died.  Significantly (P=0.011) more individuals produced sprouts in the
burned plots (94 percent) compared to the unburned plots (8 to 16
percent) [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Prescribed burning in Mexican blue oak woodlands may promote sprouting
for wildlife browse.  The open Mexican blue oak woodlands accumulate
dead material slowly and probably would not support frequent (less than
25 years) prescribed fires.
