The currently accepted scientific name of coast live oak is <i> Quercus</i> <i> agrifolia</i>
Nee. Two varieties of coast live oak are recognized [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]: <br><br>

<i>Quercus agrifolia </i> Nee var. <i> agrifolia</i><br> 
<i>Quercus agrifolia</i>  Nee var. <i>oxyadenia</i> (Torr.) J.T. Howell

<p>Coast live oak is included in the black oak subgenus (<i>Erythrobalanus</i>)
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].
Several hybrids between coast live oak and other California black oak
species have been observed [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>]. <i> Quercus a.</i> var. <i> oxyadenia</i> � California black oak (<i>Q. kelloggii</i>) hybrids, known as
<i> Q</i>. � <i>ganderi</i> C.B. Wolf, occur in San Diego County [<a href="#19">19</a>]. California black oak also hybridizes with the typical variety
of coast live oak (<i>Q. a.</i> var. <i> agrifolia</i>). This cross, known as <i>Q</i>. � <i>chasei</i> McMinn, is found in Monterey and
Santa Cruz counties.
Coast live oak also hybridizes with Nuttall's scrub oak (<i>Q. dumosa</i>) [<a href="#100">100</a>].&nbsp;Hybrids between interior live oak (<i>Q. wislizenii</i>) and
the typical variety of coast live oak are known
in many areas in northern California.</p>

<p>There is some uncertainty about the degree of introgression between interior
and coast live oaks. Brophy and Parnell [<a href="#19">19</a>] note that limited hybridization has occurred
but the 2 species remain relatively distinct. Dodd and others [<a href="#39">39</a>] estimate that in the northern part of
interior and coast live oaks' ranges, where hybridization is greatest, up to 60%
of coast live oak may show signs of introgression.</p>

Coast live oak is a conspicuous tree in lower-elevation oak woodlands of California [<a href="#56">56</a>].
California oak woodlands occupy about 10 million acres (4 million ha) and may be divided into 3
types: northern, southern, and foothill
woodlands.&nbsp;The northern oak woodland type is dominated by blue oak (<i>Q. douglasii</i>),
Oregon white oak (<i>Q. garryana</i>), and interior live oak [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Southern oak woodlands are
dominated by coast live oak with or without Engelmann oak (<i>Q. engelmannii</i>), sometimes in
association with bigcone Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga macrocarpa</i>)
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>]. Southern California coast
live oak woodland also has a chaparral phase, dominated by shrubby coast live
oak. Canyon live oak (<i>Q. chrysolepis</i>), gray pine (<i>Pinus sabiana</i>),
California bay (<i>Umbellularia californica</i>), wedgeleaf ceanothus (<i>Ceanothus cuneatus</i>),
chamise (<i>Adenostoma
fasciculatum</i>), and manzanita (<i>Arctostaphylos</i> spp.) are common associates of
coast live oak in chaparral habitats [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>]. The foothill oak
woodland is dominated by blue oak and interior live oak, sometimes with gray pine
[<a href="#11">11</a>].

<p>Coast live oak
frequently codominates in southern California walnut (<i>Juglans californica</i>)
woodland [<a href="#55">55</a>].
It is also a frequent dominant or codominant in mixed evergreen forests
where it grows with valley oak (<i>Q. lobata</i>), tanoak (<i>Lithocarpus densiflorus</i>), Pacific
madrone (<i>Arbutus menziesii</i>), blue oak,
California black oak, interior live oak, California bay, gray pine, and coast
Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> var. <i>menziesii</i>) [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>].
In riparian areas, coast live oak occurs with western sycamore (<i>Platanus racemosa</i>),
white alder (<i>Alnus rhombifolia</i>), Fremont cottonwood (<i>Populus fremontii</i>),
and red alder (<i>A. rubra</i>) [<a href="#10">10</a>].</p>

oak is dominant are available [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>].

<br />

Coast live oak is a native, drought-resistant, evergreen tree, ranging in height
from 19 to 82 feet (6-25 m) and in diameter from 1 to 4 feet (0.3-1.2 m)
[<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>]. The bark of young trees is
smooth. With age, it develops deep furrows, ridges, and a thickness of about 8
to 9% of bole or branch diameter [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>]. The inner bark and cork layers are
thick [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>]. Open-grown
crowns are broad and dense, with foliage often reaching the ground [<a href="#61">61</a>]. In open areas trunks are
usually 4 to 8 feet (1.2-2.8 m) tall; at this height, primary branches originate
and grow horizontally. Trees in dense
stands generally have irregular crowns and few lower branches. In closed stands trunks may be
branchless up to 20 feet (6.2 m) high, where several branches extend diagonally
upward&nbsp; [<a href="#112">112</a>].
Coast live oak stands are typically from 40 to 110 years old.
Individual trees may live over 250 years [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>].

<p>The root system consists of a deep taproot that is usually nonfunctional in large
trees [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>].
Several deep main roots may tap groundwater if present within approximately 36
feet (11 m)
of the soil surface [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>]. Coast live oak
develops extensive horizontal root branches and surface-feeding roots [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>].</p>

<br />

<b><font face="Bell MT">Breeding system:</font></b> Oaks (<i>Quercus</i> spp.) are monoecious with
staminate flowers in naked aments and solitary or clustered pistillate flowers
[<a href="#127">127</a>].

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Pollination:</b></font> Oaks are wind pollinated [<a href="#30">30</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Seed production:</font></b> Coast
live oak is the only black oak in California whose acorns develop in 1 year [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>]. Acorns are 1.0 to 1.5 inches (2.5-3.8 cm) long 
and 0.4 to 0.6 inch (1.0-1.5 cm) wide
[<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>]. Coast live oak � California black oak hybrids' acorns mature in 2 years
[<a href="#100">100</a>]. Information on the age of sexual maturity and age of maximum
production of acorns is lacking [<a href="#30">30</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p>Acorn production is variable within and among years, but coast live oak is
productive relative to other California oak species. Acorn production over a 5-year period was observed
for canyon live oak, coast live oak, valley oak, blue oak, and California black
oak. Canyon live oak was
most productive, and coast live oak was 2nd most productive [<a href="#30">30</a>]. Crop failure is frequent, and large crops may
occur in consecutive years but no more frequently than expected by
chance. In low acorn years, acorns can be absent on up to 90% of trees: this occurred in
valley oak, coast live oak, blue oak stands observed in Santa Barbara, San Luis
Obispo, and San Benito counties [<a href="#48">48</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though crop size is variable, it is often synchronized across oak populations
and species. Synchronization is more common among California oak species whose
acorns mature in the same year, but it also can occur among species with
different acorn maturation times [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>]. Synchronization may be detectable on areas as large as 190 to
390 square miles (500-1000 km<sup>2</sup>) [<a href="#71">71</a>]. Observation of acorn production cycles among canyon live oak,
coast live oak, valley oak, blue oak, and California black oak in the Santa Lucia Mountains of central
California found no species-specific
patterns in acorn production. The 5 oaks were observed over 12 years; at only 2 of 60
date/year combinations (3.3% of sample dates) was there no acorn production from any
species. Coast live oak, however, had crop failures (acorns per tree averaging
less than 1) 50% of the time [<a href="#74">74</a>].</p>

<p>Several nonmutually exclusive hypotheses seek to explain the variability and
synchronicity of California oak acorn crop sizes. This may be an adaptation to
seed predation as high acorn production years have incomplete seed consumption
and allow leftover seed to establish [<a href="#74">74</a>].&nbsp;Synchronicity
over large geographic areas may also be because the areas experience similar
environmental conditions [<a href="#73">73</a>]. One study found that acorn crops for coast live oak and
canyon live oak were larger when
the previous 1 and 2 years had more rain [<a href="#72">72</a>]. Another 5-year study found no correlation between crop size and 14 weather variables
[<a href="#30">30</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Seed </font>dispersal:</b> Coast live oak retains its acorns longer than
other California oaks. Most of its acorns are dropped in fall, but some remain
attached to trees until spring. This adaptation reduces seed loss to birds and
small mammals such as squirrels, magpies, and scrub jays; in small crop years
100% of the crop may be consumed [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>]. Though seed predation
may be high, it also provides a means of seed dispersal. Seed-caching animals such as
the scrub jay and California ground squirrel
are important to species survival, as acorns buried by these animals are more likely to develop into seedlings
than acorns that have not been cached [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>]. Scrub jays cache about 5,000 acorns each year over
an average home range of about 6.2 acres (2.5 ha), effectively seedling at a rate of
800 acorns per acre (2,000 per ha). Though 95% of cached acorns are found and eaten, remaining acorns have high
germination and survival rates because they are typically cached about 0.4 inch
(1 cm) below the soil surface [<a href="#89">89</a>].&nbsp;Scrub jays prefer burned sites
for acorn caching [<a href="#101">101</a>].</p> 

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Seed </font>banking:</b> Little information is available regarding coast live
oak seed banks, but, because coast live oak acorns have no dormancy requirement, it is
reasonable to assume that seed banks are small.</p>

<p><b>Germination:</b> Coast live oak acorns
have no dormancy requirement and germinate 15 to 50 days after
falling [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>].
Germination is slower than other California oaks; this limits coast live oak
establishment on dry sites [<a href="#84">84</a>]. Griffin [<a href="#55">55</a>]
found 100% viability of acorns collected in the Carmel Valley, while Mirov
and Kraebel [<a href="#96">96</a>] reported 73% germination of
acorns collected in Berkeley. Fifty percent germination after 18 days of 55 to
68 degrees Fahrenheit (13-20 �C) controlled climate without stratification has also been reported
[<a href="#85">85</a>].
Acorns with low moisture content
show higher rates of germination and produce taller seedlings than do acorns
with high moisture content, but unviable seed is not a serious problem for this
species [<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>].</p> 

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Seedling establishment/</font>growth:</b> Seedling
top-growth is slow under natural conditions, with early development concentrated
on rapid, early root growth [<a href="#85">85</a>].&nbsp;Lateral
root growth of 9.8 inches (25 cm) in 6 months has been observed under moist controlled conditions
[<a href="#25">25</a>]. In the field, coast live oak taproot elongation of
approximately 28 inches (70 cm) in 2 months has been noted [<a href="#35">35</a>].&nbsp;Under ideal
nursery conditions, coast live oak
seedlings have attained heights of 5 to 8 feet (15.2-24.4 m) in 2 years [<a href="#126">126</a>].</p>

<p>Acorn predation strongly limits establishment in small crop years, but
seedling survival rates are also low [<a href="#101">101</a>]. At sites in the Central and South Coast ranges, current sapling-to-tree
ratios are 1:3 or lower [<a href="#99">99</a>]. Common causes
of mortality include herbivory and livestock trampling and inadequate moisture [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>].
Mortality
results from aboveground or root herbivory by domestic livestock, black-tailed
deer, pocket gophers, grasshoppers, cutworms, and feral pigs [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p> Coast live oak is more susceptible to drought than other California oaks.
In experimental soils wherein subsurface moisture was controlled and dried
while leaving a moist surface horizon, coast live oak did not increase lateral
root production when the vertical root tip died in dry soil. In contrast, blue
oak and valley oak both responded to the treatment with increased lateral growth; these
morphological differences are consistent with the species' different ranges [<a href="#25">25</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of drought and herbivory's deleterious effects on seedling survival, recruitment is best among germinants growing in
shade, where herbivory protection and water availability are higher [<a href="#135">135</a>].
Recruitment among rock outcrops is
relatively common as this offers some protection from large browsers [<a href="#57">57</a>]. Common nurse
plants are California heathgoldenrod (<i>Ericameria ericoides</i>), chamise, coyote
bush (<i>Baccharis pilularis</i>), purple sage (<i>Salvia leucophylla</i>),
orange bush monkeyflower (<i>Diplacus aurantiacus </i>ssp. <i>
aurantiacus</i>), chamisso bush lupine (<i>Lupinus chamissonis</i>), California sagebrush (<i>Artemisia</i>
<i>californica</i>) and poison-oak (<i>Toxicodendron</i> <i> diversilobum</i>) [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>]. Eighty percent of
seedlings found on sites in the Santa Ynez Valley of Santa Barbara County were
growing under purple sage or California sagebrush. Another 15% grew under mature coast live oak. Mortality due
to herbivory was considerably higher among seedlings under parent trees [<a href="#26">26</a>].
Establishment is generally greater in coastal sage scrub than in other types of chaparral [<a href="#28">28</a>]. A study of coast live oak seedling establishment, with and without nurse
shrubs and cages for protection, found that acorns planted in the open had
higher germination but lower 1-year survival. Between 1 and 2 years of age, nurse
shrubs had no effect on seedling survival, but cages continued to have a positive
effect by reducing black-tailed deer browsing [<a href="#103">103</a>]. Another study of coast live oak establishment at 2 sites in central
California showed strong association of seedlings with
shrubs. Shrub cover was 30%,&nbsp; but
80% of coast live oak seedlings were under canopies. In 2 years of monitored growth, survivorship
was 0% in open areas and 31% under shrubs. Seedlings in the open were grazed
more, but drought also increased stress. Mortality related to moisture and temperature
stress was 17% under shrubs and 63% in the open. The authors noted that
differential

Coast live oak occurs in a mediterranean climate characterized by mild, wet
winters and hot, dry summers. Climatic extremes are modified near the coast, where
trees receive more precipitation than inland populations [<a href="#38">38</a>].
Trees generally occur on mesic sites such as north slopes, alluvial terraces, canyon bottoms,
or upper streambanks [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>].
Coast live oak's preference for mesic sites is most pronounced in the southern
part of its range [<a href="#94">94</a>]. Coast live oak may
grow where it can access groundwater, but most individuals have extensive shallow
root networks [<a href="#69">69</a>].<p> Low-elevation coastal populations of coast live
oak generally grow in loam, while higher-elevation coastal populations are
associated with shaley clay-loam soil. Inland populations are found on sandy
soil, while those in southern California
islands grow in clay or clayey loam [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].
Coast live oak tolerates serpentine soils [<a href="#46">46</a>].
Coast live oak
is often associated with depositional environments, deeper soils, and higher organic
matter. Though coast live oak occurs on a wide range of soil textures, denser soils with claypans generally favor
blue oak development [<a href="#41">41</a>].

<p>Elevations of coast live oak populations range from sea level to 3,000 feet
(914 m) in central and northern California and from sea level to 5,000 feet (1,524
m) in southern California [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>]. Coast
live oak occurs at slightly higher elevations in Baja California. On the coastal side of the
Sierra Juarez
coast live oak grows below 4,260 (1,300 m), and on western slopes
of Sierra San Pedro Martir, elevations range from 3,930 to 5,580
(1,200-1,700
m) [<a href="#94">94</a>].</p>

Ecologists refer to changes in the grassland, chaparral, and oak
woodland mosaic of California as &quot;non-directional fluctuations&quot; rather than succession [<a href="#12">12</a>].
Coast live oak may be considered seral or climax depending on habitat, but it is tolerant of shade throughout its
life [<a href="#112">112</a>].
Where their ranges overlap, deciduous trees such as blue oak and California black
oak are seral to coast live oak [<a href="#13">13</a>]. However,
because deer and cattle prefer coast live oak, it is gradually replaced by
California bay in some areas of coastal northern California where the 2
species codominate [<a href="#88">88</a>]. In mixed evergreen
forest that is burned or logged, a coast live oak phase is seral to the climax evergreen
deciduous and conifer forest. However, on steep slopes or poor sites within this
habitat type, coast live oak
represents a topographic or edaphic climax [<a href="#7">7</a>]. Succession
on coastal dunes at Asilomar State Park on the Monterey Peninsula includes an
early stage of beach wormwood (<i>Artemisia pycnocephala</i>) and/or California
heathgoldenrod on slopes; the next sere includes dense shrub (coyote bush,
seaside woollysunflower (<i>Eriophyllum stoechadifolium</i>),
California coffeeberry (<i>Rhamnus
californica</i>), poison-oak, and Pacific dewberry (<i>Rubus vitifolius</i>)) development with coast live oak and/or
gray pine in the overstory. If fire frequency and
deer numbers are low, coast live oak replaces gray pine [<a href="#9">9</a>]. In the San Francisco Bay area light
browsing allows coyote bush to
invade grasslands, and coyote bush subsequently facilitates coast live
oak woodland development [<a href="#121">121</a>]. In the absence
of disturbance, coyote bush brushland almost always gives way to coast live oak
and California bay, as coyote bush seedlings do not
develop beneath their own canopies [<a href="#138">138</a>].

<p>Recruitment of most oaks in California has declined, with some species not
regenerating rapidly enough to maintain current density. There
is much debate about the causes of change and size of decline, but it appears
that recruitment patterns are dependent on both species and locality&nbsp; [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Overall coast live oak and interior live oak are recruiting at higher
rates than the deciduous oaks of the region; this may be because of pocket
gophers' preference for the roots of deciduous oaks over those of live oaks
[<a href="#57">57</a>].
Generally, coast live oak woodlands with shrub understories have stable
population structures, and more xeric woodlands with herbaceous understories are
likely to be recruitment limited [<a href="#28">28</a>].</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT">
SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Coast live oak defers growth until winter as a drought evasion strategy [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].
Approximately 90% of stem elongation occurs in March, but some elongation occurs
from December to April, depending on elevation. Prior to stem growth, total
non-structural carbohydrate concentration of branches peaks at 5.5% [<a href="#97">97</a>]. Leaves emerge from February to April; and old leaves are shed at the
same time [<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>].
Transpiration and photosynthesis are highest in spring but leaves are
functioning year-round [<a href="#97">97</a>].<br><br>

Coast live oak begins flower and fruit production during stem elongation in
the spring [<a href="#97">97</a>]. Flowering of coast live oak is triggered by warm temperature. This is in
contrast to many other black oaks, which flower in response to photoperiod [<a href="#134">134</a>].
Catkins emerge in March and April, and acorns ripen in September and October [<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].
Damaged acorns are aborted in August through October [<a href="#101">101</a>].
Fall and early winter storms remove acorns from trees [<a href="#97">97</a>]. Seed is dispersed between late fall and early winter.
Germination is from late November to January in low elevations and in January
and February at higher elevations [<a href="#85">85</a>]. Shoots are visible in late winter [<a href="#26">26</a>].

<a name="FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS">
FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font> Coast live oak is exceptionally fire
resistant, more so than other California oak species. Adaptations to fire include
evergreen leaves, thick bark, and sprouting ability. Evergreen leaves allow coast live
oak to allocate greater amounts of energy to recovery from fire than to
replacing the entire crown annually.
Evergreens are often better able to conserve nutrients than deciduous
species, and are favored in fire-prone environments [<a href="#91">91</a>].
Coast live oak bark is the thickest among California oaks; it is mainly composed of live inner bark with little dead outer
tissue [<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>]. Oaks are
more likely to be damaged by fall fire than earlier fires [<a href="#112">112</a>]. Because of
mortality among small-diameter trees, frequent fire limits coast live oak
invasion of grasslands [<a href="#92">92</a>].

<p>Coast live oaks sprout
from the main trunk and upper crown even after severe burning [<a href="#113">113</a>].
When trees are top-killed, they sprout from the root crown [<a href="#38">38</a>].
Vigorous sprouting is supported by food reserves stored in the extensive root
system [<a href="#33">33</a>]. Resprouting from the root crown
often occurs during the first 2
months after being blackened by fire, but some charred trees do not resprout for 2 to 3
years [<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>].
Prefire crown volume is generally recovered, or nearly so, in about 8 to 10
postfire years
[<a href="#112">112</a>].</p>

<p>Roots are protected from fire by an outer corky layer and soil. Coast live oak
roots generally suffer little direct heat damage except to feeder roots near the
soil surface [<a href="#111">111</a>]. Acorns on the soil
surface are killed by low-severity fire, while animal-buried acorns usually
survive moderate-severity fire, sometimes allowing high rates of postfire
establishment [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>]. Severe fire may kill even buried
acorns, and complete removal of shrubs by fire may reduce coast live oak seedling survival
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>].&nbsp;By caching acorns in burned areas burned
areas, which are preferred caching sites, scrub jays may facilitate postfire
establishment of coast live oak seedlings [<a href="#101">101</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Fire </font>regimes:</b> Fire frequency largely
defines the extent of coastal sage scrub, chaparral, and oak woodland; in
these habitats decreasing fire frequency tends to favor the development of coast
live oak. Conversely, where coast live oak occurs in mixed evergreen forests (or
where coast Douglas-fir is invading oak woodlands), frequent fire favors coast live oak and other seral species. One study of vegetation dynamics in
coastal sage scrub, chaparral, and oak woodland
near Santa Barbara found that without fire or livestock grazing, coastal sage scrub
was replaced by coast live oak woodland at a rate of 0.3% annually. Grassland to coastal sage scrub
transition occurred at a rate of 0.69%
per year, and oak woodland reverted to grassland at a rate of 0.08% per year. On burned
areas without
livestock grazing or on unburned sites with livestock grazing, rates of
transition of grassland to coastal scrub and coastal scrub to oak woodland were lower and the rate of oak
woodland reversion to grassland was higher
[<a href="#27">27</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Oak woodlands:</font> Analysis of oak pollen (primarily that of coast live oak)
records showed that oak woodlands remained stable for up to 4 centuries before
major European-American settlement (approximately 1470 to 1870). Coinciding with
a decrease in fire frequency between 1870 and 1985, percent oak pollen increased to its
highest
level in 560 years. The 2-fold increase in oak pollen reflected both increase in
oak density and in area occupied [<a href="#92">92</a>]. Coast live oak woodlands may experience an increase
in shrub cover in the absence of frequent fire or heavy grazing, but there are
also reports of oak savannas and
adjacent grasslands that, without fire for 50 years,
have not had a noticeable increase in shrub cover. Sites without shrub increase
are generally south
facing and/or on shallow soils [<a href="#57">57</a>].
Generally, grass is present in open stands, while closed stands have up to 5 inches (12.7 cm) of oak
litter [<a href="#112">112</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Riparian forests:</font> Coast live oak associates in riparian areas include white
alder, California sycamore, and Fremont cottonwood, all of which are sprout
after fire. Severe fire was apparently historically rare in these habitats.
Currently most fire is accidental and of high severity, causing relatively high rates of
top-kill and basal sprouting of coast lie oak and associated tree species [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Mixed evergreen forests:</font> Where coast live oak occurs in mixed evergreen
forests of coast Douglas-fir<i>,</i> tanoak, and Pacific madrone, historic fire return intervals were less than 35 years, with
fires generally occurring between late August and November after termination of
radial growth [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>]. In many of these
stands fire ceased in the early to mid-1900s, and there has been a concomitant
increase in coast Douglas-fir density. Bowcutt [<a href="#18">18</a>] states that coast Douglas-fir increase in coast live oak woodlands may
indicate that such stands, when coast Douglas-fir was not present, represented
&quot;a disclimax created by native
people through burning.&quot; A study of fire frequency and coast Douglas-fir
establishment on Point Reyes Peninsula, where coast live oak occurs with California bay,
showed coast Douglas-fir establishment greatly accelerated with cessation of
fire in the early 1900s. Fire history of 2 such sites is provided
below; only 1 fire scar was observed after 1945 [<a href="#22">22</a>]:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chaparral and coastal sage scrub: Prior to settlement, chaparral communities in which coast live oak
grows in a shrubby, shorter form had mean fire intervals of 10 to 30 years [<a href="#106">106</a>]. With land use conversion and urbanization, fire frequency has
decreased. In the Santa Monica Mountains, chaparral sites dominated by California sagebrush, California
brittlebrush (<i>Encelia californica</i>), coastal buckwheat (<i>Eriogonum
cinereum</i>),
purple sage, and black sage (<i>Salvia mellifera</i>) (with 11 to 19% cover of coast live oak) had fires in 1903, 1945 and
1978. A similar site with 5.2% coast live oak cover had fire in 1903 and 1978 [<a href="#82">82</a>]. In most chaparral and coastal scrub areas, fire regimes are entirely
anthropogenic, and with urbanization, steep slopes, containment difficultly, and
erosion potential, fire's current use is limited [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>]. The absence of
fire, particularly in coastal sage scrub, has allowed coast live oak to increase
in density and area. On sites in the Monterey Bay area with fire exclusion for
over 70 years, coast live oak has increased significantly (p&lt;0.001) from 2 to
5.5% between 1976 and 2000. Where coast live oak has developed, understory
density and diversity have declined dramatically [<a href="#133">133</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Fire intervals:</font> Greenlee and Langenheim [<a href="#54">54</a>] described fire regimes of different
coast live oak associated communities in the Monterrey Bay area between
aboriginal time and present. Their results, presented below, show the remarkable
decline in fire frequency in the recent era (1929 was chosen to demarcate the
recent fire regime because of restrictions that were put in place against
burning). &quot;Probable mean fire interval&quot; refers to estimates of
fire intervals that are derived from historical or very limited physical
evidence.</p>

IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Coast live oak seedlings and saplings less than 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter
may be top-killed by low- to moderate-severity fire, and severe fire kills trees of this
size [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>].
Because of vascular cambium protection, mature trees have high fire survival
rates, even with crown fire. Heavily charred bark has a checkered appearance and frequently exfoliates, but damage typically extends only 0.5 to 0.8
inch (1.3-1.9 cm) into the bark. If cambium death occurs in large trees it is
typically in small scars at the base [<a href="#112">112</a>]. Trees greater than 6 to
8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) in diameter resist top-kill [<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>]. Saplings 2 to 6 inches
(5.1-152 cm) in diameter are top-killed by severe
fire. An "extremely hot" crown fire on the San Bernardino National Forest caused
only 4% coast live oak mortality. Ninety percent of the oaks less
than 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter were top-killed, and 2% were killed. Of
trees greater than 6 inches (15.2 cm) in diameter, the trunks and crowns of all
but 5% survived the fire without top-kill (the 5% includes 3% that were
top-killed
and 2% killed) [<a href="#111">111</a>].

<p>For small diameter trees, mortality as a result of low- to moderate-severity
fire depends on tree height and location with respect to other tree crowns. Fire mortality of
Engelmann oak and coast live oak
(in a woodland with herbaceous and coastal sage scrub species in the understory)
was studied for trees less
than 3.9 inches (10 cm) in diameter: of 1,214 small trees surveyed, 531 survived 5
years after fire. Mortality was similar
for each species: 56% for coast live oak and 59% for Engelmann oak. Mortality
was 50% among trees 11.8 to 15.7 inches (30-40 cm) tall, 30% among those
29.3 to 78.7 inches (1-2 m) tall, and 10%
among trees taller than 78.7 inches (2 m). In gaps between tree canopies mortality was
significantly lower (p&lt;0.0001). Coast live
oak mortality was 40% in gaps and 59% under canopies [<a href="#78">78</a>]&nbsp;.Generally
mortality of coast live oak is greater when there is a considerable shrub
understory or when trees are adjacent to chaparral. Coast live oak in the Santa
Monica Mountains was killed in large numbers when a hot chaparral fire burned
into the oak woodland [<a href="#123">123</a>].</p>

Coast live oak generally recovers well from fire, although severely burned
crowns, trunks, and root crowns may require several years to sprout. If
sprouting occurs within several postfire months, basal sprouts can be 2 to
3 feet (0.6-0.91 m) tall in 2 years, and crown density can be 80 to 100% of
prefire levels
within 10 years [<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>]. The most common fire
damage to the trunk is a basal wound resulting in potential cambium death. Wounds
less than a few inches in size may eventually heal with no accompanying heart rot, but
larger wounds are susceptible to fungal and bacterial pathogens and insect
infestation [<a href="#120">120</a>].

<p>Recovery of coast live oak following severe fire on the San Bernardino National Forest showed patterns typical of the species.
Mortality and top-kill rates were highest among the smallest size classes. Basal
sprouting was common in smaller size classes and crown sprouting (or crown
sprouting in addition to basal sprouting) was more common among larger size
classes. Sprouting and mortality rates were observed after 5 years on 0.64-acre
(0.25 ha) transects; rates are summarized below by
size class [<a href="#111">111</a>]:</p>

<p>Coast live oak experiences severe fire in riparian habitats. After the high-severity Wheeler Fire near Ojai,
California, coast live oak, white
alder, and California sycamore all sprouted. Most burnt tree trunks
remained after fire until storms the following winter, when some were uprooted.
Six of 19 coast live oak boles blew down in winter. Sprouting rates were 7% for white alder, 83%
for California sycamore, and 70% for coast live oak. Basal sprouting of
coast live oak was positively correlated (p&lt;0.001) with tree
size [<a href="#37">37</a>].</p>

<p>Regeneration from acorns following fire is variable, depending on fire severity
and site characteristics. Acorn survival is high in low- to moderate-severity
fire, particularly when acorns have been cached by animals. Acorn survival in
severe fire is low, and postfire seedling recruitment is slower. Following a severe fire in Ventura County, burned sites supported no
coast live oak germinants the following spring, while
adjacent unburned areas produced new seedlings [<a href="#37">37</a>].
Fire in an Engelmann oak/coast live oak stand in southern California had positive
effects on coast live oak seedling establishment. In the 2 years preceding fire there
was no establishment; in 5 postfire years 1,118 oak seedlings established, of which
1,025 were coast live
oak. Establishment was greatest under
the outer edges of canopies, particularly for coast live oak [<a href="#78">78</a>].</p>

FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Use of fire is recommended for managing coast live oak woodlands
[<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>].
The outstanding fire resistance of this species ensures that few large trees are killed by
low to moderate-severity prescribed fire.
Fire reduces coast and big-cone Douglas-fir where they invade or increase in
density in oak
woodland [<a href="#64">64</a>]. Oak regeneration is favored
because scrub jays prefer burns as acorn-caching sites [<a href="#101">101</a>].
Large trees do not always sprout during the 1st postfire growing season, and Plumb
and Gomez [<a href="#112">112</a>] recommend waiting at least 1 growing season, possibly up to
3, if there is a desire to remove large trees with
uncertain potential for crown survival. Dougherty and Riggan [<a href="#40">40</a>] report that in San Diego County,
prescribed fire in coast live oak
woodland (with desert ceanothus (<i>Ceanothus greggii</i>) and Nuttall's scrub oak in the understory)
achieved litter reduction goals
only temporarily. Within 1 to 3 years, they estimate, litter falling from lightly burned parts of
the lower canopy would increase surface litter to its former coverage.

<p>Fire exclusion in coastal sage scrub and mesic chaparral communities allows
coast live oak to increase in density and reduce understory diversity and
abundance [<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>]. Van Dyke and Holl [<a href="#133">133</a>] recommend prescribed burning in coastal sage scrub to
maintain scrub species and associated herbaceous species and to slow coast live
oak expansion. Fire managers in southern California have made fire control lines in coast
live oak riparian woodlands when planning broadcast burning of adjacent
chaparral and coastal scrub. Control lines are burned to create a fuelbreak
[<a href="#40">40</a>].
Green [<a href="#52">52</a>] offers much information on prescribed fire planning
in chaparral.</p>

Flammability of coast live oak and chaparral communities with a coast live
oak component is of particular concern because of
their high fuel loading and proximity to urban areas. Some fire-excluded chaparral habitats have fuel accumulations of 30 to 40 tons
per acre (73 to 97 t/ha) [<a href="#59">59</a>].&nbsp;Fuel modification is of greatest
value in the immediate area around development. Recommendations for property
protection include: planting trees away from
structures, trimming low branches, selecting less flammable landscaping species, using nonflammable
construction materials, and, where trees already grow near homes, removing
overhanging branches [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>]. See the <a href="https://www.firewise.org">Firewise</a>
website for specific
recommendations. Domestic goat grazing (at a rate of 240 goats/acre (600 goats/ha) for 1 day),
in conjunction with prescribed fire, has been used to reduce fuel loading and
continuity in dense coast live oak chaparral near housing developments [<a href="#131">131</a>].

IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Coast live oak woodlands are some of the most important habitats to wildlife in
California [<a href="#48">48</a>]. These communities are
preferred habitat for black bear and black-tailed deer.
In chaparral areas where shrubs predominate, coast live oak stands with an
understory of mixed shrubs and forbs are critical to black-tailed deer [<a href="#114">114</a>].
Coast live oak provides browse for black-tailed deer and various rodents and
lagomorphs [<a href="#122">122</a>]. Feral
pigs and pocket gophers eat the roots, and black bear, feral pig, black-tailed deer, rodents, and
various upland game and nongame birds consume the acorns heavily [<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>].
Coast live oak litter provides excellent hunting opportunities for
insectivorous vagrant and ornate shrews [<a href="#114">114</a>].
Cattle eat coast live oak sprouts [<a href="#109">109</a>]. Most
livestock do not readily browse mature foliage, although domestic goats eat it
year-round [<a href="#53">53</a>]. Livestock readily consume
the acorns [<a href="#122">122</a>].

<p>Coast live oak communities support a number of bird species including the federally endangered least Bell's vireo
and least tern [<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>]. Acorns of coast live oak are of particular value to acorn feeders, as
they are retained on tree for up to 8 months [<a href="#30">30</a>]. Acorn-dependent
birds include the acorn
woodpecker, yellow-billed magpie, and scrub jay [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>]. Acorns comprise over 50%
of diets of the acorn woodpecker and scrub jay in fall and winter [<a href="#77">77</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Palatability/nutritional value:</b></font>  Nutritional
information on coast live oak foliage is sparse. One study found the protein
content of leaves was 4.6% in December. Springtime protein levels were
not determined; however, protein content of interior live oak, a closely related
species, was 17.6% in May [<a href="#15">15</a>]. Coast live oak acorns
are 6.26% protein, 16.7% fat, and 54.7% carbohydrate [<a href="#6">6</a>].
The palatability of coast live oak foliage has been rated useless for cattle and
horses, poor to useless for domestic sheep, and fair to poor for black-tailed deer [<a href="#122">122</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Cover value:</font></b> 
Western sycamore/coast live oak communities in the South Coast Ranges provide
wintering grounds for 32 species of birds, at a density of approximately 251 birds per acre
(620/ha) [<a href="#44">44</a>]. An estimated 41% of owl
territories in southern California are interior and coast live oak/bigcone Douglas-fir forests.
Owls are benefited by fire in adjacent chaparral, which increases prey
populations [<a href="#137">137</a>]. Red-shouldered hawks rely heavily on coast live oak woodlands in southern
California but adapt
to urban woodlands as well [<a href="#16">16</a>].</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES">
VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES:</a>
</span>
<br />

Coast live oak is favored for use in rehabilitation projects throughout its
range. It is used in watershed improvement, restoration, and wildlife habitat rehabilitation projects [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>].
In the Sepulveda Wildlife Reserve of Los Angeles County, nursery seedlings were
planted for slope stabilization and wildlife habitat improvement. Survival of
these seedlings was between 40 and 75% over 3 years [<a href="#104">104</a>].
Transplants along the Santa Margarita River in San Diego County have also shown
good survival [<a href="#117">117</a>]. In eastern Ventura
County, coast live oak was planted to help restore the ecotone between saltbush
(<i>Atriplex</i> spp.), black sage, and annual grassland communities
[<a href="#105">105</a>]. Recommendations for nursery growth of
coast live oak are 36 to 41 degrees Fahrenheit (2.5-5 �C) acorn storage, germination in wet vermiculite,
and planting in tar paper tubes filled with 25% topsoil, 25% organic matter, and 50%
sand. Burger and others [<a href="#24">24</a>] also recommend transferring seedlings to glass houses
after 0.8 inch (2 cm) of aboveground growth. Root fragments seldom host both ecto- and
endomycorrhizae; inoculating
with both types is generally detrimental [<a href="#43">43</a>]. Coast live oak is also established by
acorn plantings. In the Berkeley Hills, seedlings grown from locally collected
acorns had 75% survival in their 1st year. Seedlings were
hand-watered twice during summer because of drought [<a href="#116">116</a>].
Seedling survival is enhanced by weeding competitors, providing protection
against herbivores and acorn predators with above- and belowground wire caging,
and providing microsite shading. Acorns are collected from local oaks in late
fall. Planting density recommendations and other cultivation methods have been
detailed [<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>].
Large oak trees slated for removal because of roadway or other construction have
been successfully transplanted onto favorable sites using heavy equipment [<a href="#34">34</a>].

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="OTHER USES">
OTHER USES:</a>
</span>
<br />

Coast live oak is used as an urban ornamental tree [<a href="#24">24</a>]. Coast live oaks were planted by Native Americans
of the region as a source of food. In some parts of the northern California coast live oak may have expanded its range into interior live oak
habitats as acorns
were planted further inland [<a href="#119">119</a>].

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Wood Products: </b></font>Coast live oak wood is
primarily used for fuel. Some commercial charcoal is made from the wood. Though
the wood is hard, heavy, and fine-grained, it is
unsuitable for lumber, as it cracks easily and warps badly [<a href="#112">112</a>].</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Mesic coast live oak woodlands with shrub understories have adequate
regeneration, while xeric woodlands are
likely to have limited recruitment [<a href="#28">28</a>].&nbsp;Thus, northern coastal populations of this tree are
generally stable, but the species is in decline
in southern California [<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>].
Coast live oak regeneration in xeric sites can be improved by reducing grazing intensity or
protecting individual seedlings from livestock [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>]. Other threats to this oak
include urban and rural development, increased recreational
use of oak woodlands, and cutting trees for firewood [<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>].
Some coast live oak woodlands were cleared to increase forage for domestic
livestock, but since the early 1970s, urban and residential development have had
a much larger impact&nbsp;[<a href="#1">1</a>]. Coast live oak populations in Baja California were not
as heavily logged as in California, as natural gas and propane were available
when human populations in the area expanded. Here heavy grazing around population centers
has been the
primary anthropogenic limitation on recruitment [<a href="#95">95</a>].

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Diseases:</font></b> Coast and interior live oaks are susceptible to oak drippy-nut disease, which
develops after wasps, acorn weevils, or other acorn feeders puncture acorns and allow
the bacteria <i>Erwinia</i> <i> quercina</i> to develop within [<a href="#17">17</a>]. <i> Diplodia</i> <i> quercina</i>, a
fungal pathogen that grows hyphae through wounds, may cause dieback of large branches
of coast live oak, valley oak, and California black oak. &quot;Twigblight&quot; in coast and
interior live oaks is caused by the fungal pathogens <i> Cryptocline</i> <i>
cinerescens</i> and <i> Discula</i> <i>quercina</i>; dieback may range from a few twigs to the
entire crown [<a href="#60">60</a>]. Epidemics of oak wilt disease, caused by the pathogen <i>Ceratocystis</i>
<i>fagacearum</i>, have occurred among
Texas oaks in urban forests and in live oak (<i>Q. virginiana</i>) savannas; coast and interior live oaks
are more resistant [<a href="#4">4</a>]. Watering during summer may cause root rot as a result of <i>Armillaria</i>
<i> mellea</i> infection or crown rot as a result of <i>Phytophthora</i> spp.
infection [<a href="#60">60</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<b><font face="Bell MT">Insects:</font></b> The California oakworm (<i>Phryganidia</i> <i>californica</i>) feeds on older 
leaves in early summer and
leaves of all ages later in summer [<a href="#87">87</a>]. This moth occurs at low density in
most years but periodically, in approximately 5- to 7-year intervals, increases to outbreak levels
that defoliate coast
live oak [<a href="#62">62</a>]. The
California oakworm may feed on coast live oak year-round, as it has summer and
winter generations that feed without diapause. Outbreak frequency may be related
to climate: cold winters cause mortality [<a href="#93">93</a>]. Acorn feeders include the acorn weevil (<i>Curculio occidentalis</i>)
and to a lesser extent, the filbertworm (<i>Melissopus</i> <i>latiferreanus</i>).
One survey in northern California found that 38% of
coast live oak acorns had some boring and larval infestation, 70% of which were
acorn weevils and 30% were filbertworms. Infestation was greater on cooler, more shaded aspects of
trees [<a href="#79">79</a>].
