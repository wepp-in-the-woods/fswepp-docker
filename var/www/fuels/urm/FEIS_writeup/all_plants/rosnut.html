<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Nootka rose is listed as a dominant understory shrub in the following
publication:

Plant communities and soils of north slopes in the palouse region of
   eastern Washington and northern Idaho [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Common plant associates of Nootka rose include common snowberry
(Symphoricarpos albus), red-osier dogwood (Cornus sericea), trembling
aspen (Populus tremuloides), and black cottonwood (P. trichocarpa) [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rosa nutkana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Nootka rose is important wildlife browse.  Mule deer, white-tailed deer,
elk, moose, caribou, bighorn sheep, bears, coyotes, and various rodents
eat the fruits.  Squirrrels, mice, beavers, and porcupines eat the twigs
and leaves [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Nootka rose fruits are preferred by deer, elk, and squirrels [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Nootka rose thickets are used for nesting and escape cover by birds and
small mammals [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Nootka rose provides good cover for waterfowl in
Wyoming [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Nootka rose has successfully been used for rehabilitating disturbed
sites at Columbia River Gorge, Oregon [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In a Douglas-fir/ninebark (Pseudotsuga menziesii/Physocarpus malvaceus)
habitat type in Idaho, Nootka rose cover was greater on disturbed sites
than on undisturbed sites.  Average cover was highest (7.7 percent) on
grazed sites [<a href="#7">7</a>].  In 16- to 20-year-old lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta)
regeneration in northeastern Utah, Nootka rose productivity was little
affected by thinning or clearcutting [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Spring and fall foliar applications of herbicides control Rosa species [<a href="#14">14</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rosa nutkana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Nootka rose is a native, deciduous, perennial shrub 3 to 6 feet (0.9-1.8
m) tall with erect or trailing stems.  Nootka rose reaches its maximum
height within 10 years.  Stems and branches are prickly to unarmed.
Leaves are compound and have five to seven leaflets.  The fruits contain
several long, hairy achenes.  Roots are deep.  Nootka rose has rhizomes
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte
   Chamaephyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Nootka rose attains sexual maturity at 2 to 5 years of age.
Good seed crops are produced about every other year.  Nootka rose is a
seedbanking species.  Seeds exhibit seedcoat dormancy and require a
combination of warm and cold stratification or mechanical disturbance
for germination.  Seeds are dispersed by birds and mammals [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].

Asexual:  Nootka rose sprouts from the root crown and rhizomes [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Nootka rose is commonly found in moderately dry to moist climates in
submontane to montane zones.  It occurs on nitrogen-rich, fresh to very
moist soils.  It frequently occurs in floodplains, open streambanks, and
meadows [<a href="#24">24</a>].  It is sporadic in open-canopy forests with fluctuating
groundwater tables.  It is occasionally found on brackish-water sites or
sites exposed to ocean spray [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Nootka rose grows best at pH ranges
of 5.6 to 7.0.  It thrives on moderately fertile, well-drained
clayey-loam, sandy-loam, or sandy soils [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Nootka rose is tolerant of both sun and shade.  It shows increased
growth and fruit production with increasing light.  Nootka rose
increases in cover with canopy closure, but may produce less fruit [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Nootka rose flowers from May through July [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Fruits ripen in early
fall and remain on the plant through winter [<a href="#13">13</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rosa nutkana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Nootka rose sprouts from rhizomes and root crowns following fire.  It
also regenerates from onsite or transported seed [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Small shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Rhizomatous shrub, rhizome in soil
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rosa nutkana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Nootka rose is top-killed by fire.  Shallowly buried root crowns and
rhizomes of Rosa species, including Nootka rose, may be killed by severe
fire [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Nootka rose may increase or decrease following fire.  Rosa species of
British Columbia, including Nootka rose, usually initially decrease in
cover after wildfire.  Cover gradually increases, and then declines
again as the canopy closes [<a href="#14">14</a>].  In a Douglas-fir/ninebark habitat type
in Idaho, Nootka rose cover was greater on burned sites or sites logged
and then burned than on undisturbed sites.  Cover was less, however,
than on logged or grazed sites [<a href="#7">7</a>].  In aspen and aspen-mixed conifer
stands in Idaho and Wyoming, prescribed fires of low to high severity
caused a decrease in cover of Nootka and Wood's rose (Rosa woodsii) in
postfire year 1.  Rose biomass in postfire year 2 was near prefire
levels [<a href="#25">25</a>].  In Washington and Oregon, burning had little effect on
abundance of Nootka rose.  Multiple fires can significantly reduce cover
of rose species [<a href="#14">14</a>].
