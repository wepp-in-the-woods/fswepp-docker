<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ceratiola ericoides
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Rosemary is distributed along the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains from
southeastern South Carolina to the Escambia River in the Florida
Panhandle.  Continuous populations exist in northern and central
Florida.  Discontinous populations occur in the coastal counties of
Georgia and Mississippi [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].

Rosemary stands provide nesting sites for the northern cardinal,

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In the Florida scrub, rosemary does not present any management problems
because it does not compete or hinder the growth of pines (Pinus spp.)
or evergreen scrub oaks (Quercus spp.) [<a href="#25">25</a>].

The seeds of rosemary are attacked primarily by fungi and insects [<a href="#14">14</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ceratiola ericoides
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Rosemary is a native, evergreen, dioecious, needle-leaved shrub that
grows to about 8 feet (2.5 m) tall.  It has bushy branches and a
distinct, erect form.  The slender stems are straight, and the small
leaves are alternate or whorled on the twigs.  The buds are at the stem
tips.  The very small sessile flowers are borne along the twigs at the
base of the leaf axils.  The fruit is a juicy yellow drupe containing
two seeds [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Rosemary is a prolific seed producer; the literature suggests that
regeneration from seed is its only mode of reproduction.  Seed
production begins at 15 to 20 years, peaks at 25 to 30 years, and then
declines.  The seed is dispersed by several species of birds; it passes
through their digestive tracts unharmed.  Many seeds are lost to mice
and insect predation [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Rosemary commonly occurs in scrub oak woods, dry open pinelands, and
stable dunes in the southeastern United States.  It grows on
well-drained to excessively drained, infertile, acid to strongly acid
sandy soils of the order Entisols.  The soils are made of quartz sands,
white to grayish with very little clay, silt of humus mixture, and no
horizon development.  Rosemary often forms pure stands on the slightly
higher elevations which are surrounded by scrubby flatwoods [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

Rosemary is a pioneer species.  When there is a disturbance from a tree
falling, a road, or a fire, rosemary seedlings appear.  As the site
matures, the oaks and palmettos begin to shade out rosemary [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Rosemary flowers from early spring to early summer.  The fruit ripens in
the late summer and the seed is dispersed in the late fall [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ceratiola ericoides
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fire-stimulated germination of seed is rosemary's only known
fire survival mechanism, since it does not reproduce vegetatively.  It
is adapted to a fire cycle of not less than 10 years and no more than 40
years.  Fire intervals of less than 10 years would deplete the seed
bank.  Fire intervals of longer than 40 years would selectively favor
plants that produce large seed crops when past the age of 40 years
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Shrub without adventitious-bud root crown
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ceratiola ericoides
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Rosemary is readily killed by fire [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Rosemary seeds germinate in response to fire [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Johnson [<a href="#15">15</a>]
reported that rosemary biomass increases slowly from postfire years 2 to
4, rapidly from postfire years 4 to 10, and less rapidly from postfire
years 10 to 34.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Burning dune scrub at intervals shorter than 15 to 20 years prevents
rosemary shrub from reaching reproductive maturity [<a href="#16">16</a>].
