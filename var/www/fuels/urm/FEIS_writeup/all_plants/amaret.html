<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Rough pigweed affects the kidneys of swine and cattle when animals
consume large quantities of fresh material for 5 to 10 days.  Cattle
have developed perirenal edema and toxic nephrosis after ingesting rough
pigweed.  The toxicant has not been identified, although oxalates and/or
phenolics have been suspected [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Additionally, rough pigweed
accumulates nitrates, which causes poisoning in most livestock species
when ingested in large quantities either fresh or in hay [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  The
excess nitrates cause cattle to bloat [<a href="#41">41</a>].  In the Midwest, pigs have
been poisoned by rough pigweed growing under drought stress.  In drought
conditions, rough pigweed accumulation of nitrates accelerates [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].

In Nebraska, cattle consumed immature leaves and tops of rough pigweed
in fields seeded to big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii var. gerardii).
By mid-July of the first year of the study, nitrate concentration had
reached toxic levels (10,000 ppm).  In the second year, nitrate levels
exceeded the toxic level at the beginning of the grazing season [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Sheep in Texas were maintained for varying lengths of time on rough
pigweed pasture supplemented with wheat and alfalfa hays [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Scaled quail in Texas made use of rough pigweed seeds.  When available,
seeds averaged 0.9 percent of food eaten.  In the highest recorded use,
rough pigweed seeds made up 3.6 percent of food eaten.  Percent use was
greater than rough pigweed presence [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Rough pigweed is probably unpalatable when mature because of the stiff,
spine-like bracts in the flower clusters.

In Utah, rough pigweed was rated as having fair palatability for cattle
and horses, and good palatability for sheep [<a href="#7">7</a>].

In Minnesota, rough pigweed was as palatable to sheep as oats (Avena
sativa) [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Rough pigweed seeds with hulls contain 18.0 percent protein [<a href="#29">29</a>].

The nutritional components of immature rough pigweed browse are [<a href="#29">29</a>]:

                  Component       Percent

                Ash                18.8
                Crude Fiber        10.8
                N-free Extract     43.2
                Protein            25.7


The use that various animals can make of protein in rough pigweed browse
is [<a href="#29">29</a>]:

                  Sheep            20.9

The food value of rough pigweed for wildlife species in several western
states is rated as follows [<a href="#7">7</a>]:

        Waterfowl              good         poor        fair

In Minnesota, rough pigweed harvested from late June to mid-July showed
a nutrient composition and digestibility for sheep equivalent to that of
high-quality alfalfa (Medicago sativa).  Rough pigweed contained
adequate minerals to meet the requirements of ruminants.  However, it
must be utilized at relatively early stages of maturity.  Nitrate
concentration, which has been implicated in livestock poisoning, is
highest in rough pigweed just before bloom.  Calcium to potassium ratio
in rough pigweed is such that it should not be fed as the sole ration
[<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The degree to which rough pigweed provides environmental cover for
wildlife species in several western states is as follows [<a href="#7">7</a>]:

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Young leaves of rough pigweed are used as salad greens when the plant is
only a few inches tall, before the stem becomes woody.  Fresh young
plants can also be used as a potherb.  Seeds are edible whole or ground
into meal.  However, because rough pigweed concentrates nitrates, it
should be used in moderation, particularly when taken from
nitrate-fertilized areas [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Rough pigweed is a useful component of patchwork vegetation for scaled
quail habitat, providing both food and cover [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Rough pigweed is difficult to eradicate when once established [<a href="#34">34</a>].  A
survey of weeds in spring annual crops throughout Manitoba over a 4-year
period showed 83 weed species.  Rough pigweed was the third most common
dicotyledonous weed [<a href="#40">40</a>].  In Kansas, it was the most abundant forb weed
in the seedbank [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Rough pigweed can be controlled with herbicides [<a href="#30">30</a>].

Cultivation reduces longevity of rough pigweed seed, apparently by
increasing soil aeration, exposing the seeds to light, and generally
improving conditions for germination.  High soil temperatures favor
germination and reduce rough pigweed seed survival [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Rough pigweed showed no establishment in intact prairie vegetation in an
Illinois study.  It did, however, establish in gaps in prairie
vegetation.  Flowering and seed set increased with increasing gap size
[<a href="#26">26</a>].

An investigation was conducted in Nebraska as to the effect of cattle
grazing in controlling rough pigweed and other weeds in seeded
grassland.  Cattle consumed immature rough pigweed, but nitrate
accumulation limited grazing rough pigweed as a weed control practice
[<a href="#23">23</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Amaranthus retroflexus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Rough pigweed is an introduced, coarse, monoecious, annual herb with
taproots.  It has an erect stem, 1 to 6.6 feet (0.3-2 m) tall, that is
commonly freely branched.  Leaves are 0.8 to 3.9 inches (2-10 cm) long.
Inflorescences are usually densely crowded.  There are often additional
dense clusters of flowers in the axils of upper leaves.  The fruit is a
utricle [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].

Rough pigweed has a taproot.  In pinyon-juniper (Pinus-Juniperus)
woodland in New Mexico, root depth averaged 39 inches (100 cm), with a
range of 3.9 to 95 inches (10-240 cm) [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Therophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Rough pigweed regenerates from seed each year.  Plants can result from
germination of newly released seed, or from germination of seed carried
over in the seedbank from previous years.  Seeds may germinate any time
soil moisture is adequate during the growing season [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Rough pigweed seeds harvested in Mississippi showed 94 percent viability
at time of harvest.  After burial in soil for 30 months, seeds showed 7
percent viability.  Seeds put in dry, low-temperature storage for 30
months had 98 percent viability [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Some seeds of rough pigweed remained viable after 24 hours of rumen
digestion, 8 weeks ensiling, or both [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Rough pigweed grows in cultivated fields, gardens, orchards, fallow
land, stream valleys, shores, prairie ravines, roadsides, fence rows,
and waste places [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Its grows in dry to moist conditions
[<a href="#7">7</a>].

In Utah, rough pigweed demonstrated poor growth on gravel, dense clay,
and sodic-saline soils; fair growth on sandy, clay-loam, organic acidic,
and saline soils; and good growth on sandy loam, loam, and clay.
Optimum soil depth was 10 to 20 inches (25-50 cm) [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Recorded elevations for rough pigweed are [<a href="#7">7</a>]:

      State        Elevation (feet)     Elevation (m)

     Arizona         5,000-7,000        1,525-2,134 
     Colorado        4,700-9,200        1,433-2,804
     Montana         2,300-9,000          700-2,743
     Utah            4,400-4,700        1,341-1,433
     Wyoming         4,300-7,800        1,310-2,377


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

Rough pigweed, an early successional species, extracts more nitrogen
from and grows faster on the nitrogen-poor soils of recently abandoned
fields than mid- and late successional species [<a href="#38">38</a>].

In Michigan, an agricultural field was rototilled and abandoned in
March.  By May, seedlings of several annuals had emerged.  Dominant
species during the first growing season included rough pigweed.  In
similar adjacent fields that had been abandoned for 5 and 15 years,
rough pigweed was not present.  [<a href="#16">16</a>].

During the 1934 drought, rough pigweed grew thickly where windblown dust
had covered considerable portions of prairies in Kansas and Nebraska.
Rough pigweed and other ruderals normally not found in prairies became
widely distributed when released from their usual competition with
grasses.  However, with the end of drought and the return of grasses,
rough pigweed nearly disappeared in many prairies [<a href="#45">45</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Rough pigweed normally begins growth in late spring and matures in late
summer or early fall [<a href="#44">44</a>].  It blooms in the Great Plains from July to
October [<a href="#14">14</a>], and in the central and northeastern United States and
adjacent Canada from August to October [<a href="#11">11</a>].  It blooms in southern
California from June to November [<a href="#27">27</a>], in Montana from June to October,
in North Dakota and Wyoming from July to September [<a href="#7">7</a>] and in the
Carolinas from July until frost [<a href="#31">31</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Amaranthus retroflexus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Rough pigweed seeds are an important part of the seedbank in many
habitats, even when plants are almost absent [<a href="#16">16</a>].  As an obligate
initial community species, rough pigweed needs bare, disturbed sites in
order to establish [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  A fire which clears away competing
vegetation can allow the establishment of rough pigweed.

Rough pigweed seeds are very small [<a href="#14">14</a>], and easily blown by the wind
from off-site sources.  Some seeds survive cattle digestion [<a href="#4">4</a>], and can
be carried by animals to burned areas.

<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
When rough pigweed is killed by fire, the population must establish from

conditions continue to be favorable, seeds from the seedbank will
germinate [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Late in the growing season, a fire will prepare the
seedbed for establishment of rough pigweed from seed the next spring.
