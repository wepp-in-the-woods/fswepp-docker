<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Hamamelis virginiana

<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Witch-hazel occurs throughout the northeastern and southeastern United
States.  It extends from the Appalachian Mountains south to the northern
Florida Panhandle and west from the mountains into Indiana, Illinois,
Iowa, Minnesota, western Kentucky, eastern Missouri, eastern Oklahoma,
and eastern Texas.  At its northern limit, witch-hazel ranges along the
southern border of Canada from southern Ontario to southern Nova Scotia
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Hamamelis virginiana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
The fruit of witch-hazel is eaten by ruffed grouse, northern bobwhite,
ring-necked pheasant, and white-tailed deer.  The fruit is also
frequently eaten by beaver and cottontail rabbit [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

Witch-hazel fruit is a minor fall food for black bear in western
Massachusetts [<a href="#15">15</a>].

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Medicinal extracts, lotions, and salves are prepared from the leaves,
twigs, and bark of witch-hazel.  The distillate is used to reduce
inflammation, stop bleeding, and check secretions of the mucous
membranes.  Extracts of the twigs were also believed to infuse the
imbiber with occult powers [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Witch-hazel competes with more desirable hardwoods for available light
and moisture [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Its dense cover inhibits seed germination of
intolerant species [<a href="#9">9</a>].
 
Blair and Burnett [<a href="#2">2</a>] reported that witch-hazel, along with Carolina
jessamine (Gelsemium sempervirens), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), sweetgum
(Liquidambar styraciflua), red maple (Acer rubrum), and post oak
(Quercus stellata), declined by 94.7 percent collectively after logging.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Hamamelis virginiana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Witch-hazel is a deciduous shrub or small tree with a short trunk,
bearing numerous spreading, crooked branches.  At maturity, it is
commonly 15 to 25 (4.5-7.5 m) feet tall.  It has thin bark and shallow
roots.  The fruit is a woody capsule containing two to four seeds
[<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Witch-hazel reproduces mainly by seed.  After maturing the capsules
burst open, explosively discharging their seeds several yards from the
parent plant.  There is limited dispersal by birds. The seeds germinate
the second year after dispersal [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Brinkman [<a href="#4">4</a>] reported that
witch-hazel can be propagated by layering.



<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Witch-hazel is found on a variety of sites but is most abundant in mesic
woods and bottoms.  In the western and southern parts of its range, it
is confined to moist cool valleys, moist flats, north and east slopes,
coves, benches, and ravines.  In the northern part of its range, it is
found on drier and warmer sites of slopes and hilltops [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].

In addition to those species listed under Distribution and Occurrence,
common tree and shrub associates of witch-hazel include white ash
(Fraxinus americana), blackgum, mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia),
blueberry (Vaccinium spp.), rhododendron (Rhododendron spp.), pepperbush
(Clethra acuminata), sweetgum, flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), and
eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana) [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species 

Witch-hazel is a shade-tolerant, mid- to late-seral species.  It
sometimes forms a solid understory in second-growth and old-growth 
forests in the eastern United States [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
The flowers of witch-hazel open in September and October, and the fruit
ripens the next fall.  Shortly after ripening, the capsules burst open,
discharging their seed [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Hamamelis virginiana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
DeBruyn and Buckner [<a href="#10">10</a>] rated witch-hazel low in fire resistance.  This
is probably due to its thin bark, shallow roots, and low-branching
habit.  Fire survival strategies were not given.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Hamamelis virginiana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Witch-hazel is readily killed by fire.  In a prescribed fire in a
loblolly pine community in western Tennessee, witch hazel suffered 54
percent mortality [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Witch-hazel's response to fire is not well documented.  Literature
suggests that it is a fire decreaser, although postfire density,
frequency, or growth rates were not given [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
