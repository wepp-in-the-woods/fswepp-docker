<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of sandpaper oak is Quercus
pungens Liebm.  It is a member of the beech family (Fagaceae) [<a href="#17">17</a>].  In
addition to the typical variety, there is one recognized variety, Vasey
shin oak (Q. p. var. vaseyana [Buckl.] C. H. Muller) [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

Sandpaper oak hybrizes with gray oak (Quercus grisea) in the Guadalupe
Mountains of New Mexico and Texas [<a href="#37">37</a>].

This report presents information for both sandpaper and Vasey shin oaks.
Information applicable to both is presented under sandpaper oak.  When
publications specifically used Vasey shin oak, the information is
presented under that name.

<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus pungens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Sandpaper and Vasey shin oaks are widespread throughout the Edwards
Plateau and Trans-Pecos region of Texas.  Scattered, isolated
populations continue southward into the state of Tamaulipas and proceed
westward into Chihuahua, Mexico [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Populations of sandpaper
oak extend northward into the Guadalupe Mountains of Texas [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>] and
westward to the mountains of southwestern New Mexico and southeastern
Arizona [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Sandpaper oak has been reported from southern Colorado
[<a href="#4">4</a>]; however, Harrington [<a href="#14">14</a>] was unable to locate any specimens
supporting this range extension.

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Sandpaper oak occurs with true mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus)
and desert ceanothus (Ceanothus greggii) as a dominance type in the
chaparral formations in the Guadalupe Mountains, Texas [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>] and the
montane chaparral of the Chihuahuan Desert region [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Sandpaper oak
is a characteristic member of juniper (Juniperus spp.)-oak (Quercus
spp.) communities and intermixes with desert scrub savanna in the
canyons of central and western Texas [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  In Texas sandpaper or
Vasey shin oaks are a dominant or characteristic species in the Mohr
shin oak (Quercus mohriana) series, oneseed juniper (Juniperus
monosperma) series, and sandpaper oak-true mountain-mahogany series [<a href="#33">33</a>].
Sandpaper or Vasey shin oaks are dominant species in the following
publications:

(1) Vegetation and community types of the Chihuahuan Desert [<a href="#15">15</a>]
(2) Plant communities of Texas (Series level) [<a href="#33">33</a>].

Several species that were not previously included in Distribution and
Occurrence information but occur with sandpaper oak are cane cholla
(Opuntia imbricata), purplefruited pricklypear (O. phaecantha), Mexican
buckeye (Ungnadia speciosa), Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana), hairy
tridens (Erioneuron pilosum), and plateau oak (Quercus fusiformis)
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus pungens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
The oaks of Arizona, which includes sandpaper oak, rarely grow large
enough to use as timber.  The wood may be used locally for fuel and
fence posts [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Vasey shin oak is lightly grazed in Texas by cattle, sheep, goats, and
white-tailed deer [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Vasey shin oak acorns have a high food value, and its leaves have a
medium food value for white-tailed deer in the Rolling Plains and the
Edwards Plateau of Texas [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Actively growing Vasey shin oak sprouts
are nutritious, with a crude protein content of about 13 to 17 percent [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Vasey shin oak has high cover value, providing escape and thermal cover
for white-tailed deer [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Vasey shin oak, live oak (Quercus virginiana), and Ashe juniper
(Juniperus ashei) have invaded savannas on the Edwards Plateau in Texas
due to suppressed fires and overgrazing [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Mechanical methods
and herbicides have successfully controlled Vasey shin oak [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].
Vasey shin oak breaks at ground level when chained and sprouts 1 year
later, providing important forage for white-tailed deer.  Intense
browsing of the sprouts will kill Vasey shin oak [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Browse biomass estimates of Vasey shin oak from various regression
formulae have been evaluated for predictive ability.  Log-log models
accounted for the most variability in Vasey shin oak samples at Sonora,
Texas [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Poisoning by sandpaper or Vasey shin oak was not described in the
literature, but oak poisoning of cattle, horses, sheep, and goats is a
problem on some rangelands in the southwestern United States.  Poisoning
occurs when oak foliage or acorns are exclusively consumed, which may
happen in the spring when other food is scarce [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus pungens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sandpaper oak is a native, evergreen to subevergreen shrub or
medium-size tree [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  It grows 3.3 to 6.6 feet (1-2 m) tall as a
shrub and to 26 feet (8 m) tall as a tree [<a href="#11">11</a>].  The thick, simple,
coarsely toothed leaves are 3.5 inches (9 cm) long [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Female
catkins produce 1 to 3 flowers; male catkins have numerous flowers.
Fruits are solitary or paired acorns [<a href="#35">35</a>] about 0.4 inch (1 cm) long
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].

Vasey shin oak has shallowly lobed leaves [<a href="#27">27</a>] and larger (up to 0.9 inch
[2.2 cm]) acorns than sandpaper oak [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction:  Sandpaper oak is monoecious.  Acorns are produced
annually [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  No information was found in the literature on seed
germination requirements.  However, the other southwestern oaks (Quercus
spp.) have no seed dormancy.  Most germination occurs within 30 days
after acorns drop from the trees [<a href="#23">23</a>].

On the Edwards Plateau in Texas Vasey shin oak occurs as individuals or
clumps in a semiarid grassland.  A seedbank study was done, but plots
were specifically chosen to exclude woody plants.  Woody species were a
minimum of 30 feet (10 m) from the plots.  No Vasey shin oak germinated
in the plots [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Asexual reproduction:  Vasey shin oak readily sprouts following
topgrowth removal [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sandpaper oak is found in gravelly or rocky soils [<a href="#2">2</a>] that are often
shallow (less than 9.8 inches [25 cm] deep) [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Soil texture may
be stoney clay [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Sandpaper oak grows on middle to upper slopes and
in lower canyons of desert mountains [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>] and along arroyos [<a href="#35">35</a>].
Sandpaper oak occurs in open shrublands on dry sites or in closed canopy
woodlands on more moist sites [<a href="#33">33</a>].

Sandpaper oak is found in semiarid to subhumid climates with hot
summers and mild winters [<a href="#30">30</a>].  It occurs at moderate elevations from
3,500 to 6,000 feet (1,067-1,829 m) [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].

Vasey shin oak has been classified as an edaphic specialist limited to
limestone [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Sandpaper oak occurs on but is not restricted to
calcareous soils derived from limestone [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Climax Species

Sandpaper oak occurs in climax oak woodlands or chaparral and
oak-juniper communities.  In Texas the mixed-grass prairie has been
replaced by oak-juniper disclimax.  Vasey shin oak, plateau oak, and
Ashe juniper have increased due to fire suppression and overgrazing
[<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Sandpaper oak flowers in late spring.  Fruits mature the first autumn
after flowering [<a href="#2">2</a>].  The leaves persist 1 year until new leaves are
produced [<a href="#2">2</a>]; however, they may drop in late winter [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus pungens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Sandpaper oak is present as a low-growing form in desert grassland of
southeastern Arizona.  Benson and Darrow [<a href="#2">2</a>] speculated that these small
trees were possibly the survivors of repeated ancient or recent fires.
Oaks generally survive low intensity fast fires [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Fire return
intervals in the oak woodlands are longer than in the past due to fire
suppression and fuel removal by overgrazing [<a href="#36">36</a>].

All of the oaks of Arizona, which includes sandpaper oak, sprout
prolifically following top-kill by fire [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tree with adventitious-bud root crown/soboliferous species root sucker
   Tall shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus pungens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire top-kills sandpaper and Vasey shin oaks; surviving plants are
stimulated to sprout [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Unburied acorns are probably killed by fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
The responses of sandpaper or Vasey shin oaks to fire were not found in
the literature.  Because sandpaper oak sprouts vigorously following
removal of top growth, recovery should be fairly rapid, similar to the
response of other southwestern oaks that sprout (e.g., Emory oak
[Quercus emoryi]) [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Site factors will influence the length of time
required to achieve prefire crown cover.  Potentially, the postfire
community could be more dense from sandpaper oak sprouting than the
original community.  If establishment depends on off-site seed, rates of
recovery will vary depending on the proximity of seed trees and animal
facilitation.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Prescribed burning is recommended to open up dense Ashe juniper stands
and to encourage Vasey shin oak, other shin oaks (Quercus spp.), and
plateau oak to sprout [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].
