<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
Most North American systematists recognize Bromus hordeaceus L. as the
scientific name of soft chess [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].  European systematists
generally describe this entity as B. mollis L. [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].  Subspecies of
soft chess occurring in North America are [<a href="#56">56</a>]:

B. h. ssp. hordeaceus L.
B. h. ssp. molliformis (Lloyd) Maire & Weiller
B. h. ssp. pseudothominii P. Sm.
B. h. ssp. thominei (Hardham ex Nyman) Victorin & Weiler

Soft chess hybridizes with erect chess (B. erectus) [<a href="#3">3</a>] and intergrades
occasionally with Japanese brome (B. japonicus) [<a href="#95">95</a>].

<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES : Bromus hordeaceus
</b></font><hr size="3">

<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Soft chess is native to Eurasia, where it is most common in the
Mediterranean region [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].  It has naturalized in all other
continents except Antarctica [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].  Soft chess is widely distributed
but scattered and uncommon in most of North America [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>],
ranging from coastal southern Alaska south to Baja California and east
to Maine, North Carolina, and Texas [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>].  Soft chess is
most common in low-elevation valleys and foothills of California and
southwestern Oregon where climate is mediterranean.  It is more abundant
in mediterranean areas of California than in Mediterranean Europe [<a href="#61">61</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Soft chess is typically dominant in annual grassland communities of
California and southwestern Oregon [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>].  It is an important
component of some sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) steppe and palouse prairie
communities of eastern Washington and Oregon and southern Idaho,
especially where cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is a community dominant
[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].  Soft chess is not usually important in other plant communities
in which it occurs [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>].

California annual grassland - The native prairie that occurred on
coastal and inland valleys of California and southwestern Oregon has
been almost entirely replaced by annual grassland, agricultural land, or
urban areas [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Conversion from native prairie to annual
grassland occurred in less than two hundred years [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  Soft chess
is thought to have naturalized in native California prairie in about
1860 [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Species composition of native grasslands was poorly
documented and will always be open to debate [<a href="#96">96</a>].  Most experts agree
that coastal prairie and mesic inland valleys were dominanted by
perennial bunchgrasses [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  Drier inland valleys may have
been dominated by native annual grasses [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Hoover [<a href="#52">52</a>] argued that
most native California prairie was dominated by annual forbs.

Species composition in California annual grassland is complex and
varied:  Even slight differences in climate, topography, and soil type
can alter species composition [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  However, soft chess dominates
California annual grassland communities more often than any other plant
species [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  In Pinnacles National Monument, for example, soft
chess has 26 percent cover and 100 percent frequency:  It is the most
commonly occurring seed plant in the Monument [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Even where it is
not dominant, soft chess is usually an important component of annual
grassland vegetation [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].

Publications describing plant communities in which soft chess is a
dominant part of the vegetation are listed below.

Plant species commonly associated with soft chess in California and
southwestern Oregon are listed below.

California: annual grassland - Broad-leaved filaree (Erodium botrys)
commmonly codominates with soft chess throughout California annual
grassland.  Red brome (B. rubens) and cutleaf filaree (E. cicutarium)
are also common associates, usually replacing soft chess and
broad-leaved filaree as dominants in portions of the Central Valley
where annual precipitation is less than 12 inches (305 mm) [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Other
common annuals include ripgut brome (B. rigidus), slender oat (Avena
barbata), wild oat (A. fatua), rattail fescue (Vulpia myuros), bur
clover (Medicago hispida), and yellow starthistle (Centaurea
solstitialis).  Native perennial associates include purple needlegrass
(Stipa pulchra), Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda), melic grass (Melica
californica), California oatgrass (Danthonia californica), bottlebrush
squirreltail (Elymus elymoides), Spanish clover (Lotus americanus), and
ground lupine (Lupinus bicolor) [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].

California hardwoods:  Soft chess is dominant to common in the
understory of oak (Quercus spp.) and other upland hardwood types.
Upland tree associates of soft chess not previously listed in SAF COVER
TYPES include valley oak (Q. lobata), tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus),
California black walnut (Juglans californica), and California buckeye
(Aesculus californica) [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>].  Soft chess also occurs in Fremont
cottonwood/willow (Populus fremontii/Salix spp.) and other riparian
types [<a href="#97">97</a>].

Oregon:  annual grassland - Soft chess/hedgehog dogtail (Cynosurus
schinatus) communities occur on grassy balds of the Umpqua River Basin.
Associated grasses include California oatgrass, pine bluegrass (P.
scabrella), Sandberg bluegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail [<a href="#85">85</a>].

Oregon white oak - Associates of soft chess in Oregon white oak (Q.
garryana) communities of southwestern Oregon include California brome
(B. carinatus), sheep fescue (Festuca ovina), birchleaf
mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus betuloides), California black oak (Q.
kelloggii), poison-oak (Toxicodendron diversiloba), blue wildrye (E.
glaucus), rough bluegrass (P. trivalis), and burr chervil (Anthriscus
caucalis) [<a href="#78">78</a>].

Basin big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. tridentata) - At the
Sheep Rock Unit of John Day Fossil Beds National Monument, soft chess
associates in basin big sagebrush communities include Idaho fescue (F.
idahoensis), bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata), cheatgrass,
western yarrow (Achillea millefolium), smallflower woodlandstar
(Lithaphragma parviflora), and western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis)
[<a href="#82">82</a>].

A medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae)-rattail fescue-soft brome
community has been described in a bluebunch wheatgrass-Sandberg
bluegrass habitat type near Pendleton, Oregon [<a href="#18">18</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES : Bromus hordeaceus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Soft chess is nutritious and palatable forage.  Sampson and others [<a href="#81">81</a>]
rated it the best forage of all California's annual bromes.  The awns
are short and soft, and livestock graze soft chess even after seeds
mature.  Because soft chess matures later than most annual grasses and
the seeds do not readily shatter, cattle graze it well into summer,
gaining extra nutrition from the seeds [<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>].

Use of soft chess by native ungulates may be sparse in some areas.  In
Point Reyes National Park, California, tule elk and mule deer avoided
soft chess and ripgut brome.  Although grasses were the primary
component in the fall diets of tule elk, the elk used the annual bromes
very little.  Grasses were less important in the diets of mule deer, but
annual bromes were the least preferred of the grass species that the
mule deer grazed [<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
In Montana and Utah, palatability of soft chess has been rated fair for
wild and domestic ungulates, small mammals, small nongame birds, and
upland game birds.  Palatability was rated poor for waterfowl in Utah
[<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Nutritional content of fresh, immature soft chess was as follows [<a href="#73">73</a>]:

Protein (N x 6.25, %)           Potassium (%)     4.00
  cattle          14.2          Ash (%)          12.2 
  domestic goats  14.5          Crude fiber (%)  24.2
  horses          13.8          Calcium (%)       0.59
  rabbits         13.5          Phosphorus (%)    0.39
  domestic sheep  14.9


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
In Utah, cover value of soft chess for small mammals, small nongame
birds, and upland game birds was rated fair.  Cover value for waterfowl
was rated poor [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Soft chess is planted for hay.  The seed is commerically available
[<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Annual grasslands - Soft chess and other exotic annuals probably
replaced native California prairie because native perennial grasses were
severely overgrazed over several periods of extended drought [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].
Annual grasses are far more prolific seed producers than are perennials.
Once established, soft chess and other annual grasses probably
interfered greatly with perennial grass regrowth, seed production, and
seedling establishment [<a href="#61">61</a>].  In a greenhouse experiment, soft chess has
also been shown to interfere with seedling establishment of coyote bush
(Baccharis pilularis), a native chaparral shrub [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Soft chess and
other exotic annuals can probably not be eliminated from the California
flora [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  Although some fire and grazing treatments have
reduced soft chess and other annuals, results have been mixed.

Control:  grazing - Soft chess may be partially controlled by spring
grazing.  Defoliation within a week after flowering has been found to be
effective in reducing seed formation in annual bromes [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Laude [<a href="#67">67</a>]
found that removing terminal buds of soft chess prevented leaf
elongation and seed production.  Treatments of spring grazing and fall
fire have been successful in reducing soft chess (see FIRE MANAGEMENT
CONSIDERATIONS).

No grazing - Attempts to reduce reduce soft chess cover by cessation of
grazing have sometimes suceeded.  In the short term, cover of soft chess
and other annuals declined after cattle were removed from Golden Gate
National Recreation Area, California, in 1984.  The next 3 years were
droughty, but native perennial cover increased relative to cover of
annuals despite low rainfall [<a href="#88">88</a>].  Cessation of grazing also reduced
soft chess in an upper riparian zone in eastern Oregon.  On plots with
10 years of late summer cattle grazing, soft chess cover increased
greatly:  Cover on grazed plots was 1.7 percent the first year of the
study and 47.5 percent in the tenth year.  On exclosures, cover of soft
chess declined over the 10-year study period [<a href="#39">39</a>].  However, Heady [<a href="#45">45</a>]
found that in Mendocino County, California, soft chess and other annuals
continued to dominate the Hopland Field Station despite protection from
grazing for at least 40 years.

Fire - Studies using prescribed fire to control soft chess are discussed
in the FIRE EFFECTS section.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES : Bromus hordeaceus
</b></font><hr size="3">

<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Soft chess is a cool-season exotic grass [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  It is usually an
annual but is sometimes a biennial in the Great Basin and the Northeast
[<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].  The erect to ascending plants are 4.4 to 26 inches (11-65 cm)
tall.  Soft chess is generally pubescent, but culms and/or spikelets are
occasionally glabrous [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Awns are straight and from 0.16 to 0.4 inch
(4-10 mm) long [<a href="#95">95</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Therophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
As an annual, soft chess regenerates entirely from seed.  Soft chess is
mostly self-pollinating [<a href="#55">55</a>].  Seed set insufficient to maintain soft
chess populations has not been observed in the field [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  Ewing and
Menke [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>] found that drought reduced average mass and number of
seed, but some plants produced seed even under severe drought
conditions.  Viable seeds germinate in their first autumn.  Little seed
is carried over from year to year in the seedbank [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>], although
dry-stored soft chess seed may remain viable for decades [<a href="#53">53</a>].
Germination is best on a seedbed of moderate mulch, but some seed
germinates without mulch [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  In the laboratory, soft chess required
stratification to germinate [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>], but not light [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Temperature
range for germination is wide, with best germination occurring between
50 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit (10-30 deg C) [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Seeds become dormant
with freezing temperatures or temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit
(38 deg C) [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  Most germinating seeds survive the sporadic cycles
of wetting and drying that are common in fall in mediterranean climates.
Flood [<a href="#31">31</a>] found that in the greenhouse, germination rates of soft chess
seed were actually better when seeds were exposed to several cycles of
wetting and drying.

Seedling establishment is limited by freezing temperature and exposure
to drying.  At the Hopland Field Station, California, soft chess
coverage was best when germination was followed by warm autumn nights.
Ripgut brome became dominant in years when temperatures fell below
freezing in October and November [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Survival of soft chess seedlings
is enhanced by moisture-retaining clay substrates or mulches [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].
Kay [<a href="#57">57</a>] reported that seedling establishment of soft chess on
decomposed granite was 17 times greater when straw mulch was applied.

Soft chess seedlings grow rapidly.  Rate of greenhouse-grown soft chess
seedlings was as follows [<a href="#23">23</a>]:

  Age       root length     shoot length
(weeks)        (cm)             (cm)
_______     ___________     ____________
   1            7.2              4.3
   5           18.0              6.0
   9           50.0              8.0  


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Soft chess occurs mostly in waste places in Alaska, the Pacific
Northwest, the Great Plains, the Southwest, and the East [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].

Soils and aspect:  Soft chess grows on a variety of soil types including
serpentine and caliche [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].  Best growth occurs on clay loam and
sandy soils [<a href="#80">80</a>].  In inland California, soft chess is most common on
deep, clayey soils [<a href="#2">2</a>] receiving 26 to 40 inches (650-1,000 mm) of
annual precipitation [<a href="#12">12</a>].  On the coast, it is most common on sandy
soils [<a href="#47">47</a>].  In Somewhere, California, McNaughton [<a href="#72">72</a>] found that soft
chess occurred on all aspects but was most common on southwest slopes.

Climate:  Dry mediterranean climates are most favorable to soft chess.
Soft chess is probably more common in California than in its native
Mediterranean because the drier California climate favors establishment
of annual grasses over perennial herbs and shrubs.  The relatively
moister climate of the Mediterranean favors perennials [<a href="#61">61</a>].

Outside mediterranean regions of California and southwestern Oregon,
soft chess is most common in the cold climates of the Pacific Northwest
[<a href="#50">50</a>] and in northern portions of the Great Basin [<a href="#95">95</a>].  It is uncommon
in warm desert regions [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  Soft chess is probably not well adapted
to the climate of the Southeast:  It does not occur further south than
North Carolina, where it is very rare [<a href="#76">76</a>].

Elevation:  Soft chess occurs at the following elevations:

California   below 6,300 feet (2,100 m) [<a href="#49">49</a>]
Colorado     5,000 to 9,200 feet (1,500-2,800 m) [<a href="#42">42</a>] 
Utah         4,220 to 8,350 feet (1,280-2,530 m) [<a href="#95">95</a>]


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Soft chess occurs on newly disturbed sites, in mid-succession, and on
sites left undisturbed for decades [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].

California annual grassland - In the absence of disturbance, soft chess
and other annual grasses tend to increase at the expense of forbs and
perennial grasses [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Heady [<a href="#45">45</a>] found soft chess was an important
component of California annual grassland that had not been burned or
grazed by livestock for at least 40 years.  Mulch, which accumulates in
the absence of heavy grazing and/or fire, tends to favor germination of
soft chess and other annual bromes over forbs and perennial grasses
[<a href="#45">45</a>].  Heady and others [<a href="#46">46</a>] reported that soft chess decreased on
heavily grazed sites, probably because grazing removed mulch.  Over 3
years, soft chess coverage increased greatly (from 0.9% to 37.3%) on a
newly disturbed site on the Hopland Field Station.  However, soft chess
coverage remained below 2 percent on plots where mulch was mechanically
removed in each of the 3 years [<a href="#45">45</a>].

Chaparral - Soft chess and other annual grasses may be successional to
chaparral shrubs on some sites.  Repeated burning, often intentional for
the purpose of "type-conversion" of chaparral to grassland, has
eliminated woody species on some sites.  In the absence of heavy grazing
and/or fire, woody plants have recolonized some of these burned sites
[<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].  Equilibrium dynamics of annual grassland and chaparral are
not well understood, however, and probably differ by site.  On level
terrain with heavy clay soil, soft chess and other annual grasses are
apparently stable and do not succeed to woody shrubs [<a href="#61">61</a>].  Woody
species may displace annuals on nutrient-poor, rocky slopes [<a href="#79">79</a>].

Palouse prairie - In oldfield succession on a bluebunch
wheatgrass-Sandberg bluegrass habitat type in eastern Washington, soft
chess was an important component of the vegetation on new fields, young
fields (1-12 years since cultivation), and old fields (39-52 years since
cultivation).  Soft chess cover (percent) was as follows [<a href="#24">24</a>]:

                            Time since cultivation

<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Soft chess germinates and begins growth in fall [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  Vegetative
growth slows or stops early in winter and resumes early the next growing
season [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Flowering occurs in early spring. Seeds mature later in
the season than do seeds of most annual grass species.  In California,
soft chess seed matures in early summer.  Seeds do not readily shatter
upon maturity and are shed about a month after ripening [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].
Phenological development of soft chess on the central coast of
California was as follows [<a href="#46">46</a>]:

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fire autecology:  Summer and fall fires have no direct effect on soft
chess.  Soft chess has usually senesced and shattered seed when the fire
season starts.  The seed is not killed until fire temperatures rise
above approximately 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 deg C).  Since grassland
fires are usually fast-burning and relatively "cool," soft chess seed is
usually not damaged by fire [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].  Fire can affect relative abundance
of soft chess in the postfire plant community, however [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].  Fire
removes mulch, which favors annual forbs over soft chess.  Some soft
chess germinates the fall after fire, but best germination occurs in
mid-succession, when mulch layer is moderate [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].

Fire regimes:  California native grassland - Data are lacking to
quantify intensity and frequency of fire in pristine California prairie.
It is generally accepted that lightning-caused fire was part of the
evolutionary history of California prairie.  The California Division of
Forestry reported an average of 312 lightning-ignitied fires per year in
its fire protection area, which is 43 percent woodland-annual grassland.
Frequency of lightning-caused fires was probably at least as great in
the presettlement era [<a href="#45">45</a>].

Native Americans may have used frequent fire to enhance production of
edible perennial bunchgrass seeds [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Fire enhances flowering and
seedling recruitment for some perennial bunchgrasses native to
California prairie including purple needlegrass [<a href="#62">62</a>] and bottlebrush
squirreltail [<a href="#99">99</a>].  Both species show mass flowering after fire and
require mineral soil for establishment [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].

Annual grassland - Since California annual grassland has existed for
less than two hundred years, it has no evolutionary history of fire.
Like the perennial grassland that preceded it, however, California
annual grassland is a fire-tolerant ecosystem [<a href="#61">61</a>].  Studies attempting
to promote native perennial bunchgrasses over exotic annuals by using
prescribed fire have had mixed results.  These results are summarized
in FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS.

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire has little direct effect on soft chess.  Wildland and prescribed
fires usually occur after soft chess has dried and shattered seed
[<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Fire may reduce soft chess in the short term [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Species composition
in the postfire plant community is difficult to predict, however.
Year-to-year plant composition in annual grassland is highly dependent
upon local weather patterns, and even slight differences in annual
precipitation can alter species assemblages [<a href="#61">61</a>].  Fall weather
patterns, especially interactions of precipitation and temperature after
rainfall, appear to be overriding factors in soft chess establishment
[<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].

Fire affects plant species composition in annual grasslands largely by
removing mulch, which affects germination and seedling establishment
rates of soft chess relative to associated herbaceous species.
Bartolome [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>] found that soft chess reached highest densities when
mulch biomass was at intermediate levels.  Little quaking grass (Briza
minor) was favored when mulch biomass was low, as it would be in the
immediate postfire environment.  Fescues (Vulpia and Festuca spp.) were
favored when mulch biomass was high.  Heady [<a href="#45">45</a>] reported that without
heavy grazing the mulch layer usually recovers by postfire year 3, and
soft chess and other annual bromes regain dominance.

Decreases with fire:  Hansen [<a href="#40">40</a>] found that fall prescribed fire in
Tulare County, California, significantly increased dominance of annual
forbs relative to soft chess.  Greatest reduction soft chess and other
annual grasses (and greatest increase of annual forbs) was achieved by 3
years of successive fall burning.  Response of native grasses was
similar to that of soft chess:  Native grasses were reduced by fall
burning, with greatest reduction achieved after 3 years of consecutive
fall burning.  Percent cover of soft chess the spring after fall burning
follows.

A July 1947 prescription fire reduced soft chess on ungrazed annual
grassland near Berkeley, California.  Precipitation in the fall and
winter of 1947-1948 was slightly below average for the area (20.4 inches
with the average being 22.6 inches).  Average height and yield of soft
chess on two burned and two unburned sites in May of 1948 was as follows
[<a href="#48">48</a>]:

Mixed effects: Chaparral and oak woodland - Density of soft chess
increased greatly from prefire levels 5 years after prescribed fall
burning in a nonsprouting manzanita-Lemmon ceanothus (Arctostaphylos
spp.-Ceanothus lemmonii) community in Mendocino County.  However,
density of soft chess had changed little 5 years after prescribed fall
fires in nearby nonsprouting manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.)-Lemmon
ceanothus and interior live oak-blue oak (Quercus wislezenii-Q.
douglasii) woodland communities.  Average density (plants/milacre) of
soft chess was [<a href="#80">80</a>]:

No effect:  Neither spring nor fall prescribed fire had significant
effect on soft chess in annual grassland of Sequoia National Park,
California.  Precipitation averaged about 200 percent of normal during
postfire years 1 to 4.  Soft chess formed an important component of the
vegetation (between 10 and 27%) on plots measured before fire and on
spring-burned, fall-burned, and unburned plots measured 4 years after
fire [<a href="#75">75</a>].

Sagebrush steppe - In central Idaho, fire had little effect on soft
chess coverage in either the long term or the short term.  A long-term
study was conducted above the Snake River Canyon, after a July wildfire
occurred 1961 in a rubber rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus
nauseosus)-cheatgrass community.  At postfire year 12, soft chess had
declined on both burned and adjacent unburned plots.  (Weather data were
not given.)  Soft chess coverage was as follows [<a href="#24">24</a>]:

A short-term study was conducted nearby when an August 1972 wildfire
occurred in a rubber rabbitbrush-cheatgrass stand within the Snake River
Canyon.  The following spring, soft chess frequency was 21 percent on
unburned plots and 18 percent on burned plots [<a href="#24">24</a>].

NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
California:  annual grassland - Use of prescribed fire to increase the
balance of natives relative to non-natives such as soft chess has had
mixed results.  In all cases, "remnant" California prairie contains
exotic annuals, and attempts to eliminate the exotics have been
unsuccessful [<a href="#61">61</a>].  However, fire sometimes tips the balance toward
natives.  Perennial bunchgrasses are well adapted to frequent fire
[<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>].  Some authors have reported that fire favors native
bunchgrassses over exotic annuals [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].  However, Garcia and Lathrop
[<a href="#33">33</a>] reported no increase in purple needlegrass after burning, and
Lathrop and Martin [<a href="#66">66</a>] found that native deer grass (Muhlenbergia
rigens) decreased under some burning regimes.  In view of the
differences in phenology and life histories between perennial
bunchgrasses and annual grasses such as soft chess, it would be
instructive to know how burning in different seasons affects the ratio
of native to non-natives.  Since annual grasses produce seed about a
month earlier than perennial grasses, precise timing of burning may
alter the balance of reproductive success between annual and perennial
grasses [<a href="#61">61</a>].

When used with prescribed grazing, fire may favor purple needlegrass and
reduce soft chess and other annual grasses.  Langstrotti [<a href="#65">65</a>] found that
on the Jepson Prairie (a relict perennial grassland reserve in Solano
County, California), short-term, intensive grazing by domestic sheep in
early spring (late March or early April) combined with late summer
(early September) prescribed fire favored tillering and seedling
establishment of purple needlegrass over exotic annual grasses including
soft chess.  Purple needlegrass had been declining on the reserve for a
number of years.  Frequency of soft chess was significantly reduced
(p=0.05) by early spring grazing and late summer fire.  The treatments
reduced soft chess cover to less than 2 percent.  Early spring grazing
reduced average seed mass, and the number of soft chess seeds was
reduced by 76 percent (p=0.25).  Late summer fire reduced soft chess
cover by 50 percent (p<0.001).  Summer grazing and late summer fire also
reduced soft chess, but not as much.  Data from the spring
grazing/late summer fire treatments follow.

                            grazed-     ungrazed-     
                             burnt       unburnt

Effects of postfire seeding of ryegrass on soft chess:  Seeding Italian
ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) to reduce postfire erosion had little
effect on postfire growth of soft chess and other exotic bromes in
southern California chaparral.  Coverage of annual bromes was similar on
unseeded plots and on plots seeded with Italian ryegrass [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Oregon: big sagebrush - Prescribed fire had little effect on soft chess
in a basin big sagebrush/bluebunch wheatgrass community in John Day
Fossil Beds National Monument, Oregon.  Weather patterns occurring after
fire greatly influenced plant community composition, however.  One study
area was prescribed burned on September 25, 1987; an adjacent study area
was prescribed burned on May 24, 1988.  Prescription burning was
followed by 3 years of drought, which appeared to greatly reduce soft
chess cover.  By the third postfire year, soft chess was absent from all
treatments including the unburned control.  Density of other annual
grass species was also greatly reduced on all treatments including the
unburned control.  Density of annual forbs increased on all plots, and
density of native perennial grasses did not change.  Density of woody
shrub species was greatly reduced on burned plots but did not change on
control plots.  Average density of soft chess (plants/sq m) on unburned
control, fall-burned, and spring-burned plots is given below.  Numbers
in parenthesis are the standard errors of the mean; different letters
denote a significant difference between years (p<0.1) [<a href="#82">82</a>].
