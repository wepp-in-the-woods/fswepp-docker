<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Winterfat occurs in salt-desert shrub communities with other chenopod
shrubs including shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia), fourwing saltbush
(A. canescens), spiny hopsage (Grayia spinosa), greenmolly (Kochia
americana), and black greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus).
Winterfat-dominated communities exist in almost pure stands over
extensive areas.  Associated species frequently include green
rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus), Indian ricegrass (Oryzopsis
hymenoides), galleta (Hilaria jamesii), and black sagebrush (Artemisia
nova).  Winterfat is also a common component of grassland and sagebrush
(Artemisia spp.) communities [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  Winterfat occurs in Joshua tree
(Yucca brevifolia) communties in California [<a href="#53">53</a>].

Winterfat is described as a dominant or codominant species in plant
communities in the following publications:

<pre><center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Krascheninnikovia lanata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Winterfat is an important forage plant for livestock and wildlife in
salt-desert shrub rangeland and subalkaline flats, especially during
winter when forage is scarce [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  A winterfat cultivar, `Hatch,' is
taller than native winterfat and protrudes above snow, facilitating
winter grazing [<a href="#66">66</a>].

Winterfat is a staple food for black-tailed jackrabbit [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  It is a
major forage item for Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep on winter ranges near
Yellowstone National Park [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Winterfat contributes 60 to 70 percent
of the winter diet of Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep in the North Dakota
badlands [<a href="#32">32</a>].  It contributed 6 percent of the diet (relative density
in feces) of Nuttall's cottontail in southern Idaho [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Winterfat is
probably eaten by desert tortoise [<a href="#54">54</a>].  Townsend's ground squirrels
browse winterfat [<a href="#107">107</a>].  Other animals that browse winterfat include
mule deer, white-tailed deer, Rocky Mountain elk, desert bighorn sheep,
pronghorn, and Dall sheep [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].  Winterfat seeds are eaten by
rodents including the chisel-toothed kangaroo rat and Great Basin pocket
mouse [<a href="#109">109</a>].

Several passerine bird species breed in winterfat-dominated communities;
these include horned lark, Brewer's sparrow, and sage thrasher in
east-central Nevada [<a href="#58">58</a>], and horned lark, black-throated sparrow, and
loggerhead shrike in Utah [<a href="#57">57</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Winterfat palatability to browsing animals is above average during all
seasons but greatest during periods of active growth [<a href="#85">85</a>].  Palatability
varies year to year [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Winterfat palatability is rated as good for
sheep, good to fair for horses, and fair for cattle [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Average nutrient content of winterfat herbage in winter (compiled from
literature sources by Welch [<a href="#96">96</a>]) is as follows:  43.5 percent in vitro
digestibility, 10.0 percent crude protein, 0.11 percent phosphorus, and
16.8 mg/kg carotene.  Crude protein contents in the spring and summer
are 21.0 percent and 12.2 percent, respectively [<a href="#96">96</a>].  Cook and others
[<a href="#20">20</a>] report nutrient content of the current year's growth during winter
in Utah.  Winterfat is a good source of digestible protein and vitamin A [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Mineral element composition of winterfat stems and leaves is reported by
month and for different soil salinity zones in the Mojave Desert in
southern Nevada [<a href="#744">744</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>].  


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Winterfat is used for cover by rodents [<a href="#95">95</a>].  It is potential nesting
cover for upland game birds, especially when grasses grow up through its
crown [<a href="#76">76</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Winterfat is a useful shrub for reclamation of surface coal and oil
shale mines and revegetation of disturbed sites in arid climates.
Winterfat adapts well to most site conditions, and its extensive root
system stabilizes soil.  However, winterfat is intolerant of flooding,
excess water, and acidic soils.  Planting and seeding methods are
described [<a href="#95">95</a>].  Winterfat can be propagated by stem cuttings [<a href="#30">30</a>].  It
has medium to good adaptation for seeding or transplanting in the
subalpine zone in Utah [<a href="#71">71</a>].  Winterfat survived better on south-facing
slopes than on north-facing slopes when planted from containers on arid
roadcuts in Nevada [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Grass species planted with winterfat should be chosen for minimizing
possible root competition.  In northern Colorado, bluebunch wheatgrass
(Pseudoroegneria spicata) and western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii)
growing within 8 inches (20 cm) of winterfat significantly (P<0.05)
reduced the extent of winterfat roots.  Winterfat had significantly
(p<0.05) shallower rooting depth and area of root concentration when
planted on disturbed soils than when planted on adjacent undisturbed
soils, possibly because soil moisture was greater on disturbed soils
[<a href="#10">10</a>].  Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda) did not interfere with winterfat
seedling establishment in Idaho [<a href="#60">60</a>], but Rosentreter and Jorgensen
[<a href="#110">110</a>] report that winterfat seedlings are not competitive with Sandberg
bluegrass.

Winterfat has genotypic variation in seed germination and seedling
traits [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>].  Seeds from populations on warm dry sites have
shorter chill requirements than those collected from populations on
colder, wetter sites [<a href="#59">59</a>].  Seeds used in revegetation projects should
be collected from sources with similar site conditions [<a href="#77">77</a>].  It is a
poor candidate for rapid colonization by natural seed dispersal because
seeds are not dispersed far from the parent plant [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Winterfat grows well on salty or alkaline soils.  In Texas, winterfat
seedlings transplanted on saline-sodic soils had 61 percent survival
after 3 years.  Soils tested ranged from 13 to 46 percent exchangeable
sodium [<a href="#55">55</a>].




<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Abusive grazing practices have reduced or eliminated winterfat on some
areas even though it is fairly resistant to browsing [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Effects
depend on severity and season of grazing.  Density, frequency, canopy
cover, and basal cover were significantly (p<0.05) greater on areas
protected from grazing than on grazed areas in the northern mixed
prairie of Saskatchewan [<a href="#75">75</a>].  There, winterfat defoliated in late July
or August produced significantly (p<0.05) less biomass the following
year than undisturbed plants or plants browsed earlier in the summer
[<a href="#75">75</a>].  Winterfat is a decreaser on moderately to heavily grazed native
grasslands in Alberta [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Winterfat basal cover on lightly grazed
needle-and-thread grass (Stipa comata)-blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis)
prairie in Alberta did not differ significantly from sites ungrazed for
33 years [<a href="#79">79</a>].  West [<a href="#98">98</a>] reported no significant difference (p<0.05) in
winterfat survival between grazed and ungrazed plots in desert shrub
communities in southwestern Utah [<a href="#98">98</a>].

Grazing season has more influence on winterfat than grazing intensity.
Late winter or early spring grazing is detrimental [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>].  However,
early winter grazing may actually be beneficial.  Winterfat
significantly increased (p<0.05) on light to moderate winter grazing in
western Utah from 1933 to 1989 [<a href="#108">108</a>].  Light grazing and grazing during
winter increased winterfat survival and recruitment during a drought in
southwestern Utah.  Changes in plant morphology caused by grazing may
encourage more effective use of soil moisture [<a href="#16">16</a>].

On some heavily grazed rangelands, other species are replacing
winterfat.  Areas formerly dominated by winterfat in the Duckwater
Watershed in Nevada have been converted to flixweed tansymustard
(Descurainia sophia) or have been invaded by halogeton (Halogeton
glomeratus) or Russian-thistle (Salsola kali) [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Broom snakeweed
(Gutierrezia sarothrae) has increased on degraded winterfat communities
in the Upper Rio Puerco Watershed in New Mexico [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Blaisdell and Holmgren [<a href="#9">9</a>] recommend that browsing of winterfat be
limited to 60 percent of its annual growth.  Grazing management
strategies are presented [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Wilkin [<a href="#103">103</a>] has published a regression
equation applicable to winterfat which predicts utilization of a
particular shrub species from relative abundance, expected utilization
of total forage, and relative palatability in the plant community.  Romo
and others [<a href="#75">75</a>] suggest winterfat management strategies for the northern
mixed prairie region in Saskatchewan.  

Degraded rangeland can be improved by seeding winterfat although
seedling establishment is not consistent.  Aerial broadcasting of
winterfat fruits after light chaining of the surface is effective.  Late
fall or winter seeding is most successful in Utah [<a href="#41">41</a>].

Land managers and livestock growers have been concerned about the
effects of black-tailed jackrabbits on winterfat.  In southern Idaho,
aboveground annual growth was completely eaten over in winter during
peak population densities of black-tailed jackrabbit.  However,
winterfat growth resumed in the spring and by July there was no
significant (p<0.05) difference in total biomass between open and
protected plots [<a href="#4">4</a>].

A shrub mortality (die-off) epidemic struck the Great Basin in the
mid-1980s.  Winterfat was affected and declined despite protection from
browsing.  Above-average precipitation is suspected to have altered
soil-water relationships and perhaps facilitated the entry of root
pathogens [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Krascheninnikovia lanata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Winterfat is a native, low-growing, long-lived subshrub with a woody
base and numerous annual branchlets growing 1 to 2 feet (0.3-0.6 m)
tall.  Herbage is hairy giving the plant a silvery white appearance
[<a href="#62">62</a>].  The narrow leaves remain on the plant during winter and are shed
when new leaves grow in the spring or when the plant is water stressed
[<a href="#99">99</a>].  The flowers are inconspicuous with no petals [<a href="#62">62</a>].  The fruit,
0.2-inch (0.5-cm) long, is a utricle enclosed in two bracts covered with
fine, silky, pilose hairs [<a href="#13">13</a>].  The oldest winterfat plant in a
community in southwestern Idaho was 136 years old [<a href="#106">106</a>].

Winterfat is polymorphic with short and tall ecotypes. The typical
variety is low growing.  Krascheninnikovia lanata var. subspinosa has
taller, woodier stems at the base than the typical variety, and K. l.
var. ruinina is woody for 2.6 feet (0.8 m) from the base, with annual
growth sometimes exceeding 3.9 feet (1.2 m) in height [<a href="#97">97</a>].

The root system consists of a deep taproot with numerous branched
lateral roots.  Fibrous roots are contained within the upper meter of
soil but may extend as deep as 57 inches (145 cm).  The taproot may grow
as deep as 25 feet (7.6 m) [<a href="#85">85</a>].  In Saskatchewan, a winterfat taproot
penetrated 6 feet (1.8 m) [<a href="#21">21</a>], and in western Colorado, winterfat root
depth was 3.1 feet (0.95 m) [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Winterfat reproduces by seed and sprouts from buds near the plant's base
when browsed or damaged [<a href="#111">111</a>].  Under favorable conditions, winterfat
may produce seed in its first growing season, but it may require up to 5
years to produce seed in areas of low rainfall [<a href="#85">85</a>].  Seed production,
especially in desert regions, is dependent on precipitation [<a href="#101">101</a>].  Good
seed years occur when there is appreciable summer precipitation and
little browsing [<a href="#85">85</a>].  Winterfat produced approximately 350 seeds per
plant on a site in western North Dakota during a slightly drier than
normal year [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Seeds are dispersed a short distance by wind.  In a study of seed
dispersal, 67 percent of seed was found within 12 inches (30 cm) of
the parent plant, and no seeds were farther than 35 inches (90 cm) away
[<a href="#44">44</a>].  All seedlings observed on southwestern Idaho sites were within 3
feet (1 m) of a mature plant [<a href="#60">60</a>].

The hairy bracts help anchor seed to soil which in turn helps the
radicle penetrate and begin growth.  Entire fruits have better seedling
establishment and seedling vigor than threshed seed, which may be
damaged [<a href="#13">13</a>].

An undetermined percent of winterfat seeds are dormant when fresh.  A
10-week afterripening period generally breaks dormancy [<a href="#82">82</a>].  In the
laboratory, a 14-day prechill period at 41 degrees Fahrenheit (5 deg C)
effectively breaks dormancy of fresh seed [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Germination generally occurs during warm, wet weather [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Germination
occurs near the soil surface [<a href="#104">104</a>].  Seedlings emerged substantially
better from a 0.06-inch (0.02-cm) depth than than from greater depths
[<a href="#81">81</a>].  Germination is reduced as moisture stress increases, regardless
of temperature [<a href="#80">80</a>].  However, seeds are sensitive to deficient aeration
and have poor germination rates when soils approach saturation.
Germination was best at field capacity soil moisture [<a href="#81">81</a>].

Germination of viable seeds generally exceeds 90 percent within a
constant temperature range of 50 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (10-27 deg C).
Optimum temperatures for germination depend on seed source [<a href="#105">105</a>].
Germination is generally complete within 5 days at 59 degrees Fahrenheit
(15 deg C) or higher [<a href="#83">83</a>].  Dettori and others [<a href="#23">23</a>] achieved greater
than 95 percent germination when they used an alternating temperature
regime with a 32, 36, or 41 degree Fahrenheit (0, 2, or 5 deg C) cold
period and a 59 or 68 degree Fahrenheit (15 or 20 deg C) warm period.
For laboratory germination, a 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 deg C) constant
temperature for 14 days without light is recommended [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Booth [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>]
reports that post germination growth is affected by mother-plant
transpiration, imbibition temperature, windstress, and nutrition.

As the level of soil salinity increases, germination decreases [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>].
Choride salts reduce germination more than sulfide salts.  Germination
was severely restricted by soil sodium chloride levels of 2 percent [<a href="#17">17</a>]
and 3 percent [<a href="#105">105</a>].

Winterfat seeds stored in an open (temperature unregulated) warehouse in
Utah maintained high germination rates (greater than 74%) for 4 years,
but germination after 5 years was only 18 percent, and germination was 0
percent after 10 years of storage [<a href="#86">86</a>].  After 8 years of refrigerated
storage at 34 to 42 degrees Fahrenheit (1-6 deg C), viability ranged
from 51 to 80 percent [<a href="#84">84</a>].

Natural reproduction in central New Mexico had greatest survival on
disturbed soils with low-growing vegetation that afforded some shelter
but little shade.  By July, when summer rains began, the only seedlings
surviving were either close to mature winterfat, in grass clumps, or in
litter.  The seedling roots penetrated beneath those of the grasses.
Seedlings were successful on land protected from grazing or lightly
grazed range dominated by grasses, but did not survive heavy grazing
[<a href="#104">104</a>].  Seedling survival was poor in the Mojave Desert.  Of the 44
seedlings that established on plots during a 5-year period, none lived
to a second growing season [<a href="#1">1</a>].




<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Winterfat occurs in dry valley bottoms, on flat mesas, and on hillsides.
It occurs on well-drained, calcareous soils with low to moderate salt
concentrations [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>].  It is a halophytic species which excludes
salt at the roots [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].  It often occurs over compact and indurated
calcic horizons [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Soil texture apparently does not influence the
distribution of winterfat [<a href="#95">95</a>].

Winterfat occurs in arid to semiarid climates with mean annual
precipitation ranging from 5 to 20 inches (130-510 mm) [<a href="#95">95</a>].
Elevational ranges for some states are as follows:

Arizona    2,000-7,000 feet 	  (600-2,100 m) [<a href="#47">47</a>]
California   300-8,900 feet 	  (100-2,700 m) [<a href="#42">42</a>]
Colorado   3,800-9,500 feet     (1,160-2,900 m) [<a href="#25">25</a>]
Montana    3,800-5,000 feet     (1,160-1,520 m) [<a href="#25">25</a>]
Wyoming    4,000-7,300 feet     (1,200-2,200 m) [<a href="#25">25</a>]
Utah       2,400-9,300 feet 	  (730-2,840 m) [<a href="#97">97</a>]

In northern climates, winterfat is often found on south- or west-facing
slopes.  It occurs on ridgetops and south- and west-facing slopes in the
Gros Ventre River drainage in northwestern Wyoming [<a href="#39">39</a>], and on southern
aspects in coulees in Alberta [<a href="#52">52</a>].  In the Kluane Range in Yukon
Territory, winterfat occurs on open, xeric gravelly hillsides [<a href="#64">64</a>].
Winterfat is tolerant of cold temperatures.  Lethal temperatures for
winterfat shoots (measured in laboratory tests) were -112 degrees
Fahrenheit (-80 deg C) in winter and -31 degrees Fahrenheit (-35 deg C)
in April [<a href="#94">94</a>].  However, newly germinated seedlings are susceptible to
freezing temperatures [<a href="#85">85</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Winterfat is a component of stable arid shrub communities.  Winterfat
communities have very little change in population over time [<a href="#16">16</a>].
Winterfat is intolerant of shade; it decreases as juniper (Juniperus
spp.) cover increases [<a href="#112">112</a>].

Winterfat is generally not favored by disturbance.  It had only 4.3
percent cover on formerly cultivated, ungrazed lands, whereas cover was
21 percent on undisturbed sites in Alberta [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Winterfat
significantly (p<0.01) increased in desert grasslands protected from
grazing for 10 years in southern Utah [<a href="#49">49</a>].  In southwestern Nevada,
winterfat had greater mean density in undisturbed communities than in
communities disturbed by Nevada Test Site activities [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Winterfat
was not present on mined sites abandoned from 1 to 13 years previously,
but was present on adjacent unmined plots in northwestern New Mexico
[<a href="#91">91</a>].  Although winterfat is susceptible to disturbance, it establishes
on disturbed sites if seeds are present [<a href="#104">104</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
In the Mojave Desert, winterfat flowers and puts out new growth
following adequate spring, summer, or fall rains [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Germination
occurs between October and March after rains of at least 0.6 inch (16
mm) [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Bud, leaf, flower, and fruiting phenology is reported for a
2-year period in the Mojave Desert [<a href="#2">2</a>].

In Saskatchewan, average first flowering date of winterfat over a 5-year
period was June 27.  The mean flowering period was 45 days [<a href="#15">15</a>].  In
western Colorado, flowers bloom in late May to early June [<a href="#14">14</a>].  The
average phenology of winterfat in the Curlew Valley in northern Utah
over a 7-year period follows [<a href="#101">101</a>]:

Stage				average date

leaf buds swell			April 8
twigs elongate			April 29
floral buds develop		May 28
flowers open			June 7
fruits develop  		July 8
fruit dissemination begins	August 27
summer dormancy begins		September 10

Winterfat root growth was primarily in the upper soil layers early in
the growing season in the Curlew Valley.  Later in the season, root
growth began in the deeper soil layers [<a href="#33">33</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Prior to the invasion of exotic annuals, fire was an uncommon component
of salt-desert shrub communities.  Salt-desert communities dominated by
winterfat produced little fine fuel.  The introduction of annual
grasses, including the highly flammable cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum),
into these communities has altered fuel loads and fuel distribution.
After wet years when annual grass production is high, salt-desert shrub
communities are susceptible to fire.  Fire drastically alters the
community composition because salt-desert shrubs are not adapted to
periodic fire [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Krascheninnikovia lanata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Winterfat is either killed or top-killed by fire, depending on fire
severity.  Severe fire can kill the perennating buds located several
inches above the ground surface and thus kills the plant.  In addition,
severe fire usually destroys seed on the plant.  Low-severity fire
scorches or only partially consumes the aboveground portions of
winterfat and thus does not cause high mortality.

On a winterfat-dominated rangeland on the Snake River Plain in
southwestern Idaho, a severe wildfire in September 1981 resulted in 100
percent mortality of winterfat.  Herbage production was well above
normal that year and fuel levels were high.  Winterfat was consumed to
within 1 inch (2.5 cm) of ground level [<a href="#68">68</a>].

Pellant and Reichert [<a href="#68">68</a>] observed that on other severe burns on the
Snake River Plain, winterfat mortality is often about 95 percent, and
that surviving winterfat plants have at least 20 percent annual leader
growth remaining [<a href="#68">68</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
There are conflicting reports in the literature about the response of
winterfat to fire.  In one of the first published descriptions (1967),
Dwyer and Pieper [<a href="#27">27</a>] reported that winterfat sprouts vigorously after
fire.  This observation was frequently cited in subsequent literature,
but recent observations have suggested that winterfat can be completely
killed by fire [<a href="#68">68</a>].  The response is apparently dependent on fire
severity.  Winterfat is able to sprout from buds near the base of the
plant.  However, if these buds are destroyed, winterfat will not sprout.

Winterfat sprouted vigorously after a "relatively" low-severity, April
fire on a true pinyon (Pinus edulis)-oneseed juniper (Juniperus
monosperma)-blue grama rangeland in New Mexico.  The surface fire moved
1,250 feet per hour (380 m/hr) through the dry grass fuel.  There was
less than 750 pounds of fuel per acre (840 kg/ha) in the open grasslands
[<a href="#27">27</a>].

Scorched winterfat sprouted after a July fire in a salt-desert shrub
community in the Curlew Valley of northwestern Utah.  Bottlebrush
squirreltail (Elymus elymoides) was the major fuel.  Subsequent
populations of winterfat on the site appeared "reduced" [<a href="#100">100</a>].

Pellant and Reichert [<a href="#68">68</a>] observed that regeneration of winterfat from
seed is rare after fire on the Snake River Plain, Idaho.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In order for the salt-desert shrub communities to persist in the
presence of flammable annual grasses, either fire has to be prevented or
extensive rehabilitation has to follow each fire.  The costs of
rehabilitation after a cheatgrass fire can exceed 100 dollars per acre
[<a href="#73">73</a>].  Winterfat has been successfully seeded on burns [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>], but the
price may be prohibitive.  In order to protect salt-desert shrub
communities from fire, greenstrip vegetative fuel breaks have been
created in some areas [<a href="#67">67</a>].

Burned sites should be seeded before cheatgrass is able to establish or
gain dominance.  On the Snake River Birds of Prey Area in southwestern
Idaho, winterfat was seeded with various perennial grasses on three
separate burns in the early 1980s.  Winterfat seedlings established and
matured, and by 1987, mature plants began producing seeds and new
seedlings established in 1988.  Seedlings were able to establish amid
considerable perennial herbaceous competition from primarily Sandberg
bluegrass.  Most winterfat seedlings occurred in areas where cheatgrass
cover was less than 10 percent.  Sandberg bluegrass controlled the
invasion of annual weeds and allowed for winterfat establishment [<a href="#60">60</a>].
Winterfat was seeded in December on a burn in Utah.  Nearly 1 percent of
winterfat seeds became established seedlings for an average density of
4,200 seedlings per acre (10,374/ha) [<a href="#18">18</a>].
