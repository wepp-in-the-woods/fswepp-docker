<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Scirpus robustus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Saltmarsh bulrush is valuable to wildlife as food and cover.  Muskrat
and waterfowl eat the seeds [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  In the coastal plain of Louisiana,
saltmarsh bulrush is one of the most important waterfowl foods as
measured by gizzard content [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Saltmarsh bulrush provides cover for fiddler crabs and nesting ducks
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Saltmarsh bulrush was used to improve habitat for largemouth bass in the
Lake Mead Recreation Area [<a href="#4">4</a>].  It established and spread quickly,
showing an 88 percent survival rate.  After 1 month cover rates
increased from 45 percent to 80 percent on one site and from 30 percent
to 70 percent on another.


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Pure stands of Scirpus species in Louisiana saltmarshes are more
susceptible to destruction by foraging geese and muskrats than are
Scirpus stands mixed with other climax species [<a href="#16">16</a>].

After seed planting, water level over the seeds should be maintained at
1 foot for 2 weeks, then reduced to "mudflat stage" [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Periodic
flooding up to 3 feet should occur until the seeds are established.
Seeds can germinate in fresh water but are unable to compete well with
other species under these conditions [<a href="#18">18</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Scirpus robustus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Saltmarsh bulrush is a native, rhizomotous, perennial sedge [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].
Its triangular culms are 2.3 to 5 feet (0.7-1.5 m) tall, with narrow
leaves.  It has from one to five spikelets that are 0.4 to 1 inch (1-2.5
cm) long [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Spikelets have been described as reddish-brown near
the coast and more straw-colored inland [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Seed heads are brown and
occur in dense, conical clusters [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Saltmarsh bulrush regenerates mainly by tuber-forming rhizomes [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].

Germination tests have shown seeds to be very viable; 95 percent
germinated after exposure to 14 hours of light per day [<a href="#21">21</a>].  When
exposed to salinity levels of 9,000 p/m, germination is reduced by 50
percent.  No germination occurred after salinity levels reached 21,000
p/m [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Saltmarsh bulrush seeds can remain dormant in marsh soils for
"long periods" until moisture conditions are favorable [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Saltmarsh bulrush is an obligate wetland species found in brackish
coastal and inland marshes [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  In California it usually grows below
1,000 feet (305 m), but in the Great Basin it is found between 2,000 and
5,000 feet (610-1,524 m) [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Soil salinities of saltmarsh bulrush
communities have been measured between 3,000 and 22,000 p/m, but it
appears to grow best when salinity levels average between 3,000 and
7,000 p/m [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Water depths in these Scirpus communities average
between -6 and +5 inches (-15 and +13 cm).  Soil pH ranges from 4.3 to
6.4 [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].

Common associates of saltmarsh bulrush include common reed (Phragmites
communis), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), cordgrass (Spartina spp.),
American bulrush (Scirpus americanus), widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima),
coastal saltgrass (Distichlis spicata var. spicata), sedge (Carex spp.),
buckbrush (Baccharis halimifolia), marsh button (Achyranthes
philoxeroides), seaside goldenrod (Solidago mexicana), cattail (Typha
spp.), bulltongue (Sagittaria spp.), and cutgrass (Zizaniopsis miliacea)
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Saltmarsh bulrush is a pioneer species in coastal marshes where soil is
exposed and water levels fluctuate [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  In areas where fire is
excluded, saltmarsh bulrush is subclimax to marshbay cordgrass (Spartina
patens) but could become dominant with frequent fire.  In the absence of
disturbance, it is outcompeted and eventually crowded out by climax
species [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Saltmarsh bulrush sprouts in early spring, flowers between April and
August, and fruits between July and October [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  After a brief
dormant period in summer, it will resprout in the fall if soils are
flooded again [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Water level fluctuations of 6 to 8 inches (15-20
cm) in spring, summer, or early fall will increase saltmarsh bulrush
[<a href="#20">20</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Scirpus robustus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Saltmarsh bulrush can survive fire by sprouting from rhizomes [<a href="#9">9</a>].
However, because saltmarsh bulrush grows in coastal and wetland areas
fire may be infrequent.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Scirpus robustus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire removes all aboveground vegetation of saltmarsh bulrush [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
Chabreck [<a href="#2">2</a>] reported that fall burning of Scirpus communities
benefitted this genus.  Fire in brackish coastal marshes can increase
minerals such as potassium, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium [<a href="#13">13</a>].
The absolute concentration of these and other minerals increased in
Scirpus shoots following a January/February burn in the coastal marshes
of Mississippi [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Because saltmarsh bulrush has much deeper rhizomes
than the dominant marshbay cordgrass, fire can be used to enhance
saltmarsh bulrush in areas where cordgrass is not desired [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Saltmarsh bulrush can sprout as quickly as 1 week following fire [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
In Mississippi coastal marshes, prescribed fire effects on vegetation
were simulated by clipping all aboveground vegetation in areas where
soils were wet or where there was standing water [<a href="#11">11</a>].  This caused an
increase in net primary production of Spartina communities that included
saltmarsh bulrush.  However, saltmarsh bulrush itself did not show an
increase in abundance here as reported by others in similar communities
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In the South, saltmarsh bulrush can be burned during late winter to
enhance food for geese and muskrats [<a href="#16">16</a>].  However, ash could possibly
retard vegetative recovery of marshland plants [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Burning an entire
marsh community at one time is not recommended because different stages
of plant community development are needed for various animal life cycle
stages [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Perkins [<a href="#30">30</a>] recommended burning Scirpus marshes between
October and January to maintain constant annual growth.
