<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Anderson wolfberry occurs in some desert shrub and woodland community
types but seldom attains dominance.  Wolfberry is a codominate in only
one plant association (Larrea-Lycium andersonii-Grayia). This
association occurs in the Mojave Desert of Nevada.

The publication listing Anderson wolfberry as an indicator or dominant
species is as follows:

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Anderson wolfberry is sometimes used as forage by livestock and feral
burros [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  In the lower Colorado River Valley, Arizona, this shrub
can provide an important source of phosphorous and B-carotene for feral
burros in late summer and fall when other more preferred species were
unavailable [<a href="#9">9</a>].

The red berries are eaten by some birds and mammals [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Berries of
this plant constituted 2 percent of the diet of chukar partridges living
on the eastern desert ranges of California.  In some areas of southern
Nevada, the fleshy leaves and juicy berries provide part of the
succulence permitting Gambel quail to occupy desert areas devoid of
drinking water.  Ord kangaroo rats are also known to eat these berries
[<a href="#8">8</a>].  Black-chinned hummingbirds are attracted to Anderson wolfberry's
pollen [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability of Anderson wolfberry browse is presumably fair to low.
This species is used as forage only when more desirable species are
unavailable [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  The fruit, however, appears to be moderately
palatable.


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Nutrient values were examined in detail in a Great Basin study at
Mercury Valley, Nye County, Nevada [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Selected values are as
follows:

                  Percent dry weight
        N     P     Na     K     Ca     Mg     Si
shoot   -    .10    .010   2.12  2.65   .24    .04   
leaf    3.26 .12    .013   5.58  11.64  1.44   .05


                   ppm dry weight (micrograms)
        Zn     Cu     Fe     Mn     B     Sr
shoot    9      3     90      5     12    77
leaf    41      4     162    33     65    648


In the lower Colorado River Valley, Arizona, researchers found that the
gross energy for Anderson wolfberry was lowest in January and February,
but stayed between 4.0 and 5.0 kcal/g all year.  Crude protein was
highest in the spring at approximately 0.075 percent and decreased
through summer, fall, and early winter to approximately 0.05 percent
[<a href="#9">9</a>].  Phosphorus levels generally decreased in the summer and fall and
were highest in the spring.  B-carotene levels were greatest in the late
winter when growth was active [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
In desert washes Anderson wolfberry grows in dense thorny thickets which
provide good cover for quail and other small wildlife [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].  In
southern Arizona, Anderson wolfberry provides resting and feeding cover
for masked bobwhite quail [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Wolfberry provides midday shade and is
open around the base to allow easy escape from predators [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
No specific information is available on Anderson wolfberry's value for
rehabilitating disturbed sites.  Lycium spp., however, have been used to
rehabilitate abandoned desert farmlands in the Sonoran desert lowlands,
disturbed sites in Red Rock, Arizona, and disturbed lands in the Mojave
Desert [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  In the Sonoran Desert lowlands and in Red Rock,
Arizona, sites were restored by establishing berms on the contour, and
then seeding with wolfberry (Lycium spp.) and other desert shrubs [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Desert shrub transplants should be protected from grazing animals to
ensure establishment and survival [<a href="#22">22</a>].  In addition, summer annuals
(Salsola spp.) must be removed from around the transplanted shrubs to
reduce competition for water, and some of the nutrient resource must be
returned to the soil [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Native Americans used the fleshy berries of Anderson wolfberry either
fresh or boiled and then dried them for later use [<a href="#17">17</a>].  This shrub is
also used as an ornamental valued chiefly for its showy red berries
[<a href="#24">24</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lycium andersonii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Anderson wolfberry is a native desert shrub [<a href="#28">28</a>].  It is spiny, rounded,
and much branched, obtaining a height of 1 to 9 feet (0.30-2.7 m)
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Twigs are light barked [<a href="#25">25</a>]; spines are
numerous and slender, 0.20 to 0.80 inch (5-20 mm) long [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>];
leaves are flattened, but thick and fleshy, 0.09 to 0.66 inch (3-17 mm)
long [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  This species is drought deciduous, meaning it loses
foliage in response to low moisture availability [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Anderson wolfberry roots are tough and fiberous [<a href="#29">29</a>].  The root system
is relatively extensive in comparison with aerial portions [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>],
often extending 25 to 30 feet (7.6-9.1 m) from the plant [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Flowers and Fruits:  The perfect flowers of Anderson wolfberry are
pollinated by birds such as black-chinned hummingbirds.  The fleshy red
berries of this plant contain many seeds [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  After ingestion,
seeds are disseminated by small mammals and birds in droppings [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

Seed germination:  Seeds generally germinate late in the year following
summer rains.  In a Nevada test site study, a large number of Anderson
wolfberry seeds germinated in the late summer of 1967 and early spring
1968 presumably as a result of 1967 summer rains [<a href="#31">31</a>].  By germinating
late in the year, the seedlings have the advantage of both winter and
spring rains [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Root sprouting is another form of regeneration
[<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Adventitous shoots form readily on broken roots [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Shoots
will actually form on uninjured roots that have been exposed to the air
[<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Anderson wolfberry commonly grows on sandy or gravelly washes, sandy or
alkali flats, mesas and slopes generally from 1,500 to 6,000 feet
(457-1,829 m) in elevation [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  This species exhibits some degree
of facultative adaptation for salt tolerance and has been known to occur
on poorly drained soils with high alkalinity and/or salinity [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].
Anderson wolfberry also occurs on highly calcareous, well-developed
desert pavement with a strongly cemented caliche layer [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Soil pH of
some sites where this species occurs ranges from 8.0 to 8.3 [<a href="#21">21</a>].
Growth of Anderson wolfberry appears to be independent of soil
temperature but not of soil pH [<a href="#33">33</a>].  When cuttings were grown for 90
days in loam soil, accidification of the soil resulted in decreased dry
weight and calcium carbonate [<a href="#33">33</a>].

Anderson wolfberry is commonly found associated with the following
species:  ceosotebush (Larrea tridentata), foothill "yellow" paloverde
(Cercidium microphyllum), white bursage (Ambrosia dumosa), smoke tree
(Dalia spinosa), rough ephedera (Ephedra nevadensis), hop-sage (Grayia
spinosa), pale wolfberry (Lycium pallidum), blackbush (Coleogyne
ramossissima), burrobush (Hymenoclea monogyra), Joshua tree (Yucca
brevifolia) [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].
 
Some of these species form discrete clumps of vegetation separated by
bare areas of desert pavement.  Size and spacing is irregular, and as
many as 10 different species may aggregate with interlocking foliage
[<a href="#33">33</a>].


Anderson wolfberry typically occurs on hot, dry sites. It often occurs
in areas with only 5 to 6.5 inches (128-162 mm) annual precipitation
[<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Anderson wolfberry is a slow-growing shrub which appearsf to a
stress-tolerant competitor and is therefore found in many older seral
communities.  This species eventually dominates over other colonizing
species but gradually gives way to the stress tolerators of the climax
communities [<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Seasonal development of Anderson wolfberry varies with seasonal climatic
conditions [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  In the western United States, flowering starts in
April to June, in the southwestern United States in January to May, and
in California flowering occurs from November to April [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Studies in
the Lower Colorado River Valley, Nevada, showed that leaf development
occurs in late February to March followed by flowering in mid-March to
April and fruiting in April and May [<a href="#9">9</a>].

The plant generally becomes dormant in late May through January
depending on the amount of available moisture [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Leaf fall was
found to coincide with high temperatures and depletion of soil moisture
[<a href="#33">33</a>].  A study in the Rock Valley, Nevada, found that high winter
temperatures delayed leafing [<a href="#29">29</a>].  New leaves normally occur on
established stems even in dry years, but new shoots generally are
produced only in relatively moist growing seasons [<a href="#33">33</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lycium andersonii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Many long-lived desert perennials are poorly adapted to fire [<a href="#4">4</a>] and
Anderson wolfberry is no exception.  Adaptations to fire are present but
are not strongly developed [<a href="#25">25</a>].  This shrub does have the ability to
sprout from the root crown after disturbance [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>], but it may take
many years for it to reach preburn densities on a burned site [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].
Seedling establishment of Lycium spp. was observed following a fire on a
Sonoran Desert site; these seedlings resulted from seeds surviving fire
in the soil, surviving on burned plants, or dispersed from resistant
plants within the burn, or from unburned areas [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by animals or water; postfire yr 1&2
   secondary colonizer; off-site seed carried to site after year 2

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lycium andersonii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire typically destroys aboveground parts of Anderson wolfberry, but the
degree of damage to the plant depends on fire severity.  Following a
high-severity fire in a creosotebush community, most plants were reduced
to ash and mortality was almost inevitable [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Following moderate
severity fires, however, intermittent sprouting occurred [<a href="#4">4</a>].
  
Lycium species were sampled following two June Sonoran Desert fires
[<a href="#25">25</a>].  No information of the fire's severity or intensity was provided.
Results are as follows [<a href="#25">25</a>]:

%Consumption= Mean reduction of total biomass. 


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Anderson wolfberry sprouts from the root crown or roots after
disturbance, and will presumably do so after fire [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In some desert communities, such as cresotebush, where Anderson
wolfberry occurs, fires tend to be infrequent due to limited fuel, wide
spacing between shrubs, and sparse ground cover [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Many desert
perennials are poorly adapted to burning.  Recurrent fires appear to
select for short-lived desert shrubs at the expense of long-lived
species [<a href="#4">4</a>] such as Anderson wolfberry.  Postdisturbance recolonization
by long-lived species is very slow initially and may require hundreds of
years [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  A conservative approach toward desert fire management is
recommended [<a href="#25">25</a>].
