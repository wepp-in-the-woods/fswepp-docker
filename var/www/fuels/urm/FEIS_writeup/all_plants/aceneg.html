<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The fully documented scientific name of boxelder is Acer negundo L.
Numerous varieties of this widely distributed species have been
designated [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>]:

    Acer negundo var. negundo L.

    Acer negundo var. violaceum (Kirchn.) Jaeg.   
    Acer negundo var. texanum Pax.                
    Acer negundo var. californicum Sarg.          
    Acer negundo var. arizonicum Sarg.            

These varieties appear to represent fairly distinct geographic races.
Intergradation occurs between varieties and has been considerable
between var. violaceum and var. negundo [<a href="#16">16</a>].

<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Acer negundo
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Boxelder is widespread in riparian and palustrine communities throughout
most of the contiguous United States.  Its range extends from New Jersey
and central New York west through extreme southern Ontario, central
Michigan, northern Minnesota, central Manitoba, central Saskstchewan,
southern Alberta and central Montana, eastern Wyoming, Utah, and
California; and south to southern Texas and central Florida.  It is also
local in New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Idaho, and
Nevada.  Boxelder has been naturalized in Maine, southern Quebec, New
Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and in southeastern
Washington and eastern Oregon.  Varieties of boxelder occur in the
mountains of Mexico (Nuevo Leon, San Luis Potosi, and south to
Chihuahua) and in Guatemala [<a href="#32">32</a>].

General distribution by variety is as follows [<a href="#25">25</a>]:
 
var. negundo -- eastern United States and introduced to eastern
                Washington and Oregon
var. interior -- Rocky Mountains to Arizona and Canada

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Boxelder is a component of various deciduous forest plant associations
in the Great Plains.  It is associated with the following overstory
dominants:  green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), narrowleaf cottonwood
(Populus angustifolia), plains cottonwood (P. sargentii), aspen (P.
tremuloides), willow (Salix spp.), and bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa).  In
Arizona and New Mexico, boxelder is the overstory dominant in several
high elevation riparian forests.  In much of this species' range there
are no described plant communities.

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Acer negundo
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Boxelder is not a desired timber species because its wood is light,
soft, close grained, and low in strength [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  The wood is used
locally for boxes and rough construction [<a href="#27">27</a>], and is used occasionally
for cheap furniture and woodenware.  Boxelder was once used for posts,
fencing, and fuel but the soft, spongy wood generally makes poor
firewood [<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Riparian boxelder communities provide important habitat for many
wildlife species and protect livestock from temperature extremes in
summer and winter.  Many species of birds and squirrels feed on the
seeds of boxelder [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  Mule deer and white-tailed deer use it in
the fall as a browse species of secondary importance [<a href="#37">37</a>].  This tree
may be poisonous to livestock [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability of boxelder has been rated as follows [<a href="#9">9</a>]:

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The nutritional value of boxelder is low for livestock, with fair energy
value, poor protein value, and suspected toxicity [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Boxelder provides valuable cover for wildlife and livestock, especially
in the Great Plains region where quality cover is often lacking.  The
degree to which this species provides environmental protection during
one or more seasons for wildlife species is as follows [<a href="#9">9</a>]:

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Growth of boxelder is poor on saline, sodic, sodic-saline, and most
acidic soils; it is not recommended for use in rehabilitation of
disturbed sites.  This tree's potential for erosion control and for
long-term revegetation is low to medium [<a href="#9">9</a>].

In California, Arizona, and parts of Nevada and New Mexico, boxelder is
one of many native species used for revegetating flood control basins to
provide quality wildlife habitat [<a href="#13">13</a>].  In the southeastern United
States where soil moisture (or inundation) is likely to be excessive for
several weeks at a time, boxelder is one of the favored flood-tolerant
species recommended for recreation plantings.

Boxelder is propogated by seed.  Guides for seed collection, treatment,
and cultivation are available [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Boxelder, first cultivated in 1688 [<a href="#39">39</a>], is often held in low regard as
an ornamental tree in cities.  Its limbs are brittle and break easily;
its trunk is susceptible to rot and infested with boxelder bugs, which
make their way into houses with the arrival of cold weather.  The leaves
turn a dull yellow and fall untidily over a long period, as do the
winged seeds, giving this species the reputation of being a "dirty tree"
[<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  However, because of its fast growth and drought and cold
hardiness, boxelder is popular in rural communities for street and
ornamental plantings; and for shelterbelts.

Boxelder's abundant sap contains a large proportion of sugar as well as
mucilaginous and demulcent properties, and can be made into a pleasant
beverage [<a href="#22">22</a>].  The Plains Indians used the sap as a source of syrup,
and it is still used today, but the product is not as sweet as sugar
maple syrup [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Boxelder is susceptible to mechanical damage by livestock in northern
Great Plains wooded draws [<a href="#4">4</a>].  This tree is also easily storm damaged;
its weak branches often break off in the wind, but the trunk is wind
firm [<a href="#47">47</a>].

Boxelder is easily injured by heartrot, fire, and insects.  It is often
infested with boxelder bugs which feed on the tree but rarely kill it
[<a href="#40">40</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Acer negundo
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Boxelder is a native deciduous small to large tree with an irregular
form.  The trunk often divides near the ground into a few long,
spreading, rather crooked limbs, which branch irregularly to support a
broad, uneven crown.  When growing among other trees, boxelder forms a
high, open crown, with the undivided portion of the trunk much longer
and usually straighter than that of an open-grown tree [<a href="#27">27</a>].  This
variable-sized tree may reach 70 feet (21 m) in height and 3 feet (0.92
m) in diameter but is more often medium sized, from 40 to 50 feet (12-15
m) high and from 1 to 2 feet (0.3-0.6 m) in diameter [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Boxelder may
also appear as a large shrub [<a href="#50">50</a>], and in upland soil on the Great
Plains this tree is usually only about 25 feet (8 m) high with low,
crooked branches [<a href="#45">45</a>].

Boxelder has a fast growth rate [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>] and a short life span [<a href="#46">46</a>]; it
typically lives for 75 years, with 100 years maximum longevity [<a href="#33">33</a>].
Growth is rapid when young; long, smooth, green annual shoots extend 2
feet (0.6 m) or more in a year.  At maturity growth slows and brittle
trunks and limbs shatter; old trunks frequently put out clusters of
sprouts and sometimes develop large burls [<a href="#31">31</a>].

A drought-tolerant tree once established, boxelder's roots are shallow
and spreading, except on deep soils [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  The bark is light grey and
smooth but becomes furrowed into narrow, firm ridges and darkens with
age.  Twigs are stout, light green to purplish or brownish with a
polished look or are often covered with a whitish bloom that is easily
rubbed off.  The blunt buds are 0.125 to 0.25 inch (2-5 mm) long with
one or two pairs of scales and are coated with fine white hairs [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Boxelder is the only maple with divided leaves.  The three to seven
leaflets are from 6 to 15 inches (15-38 cm) long, light green above and
greyish green below, usually without hairs.  The leaflets are shallowly
lobed or coarsely toothed [<a href="#27">27</a>].  This completely dioecious tree has pale
green male and female flowers with a strongly pronounced reduction of
flower parts, and contains no rudimentary parts of the opposite sex.
Male flowers are on slender stalks in loose clusters, and female flowers
are arranged along a separate stem [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].

The fruit is composed of two fused, winged samaras which eventually
separate upon shedding.  The angle separating the two wings is less than
60 degrees [<a href="#27">27</a>].  The samaras, about 1.5 inches (4 cm) long, hang in
long chains on slender stalks, mature in autumn, and remain on the tree
well into the winter [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Each contains a single seed without an
endosperm [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Seeds are 2 to 3 times as long as they are wide and are
markedly wrinkled.

Many ecotypes of this species occur.  Varieties are distinguished by the
morphological characteristics of glaucousness, pubescence, or color of
the branches and/or samaras.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Boxelder reproduces both sexually and asexually [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Large seed crops
are produced each year [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Seeds persist through the winter; they are
dispersed by wind or by birds and squirrels [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  Wind will carry
these winged seeds up to 100 yards across a snow surface [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Boxelder establishes by seed under a wide range of conditions:
immediately after disturbance on moist disturbed soil [<a href="#40">40</a>], along
riverbanks [<a href="#51">51</a>], and in areas with heavy cover and medium to heavy
competition [<a href="#28">28</a>].  In southern Illinois, Hosner and Minckler [<a href="#28">28</a>]
reported reproduction of boxelder on areas with light, medium, and heavy
duff:

                      light duff        med duff       heavy duff
                     (over 0.5 in)   (0.5 to 2 in)    (over 2 in)

No. of 1- and              
2-yr-old seedlings        121              90              35

Vegetative reproduction is also common on damaged plants of this
species.  New shoots will appear on exposed or injured roots [<a href="#50">50</a>].
After the extreme drought condition of the 1930's in the Great Plains,
during which nearly all boxelder trees in shelterbelts 30 years or older
died back to the ground, many trees recovered by producing root sprouts,
forming a dense hedge or undergrowth [<a href="#1">1</a>]. In shelterbelts of the
northern Great Plains, boxelder has a dense growing habit resulting from
the plant suckering at the root collar [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Seven years after timber
harvest in a South Carolina bottomland, sprouts from boxelder stumps
greater than 20 inches (51 cm) in diameter were reported to be dying or
losing vigor [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Although this species will produce abundant sprouts
after disturbance, the primary method of reproduction is through seed,
due to the quantity produced each year and the facility of its
distribution.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Boxelder generally grows on moist sites along lakes and streams, on
floodplains, and in low-lying wet places where its shallow root system
can find abundant moisture [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Hardy to extremes of climate [<a href="#41">41</a>],
boxelder is drought tolerant once well established and can also
withstand short periods of flooding [<a href="#46">46</a>].

Soils:  This species is able to tolerate a wide variety of soils but
shows a strong preference for well-drained, aquic soils [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Although
boxelder will grow on soils from gravel to clay, it grows best on deep,
sandy loam, loam, or clay loam soils with a medium to rocky texture and
a pH of 6.5 to 7.5 [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Associates:  Throughout its range, boxelder is most often associated
with various species of cottonwood (Populus spp.) and willow (Salix
spp.).  On the northern Great Plains, boxelder will generally outlive
cottonwood and willow to become an associate in American elm (Ulmus
americana), hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), mulberry (Morus spp.), and
green ash communities [<a href="#2">2</a>].  In the central Great Plains and in the
eastern United States, boxelder occurs with elms (Ulmus spp.), sugar
maple (Acer rubrum), basswood (Tilia spp.), and ashes (Fraxinus spp.),
which eventually replace boxelder in the overstory along with other more
durable and shade-tolerant species [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  At higher elevations on the
Utah plateaus, boxelder occurs in the riparian zone with water birch
(Betula occidentalis), narrowleaf cottonwood (Populus angustifolia),
willows, and blue spruce (Picea pungens) [<a href="#31">31</a>].  In New Mexico and
Arizona, scattered along streambeds in riparian forests at higher
elevations, boxelder is a typical canopy dominant with Arizona alder
(Alnus oblongifolia) and coyote willow (Salix exigua) [<a href="#35">35</a>].

Elevation: The elevational ranges for boxelder in several states 
are as follows [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>]:

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Boxelder occurs in a variety of forest types ranging from early to late
seral, making its successional position difficult to determine.  It is
moderately shade tolerant but does not reproduce in its own shade.  It
usually establishes under pioneering species such as cottonwood and
willow, particularly in the northern Great Plains [<a href="#2">2</a>], and is then
followed by more shade-tolerant, climax species [<a href="#40">40</a>].  In Arizona and
New Mexico, boxelder is a dominant or codominant overstory species in
several high-elevation riparian communties [<a href="#48">48</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Boxelder flowers from March through May with or before the appearance of
the leaves.  The fruit, a winged samara, ripens from September through
October and is dispersed from September through March [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].
Boxelder's leaves turn a dull yellow color in the autumn and drop
throughout the fall and winter [<a href="#40">40</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Acer negundo
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Boxelder grows on moist bottomland sites which are seldom subject to
burning.  This thin-barked species is injured by fire [<a href="#50">50</a>], but how it
regenerates following fire is not known.  Boxelder produces large yearly
crops of wind-dispersed seeds which germinate on a wide variety of
soils; this is most likely boxelder's primary fire survival strategy.
This tree also sprouts from the exposed roots, root crown, or stump
following top-killing mechanical damage [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>], and it is likely
that boxelder would sprout following fire severe enough to girdle or
top-kill the adult tree.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   off-site colonizer species;seed transported by wind;postfire years 1&2
   off-site colonizer species;seed transported by animals;post-fire years 1&2
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex (possible)

<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Boxelder most likely reestablishes following fire via wind-dispersed
seeds [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  It may also sprout from the roots, the root collar, or
stump if girdled or top-killed by fire.
