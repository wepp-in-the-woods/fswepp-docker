The scientific name of soaptree yucca is <i>Yucca elata</i>  (Engelm.) Engelm. (Agavaceae)
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>]. Three varieties of soaptree yucca are
recognized [<a href="#23">23</a>]:<br><br>

<i>Yucca elata</i> var. <i> elata&nbsp; </i>soaptree yucca<br>
<i>Yucca elata</i> var. <i>utahensis</i> (McKelvey) Reveal&nbsp;&nbsp; Utah yucca<br>
<i>Yucca elata</i> var. <i> verdiensis</i> (McKelvey) Reveal&nbsp; Verdi yucca

<p>
Most literature regarding the soaptree yucca does not specify which subspecies is studied.
However, most research has focused on populations of New Mexico, Arizona, and
the Chihuahuan Desert of Texas and adjacent Mexico; these populations are either
 the typical variety (<i>Y. e. </i> var.<i> elata)</i> or Verdi yucca.</p>

<p>In southwestern Utah and southeastern Nevada, Utah yucca &#215
narrow-leaved yucca (<i>Y. angustissima</i>) hybrids are common [<a href="#48">48</a>]. Soaptree yucca &#215 soapweed yucca (<i>Y. glauca</i>)
hybrids have been reported in
northern Arizona and New Mexico [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>]. Soaptree yucca reportedly hybridizes with Buckley yucca (<i>Y.
constricta</i>) in Pecos and Howard Counties, Texas,
and in southeastern New Mexico [<a href="#48">48</a>].</p>

Soaptree yucca is present in many desert scrub
communities and is also an important component of semi-desert grasslands. In the
San Simon Valley of southeastern Arizona, soaptree yucca, Mariola (<i>Parthenium incanum</i>),
and cacti (<i>Opuntia spp.</i>) were subdominant in communities where
creosotebush (<i>Larrea tridentata</i>), tarbush (<i>Flourensia cernua</i>),
mesquite (<i>Prosopis spp</i>.), or acacia (<i>Acacia spp</i>.) were dominant
[<a href="#10">10</a>]. Similar shrub communities were described in the Huachuca Mountains of the
southern border of Arizona below 4,500 feet (1,370 m). Grass species present here were
black grama (<i>Bouteloua eriopoda</i>), crowfoot grama (<i>B. rothrockii</i>), burrograss (<i>Sclerpogon
brevifolius</i>), fluffgrass (<i>Tridens pulchellus</i>), bush muhly (<i>Muhlenbergia porteri</i>),
and threeawns (<i>Aristida spp.</i>). Desertholly (<i>Perezia nana</i>) and burrowweed (<i>Isocoma
tenuisecta</i>) were present in disturbed areas [<a href="#45">45</a>]. Soaptree yucca is also subdominant
on the Jornada Experimental Range near Las Cruces, New Mexico, and similar communities
occur there [<a href="#3">3</a>].<p>Soaptree yucca occurs in an irregular,
clumped distribution in grasslands dominated by
gramas (<i>Bouteloua </i>spp.), threeawns, tobosagrass (<i>Pleuraphis mutica</i>), and dropseeds
(<i>Sporobolus </i>spp.) [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>]. On the Jornada Experimental Range, soaptree yucca
is described as a &quot;structural dominant:&quot; 1 of few shrubs growing in
black grama grasslands [<a href="#25">25</a>].
</p>

<p>Soaptree yucca, creosotebush, and fourwing saltbush (<i>Atriplex</i> <i>canescens</i>) are the predominant shrubs in the large area of dune fields
known as the
Mesilla Basin, New Mexico and adjacent Chihuahua, Mexico [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Livestock use soaptree yucca leaves as a secondary or seasonal source of feed. A
number of wildlife species also use the species as browse, but
quantitative data are lacking. The following table summarizes soaptree
yucca use by birds and mammals [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].<br><br>

Livestock browse soaptree yucca leaves during winter and spring months when
young regrowth is available and grasses are least productive [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>]. Soaptree yucca is palatable to cattle [<a href="#25">25</a>].
Cattle on the
Jornada Experimental Range consumed soaptree yucca leaves in March (14% of diet) and December (17%) [<a href="#16">16</a>]. Similarly, in
southern New Mexico soaptree yucca leaves comprise up to 20% of
cattle diets in winter and spring [<a href="#18">18</a>]. Campbell and Keller [<a href="#8">8</a>]
commented that livestock use soaptree
yucca infrequently on &quot;conservatively grazed range, supporting the black grama climax.&quot;
On
the New Mexico State University College Ranch, cattle browsed soaptree yucca
more heavily than any other shrub present. Grasses, primarily gramas and dropseeds, were 86% of the winter diet, soaptree yucca was approximately
9% of the diet, and other shrubs were 2% [<a href="#50">50</a>]. 

<p>Soaptree yucca inflorescences are consumed heavily by livestock
[<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>] and wildlife including mule deer, pronghorn, black-tailed jackrabbit, and several types of
woodrats. In cattle exclosures on the New Mexico State University
College Ranch, woodrats consumed a mean of 15% (n= 10, range = 0-42%) of
soaptree yucca floral production. Up to 98% of
inflorescences were consumed on similar sites with cattle (density = 50 cows/ha) [<a href="#25">25</a>].</p>

Soaptree yucca foliage, particularly actively growing apices, is low in acid-detergent lignin [<a href="#25">25</a>].
The consumption
of the nutritious apex is limited by larger fibrous leaves with pointed tips below
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>]. The nutritional value of
soaptree yucca leaves, collected on the New Mexico State University College Ranch

Soaptree yucca provides cover for small mammals and birds. The
white-throated woodrat frequently nests at the base of stems; when these dens
are abandoned by woodrats they are often used by desert cottontails [<a href="#8">8</a>]. 
Soaptree yucca is the only perch for birds in much of its range [<a href="#25">25</a>].

<br />

Because soaptree yucca is 1 of few long-lived woody plants on many sites, it is of
value for long-term soil quality. Its litter increases soil organic matter and
helps retain soil water [<a href="#8">8</a>]. Soaptree yucca helps stabilize sand in dune
areas [<a href="#29">29</a>]. The stems often produce adventitious roots that increase sand stability
[<a href="#48">48</a>].

<p>
Soaptree yucca is difficult to transplant. Campbell and Keller [<a href="#8">8</a>] reported that only 25%
of soaptree yucca transplants survived due to taproot breakage. Soaptree yucca
has been transplanted to revegetate highway rights-of way, but there was great
expense in removing entire roots, as is required for successful planting. Successful transplanting of yuccas (an unspecified amount of which
were soaptree yucca) has been done; plants were removed with as little root
damage as possible and immediately watered when replanted [<a href="#48">48</a>].</p>

 Native
Americans traditionally consumed young flowerstalks and the lowest part of the stem
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>], and ground interior portions of the trunk into flour [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].
Historically, they also used yucca fibers (including that of soaptree yucca) for
clothing and rope. Yucca fibers were economically important during World War I,
when New Mexico and
Texas
&quot;produced 80 million pounds of bagging and burlap&quot; [<a href="#27">27</a>]. Crushed
soaptree yucca roots and stems
can be used to make soap or shampoo [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>]. Whole plants can be ground to pulp, much as
trees are prepared for paper pulp,
to provide a valuable emergency livestock feed [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>]. Complete population
recovery following extensive soaptree yucca harvest has not been
observed [<a href="#48">48</a>].

<a name="OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Soaptree yucca is relatively resistant to browsing pressure in the short term because of frequent
clonal reproduction. Because of this reproductive strategy, an early
source stated that leaving seed trees is unnecessary except to provide shade [<a href="#8">8</a>].
However, a more recent study cited several reasons for reducing
browsing pressure on soaptree yucca inflorescences. The authors stated that
overconsumption of inflorescences may: 1) lead to local declines in the
flight-limited yucca moth, reducing pollination in subsequent years, 2) reduce
mobilization of nutrients and carbohydrates from aborted fruit to other parts of
the plant, leading to decreased ability
to produce new caudices, 3) reduce recruitment of seedlings that maintain
genetic diversity in populations and provide a means of colonizing new habitats,
and 4) reduce local biodiversity, especially birds and insects because of loss
of species that depend on the inflorescence and fruit [<a href="#25">25</a>]. The study concluded that in
soaptree yucca populations where some members are tall enough (<u>&gt;</u>1.7
m) to escape fruit consumption by livestock, tall individuals are
important refugia for yucca moths and help maintain genetic diversity. In populations where no individuals are tall enough to escape
browsing, management should reduce grazing in spring to avoid complete
consumption of inflorescences [<a href="#25">25</a>].

<p class="subframeContent">
Grazing may favor soaptree yucca if more palatable forage is available. Some sources have cited
grazing as a cause of increase in soaptree yucca cover, but the data are not
conclusive. Two studies were conducted on the New Mexico State University
College Ranch; 1 found shrub cover in general was consistently higher in grazed
areas compared to ungrazed areas, but cover of soaptree yucca was significantly higher (p
&lt;0.05) in grazed areas only on
some sample locations and times [<a href="#19">19</a>]. In the 2nd study, there was a trend for
soaptree yucca to have more cover on good condition than excellent condition range, but the
trend was not statistically significant [<a href="#40">40</a>].

<p>Desert grasslands have declined due to cultivation, urbanization,
and shrub invasion [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. Causes of shrub increase include fire suppression and grazing.
Desert grasslands are important for biodiversity, as
many avifauna use both soaptree yucca-black grama communities in the Chihuahua Desert and shortgrass prairies elsewhere [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>]. Raitt and
Pimm [<a href="#36">36</a>] conclude that &quot;lowland grasslands in the Chihuahua Desert
region... are relevant beyond immediate, local considerations, however
important. The future of a number of continental bird populations may
depend upon their success.&quot; Fire and grazing
management strategies are used by managers to maintain or restore desert grasslands that have
become shrub-dominated [<a href="#20">20</a>]. </p>

Soaptree yucca has woody, succulent stems often 9-12 feet (3-4 m) high
(occasionally up to 30 feet (9 m) [<a href="#24">24</a>]. Utah yucca is smaller, with stems up to approximately 4.5
feet (1.3 m) [<a href="#49">49</a>]. Growth form of soaptree yucca varies from a
single, erect, trunklike stem to several stems in clumps of 1.6 to 8.2 feet
(0.5-2.5 m) in diameter [<a href="#48">48</a>]. Like all yucca species with dehiscent fruits,
soaptree yucca is rhizomatous. The species is unique in that the rhizome
develops downward and later begins lateral root extensions. The
&quot;vertical rhizome&quot; as described by Webber [<a href="#48">48</a>] commonly grows to 3-5
feet (1-1.5 m) deep, and 3-6 inches (8-15 cm) in diameter. Lateral roots
are 6-10 inches (15-20 cm) long and 1-3 inches (2.5-8 cm) in diameter
[<a href="#48">48</a>]. Leaves are slender, sharply pointed, 2-3 feet
(0.6-1 m) in length, and grow in variably loose to densely crowded clumps [<a href="#8">8</a>]. Stems are often clumped
because they are derived from common rhizome systems [<a href="#48">48</a>]. Leaves grow in a tuft at the top of the
stem [<a href="#24">24</a>]. The stem can be either upright or procumbent [<a href="#25">25</a>]. The inflorescence is an open, branching panicle [<a href="#8">8</a>],
producing a capsular, fleshy, and dehiscent fruit. The fruit commonly
contains about 150 viable ovoid seeds [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Soaptree yucca produces from seed and by sprouting. Soaptree yucca has an obligate mutualistic relation to its pollinator the
yucca moth (<i>Tegeticula yuccsella</i>) [<a href="#21">21</a>]. The yucca moth pollinates its flowers
and moth larvae feed on the developing fruit, decreasing viable
seed production by up to 20% [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>]. Soaptree yucca aborts
many fruits, killing larvae therein; this process is thought to help maintain
the mutualistic relationship [<a href="#22">22</a>]. Fruits produce many small, windblown seeds [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>]. Little information
is published regarding seed longevity and seed banking. 

</p>

<p>
In most cases,
reproduction is
primarily clonal [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>]. Sprouts originate from meristems on rhizomes
and the root
crown. Soaptree yucca may also resume growth from unburned portions of the stem
[<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>]. Seedling establishment
is not thought to be a
reliable means of regeneration for soaptree yucca, primarily because
germination and seedling establishment are controlled by a number of factors including, most importantly,
adequate soil moisture and facilitation by other shrubs [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].</p> 

<p class="subframeContent">
<span class="subframeName">

<br />

Soaptree yucca grows on a wide range of sites but prefers coarse soils
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>]. In the Guadalupe Mountains of New Mexico, soaptree yucca is most prevalent on
gypsum dunes, but also present on sandhills derived from quartz [<a href="#9">9</a>]. In
the Davis Mountains of Texas and Coahuila, Mexico, soaptree yucca is common on
gentle to moderate slopes with coarse soils derived from igneous materials
[<a href="#17">17</a>]. In
the Chisos Mountains of the Rio Grande area of Texas, soaptree yucca &quot;reached best development&quot; on eroded rocky slopes [<a href="#30">30</a>].

<p>The climate of the Jornada Experimental Range is
typical of the semidesert grassland communities where soaptree yucca is
prevalent. At
this site there is an average of 8.33 inches (215 mm) precipitation per year, with 64%
occurring in May through September. Mean annual temperature is 59 degrees
Fahrenheit (15 <sup>o</sup>C) [<a href="#6">6</a>].
</p>

<p>In southwestern Texas and central and southern Arizona
soaptree yucca grows between 1,500 and 6,000 feet (450- 1,220 m) in elevation,
Verdi yucca<i> </i>grows in central Arizona between 3,000 and 6,000 feet
(910-1,220
m) in elevation [<a href="#24">24</a>].</p>

Soaptree yucca occurs in both early and later succession. Early descriptions of honey mesquite (<i>Prosopis
glandulosa</i>) dunes list soaptree yucca as
a secondary colonizer [<a href="#7">7</a>]. Honey mesquite was dominant
on unprotected areas with frequent wind erosion or sand aggradation, while
soaptree yucca established after several years of favorable conditions on sites where
topography or honey mesquite had stabilized soils [<a href="#7">7</a>]. A more recent source
cites soaptree yucca as a major component of dune vegetation in the Mesilla
Basin of New Mexico. The author reported that mounds of sand formed
around soaptree yucca, implying that it did not require other shrubs to
stabilize sand and advance succession [<a href="#29">29</a>].

In Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas soaptree yucca flowers between May 15 and July
15; fruit ripens between August 1 and October 1; and seed is dispersed in
September and October [<a href="#2">2</a>]. On the Jornada Experimental Range soaptree yucca initiated new leaf growth in May and June and continued producing
new leaves
throughout the summer [<a href="#8">8</a>]. Leaf elongation occurred until early fall. The period of
most rapid growth was at the end of July, when average length of new
leaves doubled in 1 week [<a href="#8">8</a>]. During their 1st year leaves
grow parallel to the stem. In subsequent years they are oriented outward,
providing some protection for the apical meristem [<a href="#8">8</a>]. Leaves remain
green for 3-5 years. Dry leaves remain on the stem [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Fire generally top-kills soaptree yucca, but it can be fire tolerant depending on the intensity and frequency of fire
[<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>]. Two studies, both low-severity spring fires, one in the Sierrita Mountains near Tucson,
Arizona,
and one in the Whetstone Mountains of southeastern Arizona, found 25% and 27% mortality of
soaptree yucca after several months,
respectively [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>]. In both cases, damage to the apical meristem was a frequent cause of mortality. Leaves remaining on the stem,
whether dead or living, insulate conductive tissue and reduce fire damage to the
stem and vascular tissue [<a href="#42">42</a>]. Meristem protection also increases fire tolerance of soaptree
yucca:
apical meristems are protected by the dense terminal rosette and belowground
meristems along rhizomes are protected by soil [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].

Soaptree yucca sprouts from rhizomes, the root crown, and undamaged stems after
fire [<a href="#43">43</a>]. Frequent production of belowground sprouts makes soaptree yucca unique among leaf
succulents [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>]. In the Whetstone Mountains of Arizona, 51% of
soaptree yucca survived fire only by producing sprouts from belowground meristems
[<a href="#43">43</a>], 33% of surviving soaptree yucca regrew from the apical meristem [<a href="#43">43</a>], 7%
regenerated from the apical meristem and produced belowground sprouts, and 2%
grew from seed. Few (7%) soaptree yucca were unburned, showing that the species is a fire
tolerator rather than evader [<a href="#43">43</a>]. The authors
concluded that in most cases, regeneration of soaptree yucca occurs via
vegetative reproduction rather than from seed trees surviving on unburned patches [<a href="#43">43</a>]. Seedling establishment following fire is not thought to be a
reliable means of recovery for soaptree yucca in most years, but it may be
important during wet years following fire [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>]. The estimated time for yucca
species to recover to prefire density is 2-5 years [<a href="#42">42</a>].

It is reasonable to expect 25% mortality of soaptree yucca following fire
[<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>]. This
may be problematic where fire frequently occurs [<a href="#43">43</a>]: young regrowth would likely be less
fire tolerant because a
larger proportion of stems would be shorter and exposed to lethal
temperatures. Though
long-term studies of different fire regimes' effects on soaptree yucca populations
have not been conducted, it has been suggested that soaptree yucca would
survive in the historic 3-10 year fire return interval of semidesert grasslands;
however, in many areas its density
would be lower than at present [<a href="#43">43</a>]. 


<p>Managers often seek to eliminate undesirable shrubs
by burning in high fuel years (after wet growing seasons or 1-2 years without grazing) to
achieve maximum crown burning. This practice may result in high mortality of succulents including soaptree yucca.
Damage to succulents is reduced by low-severity fires that kill shrub seedlings
and scorch some crowns Although reduction of shrub canopy cover and seed production
is not as great as that achieved with crown fires, greater coverage of soaptree
yucca and other succulents is retained [<a href="#38">38</a>].</p>
