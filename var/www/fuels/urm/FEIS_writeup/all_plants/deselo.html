<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Slender hairgrass occurs in a wide variety of habitats including maple
(Acer spp.), aspen (Populus spp.), fir-spruce (Abies-Picea spp.),
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and lodgepole pine (P. contorta).  It
also occurs in alpine, subalpine forest, riparian forest, meadow, and
coastal prairie communities [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

Slender hairgrass is an indicator species in lodgepole pine and
Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests of western Oregon [<a href="#12">12</a>].  

Slender hairgrass occurs in many wetland and riparian habitats.  In
Nevada, slender hairgrass is a component of the willow (Salix spp.)-forb
community type of the subalpine zone.  In northeastern California,
slender hairgrass occurs in the quaking aspen/skunkcabbage (Populus
tremuloides/Veratrum californicum) habitat type [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Slender hairgrass
occurs in the montane black cottonwood (P. trichocarpa) riparian forest
of California.  This is a dense, mixed riparian forest dominated by
black cottonwood with emergent Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) towering up
to 150 feet (45 m) [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Slender hairgrass occurs in moist forests.  It is a member of the
lodgepole pine/California oatgrass (Danthonia californica) community on
moist sites in Washington and Oregon [<a href="#5">5</a>].  In the Cascade Ranges of
southern Oregon, slender hairgrass occurs in the western hemlock/Pacific
rhododendron-twinflower (Tsuga heterophylla/Rhododendron
macrophyllum-Linnaea borealis var. longiflora) association [<a href="#1">1</a>].  In
eastern Washingtion and northern Idaho, slender hairgrass occurs in
western redcedar (Thuja plicata) forests [<a href="#3">3</a>].  In larch-fir (Larix-Abies
spp.) forests of Montana, slender hairgrass occurs in two phases:  the
subalpine fir/queencup beadlily-rusty menziesia (A.
lasiocarpa/Clintonia uniflora-Menziesia ferruginea) phase and the
subalpine fir/queencup beadlily-beargrass (A. lasiocarpa/C.
uniflora-Xerophyllum tenax) phase [<a href="#32">32</a>].

Slender hairgrass also occurs in moderate to dry habitats.  In eastern
Washington and northern Idaho, slender hairgrass is a common understory
species in subalpine fir, grand fir (A. grandis), Douglas-fir, and
ponderosa pine forests [<a href="#3">3</a>].  In the Santa Lucia and Diablo ranges of
southern California, slender hairgrass can be found in the understory of
sugar pine (P. lambertiana), bristlecone fir (Abies bracteata), and
mixed oak-Coulter pine (Quercus spp.-Pinus coulteri) communities [<a href="#10">10</a>].
In the Sierra Nevada, slender hairgrass occurs in Jeffrey pine forests
[<a href="#31">31</a>].  Slender hairgrass has been a member of the fescue-oatgrass
(Festuca-Danthonia spp.) coastal prairie community along the coast of
California [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Slender hairgrass is a component of the subalpine forb
community in the Bridger-Teton National Forest of Wyoming [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Species not previously mentioned but commonly associated with slender
hairgrass include incense-cedar (Libocedrus decurrens), Rocky Mountain
maple (Acer glabrum), Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia), erect willow
(Salix rigida), western chokecherry (Prunus virginiana var. demissa),
Oregon boxwood (Pachistima myrsinites), devil's club (Oplopanax
horridus), ninebark (Physocarpus malvaceus), oceanspray (Holodiscus
discolor), Wood's rose (Rosa woodsii), starry Solomon-seal (Smilacina
stellata), longstalk clover (Trifolium longpipes), salal (Gaultheria
shallon), Oregon-grape (Berberis nervosa), larkspur (Delphinium
nutallianum), western yarrow (Achillea millefolium), sweetscented
bedstraw (Galium triflorum), tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia cespitosa),
red fescue (Festuca rubra), western needlegrass (Stipa occidentalis),
blue wildrye (Elymus glaucus), prairie junegrass (Koeleria macrantha),
Columbia brome (Bromus vulgaris), Merten's rush (Juncus mertensianus),
and sedge (Carex spp.) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Deschampsia elongata

<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Slender hairgrass is a native, perennial bunchgrass.  Culms are slender,
erect, ensely tufted, and usually 12 to 48 inches (30-120 cm) tall
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  The leaves have flat or folded blades from 0.04 to 0.06
inch (1-1.5 mm) wide [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  The panicle is narrow and from 4 to 12
inches (10-30 cm) tall [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>

<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Slender hairgrass reproduces from seed and tillers.  
  


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Slender hairgrass occurs in a wide variety of habitats including forest
openings, woodlands, grasslands, meadows, marshes, valley floodplains,
and stream and lake margins [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  It is most commonly found
in moist soil in open to shaded habitats [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  In Oregon,
slender hairgrass occurs from sea level to alpine zones [<a href="#16">16</a>].
Elevational ranges of slender hairgrass in several states are as follows
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>]:

Utah                    6,040-10,360             1,830-3,140

Slender hairgrass grows best on fine-textured sandy or gravelly soils
derived from glacial, volcanic, and sedimentary parent materials
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  
  


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Slender hairgrass is a facultative wetland species [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].
According to Hickman [<a href="#14">14</a>], it survives best in full or partial shade.
However, in Montana, slender hairgrass is more prominent in areas that
have been opened and disturbed by logging than in areas with undisturbed
vegetation [<a href="#6">6</a>].  In southwestern Oregon, slender hairgrass is an
indicator species in Douglas-fir forests that have been recently
harvested [<a href="#8">8</a>].  In the foothills of the western Cascades, Oregon,
slender hairgrass establishes in the early stages of secondary plant
succession after clearcutting [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Slender hairgrass flowers from May to August in California [<a href="#25">25</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Deschampsia elongata

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Perennial grasses are generally top-killed by fire so slender hairgrass
is probably top-killed by fire.  Its densely tufted growth form may
protect regenerative tissues from fires that are not severe.  Specific
fire effects, however, are not described in the literature.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Studies of larch-Douglas-fir forest succession were conducted at Miller
Creek on the Flathead National Forest in Montana.  Eight study areas
were clearcut and then slashed to provide a uniform fuel bed.  Most
units were broadcast burned within 1 year after timber harvest.  Slender
hairgrass was a component of two units:  N-7 and S-1.  The N-7 unit was
logged in January of 1967, slashed in February of 1967, and
broadcast-burned June 18, 1968.  Postfire duff depth was 1.8 inches (4.5
cm), 51 percent of prefire depth.  The S-1 unit was logged in June 1967,
slashed in June 1967, and broadcast burned May 18, 1968.  Postfire duff
depth was 1.7 inches (4.3 cm), 84 percent of prefire depth.  Slender
hairgrass was not in the prefire community and was reported in only 2 of
the 9 postfire years.  Cover and volume development of slender hairgrass
were as follows [<a href="#32">32</a>]:
