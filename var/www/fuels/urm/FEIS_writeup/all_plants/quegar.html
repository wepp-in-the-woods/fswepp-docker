<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of Oregon white oak is Quercus
garryana Dougl. ex Hook. [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Recognized varieties are as follows:

     Quercus garryana var. garryana
     Quercus garryana var. breweri (Engelm.) Jeps. (Brewer oak) [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>]
     Quercus garryana var. semota Jeps. [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>]

Varieties breweri and semota are scrub forms of Oregon white oak.  The
variety semota is not recognized by some authorities, who claim there
are no distinguishing morphological differences between it and the
variety breweri [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  The main focus of this paper will be upon
Quercus garryana variety garryana.  Brewer oak will be discussed where
relevant information is available.  Following the classification scheme
of Tucker [<a href="#51">51</a>], the varieties breweri and semota will be treated as
synonyms for Brewer oak.

Oregon white oak hybridizes with the following species:

     x Q. dumosa (California scrub oak):  Q. X howellii Tucker [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>]
     x Q. durata (leather oak):  Q. X subconvexa Tucker [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>]
     x Q. douglasii (blue oak):  Q. X eplingii C. H. Muller [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>]
     x Q. lobata (valley oak) [<a href="#51">51</a>]

Brewer oak hybridizes with Q. sadleriana (Sadler oak) [<a href="#51">51</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Oregon white oak occurs in open savannas or in monospecific closed-canopy
stands.  It is also found in mixed stands with conifers or other
broad-leaved trees [<a href="#13">13</a>].  The following classifications list Oregon
white oak as a dominant species:

     Preliminary plant associations of the southern Oregon Cascade
        Mountain Province [<a href="#5">5</a>]
     Association types in the North Coast Ranges of California [<a href="#15">15</a>]
     Oak woodland [<a href="#24">24</a>]
     Foothill oak woodlands of the interior valleys of southwestern
       Oregon [<a href="#42">42</a>]

<pre><center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus garryana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Oregon white oak has no current use except as fuelwood.  It is highly
prized for this purpose.  The heat output of Oregon white oak is rated
as high; it produces few sparks and has moderate ease of splitting [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Oregon white oak woodlands are important for livestock and wildlife.
The oaks are a critical food and nesting source for acorn woodpeckers
living in the Oregon white oak cover type [<a href="#12">12</a>].  This cover type
provides excellent hunting opportuniy for raptors [<a href="#5">5</a>].  The acorns are
eaten by black-tailed deer, pig, black bear, and various rodents, small
nongame birds, and gamebirds [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Gamebirds consuming the acorns
include wood duck, Merriam's wild turkey, pigeon, dove, and valley and
mountain quail [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Acorns are also consumed by sheep and cattle
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Oregon white oak is browsed by black-tailed deer and all
classes of livestock [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>]. Sprouts are preferred over other growth
[<a href="#44">44</a>].

Brewer oak is heavily to moderately browsed by black-tailed deer.  It is
the primary summer diet item of deer in Glenn County, California [<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
New shoots are highly palatable to deer and all classes of livestock.
The palatablity of mature Oregon white oak browse in California has been
given the following rating [<a href="#44">44</a>]:

     deer:    good to fair
     cattle:  poor to useless
     sheep:   poor to useless
     goats:   poor to useless
     horses:  useless


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Protein levels of Oregon white oak leaves in California vary from 5.2
percent in November to 11.6 percent in October [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Oregon white oak is the preferred forage and nesting cover of the
black-capped chickadee, white-breasted nuthatch, Bewick's wren, bushtit,
and orange-crowned, MacGillivray's, and Wilson's warblers [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Oregon
white oak and Oregon white oak-ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)
associations are preferred brood habitats for the Merriam's wild turkey
in south-central Washington [<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Oregon white oak is useful for watershed and wildlife habitat
restoration.  Its deep, extensive root system helps stabilize steep
slopes in watershed areas [<a href="#13">13</a>].  It has been used in western Washington
for restoration of degraded grassland habitat [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Trees are generally
established from fall acorn plantings.  Collection and cultivation
methods have been detailed [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].

Brewer oak often produces large masts, but acorns are difficult to
collect due to the dense, brushy stands formed by this variety [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Oregon white oak is a highly valued ornamental [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Native Americans used Oregon white oak acorns for making acorn meal
[<a href="#13">13</a>]. 


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Oregon white oak is in decline throughout its range [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  This
species is regenerating poorly, and many Oregon white oak woodlands are
being invaded by conifers [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  In the Willamette Valley,
Oregon, where Oregon white oak has historically shown its best growth,
the total cover provided by this tree has been reduced from 50 percent
in 1850 to 24 percent in 1955 [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Saplings there are stunted and
under insect attack [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Unless steps are taken to reduce present
trends, Oregon white oak will continue to become a less prominent member
of the western flora.  Increasing Oregon white oak populations
necessitates removal of competing conifers by burning (see Fire
Management Considerations) or other methods.  Invading conifers in the
bald hills of Redwood National Park, California, were cut or girdled in
order to reclaim Oregon white oak woodland [<a href="#41">41</a>].

Damaging agents:  The white pocket root and butt rot (Polyporus
dryophilus) and the shoestring root rot (Armillaria mellea) are the most
damaging fungi infecting Oregon white oak.  With the exception of
acorn-feeding insects, insect damage is usually not severe in this
species.  The larvae of the filbert worm (Melissopus latiferreanus) and
the filbert weevil (Curculio occidentalis) sometimes destroy a
considerable portion of a year's mast before acorns ripen.  Oregon white
oak is frequently infested with mistletoe (Phoradendron flavescens)
[<a href="#13">13</a>].

Timber production:  Conifer seedlings planted under or near Oregon white
oak often show poor establishment; the mychorrhizal fungi associated
with Oregon white oak are believed to be incompatible with conifers [<a href="#1">1</a>].
Conifer seedlings established in Oregon oak woodlands through natural
regeneration usually flourish, however, possibly because the
coniferassociated mychorrhizal fungi invade the woodlands simultaneuosly
with their conifer hosts.

Softwood logging in the Willamette Valley has favored Douglas-fir
seedling recruitment over seedlings of Oregon white oak [<a href="#16">16</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus garryana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Oregon white oak is a drought-resistant, flood-tolerant, native,
monoecious, deciduous tree ranging from 25 to 90 feet (7.6-27 m) high,
and 24 to 40 inches (60-100 cm) in d.b.h.  Acorns are from 0.8 to 1.0
inch (0.6-2.5 cm) long.  Typically, the trunk supports stout, spreading
branches and a rounded crown.  The bark is thin and scaly. The root
system consists of a deep taproot and a well-developed lateral system,
making trees windfirm even in wet areas.  Oregon white oaks may live to
500 years of age [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].

Brewer oak grows from 3 to 16 feet (1-5 m) in height [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Oregon white oak is wind pollinated.  Acorns develop in 1 year.
Masts may be heavy but are irregular.  The age of sexual maturity, the
age of maximum production, and the average number of acorns produced
have not been reported.  Acorns are disseminated by gravity or animals.
Migrating band-tailed pigeons may disseminate acorns over great
distances [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Acorn predation is high; often the entire mast is
consumed [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Some acorns are buried by seed-caching scrub jays,
magpies, and various rodents.  The viability of fresh acorns has been
tested at 75 percent [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Fresh acorns germinate immediately under
warm, moist conditions.  Germination is hypogeal, with initial growth
concentrated on development of a taproot.  Shoot development is
relatively slow; seedlings take 10 years or more to attain 3.3 feet (1
m) in height [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  Seedling survival is low in sod or heavy duff
[<a href="#4">4</a>].  It is speculated that exotic annual grasses outcompete Oregon oak
seedlings for water and light, but experimental results to date are
inconclusive [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Many seedlings are killed by browsing livestock,
deer, or rodents.  Pocket gopher frequently destroy young roots [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Vegetative:  Oregon white oak sprouts from the trunk and root crown
following cutting or burning.  Some sprouts that arise after burning
resemble rhizomes in appearance and growth habit. They originate from
the root crown and extend several meters before emerging from the humus
[<a href="#41">41</a>].  Sprouts grow rapidly; 3-year-old sprouts in Humbolt and Trinity
Counties, California, averaged 9.2 feet (2.8 m) in height [<a href="#36">36</a>].  The
sprouting ability of Oregon white oak declines with age.  Mature oaks
may be weak sprouters or fail to sprout altogether [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Soils and topography:  Oregon white oak can grow on a wide variety of
sites but is usually outcompeted on better sites.  It typically occurs
on poor, exposed or droughty locations such as inland valleys and
foothills or rocky ridges.  It also occurs on poorly drained areas with
a shallow water table or with standing water for part of the year.  Soil
texture is characteristically clay, but the oak grows in gravelly or
sandy loam as well.  Soil pH ranges from 4.8 to 5.9.  Slopes may be
steep but are typically gentle (less than 30 percent) [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Elevation:  Oregon white oak grows from sea level to 5,000 feet (1,524
m) in elevation [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].

Brewer oak grows from 3,000 to 7,500 feet (914-2,286 m) in elevation
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].

Climate:  Oregon white oak grows in diverse climates, ranging from the
cool, humid conditions near the coast to the hot, dry environment of
inland valleys and foothill woodlands.  The species can endure
temperature extremes from -30 to 166 degrees Fahrenheit (-34 to 47 deg
C).  Average annual precipitation ranges from 103.5 inches (262 cm) at
Cougar, Washington to 10.6 inches (30 cm) in the Tehachapi Mountains of
California [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Plant associates:  Overstory associates not listed under DISTRIBUTION
AND OCCURRENCE include grand fir (Abies grandis), Pacific yew (Taxus
brevifolia), incense-cedar (Libocedrus decurrens), western redcedar
(Thuja plicata), California bay (Umbellularia californica), bigleaf
maple (Acer macrophyllum), river birch (Betula occidentalis), and tanoak
(Lithocarpus densiflorus) [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].

Shrub associates include over 50 species.  Some of these are manzanita
(Arctostaphylos spp.), buckbrush (Ceanothus cuneatus), English ivy
(Hedera helix), poison-oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), thimbleberry
(Rubus parviflorus), California huckleberry (Vaccinium ovatum), and tall
Oregon-grape (Mahonia aquifolium) [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Ground cover associates are numerous.  They include bluebunch wheatgrass
(Pseudoroegneria spicata), springgold (Crocidium multicaule), California
toothwort (Dentaria californica), blue wildrye (Elymus glaucus),
threadleaf phacelia (Phacelia linearis), and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa
pratensis) [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Oregon white oak is somewhat shade tolerant.  It can reproduce
adequately under its own shade but is intolerant of overtopping by
conifers [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Oregon white oakwoods are fire climax and are seral to
Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), grand fir, or redwood (Sequoia
sempervirens) forests in the absence of fire [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  On xeric
sites unfavorable to conifers, Oregon white oak is considered a climax
species [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
The following seasonal development was reported for Oregon white oak in
the Willamette Valley, Oregon [<a href="#13">13</a>]:

     catkins emerge:    March - June
     leaves emerge:     March - June
     stems lengthen:    March - June
     acorns ripen:      August - November
     acorns dispersed:  September - November

<pre><center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus garryana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fire ecology:  Historically, Oregon white oak was subjected to a fire
regime of low-severity surface fires occurring every few years.  A study
in the Oregon white oak woodlands of Humbolt Redwoods State Park,
California, revealed a history of fire every 7.5 to 13.3 years during
the presettlement era [<a href="#47">47</a>].  Frequent fire resulted in the open savannas
typical of presettlement times in the Willamette Valley, Oregon, and the
bald hills of California [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Dead woody fuels were scant, but flashy
fuels (grasses) were abundant and dry early in summer.  The fire spread
rate was moderated by the gentle topography typical of this cover type.
Fire seldom spread into adjacent coniferous forests [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Plant adaptations:  Oregon white oak has adapted to low- to
moderate-severity fire by sprouting from the bole, root crown, and roots
[<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  Sprouts of this species grow far more rapidly than do
seedlings.  Young trees not subjected to periodic top-kill by fire
followed by sprouting often do not attain sexual maturity before they
succumb to herbivory [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Initial establishment of seedlings is
somewhat dependent on fire also.  Although this species does not require
a bare mineral seedbed, seedling recruitment is greatly enhanced when
the litter layer has been removed by fire [<a href="#4">4</a>].

</pre>

<pre><center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus garryana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Crown fire generally kills this species.  Moderate-severity surface fire
rarely kills large trees, but smaller oaks may be killed or suffer
severe cambium damage [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Low-severity surface fire rarely harms
mature trees, but seedlings and saplings are commonly top-killed.
Animal-buried acorns are usually not affected by fire [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Most researchers report vigorous sprouting of top-killed Oregon white
oak [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>], although at least one researcher [<a href="#25">25</a>] has
classified this species as a weak sprouter.  Sugihara and Reed [<a href="#48">48</a>]
report more vigorous sprouting in 40-year-old than in 70-year-old oaks.
Studies conducted on young, even-aged stands show good postfire recovery
of these trees.  Oregon white oak top-killed by fall prescribed burning
in Shasta and Tehema Counties, California, exhibited vigorous sprouting
during the first postfire growing season [<a href="#53">53</a>].  In Humbolt and Trinity
Counties, California, three-year-old sprouts had grown above the browse
line [<a href="#36">36</a>].

In the absence of further fire, these sprout clumps form dense,
even-aged stands.  Most Oregon white oak woodlands of today are of this
type due to fire supression.  When subjected to further fire, however,
weaker meristematic tissue is killed, and individual root crowns produce
fewer sprouts per clump with each fire.  Continued periodic fire
ultimately results in an open savanna with widely scattered, large oaks
[<a href="#27">27</a>].

Fire research on Brewer oak is extremely limited.  One study followed
the postfire recovery of this variety for 3 years after the Three Creeks
Burn in Humbolt County, California.  This "intense" wildfire top-killed
most oak shrubs.  At the end of postfire year 1, sprouts varied in
height from 4.4 to 11.2 feet (1.3-3.4 m), with an average of 18 sprouts
per clump.  At postfire year 3, many of the weaker sprouts had died, and
sprouts were reduced to an average of 10 sprouts per clump.  Sprout
height at postfire year 3 was not recorded [<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fire appears to be the dominant controlling factor involved in
converting invading coniferous forests back to Oregon white oak
woodland.  If a conifer forest is the objective, managers can simply
allow young invading conifers to grow.  In order to halt conifer
establishment and facilitate oak regeneration, a minimum frequency of
prescribed burning every 5 years is recommended.  Ideally, prescribed
fire should be set annually.  When existing conifers are 10 feet (3 m)
or more in height, oak woodlands can be restored by removing conifers by
cutting or girdling.  A program of prescribed burning is then necessary
for long-term maintenance [<a href="#48">48</a>].
