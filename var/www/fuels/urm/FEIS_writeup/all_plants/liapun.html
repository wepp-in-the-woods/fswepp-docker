<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Domestic livestock, particularly sheep, graze blazing star, especially
when plants are young [<a href="#40">40</a>].

Rocky Mountain elk in Montana also graze blazing star.  Blazing star was
given the lowest rating for forage value in winter, and the highest
rating for fall.  It is not known to be eaten in spring and summer [<a href="#28">28</a>].

White-tailed deer fed on Liatris species on a reserve in southeastern
Michigan.  Liatris species comprised 0.5 to 2 percent of the diet of
pronghorns in New Mexico [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Young blazing star plants are eaten by rodents [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Blazing star is an important nectar source for Lepidoptera.  The
population distribution of the endangered skipper butterfly (Hesperus
leonardus montana) near Deckers, Colorado corresponds almost exactly
with blazing star occurrence [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Goetz [<a href="#18">18</a>] stated that blazing star has little value as a forage species
because of its coarse leaves.

Blazing star palatability for livestock in several western states is as
follows [<a href="#12">12</a>]:

                    CO      MT      ND      WY

        Cattle     poor    poor    fair    fair
        Sheep      poor    fair    fair    fair
        Horses     poor    poor    fair    fair.

Rodents prefer buds, seedlings, new leaf growth, and starchy material
from the centers of the tuberous roots.  Seeds are eaten, but are not
preferred [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Blazing star energy value for livestock is fair; protein value is poor [<a href="#12">12</a>].

The food value of blazing star is as follows [<a href="#12">12</a>]:

                                 MT          ND          WY

        Elk                     poor        ----        good             
        Mule deer               poor        fair        fair     
        White-tailed deer       ----        poor        fair        
        Pronghorn               poor        poor        fair         
        Upland game birds       ----        ----        poor            
        Waterfowl               ----        ----        poor             
        Small nongame birds     ----        ----        poor             
        Small mammals           ----        ----        fair.
            
Toxic alkaloids occur in blazing star, but their low concentrations are
unlikely to cause acute toxicity, particularly because most hay contains
relatively little blazing star [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The cover value of blazing star is as follows [<a href="#12">12</a>]:

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Blazing star seeds were collected in the Badlands of western North
Dakota, and in 1977 and 1978 were grown on raw coal spoil material to
evaluate their use in minespoil reclamation.  Blazing star had
exceptionally good seedling emergence and subsequent vigorous growth
from direct seeding.  Greenhouse plants transplanted well.  They
produced more vigorous first-year plants, which had a greater chance of
survival than those from direct seeding [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>].

Blazing star is being developed and released for prairie rehabilitation
[<a href="#23">23</a>].  Shatter takes place shortly after seeds ripen and proceeds fairly
rapidly.  Seeds should be therefore be collected soon after ripening.
They are planted in the fall immediately after harvest or the following
spring when soils are warm (68 degrees Fahrenheit [20 deg C]) [<a href="#14">14</a>].
Plants show good vigor [<a href="#23">23</a>].

On a severely eroded, steep, sandy, south-facing slope in Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan, prairie hay mulch held down by jute mesh was very
successful in promoting germination and establishment of praririe plants
including blazing star [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Blazing star is a common floral decoration [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Blazing star contains sesquiterpene lactones and alkaloids which have
been extracted for use in biological tests [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Some components have
cytotoxic effects [<a href="#22">22</a>].

The carrot-flavored root of blazing star was used by American Indians
for food [<a href="#24">24</a>].  The plants of this genus were consumed in New England as
a treatment for gonorrhea [<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Rangeland:  Blazing star is drought resistant and well adapted to a
variety of upland prairies [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Its tolerance of drought is due to its
deep roots.  It can develop normally and produce seed when there is no
moisture in the upper layers of soil [<a href="#10">10</a>].  During periods of extended
drought, blazing star decreases in abundance and height [<a href="#31">31</a>].  During
the drought of 1931-1937 blazing star completely disappeared from many
sites in eastern Colorado [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Blazing star is preferred by grazing animals.  It classified as a
decreaser, soon disappearing under continuous overgrazing [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].

Herbicides:  Blazing star was seeded with other native forbs and grasses
at two lowland sites in eastern Nebraska in May, 1975.  Herbicides in
varying amounts were applied at the time of seeding to provide an
assessment of their use in establishing a diverse stand of prairie
grasses and forbs.  Blazing star did not appear in any treatment plots
in which herbicides were used [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Other:  In Colorado, blazing star is a major host for the parasitic
plant wholeleaf Indian paintbrush (Castilleja integra) [<a href="#30">30</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Liatris punctata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Blazing star is a native, warm-season, perennial forb [<a href="#40">40</a>].  It has one
to several stems 4 to 32 inches (0.1-0.8 m) tall [<a href="#20">20</a>].  The
inflorescence is a dense spike up to 12 inches (30 cm) long [<a href="#40">40</a>].  The
fruit is an achene.  The pappus is persistent [<a href="#3">3</a>].  The stems arise from
an erect or weakly spreading thick, short rootstock elongated into a
thickened taproot [<a href="#20">20</a>].  The taproot is 4.25 to 16.4 feet (1.3-5 m)
deep, with laterals at various levels [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Blazing star develops
rhizomes [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Blazing star develops slowly and is very long lived.  Ring counts in
root crowns showed plant ages greater than 35 years [<a href="#45">45</a>].

   Hemicryptophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Blazing star reproduces vegetatively by sprouting from rhizomes and
sexually by wind-disseminated seeds [<a href="#31">31</a>] which have a very long plumose
pappus [<a href="#14">14</a>].  The seeds have two periods of maximum germination: in the
spring after fall maturation, and during the following fall [<a href="#7">7</a>].
Blazing star germinates under a wide range of conditions, but optimal
conditions for germination may vary geographically.  Germination
response from seed in three areas follows.

Blazing star seed fill was about 40 percent in southeastern Montana in
1976 and 1977.  Germination was optimal for new seed at 68 to 86 degrees
Fahrenheit (20-30 deg C).  For seed 10 months old germination was best
at 68/41 degrees Fahrenheit (20/5 deg C) alternating temperatures.
Stratification of less than 1 month duration was insufficient.
Germination during stratification was quite high, and higher with new
seed than old.  Low temperature (39 degrees Fahrenheit [4 deg C])
storage had no effect on germination.  Light appeared to promote
germination at lower (50 degree Fahrenheit [10 deg C]) temperatures
[<a href="#14">14</a>].

Blazing star seed collected in south-central South Dakota was tested for
germination.  Of the seeds collected, 26.5 percent had mature embryos,
and these were maintained in darkness at a constant 70 degrees
Fahrenheit (21 deg C) for 30 days.  Forty-seven percent of the seeds
germinated within 8 to 22 days, requiring neither moist-cold nor
scarification treatments [<a href="#38">38</a>].

Blazing star seeds from western North Dakota were stored under three
different conditions, with storage beginning December 1, 1977.  There
was no significant difference in germination rate due to storage
conditions of dry cold, wet cold, or room temperature.  Seeds were
tested for germination rate each month from January through May, 1978.
Blazing star seeds had the highest germination rate in April, averaging
about 71 percent over all storage conditions [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Blazing star inhabits dry, open, upland sites, especially in sandy soil
[<a href="#20">20</a>].  It is found on dry prairie [<a href="#3">3</a>], dry plains, and hills [<a href="#40">40</a>].
Blazing star is also found on calcareous soils on the Edwards Plateau
and in the Guadelupe Mountains of Texas [<a href="#25">25</a>].

Blazing star growth is poor on dense clay, poor to fair on clay, fair to
good on gravel, sand, and clay loam, and good on sandy loam and loam.
Growth is poor on acidic and saline soils.  Optimum soil depth is 20
inches (50 cm) or more.  Blazing star makes good growth on gentle and
moderate slopes and fair growth on steep slopes [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Blazing star occurs at the following elevations:

                     Elevation (feet)    Elevation (m)

          CO           3,500-8,000        1,067-2,438    [<a href="#21">21</a>]

          WY           3,700-7,400        1,128-2,255    [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Blazing star is a member of the mature prairie community [<a href="#35">35</a>] and does
not tolerate deep litter or shading [<a href="#31">31</a>].  It often increases after
disturbance [<a href="#35">35</a>].

Blazing star was found to be a major forb species in scattered ponderosa
pine (Pinus ponderosa) in mixed-prairie in northwestern Nebraska.  It
was reduced in importance where the trees were more closely spaced, and
was not present where trees were dense [<a href="#42">42</a>]

Blazing star occurs in western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii)-blue
grama communities in south-central South Dakota on silt loam soils
disturbed by grazing and drought [<a href="#41">41</a>].

Blazing star occurred on some badger-disturbed sites in tallgrass
prairie of northwestern Iowa.  Seedlings were present in the spring of
the first growing season following disturbance.  During the second
growing season blazing star began to reproduce vegetatively.  On
reaching maturity, 94.1 percent of blazing star plants on disturbed
sites flowered [<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Blazing star seeds generally germinate in the spring, and to a lesser
extent in the fall.  The seedling grows only a few inches the first year
and remains in the rosette stage [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].  During this time it develops a
taproot up to 35 inches (89 cm) deep and accumulates some reserve food.
In later years it develops extensive taproots [<a href="#45">45</a>].  After the first
year blazing star begins growth in spring and attains its mature height
in late summer [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Blazing star flowering times are:

In central North Dakota blazing star populations bloom an average of
38 days each year [<a href="#9">9</a>].  In western North Dakota blazing star attains its
mature height by mid-August [<a href="#18">18</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Blazing star has good fire tolerance due to reproduction by rhizomes [<a href="#31">31</a>].
It produces numerous, small, wind-dispersed seeds [<a href="#3">3</a>] which can establish
on burned sites.  Blazing star thrives in the open, sunny conditions
created by fire [<a href="#31">31</a>].  No information was available on seed tolerance to

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Liatris punctata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Blazing star is probably top-killed by fire.  

Because of their persistent rhizomes, Liatris species are not usually
killed by fast fire.  Fire promotes seedling establishment by removing
deep litter.  Seedlings emerge earlier because of greater light and heat
at the soil surface [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Blazing star is listed as tolerant of fire in the tallgrass prairie of
the Central Great Plains, where it often increases following fire [<a href="#47">47</a>].

Blazing star was subjected to prescribed fire in northwestern Minnesota
in the spring of 1972.  Flowering was stimulated on a dry-mesic
south-facing slope in undisturbed prairie.  Flowering decreased on a
wet-mesic level site in severely disturbed prairie.  The primary factor
responsible for increased flowering appeared to be removal of litter,
which allowed for higher temperatures and increased light intensities
near the soil surface.  This resulted in increased vegetative growth in
spring and increased flowering in summer.  Litter removal by fire varied
with site [<a href="#34">34</a>].

A lightning fire with 48-mile per hour (77-km/hr) winds burned in the
Nebraska National Forest in the Sand Hills in May, 1965.  By fall, 1965,
blazing star had increased in dry valley sites and choppy sand sites.
Its presence on rolling sandy sites was unchanged [<a href="#46">46</a>].

Fire was prescribed at the Sun River Wildlife Management Area in
west-central Montana on October 17, 1983, and April 15, 1984.  Blazing
star had greater biomass after spring fires than fall fires.  It may not
have been dormant during the fall fires, and therefore was susceptible
to damage.  There was no difference in blazing star response between
backfires and headfires within a season [<a href="#26">26</a>].

An area in the Badlands of western North Dakota burned on August 14,
1954.  Blazing star frequency in August, 1958, was the same on both
burned and unburned areas [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Other sites burned in a severe wildfire
on May 29, 1958.  Blazing star was present in August, 1958, at 25
percent frequency on unburned areas, but had decreasedd to 17 percent
frequency on burned areas [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Postfire soil moisture is a major factor in determining the effect of
fire on blazing star.  Drought is common in the mixed-grass prairie and
can seriously set back recovery after a fire.  In mesic areas, or in dry
areas where fires are followed by a moist summer, fire can be beneficial
[<a href="#2">2</a>].
