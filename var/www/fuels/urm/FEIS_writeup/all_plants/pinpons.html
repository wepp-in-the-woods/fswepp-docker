The scientific name of interior ponderosa pine is <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> var. <i>scopulorum</i> Engel. (Pinaceae)
[<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#177">177</a>,<a href="#179">179</a>,<a href="#212">212</a>,<a href="#274">274</a>]. It is 1 of 3 widely recognized varieties of ponderosa pine (<i>P.
ponderosa </i>Laws.); the other 2 are Pacific ponderosa pine (<i>P. p.</i> var. <i>ponderosa</i>) and
Arizona pine (<i>P. p.</i> var. <i>arizonica</i>) [<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#177">177</a>]. The taxonomy of the ponderosa pine complex is not
completely resolved. There are morphological and distributional overlaps among the varieties, and disagreement among authorities regarding the geographical boundaries of
ponderosa pine infrataxa including
interior ponderosa pine [<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#191">191</a>,<a href="#253">253</a>]. Although
distinct, varieties of ponderosa pine show differences on broad latitudinal
clines. Dodge [<a href="#97">97</a>] described the species as &quot;a continuation of a large
group of populations from the Central American Highlands to British
Columbia.&quot; Ponderosa pine in the northern
interior are either classified
entirely as <i>P. p.</i> var. <i>scopulorum</i>  [<a href="#116">116</a>], or as <i>P. p.</i> var. <i>scopulorum
</i>east of the Continental Divide and as <i>P. p.</i> var. <i>ponderosa</i> west of the Continental Divide
[<a href="#191">191</a>].&nbsp;
Ponderosa pine populations that extend northward into western Texas from
Coahuila are
either classified as <i>P. p.</i> var. <i>scopulorum</i>   [<a href="#116">116</a>] or as <i>P. arizonica</i> var. <i>stormiae</i> Mart.
[<a href="#173">173</a>,<a href="#177">177</a>,<a href="#253">253</a>].<br><br>

In this report, &quot;ponderosa pine&quot; refers to the species as a whole. &quot;Southwestern ponderosa pine&quot; refers to both Arizona
pine and interior ponderosa
pine in the Southwest. Information on ponderosa pine in Texas and east of the Continental
Divide in Montana and Wyoming is included herein; <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/pinponp/index.html">Pacific ponderosa pine</a>
and <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/pinpona/index.html">Arizona pine</a>
 are covered in separate Fire Effects Information System reports.<br><br>

Intraspecies hybridization and introgression occur between all 3 varieties of ponderosa pine.
Interior ponderosa x Arizona pine hybrids may bear 3- and 4-needle fascicles; 4- and 5-needle
fascicles; or 3-, 4-, and 5-needle fascicles, sometimes on the same spur branch
[<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#236">236</a>]. Interior ponderosa and Arizona pines also hybridize and introgress with Apache
pine (<i>P. engelmannii</i>); 3-taxa hybrids (interior ponderosa x Arizona x Apache
pines) occur occasionally [<a href="#236">236</a>].

GENERAL DISTRIBUTION:</a>
</span>
<br />


Ponderosa pine is the most widely distributed pine species in North America,
ranging north-south from southern British Columbia to central Mexico and east-west
from central Nebraska to the west coast [<a href="#202">202</a>]. Ponderosa pine
ecosystems occupy about 38 million acres across 14 states [<a href="#122">122</a>]. The U.S. Geological
Survey provides a <a href="http://climchange.cr.usgs.gov/data/atlas/little/">distributional
map</a> for ponderosa pine.  

<p>
Interior ponderosa pine's general distribution is from the eastern slope of the northern Rocky Mountains in Montana east to central Nebraska and Kansas and south to eastern Nevada,
western Texas, and Mexico. The distribution continues south from Texas into Coahuila, Tamaulipas, and
San Luis Potos, Mexico [<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#274">274</a>]. However, interior ponderosa pine
 is not a geographically distinct taxon [<a href="#163">163</a>].
There is a broad zone of intergradation between interior and Pacific ponderosa
pines in southeastern Idaho and on both sides of the Continental Divide in Montana and Wyoming
[<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>,<a href="#236">236</a>].
Interior ponderosa x Arizona pine intergrades occur in southeastern Arizona,
southeastern New Mexico, and Mexico [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#236">236</a>].&nbsp; On sky
islands of southeastern Arizona, interior ponderosa pine mostly occurs above 7,000 feet (2100 m) elevation. A transition zone of
intergraded interior ponderosa pine &#215 Arizona pine occurs between 5000 and 7000 feet
(1500-2100 m) [<a href="#97">97</a>].</p>

<br />

The interior ponderosa pine/bunchgrass type is the most common association
throughout interior ponderosa pine's range. It is characterized by
open grassland interspersed with widely spaced trees. Under pristine conditions,
the tree canopy usually covers no more than 25% of the ground. North of the Colorado border, Idaho fescue
(<i>Festuca idahoensis</i>) is usually the dominant bunchgrass; Arizona fescue (<i>Festuca
arizonica</i>) is generally dominant to the south [<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#208">208</a>]. In mountainous areas, 
stand structure becomes increasingly savanna-like at lower elevations and forested
at higher elevations. Interior ponderosa pine merges with pinyon-juniper (<i>Pinus-Juniperus</i> spp.),
chaparral-mountain shrubland, or grassland at lower elevations and
with Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> var. <i>glauca</i>),
subalpine fir-Engelmann spruce (<i>Abies lasiocarpa</i>-<i>Picea
engelmannii</i>), Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i>
 var. <i>latifolia</i>), and/or limber pine (<i>P. flexilis</i>) at higher
elevations [<a href="#88">88</a>].&nbsp; Species composition
of interior ponderosa pine communities is described below by state or region.

<p>MT: In central Montana the interior ponderosa pine type merges into plains grassland at
lower elevations 
and limber pine at higher elevations. Limber pine, Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, and Rocky Mountain juniper (<i>Juniperus
scopulorum</i>) are common overstory associates. Plains grassland species
include
blue grama (<i>Bouteloua gracilis</i>), sideoats grama (<i>B. curtipendula</i>),
and prairie Junegrass (<i>Koeleria macrantha</i>). Western snowberry
(<i>Symphoricarpos occidentalis</i>) and
skunkbush sumac (<i>Rhus trilobata</i>) are common shrub associates. Soapweed yucca (<i>Yucca glauca</i>),
pygmy prickly-pear (<i>Opuntia fragilis</i>), and plains prickly-pear (<i>O. polyacantha</i>) occur on the driest
sites [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#230">230</a>]. Rocky Mountain juniper, bluebunch wheatgrass&nbsp; (<i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i>), and longleaf wormwood 
(<I>Artemisia longifolia</I>) are dominant species in interior ponderosa pine of the Missouri 
River Breaks [<a href="#208">208</a>].</p>

<p>Interior ponderosa pine
is the only forest tree in southeastern Montana, where it forms several diverse habitats.  On dry
sites it supports an understory of plains grassland species such as big bluestem
(<i>Andropogon gerardii</i> var. <i>gerardii</i>), little bluestem (<i>Schizachyrium scoparium</i>), and blue grama, and of mountain grassland species such as bluebunch wheatgrass
and elk sedge (<i>Carex geyeri</i>). Understories are typically
dense on wetter sites, and include species characteristic of Pacific ponderosa pine forests to the
west. Russet buffaloberry (<i>Shepherdia canadensis</i>), bearberry (<i>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</i>), 
twinflower (<i>Linnaea borealis</i>), and heartleaf arnica (<i>Arnica cordifolia</i>) are common wet-site 
associates [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#230">230</a>].</p>

<p>WY: Interior ponderosa pine is usually the
only tree at lower timberline in the Bighorn Mountains. Shrubs or grasses may
dominate the understory. The most common understory dominants are bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho
fescue, white spirea (<i>Spiraea betulifolia</i>), and mountain ninebark (<i>Physocarpus
monogynus</i>) [<a href="#164">164</a>]. Interior ponderosa pine communities are
uncommon in southeastern Wyoming. Where they occur, elk sedge most commonly dominates the understory. Ross' sedge (<i>C. rossii</i>) and bearberry
are occasional understory dominants. Common graminoids and forbs include prairie
Junegrass, spike fescue (<i>Leucopoa kingii</i>), western yarrow (<i>Achillea
millefolium</i>), and heartleaf arnica [<a href="#8">8</a>].</p>

<p>White spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>) may co-occur with interior ponderosa pine in
the Black Hills of Wyoming and South Dakota. Bur oak (<i>Quercus macrocarpa</i>),
quaking aspen (<i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and paper birch (<i>Betula
papyrifera</i>)&nbsp;are overstory associates [<a href="#52">52</a>].</p>

<p>Dakotas: Interior ponderosa pine understories in the Black Hills of South Dakota are usually dominated
by shrubs including common juniper (<i>Juniperus communis</i>), russet
buffaloberry, common snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos
albus</i>), chokecherry (<i>Prunus virginiana</i>), and bur oak. A few stands have grassy understories of
timber oatgrass (<i>Danthonia intermedia</i>), Kentucky bluegrass (<i>Poa
pratensis</i>), and/or little
bluestem [<a href="#289">289</a>]. Interior ponderosa pine
forests and woodlands are not abundant in North Dakota. Understory
composition is similar to that of interior ponderosa pine in the Black Hills
[<a href="#125">125</a>,<a href="#138">138</a>].</p>

<p>CO: On the Colorado Front Range, interior ponderosa pine generally occurs with
Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir&nbsp;on north slopes
and Rocky Mountain juniper on south slopes [<a href="#215">215</a>]. Quaking aspen
commonly co-occurs on sites that
have experienced past fires or other reoccurring disturbance [<a href="#84">84</a>]. Understory species
include common juniper, wax currant (<i>Ribes
cereum</i>), bearberry, spike fescue, blue grama, and buffalo grass (<i>Buchloe
dactyloides</i>). At the forest-plains grassland ecotone, understory species may
also include black grama (<i>Bouteloua eriopoda</i>), little bluestem, needlegrasses (<i>Hesperostipa</i>  and <i>Achnatherum</i> spp.), western wheatgrass (<i>Pascopyrum
smithii</i>), and cheatgrass (<i>Bromus tectorum</i>) [<a href="#215">215</a>].
Interior ponderosa pine is a minor species in western Colorado, where it occurs
in Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir forests [<a href="#165">165</a>].</p>

<p>In southern Colorado, interior 
ponderosa pine lies between lower-elevation grassland or pinyon-juniper (<i>Pinus-Juniperus</i>
spp.) and higher-elevation Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir. Grassy understories with blue
grama, mountain muhly (<i>Muhlenbergia montana</i>), mutton grass (<i>Poa fendleriana</i>), Arizona fescue, and little bluestem are
common on dry sites. On moister sites, shrubs such as Gambel oak (<i>Quercus gambelii</i>),
wavyleaf oak (<i>Q. </i>× <i>pauciloba</i>), and bearberry may also be important [<a href="#91">91</a>].</p>

<p>UT: 
Interior ponderosa pine/shrub communities in central
and southern Utah are usually the lowest coniferous forest type, and border
shrublands or Colorado pinyon-Utah juniper (<i>Pinus edulis</i>-<i>Juniperus
osteosperma</i>) woodland. Dominant understory species
include curlleaf mountain-mahogany (<i>Cercocarpus ledifolius</i>), greenleaf
manzanita (<i>Arctostaphylos patula</i>), black sagebrush (<i>Artemisia nova</i>),
Gambel oak, and mountain snowberry (<i>S. oreophilus</i>). Interior ponderosa pine/mountain muhly occurs in central and southern Utah
[<a href="#322">322</a>]. Interior
ponderosa pine/grassland series also occur in northeastern Utah: dominant
grasses are Idaho fescue, sheep fescue (<i>F. ovina</i>),
and/or mutton grass. Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine, Utah juniper, and quaking aspen are seral in these habitat
types [<a href="#216">216</a>].</p>

<p>Interior ponderosa pine in southeastern Nevada occurs mostly on northerly
aspects of canyons. Associated species include Utah juniper, Gambel oak, rubber rabbitbrush (<i>Chrysothamnus
nauseosus</i>), big sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i>), bottlebrush
squirreltail (<i>Elymus elymoides</i>), western wheatgrass, and cheatgrass [<a href="#45">45</a>].</p>
 
<p>Southwest: Interior ponderosa pine is the most common forest tree in the Southwest
[<a href="#323">323</a>]. Vegetation patterns in southern New Mexico and Arizona are
mostly determined by aspect
and elevation. In southeastern Arizona, interior ponderosa pine forest lies on elevational and moisture gradients between dry, low-elevation
Mexican pinyon-Chihuahua pine (<i>Pinus cembroides-P. leiophylla </i>var.<i>
 chihuahuana)</i>-Apache pine forest and/or Madrean oak woodland and moister, higher-elevation southwestern
white pine (<i>P. strobiformis</i>)-Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir forest
[<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#135">135</a>].
At 7,500 to 8,500 feet (2300 to 2600 m) elevation, interior ponderosa pine,
Arizona pine, and encinal oaks tend to dominate dry, south- and west-facing slopes,
while Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and
corkbark fir (<i>Abies lasiocarpa</i> var. <i>arizonica</i>) occupy north- and east-facing slopes. Madrean oak associates include Arizona white oak (<i>Quercus arizonica</i>), Gambel oak, Emory oak (<i>Q. emoryi</i>), and silverleaf oak (<i>Q. hypoleucoides</i>). Understories are dominated by grasses including pine dropseed (<i>Blepharoneuron
tricholepis</i>), Arizona wheatgrass (<i>Elymus arizonicus</i>), prairie Junegrass, and
screwleaf muhly (<i>M. virescens</i>) [<a href="#30">30</a>].
In high-elevation (8,400 to 9,300 feet (2500-2800 m)) mixed-conifer forest,
Engelmann spruce, blue spruce (<i>P. pungens</i>),
corkbark fir, Rocky Mountain
Douglas-fir, southwestern white pine, and quaking aspen co-occur with interior ponderosa pine
[<a href="#127">127</a>].</p>

<p>AZ:
Associates in interior ponderosa pine/bunchgrass in northern Arizona include mountain
muhly, mutton grass, Arizona fescue, bottlebrush squirreltail, blue grama, pine dropseed, deergrass (<i>M. rigens</i>), and prairie
Junegrass
[<a href="#25">25</a>]. Shrubs may be nearly absent to fairly
common. If present, they are
usually widely and irregularly spaced compared to more northern ponderosa pine
communities. Fendler ceanothus (<i>Ceanothus fendleri</i>), wax currant, skunkbush sumac, greenleaf
manzanita, Stansbury cliffrose (<i>Purshia mexicana</i> var. <i>stansburiana</i>),
Apache plume (<i>Fallugia paradoxa</i>), and mountain-mahogany (<i>Cercocarpus</i>
spp.) are among
the most common shrubs in interior ponderosa pine/bunchgrass. The
ponderosa pine type usually merges into Arizona chaparral at lower elevations of
northern and central Arizona. It may also finger into riparian zones [<a href="#60">60</a>]. At higher
elevations, the type merges into corkbark fir-spruce (<i>Picea </i>spp.) forest. Associates in the upper ponderosa pine zone
include those shrubs also found in fir-spruce
forest: common juniper, Oregon boxwood (<i>Paxistima myrsinites</i>),
red raspberry (<i>Rubus idaeus</i>), mountain ninebark, and
snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos</i> spp.). Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and quaking
aspen may co-occur with interior ponderosa pine above 7,000 feet (2000 m)
[<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#229">229</a>].</p>

<p>TX: Netleaf oak (<i>Q. rugosa</i>), silverleaf oak, and
quaking aspen are common associates throughout western Texas. Colorado pinyon and alligator juniper (<i>Juniperus deppeana</i>) often form a
woodland association with interior ponderosa pine on south slopes; Douglas-fir
and southwestern white pine join interior ponderosa pine in a forest/bunchgrass
association on moister slopes [<a href="#2">2</a>]. Understory associates include
finestem tussockgrass (<i>Nassella</i> <i>tenuissima), </i>California brome<i> (Bromus carinatus), </i>Big

Interior ponderosa pine is the most commercially valuable and productive timber tree in
the inland west and Southwest [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>]. High-quality logs are used for high-grade boards
and a wide variety of other products including cabinets, molding, and cut stock.
Lower-quality logs are used for dimension lumber and other
construction products [<a href="#48">48</a>].

Interior ponderosa pine communities are important wildlife habitat. The
forest understory provides valuable browsing and grazing for wildlife and
livestock [<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#291">291</a>,<a href="#294">294</a>,<a href="#296">296</a>]. Wildlife
also use interior ponderosa pine woodland-grassland mosaics heavily. Wooded draws of interior ponderosa pine in the high plains
grasslands of the Dakotas and Nebraska provide valuable habitat for a variety of
wildlife [<a href="#44">44</a>].

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>
Birds:</b> </font> Interior ponderosa pine communities are critical habitat for a wide variety of
birds [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>] including owls [<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#168">168</a>],
other cavity nesters, and wild turkey [<a href="#247">247</a>]. Cavity-nesting birds use interior ponderosa pine snags for
foraging and roosting
as well as nesting [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>]. Balda [<a href="#32">32</a>] estimated that secondary cavity nesters comprised 68% of the
total density of wintering birds in southwestern ponderosa pine forests.
Cunningham and others [<a href="#83">83</a>] provide a list of secondary cavity
nesters on the Coconino National Forest of Arizona. They recommend a density of
5.2 interior ponderosa pine snags per hectare to sustain habitat for cavity-nesting
birds.</p>

<p>
Bennetts and Hawksworth [<a href="#39">39</a>] found that bird diversity and number of nests observed in
interior ponderosa pine stands in northern Colorado were positively correlated with
interior ponderosa pine's level of infestation with southwestern pine dwarf-mistletoe (<i>Arceuthobium vaginatum</i> ssp. <i>cryptopodum</i>). Western tanagers, American robins, chipping sparrows, hermit thrush, and Cassin's finches
nested in
witch's brooms. Among guilds, number of insectivores, canopy, foliage, and ground omnivores, and ground granivores species was significantly higher in infected stands, while flycatchers and nectivores showed no significant effect due to level of stand infection.
In northern Arizona, Dwyer [<a href="#99">99</a>] found that in postfire years 1 and 2, secondary cavity-nesters were more
abundant in unburned, light-, and moderate-severity wildfire sites compared to
sites that experienced severe wildfire. She attributed
the difference to lack of suitable interior ponderosa pine snags on the severe
burn. Secondary cavity-nesters used the severe burn when artificial nest boxes
were attached to burned snags. In the short term, light and moderate wildfire
promoted mountain bluebird and had little effect on pygmy nuthatches,
white-breasted nuthatches, and violet-green swallows. Moderate wildfire had a
short-term negative effect on mountain chickadees. Other studies [<a href="#169">169</a>,<a href="#287">287</a>]
have shown that mountain chickadees increase or return to prefire numbers 3 to 5
years after fire.
</p>

<p>
Interior ponderosa pine provides roosting,
nesting, and foraging habitat for the Mexican spotted owl. The mixed-conifer,
interior ponderosa pine, and interior ponderosa pine/Gambel oak types provide optimal habitat
for the owl, which is federally listed as threatened [<a href="#121">121</a>]. Ganey and Balda
[<a href="#119">119</a>] found that for roosting habitat, Mexican spotted owls in northern
Arizona preferred closed-canopy, virgin&nbsp;stands of mixed conifers with a
high density of snags and large logs. The owls preferred both interior ponderosa pine
and mixed-conifer old growth forests for foraging. A study
on the Coconino National Forest showed the owls preferentially selected nest
sites in areas with 41 to 70% canopy closure [<a href="#129">129</a>]. Fiedler and Cully [<a href="#113">113</a>]
provide
tree basal area
and age class silvicultural prescriptions that optimize Mexican spotted owl
habitat and promote old-growth interior ponderosa pine.</p>

<p>The flammulated owl, a cavity nester, is also dependent
on old-growth interior ponderosa pine forest, but favors a more open
canopy for nesting and foraging than the Mexican spotted owl [<a href="#168">168</a>].</p>

<p>Reintroduced and rare in southeastern Arizona, thick-billed
parrots are ecologically dependent on Chihuahua and southwestern ponderosa
pines for food and shelter. Pine seeds are their primary diet item, and the
parrots nest in pine snag cavities [<a href="#270">270</a>].</p>

<p><b>Small mammals:</b> Interior ponderosa pine provides habitat for many
rodent species, and the seeds are an important food source for some rodents and
shrews [<a href="#126">126</a>,<a href="#182">182</a>]. Tree squirrels (<i>Sciurus</i> and <i>Tamiasciurus</i>
spp.) use interior ponderosa pine for
nesting, and the seeds are among their most important foods. Abert's squirrel is
ecologically dependent upon southwestern ponderosa pine [<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#181">181</a>,<a href="#269">269</a>]. Red squirrels beyond the range of Abert's
squirrel use interior ponderosa pine heavily for food and nesting. Where ranges of the 2 squirrels
overlap, Abert's squirrels tend to displace red squirrels to higher-elevation
forests [<a href="#109">109</a>].

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>
Deer:</b> </font> Interior ponderosa pine communities provide valuable deer habitat. Their
understories provide forage; production is highest in open stands. A
study on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest of Arizona showed mean production
of mule deer forage in interior ponderosa pine-Douglas-fir-southwestern white pine was 82
pounds/acre (92 kg/ha) at 50 feet<sup>2</sup>/acre (11 m<sup>2</sup>/ha) basal
area and 4 pounds/acre (4.5 kg/ha) at 400 feet<sup>2</sup>/acre (90 m<sup>2</sup>/ha)
basal area [<a href="#291">291</a>]. The tree itself provides minor browse [<a href="#297">297</a>]. White-tailed deer on Missouri River bottomlands of north-central Montana consumed
interior ponderosa pine in trace amounts during fall. In winter, browsing frequency increased to 33%,
comprising 2% of total volume intake. White-tailed deer were not detected browsing interior
ponderosa pine in spring or summer [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Interior ponderosa pine is unpalatable to domestic
livestock. Cattle generally browse interior ponderosa pine seedlings only when
herbaceous forage is scarce [<a href="#172">172</a>,<a href="#297">297</a>]. When herbaceous vegetation is sparse,
however, livestock may browse interior ponderosa pine enough to slow or stop
interior ponderosa pine seedling recruitment [<a href="#215">215</a>].
Pregnant cows that consume large amounts of interior ponderosa pine needles show an increased
incidence of abortion and other reproductive anomalies [<a href="#314">314</a>].&nbsp;Interior ponderosa pine is not highly
palatable to wild ungulates either, but they generally prefer interior ponderosa
pine to associated conifer
species [<a href="#172">172</a>]. Wild ungulate use of interior ponderosa pine is mostly seasonal, with heaviest use
occurring
in winter and spring [<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>,<a href="#172">172</a>]. White-tailed deer in the Black Hills of
South Dakota did not use interior ponderosa pine during July to September
but browsed trees from October to December.&nbsp; Use was lowest from January to
March, and highest from April to June [<a href="#161">161</a>].

<p> Rodents and lagomorphs browse seedlings
year-round [<a href="#84">84</a>]. Common porcupines consume the phloem of mature interior ponderosa pine; Abert's squirrels consume the seed, bud, and twigs as well as
the phloem.&nbsp; Palatability of the phloem varies among trees within a stand,
with both rodent species preferring trees with relatively low monoterpene
concentrations. Common porcupines also prefer trees infected with
southwestern pine dwarf-mistletoe to uninfected trees [<a href="#201">201</a>].

Interior ponderosa pine snags provide sites for cavity-nesting birds and mammals.
A study on the 
Coconino National Forest of Arizona determined that an average of 2.6 ponderosa pine snags per acre
(6.5/ha) 
was needed to maintain woodpecker (Picidae) populations. The most frequently used snags were trees
that had been dead at least 6 
years and were 16 inches (41 cm) or more dbh [<a href="#15">15</a>].
Cunningham and others [<a href="#83">83</a>] recommend a density of 2.1 interior ponderosa pine snags per
  acre (5.2 /ha) to sustain habitat for cavity-nesting
songbirds on the Coconino.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>
 
Mule deer in Colorado use open-canopy interior ponderosa pine/grassland habitat for feeding. Their 
foraging activity decreases as canopy cover increases [<a href="#190">190</a>]. On the
Missouri River Breaks of Montana, interior ponderosa pine-Rocky Mountain
juniper/bluebunch wheatgrass communities comprised the single most important
mule deer summer feeding grounds compared to grassland, shrub, and Rocky
Mountain Douglas-fir types. Mule deer also used interior ponderosa pine/longleaf wormwood communities for summer foraging, and for year-round
escape and bedding cover. Elk used interior ponderosa pine-Rocky Mountain
juniper/bluebunch wheatgrass communities moderately for summer feeding and
extensively for summer bedding. Over 3 years, overall elk use of the type was
moderate, with elk use peaking during a year of high forb production&nbsp;
[<a href="#208">208</a>].<br><br>

Interior ponderosa pine provides shade and resting cover. Amstrup [<a href="#12">12</a>] found that pronghorn in south-central 
Montana and north-central Wyoming used upland ponderosa pine woodlands significantly more than expected 
(p<0.05) during summer, while use did not differ from expected in other seasons. He often saw 12 or more 
pronghorn crowded within the shade of pine clumps during hot summer afternoons.
Elk in the Black Hills of South Dakota sought interior ponderosa pine stands with 54% or more canopy closure during the summer months
[<a href="#219">219</a>].

As a valuable wildlife and commercial timber tree, interior ponderosa pine is
widely planted on erodable and other disturbed sites including burns. Artificial regeneration is
often difficult due to droughty soils and competition from other vegetation. Heidmann [<a href="#155">155</a>] provides regeneration strategies for ponderosa
pine.

<p>Some exotic herbs that are
commonly planted for rehabilitation may interfere with growth of interior ponderosa pine
seedlings. Artificial interior ponderosa pine regeneration
planted north of Flagstaff showed no significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) in
height and stem diameter on plots seeded to native blue grama or bottlebrush
squirreltail and then weeded of other species compared to control plots kept
free of all species but interior ponderosa pine; however, interior ponderosa pine seedlings on plots seeded with the exotics small burnet (<i>Sanguisorba
minor</i>), yellow sweetclover (<i>Melilotus officinalis</i>), orchard grass (<i>Dactylis
glomerata</i>), or desert wheatgrass (<i>Agropyron desertorum</i>) were
significantly shorter than seedlings on control plots or plots planted to the
native grasses. Seedlings planted with yellow sweetclover or desert wheatgrass
were significantly smaller in girth compared to those on weeded plots or plots seeded to other
herbaceous species [<a href="#105">105</a>].</p>

Interior ponderosa pine is valued as a drought-resistant
ornamental [<a href="#67">67</a>]. It is widely planted for windbreaks,
especially on the plains grasslands [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#240">240</a>].

<p>Native Americans ate interior ponderosa pine seeds and the sweet, edible phloem
in the inner bark [<a href="#151">151</a>,<a href="#152">152</a>].
The Cheyenne of Montana applied interior ponderosa pine pitch inside whistles
and flutes to improve the instruments' tone. They made blue dye from a root extract
[<a href="#152">152</a>].
The Nez Perce used the pitch as a torch fuel; the Nez Perce and Crow also used pitch as
glue [<a href="#151">151</a>].</p>

<a name="OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>

<br />

Interior ponderosa pine ecosystems are under considerable stress, both from
natural and anthropogenic factors including past management practices.

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Pests and diseases:</b></font> 
Southwestern pine dwarf-mistletoe
is a serious disease agent of interior ponderosa pine south of Wyoming
[<a href="#153">153</a>,<a href="#200">200</a>].
Infection rates in the Southwest were at 33% in the 1990s [<a href="#200">200</a>], with about 20%
infection of
interior ponderosa pine on the
Colorado Front Range. Stands that have had partial cuts or mountain pine beetle attacks are most susceptible to
dwarf-mistletoe infections. New stands that have regenerated after stand-replacing fire are least likely to become infected
[<a href="#6">6</a>]. Dwarf-mistletoes (<i>Arceuthobium </i>spp.<i>) </i> and interior ponderosa pine do not
co-occur north of Colorado because the northern interior continental climate is
inhospitable to dwarf-mistletoe growth [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].</p>

<p>At least 59 species of insects attack interior ponderosa pine. The mountain pine beetle
(<i>Dendroctonus</i> <i>ponderosae</i>) is the most serious pest in the Black
Hills and the central and southern Rocky Mountains; <i>D. adjunctus</i> is a closely
related pine beetle that damages trees in the Southwest. Pine beetle epidemics have occurred throughout recorded history. 
Epidemic outbreaks are usually associated with large (> 6-inch (15 cm) diameter), 
stressed tress in overcrowded stands [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>]. Pine engraver beetles (<i>Ips</i> 
spp.) are usually secondary infesters in the central and southern Rocky 
Mountains but are often more damaging than pine beetles in the Southwest 
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#227">227</a>].</p>

<p>Bark beetle (<i>Ips</i> spp. and <i>D</i>. <i>adjunctus</i>) kill has 
escalated greatly in the Southwest. Prolonged drought and high tree density have 
probably increased the susceptibility of southwestern ponderosa pine to attacks. 
A 2002 survey of National Forests in Arizona and New Mexico showed a 4-fold 
increase in ponderosa pine mortality in 2002, with over 2 million pines killed 
on approximately a half-million acres. A combination of control actions 
including removing infested trees, application of insecticide, and thinning is 
recommended. Because the beetle outbreak is so large, control efforts are best 
targeted to accessible, high-value areas [<a href="#14">14</a>].
</p>

<p>
The most serious wood-decaying fungi are red rot and western gall rust. Shoestring root rot
occasionally infects pole-sized and younger trees [<a href="#7">7</a>].
Armillaria (<i>Armillaria</i> spp.) is a serious fungal pathogen in the Black Hills
and New Mexico [<a href="#154">154</a>].&nbsp;Management and harvesting guidelines
to minimize infection are available [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#154">154</a>]. 
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Age classes and stand structure:</b></font>
Interior ponderosa pine is rapidly losing its oldest age class. Mortality of old-growth
interior ponderosa pine is high due to increased interference from dense
postsettlement trees and stagnated nutrient cycling in the absence of fire. For
example, mortality rate of old-growth interior ponderosa pine on the Fort Valley
Experimental Forest of Arizona increased 7-fold from the 1930s level (0.75 tree/ha/decade) to the 1970s (5.75 trees/ha/decade) [<a href="#213">213</a>]. Changes to interior
ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests due to fire exclusion are discussed in
the Fire Ecology section of this report.</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Range:</b></font> 
Open stands of interior ponderosa pine produce more forage
than dense stands.&nbsp; Periodic surface fire promotes grass production by reducing
shrubs and pine litter, which retard graminoid production. Postfire increases in forage
production last about 5 to 10 years. Other benefits of range fires include better livestock distribution and range
utilization, increased water yield, and improved wildlife habitat. 
</p>

<p>
Forage productivity varies with
understory, with blue grama understories generally the least productive and
Arizona fescue and screwleaf muhly the most productive [<a href="#228">228</a>].
Stands of large-diameter trees in a patchy distribution help maintain graminoid diversity&nbsp;
[<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#225">225</a>]. Overstory thinning increased
production in the grass and forb understory on the Coconino National Forest.
Herbage production was
significantly* greater (p=0.10) on plots thinned to basal areas of less than 70 ft<sup>2</sup>/acre
(16.3 m<sup>2</sup>/ha) compared to unthinned plots with similar basal areas. Herbage production 6 years

<p>Cattle and elk use is inversely proportional to tree basal
area [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>]. On thinned interior
ponderosa pine sites in Arizona, elk
preferred sites where some alligator juniper was left to sites where it had been
completely removed. Mule deer showed no preference for thinned vs. unthinned
areas, but tended to congregate on sites with alligator juniper,
southwestern pine dwarf-mistletoe, or
acorn-producing Gambel oak [<a href="#72">72</a>]. 
</p>

<p>After monitoring cattle use on interior ponderosa
pine/Arizona fescue-mountain muhly on the Manitou Experimental Forest near
Colorado Springs, Colorado, Smith [<a href="#268">268</a>] recommended 30 to 40% utilization of the
bunchgrasses by the end of the grazing season to maximize cattle weight gain
while maintaining palatable bunchgrasses. Currie [<a href="#84">84</a>] provides suggestions for managing interior ponderosa pine/bunchgrass lands in the Central Rocky Mountains for cattle grazing. 
</p>

<p>
Response of to interior ponderosa pine grazing: Light- to
moderate-intensity grazing does not greatly impact advanced interior ponderosa pine regeneration on rangelands in good condition. On the Manitou
Experimental Forest, neither rest-rotation nor
season-long grazing resulted in much damage to natural and artificial
regeneration under light or moderate use, but interior ponderosa pine seedlings were heavily browsed
and incurred severe damage to terminal buds under heavy rest-rotation or season-long grazing
use [<a href="#84">84</a>]. Thirteen years after exclosures were built, ponderosa pine in northern
and central Arizona had increased slightly on both ungrazed
and grazed plots, at 6% and 5% frequency, respectively. Initial frequency was 2% on both plots
[<a href="#26">26</a>].
</p>

Mast and others [<a href="#215">215</a>] found that moderate cattle grazing combined with fire
exclusion has favored interior ponderosa pine seedling establishment on
ponderosa pine/grassland and ecotonal communities of the Colorado Front Range.
Prior to fire exclusion, frequent fire probably excluded ponderosa pine
seedlings at the ecotonal boundary.

<br />

Morphology: Interior ponderosa pine is a native conifer. Young, fast-growing trees have pyramidal crowns
that become broader and more rounded as they mature. Height
at maturity varies but this variety tends to be shorter than Pacific ponderosa pine. Trees in the Great Basin seldom exceed 100 feet
(30 m) [<a href="#192">192</a>], while specimens in the southern Rocky Mountains may reach 160 feet (50 m) in
height and 50 inches (130 cm) in diameter [<a href="#262">262</a>]. Interior ponderosa pine
branches are open and self-pruning. Needles are from 3 to 7 inches (7-17 cm)
long. The seed cones are 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm) in length, and bear winged
seeds with a body length of 3 to 4 millimeters and wing length of up to 15
millimeters [<a href="#116">116</a>]. Bark of mature trees is about 3 inches (8
cm) thick [<a href="#192">192</a>]. The root system is deep and spreading; interior ponderosa
pine is one of the most wind-firm trees in the inland Northwest [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>]. An 85-year-old tree in Colorado that was 19 feet (5.7 m) in height and 4.5 inches (114.3 cm)
dbh had a maximum root
depth of 5 feet (1.5 m) and a maximum lateral spread of 10 feet (3 m), with the majority of roots growing
down slope. Fine roots were absent [<a href="#41">41</a>].
In Nebraska plains grassland clay, a 32-year-old, 25-foot (8 m) tree had lateral
roots extending 20 feet (6 m) from the stem. Greatest depth of vertical roots
was 12 feet (4 m), with most roots concentrated 3 to 4 feet (0.9-1.2 m) below
ground [<a href="#320">320</a>].

<p> There are 2 races of
interior ponderosa pine: the northern and southwestern types. Northern interior ponderosa pine has a majority of 2-needle fascicles
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#310">310</a>]. The variety's scientific name derives from the
stiff, tufted (scopulate) foliage and compact crown characteristic of this race
[<a href="#73">73</a>]. The southwestern race has a majority of 3-needle
fascicles and a relatively open crown [<a href="#179">179</a>,<a href="#310">310</a>].&nbsp;
</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Structure: </font></b> Stands were historically open with varied age class
distributions [<a href="#213">213</a>,<a href="#215">215</a>]. Cooper [<a href="#75">75</a>] found that
on the Fort Apache Reservation of east-central Arizona, where frequent
prescribed burning is practiced, interior ponderosa pine grows in a mosaic of small (about 0.2-acre (0.08
ha)), even-aged groups that are maintained by fire. Trees are widely and randomly spaced.
In contrast, structure in an unburned virgin stand on the Fort
Valley Experimental Forest was uneven-aged with
trees in small, uneven-aged groups. Pole-sized trees predominated, with
scattered presettlement trees 14.5 to 41 inches (37-104 cm) dbh, and dense
thickets of saplings [<a href="#77">77</a>]. (The Fire Ecology section of this report compares of pre- and postsettlement structure of
this stand.) Laven and others [<a href="#198">198</a>] found presettlement stands on the
central Colorado Front Range tended to have widely spaced, uneven-aged trees.
Grouping patterns were not evident.
</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Age:</font></b> Interior ponderosa pine is long lived. Larger trees
may attain ages of 700 or more years [<a href="#192">192</a>,<a href="#262">262</a>], although ponderosa pine
between 350 and 425 years of age has a
high mortality rate [<a href="#221">221</a>]. In a reconstruction of
presettlement stand age classes near Flagstaff, Mast and others [<a href="#213">213</a>] found that
prior to 1876, trees greater than 100 years old made up 68% of the overstory.&nbsp;
The oldest
interior ponderosa pine on record was
a 1,047-year-old tree from Colorado [<a href="#192">192</a>]. In the Southwest, Swetnam and Brown
[<a href="#285">285</a>] recorded a 742-year-old tree from northwestern Arizona.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
<b><font face="Bell MT">
Physiology:</font></b> The tough, compact foliage of the northern
race of interior ponderosa pine probably confers cold tolerance [<a href="#73">73</a>]. A deep, extensive root system, high sapwood:heartwood ratio, and
sunken stomata make interior ponderosa pine highly drought tolerant throughout
its range [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>]. In the northern and central portions of
interior ponderosa pine's distribution, only limber pine and Rocky Mountain bristlecone
pine (<i>Pinus aristida</i>) better
withstand extended drought [<a href="#36">36</a>]. In the
Southwest, Barton and Teeri [<a href="#35">35</a>] found that interior ponderosa pine seedlings from the Chiricahua Mountains of southeastern Arizona were more drought resistant than southwestern white pine but less so than
Mexican pinyon, Chihuahua, and Apache pines.</p>

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Pollination and seeds:</b></font> 
Mating system is
outcrossing of monoecious trees by wind pollination. Interior ponderosa pine 1st produces cones at 10 to 20 years of age
[<a href="#188">188</a>,<a href="#193">193</a>].
Seed production is cyclic: trees in the Black Hills produce good seed crops
every 2 to 5 years [<a href="#52">52</a>]. The cycle varies with climate and is not reliably periodic
[<a href="#182">182</a>]. High temperatures during strobili formation have
been correlated with good cone crops [<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>]. Jones [<a href="#172">172</a>] reported that in the Southwest, cone crops tend to be lighter in mixed-conifer compared to
lower-elevation interior ponderosa pine forest. Seed- and cone-feeding insects may greatly reduce 
the seed crop. On the Kaibab and Coconino national forests of northern Arizona, degree of cone and seed 
infestation differed significantly (p&lt;0.05) by site. The study did not address how the sites differed
[<a href="#46">46</a>]. Shrews, rodents, and birds may also greatly reduce the cone
crop [<a href="#182">182</a>,<a href="#182">182</a>,<a href="#196">196</a>]. During a 10-year
study near Flagstaff, predation by Abert's squirrels varied from 0.3 to 75% of
the total cone crop. The number of cones clipped was not related to the size of
the total crop [<a href="#196">196</a>].<p>Seeds are mostly wind dispersed and do not usually
carry more than 120 feet (37 m) from the parent tree [<a href="#227">227</a>]. Seeds
cached by rodents may result in some seedling establishment, but rodents are not
important dispersal agents of interior ponderosa pine seed. Clark's nutcrackers
play a minor but important role in seed dispersal because seeds they cache are
more likely to establish than rodent-cached seeds [<a href="#194">194</a>]. Seeds require mineral soil and do not germinate until the soil
is continuously warm and moist [<a href="#195">195</a>]. There is some evidence that unlike Pacific
ponderosa pine, interior ponderosa pine does not require cold/damp
stratification prior to germination (M. G. Harrington 2003, pers. comm.). Schmid and Mitchell [<a href="#259">259</a>] found the number of sound seeds collected from trees on the Coconino and
Kaibab national forests did not vary significantly (p=0.05) between sites, but did vary
significantly among trees. Mean number of sound seeds/cone/tree ranged
from 35 to 58. In field trials, germination rate of seed collected and
outplanted on the Fort Valley Experimental Forest showed 61 to 90% germination,
with germination time varying from 12 to 37 days. First-year survivorship was
greatest (13-19%) in seedlings that germinated in early to mid-July, and least
(2-7%) in seedlings that germinated in August. Predation of germinants by
dark-eyed juncos was responsible for over half of germinant mortality [<a href="#195">195</a>]. Seed
germination is usually lowest, and seed predation highest, in years when seed
crops are low [<a href="#182">182</a>]. Ponderosa pine is not a seed banking
species, although a minor amount of seed may germinate in its 2nd spring or
summer [<a href="#172">172</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seedling establishment:</b></font> Seedlings are relatively shade intolerant and require canopy-opening
disturbances such as fire, logging, or tree death to establish [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#192">192</a>,<a href="#214">214</a>,<a href="#271">271</a>].
Establishment pulses may
occur on open sites when wet years follow a fire year, but wet postfire years are not always
required for good establishment in the central Rocky Mountains and north. Two major pulses of seedling establishment in Rocky Mountain National
Park, Colorado (1870-1890 and 1970-1980), occurred when fire was followed by normal
precipitation [<a href="#215">215</a>]. Seedlings quickly develop a long 
taproot that enables them to reach moisture even on hot, burned-over soils
[<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#192">192</a>]. Nevertheless, fall drought is a major factor in seedling mortality
[<a href="#171">171</a>,<a href="#197">197</a>] and drought limits seedling establishment at interior
ponderosa pine's lower elevational limit [<a href="#34">34</a>]. Since
interior ponderosa pine in the Southwest has only a 2-month growing
season before the onset of fall drought, winter dormancy, and spring drought,
seedling mortality is usually
highest in regions with bimodal precipitation [<a href="#195">195</a>]. Regeneration is further
hindered in southwestern ponderosa pine on volcanic soils, which produce smaller
seedlings (1 to 2 inches (3-5 cm)) that are more susceptible to frost-heaving compared to
seedlings on other
soils [<a href="#155">155</a>]. Rodent and ungulate browsing may result in considerable seedling loss.
Artificial interior ponderosa pine regeneration on the Apache National Forest of
east-central Arizona showed 95% mortality, and surviving seedlings showed little
height gain, with mule deer and elk browsing. Seedlings in exclosures showed
2 to 3 times the height growth of unprotected seedlings [<a href="#171">171</a>]. However, certain gazing regimes favor seedling establishment. Pearson [<a href="#232">232</a>] found
that in the Southwest, heavy cattle grazing that reduced grass interference with
interior ponderosa pine growth, followed by light cattle grazing that allowed tree
seedlings to survive, favored ponderosa pine over herbaceous and shrub species.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p> On open sites with favorable moisture conditions,
interior ponderosa pine seedlings often establish in large
numbers. Dense seedlings often develop into &quot;dog-hair&quot; sapling thickets if stands are not thinned by
fire or other means [<a href="#77">77</a>]. Boldt and Van Deusen [<a href="#52">52</a>] report that high
tree densities (&gt; 1 tree/ft<sup>2</sup>) are common
in naturally regenerated interior ponderosa pine stands in the Black Hills. An even-aged, 
63-year-old stand that had never experienced fire contained 6,600 trees per acre
(16 500/ha),
with average d.b.h. of 2.4 inches (6.1 cm). A number of researchers
[<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#257">257</a>,<a href="#284">284</a>,<a href="#285">285</a>]
have noted that ponderosa pine establishment in the Southwest tends to occur in
pulses, during periods of relatively cooler, wetter climate conditions, but the
current rate of establishment appears unprecedented. Mast and others [<a href="#213">213</a>] found
that rate of interior ponderosa pine seedling establishment varied 8-fold over the 3 centuries prior to
fire exclusion; however, presettlement variability in seedling establishment was dwarfed by a
2-orders-of-magnitude increase in seedling establishment in the early 20th
century compared to presettlement rates of interior ponderosa pine establishment. Brown
and others [<a href="#61">61</a>] suggest that these pulses of dense tree establishment and rapid
growth result in ladder fuels that increase the severity of the next fire.&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Growth and mortality: </b></font> Biomass allocation shifts as trees mature. As seedlings, ponderosa
pine allocates relatively more biomass to roots compared to stems and leaves.
Saplings tend to allocate relatively more of their biomass to foliage, and
pole-sized trees allocate more biomass to woody tissue [<a href="#132">132</a>]. Open-grown interior ponderosa pine generally
gain height rapidly in the sapling and pole stages [<a href="#172">172</a>], and mortality rates
tend to level off at maturity. Knowles and Grant [<a href="#184">184</a>] found
that interior ponderosa pine on the Colorado Front Range showed a sharp
drop in mortality at age 115. The oldest trees sampled were 300+ years old. Minor
[<a href="#220">220</a>] developed site
index curves for interior ponderosa pine in the Southwest.</p>

<p>Dendrochronological and basal area analyses of trees in central Colorado showed that
interior ponderosa pine growth was positively correlated with presence of Gambel oak and negatively correlated with presence of other
interior ponderosa pine (r <u>></u> 0.93). The authors [<a href="#42">42</a>] attributed increased growth of
interior ponderosa pine associated with Gambel oak to better soil nutrient status conferred by oak litter and/or increased density of
interior ponderosa pine facilitated by Gambel oak nurse trees.
Klemmedson [<a href="#183">183</a>] also noted the benefit of Gambel oak litter to soil nutrient
status and interior ponderosa pine growth. Gambel oak also grows in shrub form.
Data on relative growth rate of young interior ponderosa pine in Gambel oak
shrub stands are not available; however, Gambel oak shrubs may hinder growth of
interior ponderosa pine rather than increase it (M. G. Harrington 2003, pers. 
comm).</p>

<a name="SITE CHARACTERISTICS">
SITE CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Interior ponderosa pine occupies relatively dry, nutrient-poor sites compared to
other montane conifers but shows wide ecological amplitude throughout its
distribution. Interior ponderosa pine in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of Colorado
is associated 
with dry sites. Detrended correspondence analysis determined that of 5 co-occurring tree 
species, only limber pine occurred on sites that were subject to more solar radiation, and 
had higher soil pH, than interior ponderosa pine [<a href="#11">11</a>]. In contrast, interior ponderosa pine
in southeastern Arizona occurs on relatively moist sites that are 
higher in elevation than the habitats of most southwestern pine species [<a href="#35">35</a>].

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Climate:</b></font> Temperature regimens do not vary greatly across ponderosa
pine's range: Pearson [<a href="#233">233</a>]
found only a 2 <sup>o</sup>Fahrenheit difference in mean annual temperature
among ponderosa pine sites in Arizona, the Black Hills, Washington, and
California. Length of frost-free period
in interior ponderosa pine sites depends upon latitude and
elevation. In much of its northern range, the frost-free period averages about
120 days. In the extreme Southwest, the frost-free period may lengthen
to 240 days [<a href="#69">69</a>].
</p>

<p> A common climatic factor occurs across interior ponderosa pine's
geographical range: Interior ponderosa pine grows on sites too dry to support
other timber species. Although the drought season occurs at different times in
different regions, periodic
prolonged drought is characteristic across interior ponderosa pine's range and limits
its expansion into drier types [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>]. Overall, annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 20 inches (380-510 mm)
per year. In low-elevation interior ponderosa pine at desert edges,
mean precipitation is as low as 9 inches (230 mm) per year. In mixed-conifer
forests at moderate elevations, mean annual precipitation may exceed 25 inches
(640 mm) [<a href="#33">33</a>]. Climate grades from dry continental interior in the north,
to subhumid in
south-central Wyoming, to semi-arid in the Southwest and the plains grassland-interior ponderosa pine woodland interface
[<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>]. Climate is most favorable for regeneration in the Black
Hills, where the wettest months are May and June and summer rains are frequent
[<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>]. The Medicine
Bow Range of Wyoming, which averages 25 inches (640 mm) annual precipitation, is
the wettest portion of interior ponderosa pine's range. Precipitation on
the east slope of the Medicine Bow ranges between 12 and 20 inches (300-510 mm), with 2/3rds received
from April through September [<a href="#84">84</a>]. Transplant studies and abundant
natural regeneration under fire exclusion suggest that climate is not limiting
for interior ponderosa pine establishment on many plains grassland sites [<a href="#134">134</a>].
Climate
in the Southwest has a distinct bimodal pattern of winter and summer
precipitation. May
and June, the wettest months in the northern portion of interior ponderosa pine's range, are
the driest
months in Arizona and New Mexico [<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>].&nbsp; Mean annual
precipitation in interior ponderosa pine communities in western Texas is 16 to 20 inches
(400-510 mm) [<a href="#267">267</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
<b>Soils:</b></font> Interior ponderosa pine occurs widely on igneous and
sedimentary parent materials including basalt, volcanic cinder, limestone, and
sandstone soils.
Textures include
clayey and silty loams, sandy loams, gravels, and cobbles [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#138">138</a>,<a href="#267">267</a>].
Steep slopes with restricted soil profile development may support at least some interior ponderosa pine
[<a href="#68">68</a>].
Degree of slope varies and can be steep: sites in the Santa Catalina Mountains of southeastern
Arizona ranged from 10 to 36<sup>o</sup>  [<a href="#97">97</a>].
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Elevation:</b></font> 
Interior ponderosa pine occupies
a narrower, often higher elevational range than Pacific ponderosa pine. It is
most common from 6,000 to 8,500 feet (1800-2600 m) [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>].

<br />

Interior ponderosa pine is mostly a seral species. It is highly light and
drought tolerant, and is
usually the 1st conifer to establish on disturbed sites [<a href="#172">172</a>]. Lundquist [<a href="#204">204</a>] identified fire as the primary force setting back succession in interior ponderosa pine/grassland communities in the Black Hills of South
Dakota. Shallow soils that promote tree fall, tree harvest, <i> Armillaria </i>
infection, cattle grazing, and storm damage were other major factors setting
back succession&nbsp; [<a href="#215">215</a>,<a href="#245">245</a>].&nbsp;Catastrophic
  winds and mountain pine beetle outbreaks
have also been identified as stand-initiating events in interior ponderosa pine forests
  [<a href="#205">205</a>]. One or a combination of these events 
creates growing space for seedlings. Lundquist and Negron [<a href="#205">205</a>]&nbsp; predict that
  interior ponderosa pine seedling establishment stops about 70 years after
a stand-replacing event due to canopy closure. Even spacing of mature trees 
in this "stem exclusion stage&quot; is maintained by
frequent, low-severity surface fires. Fine-scale succession occurs in canopy gaps created by death
  of a group of 
mature interior ponderosa pine. On most sites, more shade-tolerant trees
eventually establish beneath the interior ponderosa pine canopy without fire or
  other stand-initiating disturbance, although interior ponderosa pine is the climax
forest on some harsh, dry sites [<a href="#215">215</a>,<a href="#237">237</a>,<a href="#245">245</a>]. Interior ponderosa pine may be completely replaced by later-successional
conifers such as Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, fir (<i>Abies</i> spp.), and spruce
(<i>Picea</i> spp.) after several decades without disturbance. Multistoried stands of interior ponderosa pine have increased as a result of fire 
exclusion. They are typically structured with seedlings, saplings, and small poles
of interior ponderosa pine and later-successional, shade-tolerant conifers, clustered around 
widely scattered mature interior ponderosa pine. In later stages of succession, the clumps merge to form continuous stands 
of irregular structure [<a href="#7">7</a>].

<p>
Interior ponderosa pine is moderately shade tolerant. It tolerates shade better than quaking 
aspen, whitebark pine, and bur oak but less than western white pine, white spruce, and Rocky Mountain 
juniper. Unlike the first 4 species, interior ponderosa pine can establish beneath 
its own canopy [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].</p>

<p>On some sites, interior ponderosa pine can be a secondary colonizer in the absence of
disturbance. GIS modelling of historic photographs of interior ponderosa
pine-plains grassland ecotones on the Colorado Front Range shows a pattern of
tree invasion into historic grassland, particularly on north slopes. Interior
ponderosa pine invasion began around 1930, when effective fire exclusion began.
Two strong pulses of interior ponderosa pine establishment onto grassland
occurred in the 1970s and 1980s during years of above-average precipitation.
Decreased livestock grazing may have also aided tree invasion into plains
grassland in the 1970s and 1980s [<a href="#214">214</a>].</p>

<p> 
Interior ponderosa pine is typically seral to white spruce in the Black Hills of Wyoming and 
South Dakota. It is climax on sites that are too dry to support white spruce. Quaking aspen may dominate 
a site following stand-replacing fire, but interior ponderosa pine typically establishes dominance 
after a few postfire decades. Bur oak may dominate some low-elevation stands in the northern Black Hills and Bearlodge Mountains of eastern Wyoming. Succession to interior ponderosa pine
is "very slow" on 
sites where oak scrub stands develop after fire or other stand-replacing events [<a href="#7">7</a>].</p>

<p>East of the Continental Divide in Montana, interior ponderosa pine is a climax species. It forms heavily stocked, 
uneven-aged stands in the absence of fire [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#237">237</a>].&nbsp; In the Missouri Breaks
region of Montana, bluebunch wheatgrass-western
wheatgrass grasslands succeed to interior ponderosa pine/bluebunch wheatgrass habitats in the absence of fire. Shrubland
areas of the region may succeed to interior ponderosa pine/Rocky Mountain
juniper without fire [<a href="#104">104</a>].
</p>

<p>
Succession to conifers may be slow in southern New Mexico and Arizona. Aspect strongly influences rate 
of succession. In the White Mountains of south-central New Mexico, interior ponderosa pine
establishment began 15 to 20 years after fire on northern and eastern exposures, while 75 or more years
were sometimes required for forest development after fire on southern and western slopes. Once established, 
however, interior ponderosa pine cover was generally higher on drier slopes than on north-facing 
slopes [<a href="#135">135</a>]. Moir and Dietrich [<a href="#221">221</a>] present successional models for interior ponderosa pine in Arizona and New Mexico, both with fire and with fire exclusion.

SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:</a>

<br />

Timing of cone development, pollination, and seed dispersal events are similar
across interior ponderosa pine's range. Germination and seedling establishment
differ north to south, with establishment occurring earlier in the year in more northern
latitudes. Strobili of interior ponderosa pine in the Great Plains elongate in May and

FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS:</a>

<br />

<font size="3" face="Bell MT"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font> 
Interior ponderosa pine is rated &quot;very resistant&quot; to
fire. No other conifer within its range is better adapted to survive surface fires
[<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>], which often char but usually do not kill mature trees [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#281">281</a>,<a href="#307">307</a>]. Adaptations to 
survive surface fires include open crowns;
self-pruning branches; thick, insulative, relatively unflammable bark; thick bud scales;
tight needle bunches that enclose and protect meristems,
then open into a loose arrangement that does not favor combustion or
propagation of flames; high foliar moisture; and a deep rooting habit
[<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#180">180</a>,<a href="#323">323</a>].&nbsp; Trees in widely spaced stands
are typically better equipped to survive surface fire than trees in denser
stands because they develop thicker bark&nbsp; [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>]. Ponderosa pine cannot survive crown
fire [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#316">316</a>,<a href="#323">323</a>], but mature trees can survive a
considerable amount of scorching [<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>].

<p>Surface fire often kills
interior ponderosa pine seedlings and saplings [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>];
however, the effect is dependent upon fire severity and stand structure. Young trees in open canopies acquire 
fire-resistant traits
rapidly, and 6-year-old saplings often survive low-severity surface fire. Fire is especially damaging in
overcrowded young stands: the relatively denser foliage and thinner bark of trees in thick stands reduce
resistance to surface fire. Such stands are also prone to crown
fire [<a href="#55">55</a>].</p>

<p>Fire prepares a favorable seedbed
for interior ponderosa pine regeneration. Periodic surface fire removes the heavy litter and duff that
accumulate in ponderosa pine forests. Wind-borne seeds falling from the crowns of surviving or
fire-killed trees land on a nutrient-enriched mineral seedbed under an open
canopy that favors germination and seedling establishment [<a href="#251">251</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>,<a href="#323">323</a>]. Seedling-water relations may be enhanced
when fire removes competing vegetation [<a href="#133">133</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font> 
Interior ponderosa pine evolved under a regime of frequent surface fires and
infrequent mixed-severity and stand-replacement fires [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#281">281</a>,<a href="#307">307</a>]. Presettlement fires in
lower-elevation (&lt;7920 feet (2400 m)) ponderosa pine 
communities were mostly low- to moderate-severity surface fires that&nbsp;
maintained open-grown, parklike stands [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#149">149</a>,<a href="#278">278</a>,<a href="#280">280</a>,<a href="#298">298</a>,<a href="#305">305</a>,<a href="#311">311</a>]. Prior to the 1900s
interior ponderosa pine was perpetuated by surface fires that recurred every 5 to 30
years. Fire return intervals tended to be shorter
in the warm, dry forests of the Southwest than
in the cool, dry
forests of the central Rocky Mountains or the cool, relatively moist forests
east of the
northern Rocky Mountains [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#198">198</a>]. For example, Dieterich
and Swetnam [<a href="#96">96</a>] report a 2-year mean fire return interval for presettlement
interior ponderosa pine on the Fort Valley Experimental Forest
near Flagstaff; Laven and others [<a href="#198">198</a>] report a 45.8-year mean fire return
interval (range=20.9-66.0 years) for the Front Range of Colorado; and Brown and
Sieg [<a href="#63">63</a>] report an average fire return interval of 22 years for
presettlement interior ponderosa pine forests of South Dakota. Gruell [<a href="#131">131</a>] provides an annotated record 
of wildfires that occurred throughout interior ponderosa pine's
range during the settlement period (1776-1900). Historic fire regimes are
summarized by state and region in the ending paragraphs of this section.</p>

<p>
Fire history studies show mixed-severity fire regimes for some interior
ponderosa pine forests. Many forests experienced infrequent, large stand-replacement fires prior to the 
European-American settlement period
[<a href="#61">61</a>]. For example, Laven
and others [<a href="#198">198</a>] reported a range of 3 to 161 years (mean (m)=45.8) for
the central Colorado Front Range. Small fires
occurred on average every 20.9 years; large fire occurrence averaged 41.7
years.&nbsp;Higher-elevation&nbsp; (&gt;7920 feet (2400 m)), relatively mesic
mixed-conifer forests with interior ponderosa pine, Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, and Rocky Mountain
lodgepole pine tend
to have more mixed-severity fires than lower-elevation interior ponderosa pine
forests&nbsp; [<a href="#280">280</a>,<a href="#315">315</a>]. This is probably because herbaceous species recover from fire more
quickly, and dry out earlier in the season, at low elevations. In the northern Colorado Front Range,
mean fire interval for widespread (<u>&gt;</u> 10 trees scarred), mixed-severity
fire in higher-elevation forests during 1650 to 1920 ranged from 34
to 43 years; mean fire interval for widespread, mixed-severity fire in
lower-elevation interior ponderosa pine forest was 14 to 24 years. During the
same period, mean fire interval for localized (2-9 trees scarred) fires in
higher- and lower-elevation ponderosa pine forest was 17 to 22 years and 8 to 18
years, respectively [<a href="#298">298</a>]. Interior ponderosa
pine at 5,633 to 5,919 feet (1707-1804 m) in the Chiricahua Mountains experienced
an historical fire return interval ranging from 1 to 15 years (m=6.17 years)
compared to a range of 1 to 31 years (m=7.96 years) in higher-elevation (6,801-7,002 feet (2073-2134 m)) 
mixed-conifer forest in the
Chiricahua Mountains.
Some higher-elevation mixed-conifer forests show an historical fire regime
similar to lower-elevation ponderosa pine, however. Swetnam and Basian [<a href="#280">280</a>]
suggest that mixed-conifer forests on dry, steep slopes, where fire can easily
ignite and spread upslope from many directions, are most likely to experience
frequent surface fire.</p>

<p>Native
American burning influenced fire regimes in ponderosa pine ecosystems
prior to and during European-American settlement, mostly by increasing fire
frequency. For example, in studying fire history in the Chiricahua Mountains of southeastern Arizona,
Seklecki and others
[<a href="#264">264</a>] found that southwestern ponderosa pine showed a shorter fire return interval
(mean=3.0 years, range=1.0-16.0 years) between 1700 and 1900, when Chiricahua
Apaches inhabited the area, than in earlier periods when Apaches did not
reside there. Dormant-season (spring) fires were also
more frequent during that time period in southwestern ponderosa pine sites of the Chiricahua Mountains
compared to southwestern ponderosa pine sites near the Mexican border, which
were used as travel corridors but mostly unoccupied at that time [<a href="#264">264</a>]. Near the border,
most fires occurred in the late May to early June
growing season [<a href="#280">280</a>]. Fire frequency
increased to 1 per year (an uncommonly low number for southwestern ponderosa
pine) during the Spanish-Apache wars of 1760 to
1780, when Apaches probably used fire as a method of warfare. Fire occurrence terminated abruptly in the late 
1880s, coincident with
Apache resettlement to reservations (Geronimo surrendered in 1886) and increased
livestock grazing by European-Americans [<a href="#264">264</a>,<a href="#280">280</a>].</p>

<p>Fire regimes in
interior ponderosa pine
also affect regimes of adjacent communities. In many cases, fire frequency has
been reduced in adjacent communities because ignitions in interior ponderosa pine are
suppressed and fire does not spread into adjacent communities. For example,
stand structure of a shrub live oak-hairy mountain-mahogany (<i>Quercus turbinella</i>-<i>Cercocarpus</i> <i>montanus</i> 
var. <i>paucidentatus</i>)<i>
 </i>community on the Prescott National Forest of Arizona was historically a fire-maintained mosaic
of different-aged chaparral. Mean fire frequency in the adjacent interior
ponderosa pine/Arizona white oak (<i>Q. arizonica</i>) stand was 2 years. After
over 100 years of fire exclusion, the chaparral stand is even-aged and
senescent, with heavy accumulations of dead material. Interior ponderosa pine is
encroaching into the chaparral [<a href="#93">93</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Climate and fire frequency:</b></font> 
Long-term fire history studies on the northern Colorado Front Range
show that interannual variability in soil moisture is more conducive to widespread
fire than drought alone. Fire occurrence, especially widespread fire,
tends to increase 1 to 4 years after above-average moisture availability in
spring-summer [<a href="#298">298</a>]. Similarly, fire occurrence tends to increase 2 to
3 years after above-average precipitation in winter-spring&nbsp; [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#281">281</a>].
Climatic variation that produces widespread, stand-replacing fire has been
associated with southern oscillation events. El Nino is associated with greater soil
moisture and herbaceous fuel production in spring, with fire occurrence peaking
several years after El Nino events. La Nina events are associated with dry
springs, with fire occurrence peaking in the same year [<a href="#298">298</a>]. A decline
in fire frequency in interior ponderosa pine forests of the Southwest coincided
with reduced El Nino-La Nina events between 1780 and 1830 [<a href="#284">284</a>,<a href="#298">298</a>].
Alternating wet and dry years resulting from El Nino-La Nina events in the mid-
to late 1800s increased fire frequency [<a href="#298">298</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire exclusion:</b></font> 
The ecological changes that have occurred in ponderosa
pine forests over the last century have been well documented by a number of
researchers [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#224">224</a>,<a href="#306">306</a>,<a href="#311">311</a>,<a href="#312">312</a>].
Frequent, mostly light-severity surface fires thinned small trees, especially the less fire-resistant Rocky 
Mountain Douglas-fir and
firs. The combined effects of 60 to 80 years of fire exclusion, logging that removed many overstory pines, 
heavy livestock grazing,
and climate change have created closed-canopy stands with dense understories and ladder fuels
[<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#256">256</a>,<a href="#281">281</a>,<a href="#292">292</a>].&nbsp;
These changes have been documented throughout interior ponderosa pine's
range [<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#209">209</a>,<a href="#271">271</a>], and have also occurred in interior ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir and mixed-conifer
types [<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#298">298</a>]. A fire history study of
interior ponderosa pine stands near Flagstaff, Arizona, documented changes in
stand structure over a 116-year period [<a href="#77">77</a>].</p>

<p>When wildfire burns these dense interior ponderosa pine stands under dry conditions, the abundant fuel quickly 
allows it to develop a high intensity and to spread into tree crowns. Severe,
stand-replacing fires were infrequent in interior ponderosa pine forests in the past;
now they are common [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].
Abundant litter and living and dead woody fuels feed explosive wildfires of
intensities and sizes that have not occurred for many centuries, if ever [<a href="#280">280</a>].
The increasingly frequent occurrence of large, crowning wildfires in interior ponderosa pine may indicate a shift
to a fire regime characterized by very large (&gt; 100 000-acre
(4000 ha)) crown fires [<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#255">255</a>].
Data in Sackett and others [<a href="#255">255</a>] show a great increase in
the number of acres burned by wildfire in Arizona and New Mexico since 1970.
Over 100,000 acres (40 000 ha) burned from 1915 to 1990, with 70% of the
fires occurring after 1970. Before 1970, total acreage burned per year never
exceeded 130,000 acres (52 000 ha). After 1970 there were 8 years in which
total acreage burned exceeded 119,000 acres (47 600 ha), with nearly 500,000 acres
(200 000 ha) burning in 1989. On the Mexican side of the international border,
where there is a lack of effective fire suppression, frequent, widespread surface fires have
persisted in southwestern ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests [<a href="#280">280</a>].</p>

<p>
Besides unprecedented, large-acreage severe fires, other
ecological consequences of fire suppression in interior ponderosa pine ecosystems include
[<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#312">312</a>]:</p>

<p>Organisms within
interior ponderosa pine ecosystems have evolved with fire, and frequent fires
are probably required to maintain ecosystem health [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#221">221</a>,<a href="#222">222</a>].
Some researchers have questioned whether ponderosa pine ecosystems are
sustainable under current conditions [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#265">265</a>,<a href="#280">280</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Fuels:</b></font>
 Even
within the same provenance, fuel loadings in ponderosa pine stands may vary
greatly depending upon age class, stand structure, and understory composition
[<a href="#252">252</a>].
Prediction equations for fuel loads in ponderosa pine are available&nbsp;
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>,<a href="#248">248</a>]. Mean fuel loadings (tons/acre, 0-1 inch and &gt; 1-inch
fuels) have been calculated for ponderosa pine stands on 3 Reservations, 2
National Parks, and 8 National Forests of Arizona and New Mexico. The study
involved 62 sites: mean forest floor loading for the entire 62 stands was 12.5
tons/acre (4.1 t/ha) [<a href="#249">249</a>].</p>

<p>Absence of fire in interior ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests has
led to
uncharacteristically large accumulations of surface and ground fuels
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#175">175</a>,<a href="#252">252</a>]. Structurally, fire
exclusion has led to vertical continuity, with Douglas-fir, firs, and other
shade-tolerant, less fire-resistant species in the understory. These late-successional
species become ladder fuels that
encourage crown fires in interior ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>]. In the dry southwestern climate, the natural
accumulation of pine needles and woody fuels is exacerbated by slow
decomposition [<a href="#149">149</a>].</p>

Black Hills and interior Northwest:
Fire season on the interior ponderosa pine-grassland savannas of eastern
Montana and the Dakotas peaks in July and August, when the majority (73%) of
lightning-strike ignitions occur. Wildfire season generally extends from April
to September [<a href="#161">161</a>]. Frequent surface fires historically burned litter and killed
young interior ponderosa pine and other non-sprouting woody species encroaching
into grasslands [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>]. Interior ponderosa pine
in the Black Hills was historically characterized by
2 communities: interior forest and savanna. These treed landscapes were
described as &quot;islands&quot; surrounded by plains grasslands.&nbsp;Brown and Sieg
[<a href="#63">63</a>] found that in
interior forest sites at Jewel Cave National Monument, South Dakota, fire return
intervals from the 1500s to the late 1800s averaged 20 to 24 years, with a range
of 1 to 93 years. Fire return intervals at savanna sites in Wind
Cave National Park, South Dakota, averaged 10 to 12 years, with a range of 2 to
23 years. The fire return interval of interior ponderosa pine savannas is the shortest documented
for northern interior ponderosa pine ecosystems, and is similar to the short-return
intervals of interior ponderosa pine forests in the Southwest.</p>

<p>Invasion
of interior ponderosa pine onto grasslands, and increased tree density in
formerly open savanna, is thought to be largely attributable to reduced fire
frequency, although grazing has probably contributed to increased interior ponderosa pine
density on forest and grassland margins [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>]. A little less than one-half of interior ponderosa pine in the Black Hills are single-storied, even-aged stands that developed after crown fires or mountain pine beetle epidemics
[<a href="#7">7</a>].&nbsp; &quot;Dog-hair&quot; interior ponderosa pine thickets are
common on many sites [<a href="#50">50</a>].</p>

<p>Colorado: A fire history study of a 10,000-acre (4000 ha) interior ponderosa pine-Rocky Mountain
Douglas-fir site in central Colorado showed a pattern of frequent surface fires
from 1197 to 1851. Large stand-replacement fires were rare, but several landscape-level fires
are documented. Intervals between fire years ranged from 1 to
128 years
at&nbsp; the landscape scale and from 1 to 58 years for individual stands. Fires
occurred throughout the growing season. Fire size varied across time; for
example, numerous small fires occurred in the 1500s, while landscape-level
fires occurred in 1631, 1696, and 1723. After 1723, there were few fires until
1851; that fire was a stand-replacement, mixed crown and severe surface fire that covered most of the
landscape. There have been no extensive fires in the study area since 1851, and
most stands have not experienced fire for nearly 100 years [<a href="#61">61</a>].</p>

<p>Utah: Fire history studies
show a range of 3 to 47 years for interior ponderosa pine in southern Utah
[<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#209">209</a>,<a href="#272">272</a>]. Studies in Zion National Park
show
a presettlement fire frequency range of 3 to 12 years for interior ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests. All study sites had experienced fire at least once a decade
[<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#209">209</a>].
Large fires that burned more than 1,000 acres (400 ha) occurred nearly every 3 years on the
Horse Pasture Plateau. Fire return intervals declined greatly in the Park
beginning in the&nbsp; late 1800s, when the study sites were subject to intense
livestock grazing and grassy fuels were sparse. Although grazing has not been
practiced in the Park for over half a century, fire events remained infrequent under fire exclusion
[<a href="#209">209</a>].</p>

<p>
Nebraska: Bragg [<a href="#56">56</a>] evaluated fire frequency for upland interior ponderosa pine-bur
oak forest adjacent to sandhills prairie. He found a mean fire return interval of 3.5 years
from 1851 to 1900, and a mean of 8.5 years for 1901 to 1950. Without the
frequent fires that killed the seedlings, upland interior
ponderosa pine has invaded sandhills prairie communities [<a href="#176">176</a>].</p>

<p>Texas: A fire history
study in mixed
interior ponderosa pine-Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir-southwestern white pine in
Guadalupe Mountain National Park showed a mean return interval between major
fires of 17 years prior to the 1920s; mean return interval for all fires
detected between 1696 and 1922 was 4.7 years. Evidence of fire scarring was not
found after 1922. Portions of the montane forest have a 2-tiered structure of
overstory interior ponderosa pine and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, and dog-hair thickets of ponderosa pine
and Douglas-fir saplings in the understory [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>].</p>

<p>
New Mexico: Swetnam and Dieterich [<a href="#286">286</a>] found that extensive surface fires were
common in the Gila Wilderness of southwestern New Mexico before 1900. Mean fire
return interval from 1633 to 1900 was 4 to 8 years, with a range of 1 to 26
years. Most fires burned throughout the 40.5-hectare study sites, although a few
fires appeared to be smaller. Fire history was similar in northern New Mexico,
with extensive high-frequency, low-severity surface fires in low-elevation (&lt;
5,545 feet (1690 m)) interior ponderosa pine forests and less frequent surface
fires, along with some patchy crown fires, in higher-elevation mixed-conifer
Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir-interior ponderosa pine-white fir forest. Across sites, the minimum
fire interval for major fires (&gt; 10% of trees scarred) in interior ponderosa
pine before 1900 ranged from 1 to 9 years; maximum fire interval for major fires
ranged from 16 to 51 years (m=9.4 years). In mixed-conifer forests where interior ponderosa pine was codominant, minimum and
maximum fire interval ranges were 1 to 4 and 21 to 46 years, respectively
(m=10.4 years). Fires were rare in interior ponderosa and mixed-conifer forest
after the 1850s. The authors attribute the initial drop in fire frequency to
domestic sheep grazing by the Navajos, and by the 1900s, to fire exclusion by
European-Americans [<a href="#292">292</a>].</p>

<p>
Arizona: The sky islands of southeastern Arizona have among the
highest incidences of lightning-caused fires in the United States [<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#260">260</a>].  The lightning fire season begins in 
late April, peaks in June, and runs into October. Maximum lightning fire
incidence is above 6,000 feet (1800 m): directly within the interior ponderosa pine zone
[<a href="#29">29</a>]. Prior to the 1880s, surface fires burned through ponderosa pine sky islands once or twice a decade, but occurred 
at highly variable intervals. Fires were somewhat less frequent in higher-elevation, mixed-conifer forests
[<a href="#281">281</a>].
Swetnam and others [<a href="#282">282</a>] reported a 9- to 22-year range (m=14.6) for
presettlement fire return intervals in interior ponderosa pine-Douglas fir
in Chiricahua National Monument.&nbsp;Fire frequency in interior ponderosa pine-Arizona pine forests in southeastern 
Arizona was greatly reduced after Euro-American
settlement in the 1870s. Intense livestock overgrazing coupled with fire exclusion caused both the number of fires and 
the area burned to decline dramatically
[<a href="#238">238</a>].</p>


<p>
Historical fire frequency in the interior ponderosa pine-encinal oak woodland interface has been documented at least 1 fire per
decade [<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#174">174</a>]. In interior ponderosa pine-oak
woodlands of the Rincon Mountain
Wilderness, fire regime was dominated by large-scale (> 500 acre (200 ha)), early-season (May-July) surface fires. 
Mean fire return interval from 1657 to 1893 was 6.1 years, with a range of 1 to 13 years.
From 1748 to 1996, mean fire return interval in the high-elevation mixed-conifer type
was 9.9 years, with a range of 3 to 19 years [<a href="#30">30</a>].</p>

<p>There are many western plant
communities and ecosystems in which interior ponderosa pine is either dominant, an important
component of the vegetation, or an invader. Historic fire return intervals for these communities
and ecosystems are summarized
below. Please refer to the Fire Effects Information System report on the dominant species listed here for further 
information on fire regimes in these communities and ecosystems.</p>

IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT:</a>
</span>
<br />

The effect of fire is related to tree size, fire severity, and stand density
[<a href="#7">7</a>]. Low-severity surface fires usually kill trees less than 3 to 5 years of age or
less than 6 inches (15 cm) dbh, and
mortality in the 6- to 30-inch (15-76 cm) dbh class is not unusual
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#316">316</a>,<a href="#323">323</a>]. Researchers in Zion National
Park, Utah, found surviving 10-year-old interior ponderosa pine seedlings that were scarred from low-severity surface
fire [<a href="#64">64</a>]. Trees in dense stands and trees infected with southwestern dwarf-mistletoe
are most susceptible to mortality, particularly in the smaller size classes.
Pole-sized and larger trees are resistant to low-severity surface fires. Thick
bark affords protection against cambial damage, and foliage and buds are usually
elevated away from the flame zone.&nbsp; However, intense radiant heat produced
by moderate-severity fire, or flames that reach buds, can damage or kill mature
trees. Severe
surface or crown fires
generally kill interior ponderosa pine of all size classes [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#316">316</a>,<a href="#323">323</a>], although some sawtimber-sized trees may survive severe
surface fire [<a href="#66">66</a>].&nbsp; Heavy
accumulations of litter at the base of trees increase the duration and intensity
of fire, making trees more susceptible to scarring. Resin deposits around an
old &quot;cat-face&quot; may increase bark flammability and promote further
injury [<a href="#55">55</a>].

<p>On the
Coconino National Forest, a mixed-severity wildfire on 7-9 May 1972 killed
about 1/4th of the standing interior ponderosa pine where surface
fire severity was moderate. Mortality was greatest in the smaller diameter classes: 90% of&nbsp;
&quot;pulpwood&quot; and 7% of&nbsp; &quot;sawtimber&quot; were killed by moderate-severity fire. Approximately
2/3rds of the trees were killed where severe surface or crown fire occurred.
Ninety percent of pulpwood and 50% of sawtimber were killed where fire was
severe. The summer after the fire, basal area was 211 ft<sup>2</sup>/acre (47.5
m<sup>2</sup>/ha) on an adjacent unburned area; 103 ft<sup>2</sup>/acre (23 m<sup>2</sup>/ha)
on the moderate burn; and 40 ft<sup>2</sup>/acre (9 m<sup>2</sup>/ha) on the
severe burn [<a href="#66">66</a>].

<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT">
DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT:</a>
</span>
<br />

With its high foliar moisture content, interior ponderosa pine can withstand
extensive scorching as long as bud and twigs, which tolerate higher temperatures
than needles, are not badly scorched [<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#258">258</a>,<a href="#323">323</a>]. Ponderosa pine may
recover from as much as 90% scorching as long as 50% of buds and twigs survive
to maintain shoot growth on defoliated branches [<a href="#323">323</a>]. Extensive scorching of ponderosa pine crowns may cause mortality within 3 postfire years
[<a href="#142">142</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>]. Generally, ponderosa pine recovery is best
after dormant-season scorching; trees scorched in the growing season show poorer
survivorship [<a href="#142">142</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>]. After a growing-season (July)
wildfire in northern Arizona, Herman [<a href="#158">158</a>] noted at least 65%
survival for trees greater than 8 inches (20 cm) dbh that had less than 60%
crown scorch, while Dieterich [<a href="#94">94</a>] observed 89% recovery of 6 to 14-inch
(15-36 cm) dbh trees that had been up to 90% scorched by dormant-season
(November) wildfire on the Coconino National Forest.&nbsp;Studies of postfire
survivorship after scorching show mixed results, however. Davis and others [<a href="#89">89</a>] reported that more than 75% of
ponderosa pines (5- to 11-inch (13-28 cm) dbh class) scorched more than 67% died
within 2 years following a dormant-season (October) prescribed fire on the
Coconino National Forest.

<p>
Dormant-season studies indicate that bud kill, which is related to fire
season, is more important than foliage kill in determining chances of ponderosa
pine survival after burning [<a href="#142">142</a>,<a href="#301">301</a>,<a href="#302">302</a>].
Wagener [<a href="#302">302</a>] and Harrington [<a href="#144">144</a>]&nbsp;found the minimum requirement for ponderosa pine survival was 90% or
less scorch with 50% or more of bud and twigs remaining. Five years after
prescribed burning on the San Juan National Forest of Colorado, Harrington [<a href="#144">144</a>] found
significant (p=0.05) differences in mortality of scorched interior ponderosa pine, depending upon season of burning. Mortality was lowest for
fall-scorched trees (5%), and spring-scorched trees showed less mortality than
summer-scorched trees (17 vs. 21%, respectively). Ninety percent of fire-damaged
interior ponderosa pine that died had done so by postfire year 4. Most
trees greater than 7.2 inches (18 cm) diameter survived fall burning even with
90% scorching. With spring and summer burning, trees less than 4 inches (10 cm)
diameter died with greater than 50% scorching, while at least 90% scorching was
required before trees larger than 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter were killed by spring or
summer fire [<a href="#142">142</a>].</p>

<p class="subframeText"><font face="Bell MT"><b>Mortality m</b></font><font face="Bell MT"><b>odels:</b></font>
 McHugh and Kolb [<a href="#217">217</a>] found a model using total crown damage by fire (scorch +
consumption) and bole char severity as independent variables gave the best 2-way
variable model for predicting individual tree mortality for prescribed and
wildfires in northern Arizona. A study on the Colorado Front Range found that crown scorch, expressed as a
percentage of the prefire live crown length, was the best determinant of
postfire mortality of interior ponderosa pine [<a href="#318">318</a>]. Wyant and Zimmerman [<a href="#319">319</a>] found that degree of crown scorch and tree size
was the most effective
predictors of postfire survival potential after September prescribed burning in
Colorado. They provide a model for estimating mortality based upon percent crown
scorch and dbh.&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Mortality studies:</b></font> Harrington and Hawksworth
[<a href="#148">148</a>] conducted prescribed burning treatments to
interior ponderosa pine on the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona.
They found that mortality generally increased with decreasing tree size and
increasing crown scorch, bole char, and southwestern dwarf-mistletoe infection. Trees with
greater than 87% crown scorch experienced 100% mortality, even in the 30- to
36-inch (76-92 cm) size class. Severe bole char resulted in 67% mortality. Mortality by
size class is indicated in the leftmost section of the graph below.</p>

<p>On the Coconino National Forest, the general effect of a
3 October prescribed fire was a thinning from below and a 70% reduction in duff.
No interior ponderosa pine less than 4.5 inches (10 cm) tall survived the fall fire. Mortality was
less in pole-sized and larger trees. Severely
damaged trees died within 2 years. Percent damage and postfire mortality of interior ponderosa pine
by size class* and fire severity are given below [<a href="#89">89</a>].

<a name="PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE">
PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Fire prepares a mineral soil seedbed favorable to interior ponderosa pine
regeneration [<a href="#133">133</a>,<a href="#275">275</a>,<a href="#323">323</a>]. Germinants require mineral soil
so the emerging root radicle immediately contacts soil moisture [<a href="#323">323</a>]. On the Fort Valley Experimental Forest near Flagstaff,
moisture in the upper 2 inches (5 cm) of soil was consistently greater on burned sites
than on unburned sites. Plots were seeded to interior ponderosa pine 4
weeks after a November prescribed fire. The 1st postfire growing season was
droughty, and although overall seedling establishment was poor, it was
significantly greater (p=0.05) on burned than on unburned plots. Of 62 surviving seedlings,
95% (59 seedlings) were on burned plots, and 5% (3 seedlings) were on unburned
plots [<a href="#133">133</a>]. A study on the Coconino National Forest showed a frequency of 90%
for natural regeneration the year following moderate-severity prescribed surface
fire. At
postfire year 12, frequency of interior ponderosa pine regeneration had
dropped to 25% on burned plots. Adjacent unburned plots showed no seedling establishment during
the 12 years of the study [<a href="#111">111</a>].

<p>Mature interior ponderosa pine may show increased growth following
low-severity surface fires. Following prescribed fall burning on the Front Range
of Colorado, mean fascicle lengths and bud sizes (length and diameter) were
significantly greater (p &lt; 0.01) on trees that received burning treatment
than on trees on unburned control sites. Sutherland and others [<a href="#279">279</a>] present a linear regression
model to predict postfire radial growth of southwestern ponderosa pine after
prescribed fire.</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE">
DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE:</a>
</span>
<br />

The open canopy created by frequent fire produces
physiological and morphological changes that significantly increased interior ponderosa pine's resistance to bark beetles and foliar
insects, increased nutrient uptake, and promoted growth on a northern Arizona
site. These changes occur even
in old growth. A year following thinning and prescribed
burning near Flagstaff, resin flow was higher in presettlement
trees (established before 1876) on burned plots compared to presettlement trees on
untreated control plots, with flows of 12.2 mL/24 h and 3.6 mL/24 h,
respectively. Foliar toughness,
which&nbsp; increases resistance to pine sawflies, was greater on burned compared to control
plots (76 vs. 69.8 g tension).
Trees on burned plots also had greater leaf nitrogen content (1.59 vs. 1.44 g/m<sup>2</sup>)
and showed more basal area growth&nbsp; (20.7 vs. 14.3 cm<sup>2</sup>) on burned
than on control plots. Thinning without burning produced similar changes in tree
physiology and morphology, except that with a mean resin flow of 4.3 milliliters per
day,
presettlement trees on plots that were thinned but not burned developed less
resistance to bark beetles than trees on thinned and burned plots [<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>].

<a name="FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Current fire return intervals are greater than the
historical range of variability for ponderosa pine forests. Magnitude of fire decline is
greater at lower than higher elevations, which may aid managers in determining
where management actions to reduce fuels and restore more natural fire regimes
might be of highest priority [<a href="#298">298</a>].&nbsp; Millions of acres of forest burns in the western United States during fire years. Roughly half of
those acres are in ponderosa pine. The expense of excluding fire from ponderosa
pine forests in an active fire year can easily exceed a billion dollars, and
these costly attempts at fire suppression are not always successful. In
comparison, treatments to restore ponderosa pine structure and ecological
processes are modest in cost [<a href="#19">19</a>].

<p>Thinning to remove small-diameter trees, accompanied by
prescribed fire, has been suggested as a means of restoring structure and
function to degraded ponderosa pine ecosystems [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#140">140</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#255">255</a>,<a href="#306">306</a>].
Frequent low-severity surface fires restore ecosystem function by thinning dense
stands and reducing woody debris and other organic matter on the forest floor.
This can result in increased soil
moisture, increased soil
temperature (with accompanying rates of increased litter decomposition, soil
nutrient cycling, and fine root growth), increased productivity of understory
herbs and shrubs, increased basal diameter growth of overstory ponderosa pine,
and favorable seedbeds [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>]. Fire-pruning of lower pine branches opens the canopy,
aiding production of wildlife shrubs such as snowberry and chokecherry [<a href="#128">128</a>]. Frequent prescribed fires
reduce fire hazard without damaging overstory ponderosa pine&nbsp;[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].
Biswell [<a href="#43">43</a>] listed several ways in which prescribed burning reduces wildfire
hazard in interior ponderosa pine:

<p>If several fire cycles have been missed,
thinning presettlement trees and manually removing heavy fuels from the base of
large trees may be necessary to in order to protect old growth from severe
scorching or death [<a href="#76">76</a>]. Harrington [<a href="#144">144</a>] recommends growing-season (spring or
summer) burning in interior ponderosa pine forests if the management objective is
thinning from below, and fall prescribed burning if stand losses must
be minimized. Weather parameters for prescribed burning in southwestern
ponderosa pine [<a href="#149">149</a>], and a logistic regression model predicting probability of interior ponderosa pine
mortality by tree size, scorch class, and season of
injury are available [<a href="#142">142</a>].</p>

<p> Allen and others [<a href="#9">9</a>] provide ecologically based recommendations for
restoring southwestern ponderosa pine. They stress that restoration programs
should include natural variability in southwestern ponderosa pine stands and the
reestablishment of natural processes. Managers are encouraged to fully review
their recommendations. A synopsis of their principles for restoration follows
[<a href="#9">9</a>]:</p>

   <ul>
    <li>Reduce the threat of crown fire</li>
    <li>Prioritize and strategically target treatment areas</li>
    <li>Develop site-specific reference (historical) conditions</li>
    <li>Implement multiple, conservative treatments</li>
    <li>Utilize and incorporate existing forest structure</li>
    <li>Restore ecosystem composition</li>
    <li>Retain trees of significant size or age</li>
    <li>Consider demographic processes (regeneration pulses)</li>
    <li>Integrate ecological processes and stand structure</li>
    <li>Control and avoid using exotic species</li>
    <li>Foster regional heterogeneity</li>
    <li>Protect sensitive species</li>
    <li>Assess cumulative effects</li>
    <li>Protect from overgrazing</li>
    <li>Establish monitoring and research programs</li>
    <li>Implement long-term, adaptive management</li>
   </ul>

<p>Swetnam and Dieterich [<a href="#286">286</a>] recommend allowing large
(&gt; 3000 acres (1200 ha)) prescribed natural surface fires in southwestern ponderosa
pine in wilderness areas such as the Gila Wilderness. Based upon their fire
history research, which showed evidence of mostly extensive but also small
fires, they also recommend allowing small and patchy mixed-severity fires in
approved areas, subject to the limitations of wilderness boundaries, visitor
safety, and management and suppression capabilities.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Mixed and stand-replacing fire:</b></font> High-elevation interior ponderosa
pine forests were historically denser, with lower fire frequencies and greater
severities, than lower-elevation
forests. Even at low elevations, north-facing slopes and mesic ravines probably
supported dense forests that experienced occasional mixed and stand-replacing fires. Evidence of a
mixed regime of frequent surface fires and occasional mixed or stand-replacement fires suggests that a single prescription cannot capture historical variability of
fire regimes in interior ponderosa pine types [<a href="#298">298</a>].</p>

<p>Historical occurrence of large, widespread prehistoric fires in
interior ponderosa pine demonstrates the potential for large portions of montane
zones to burn during a single year. Interannual climatic variability,
particularly El Nino-La Nina events, can greatly
increase fine fuels. Fuels management through thinning and prescribed burning reduces
the probability of widespread wildfire in most years, but it is uncertain that
low to moderate levels of fuels management will reduce fire hazard enough to
prevent stand-replacing fire during years when the weather is exceptionally
conducive to rapid fire spread.&nbsp; It may be helpful for public education programs
on fire hazard reduction to emphasize that although frequent surface fires were
most common in interior ponderosa pine stands, mixed and stand-replacement fires
did occur in prehistoric times, and that during years of high fire hazard,
stand-replacement fires may occur again despite fuels reduction programs [<a href="#298">298</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Fuels: </b></font> Fuel loads in pole-sized thickets of interior ponderosa pine
can be high. Ponderosa pine's long needles form a loose
litter layer that burns readily [<a href="#246">246</a>]. Near Flagstaff, fuels averaged 28.3 tons
per acre (63.4 t/ha), 21.3 tons (19.2 t) of which was duff [<a href="#77">77</a>].&nbsp;
Eakle and Wagle [<a href="#100">100</a>] provide a model, developed on the Fort Apache Reservation,
for estimating fine fuels in southwestern ponderosa pine stands. Harrington
[<a href="#145">145</a>] presents a model for estimating forest floor consumption in southwestern
ponderosa pine forest based upon moisture content of the H surface soil layer.</p>

<p> Beaufait [<a href="#37">37</a>] found that backfires in ponderosa pine needles spread more slowly and had less 
flame depth, longer residence time, and a higher rate of energy release than headfires.</p>

<p> Boldt [<a href="#51">51</a>] provides prescriptions for thinning pole-sized &quot;dog-hair&quot; 
thickets of interior ponderosa pine using sequential treatments. Additional 
information on thinning &quot;dog-hair&quot; stands is found in Sackett and others 
[<a href="#254">254</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b> 
Range: </b></font> Prescribed fire can enhance understory forage production by reducing forest floor depth, tree density, and allelopathic toxins, and by increasing nutrient availability
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>]. On the Fort Apache Reservation in Arizona, Gambel
oak had reached mid-story in an interior ponderosa pine forest. Prescribed surface fires at 5- to 7-year intervals reduced Gambel oak to an
understory shrub that was&nbsp; readily available to browsing animals. Coverage
of the dominant grass, mountain muhly, increased under the prescribed burning regime [<a href="#43">43</a>].</p>

<p> Pearson and others [<a href="#234">234</a>] reported that on the Wild Bill Range of Arizona, an area of interior ponderosa pine
that had been thinned to 20 square feet basal area per
acre (4.5 m<sup>2</sup>/ha) did not show a significant reduction in density following a wildfire. The fire
crowned and killed the trees in an adjacent unthinned stand, however. Forage production increased as much as
578 pounds per acre (650 kg/ha) from prefire levels on sites were
stand-replacement fire occurred, while pre- and postfire forage production were
similar on thinned and burned sites.</p>

<p>Wild ungulate foraging, especially that of bighorn sheep, increased after late April
prescribed fire in a interior ponderosa pine/sedge-bluegrass (<i>Carex-Poa</i>
spp.) community in Custer State Park, South Dakota. Grass production did not
increase after the fire, but forb production was significantly increased (p &lt;
0.01) on burned compared to unburned sites [<a href="#102">102</a>].</p>

<p>October prescribed burning brought a 2-fold increase in
nitrogen content of Arizona fescue and associated grasses on an interior ponderosa pine/Arizona 
fescue community on the Fort Valley Experimental Forest
near Flagstaff. Concentrations of potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium
were also generally greater in forb and grass species on burned plots than in
herbs on unburned control plots. Understory biomass was significantly (p &lt; 0.05)
greater on burned plots. The 1st fall after burning, understory yield was twice
as great on burned plots compared to unburned plots [<a href="#150">150</a>].</p>

<p>Overgrazing can greatly reduce fire frequency by
removing understory fuels. Fire history studies of southwestern ponderosa
pine document the near-cessation of fire in the mid-1800s due to livestock
grazing in Arizona and New Mexico [<a href="#292">292</a>,<a href="#293">293</a>].</p>

<p>Exclusion of the recurrent fires that once swept the
interior ponderosa pine-plains grasslands interface has resulted in interior
ponderosa pine invasion into the grassland. Expansion is likely to continue without
application of prescribed fire [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#273">273</a>].</p>

<p>Since fire kills interior ponderosa pine seedlings and
some saplings, prescribed fire can be used to reduce the density of encroaching pines. Late-April 
fire in little bluestem-hairy grama-sideoats
grama in the Black Hills of South Dakota caused 79% mortality of pine seedlings.
Mean density of interior ponderosa pine seedlings was 8,132 per acre (3251/ha) before the
fire and 1,669 per acre (4173/ha) in late summer, after burning. The fire
reduced ground fuels by 32% [<a href="#123">123</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Wildlife:</b></font> 
Fire benefits the majority of wildlife species inhabiting interior ponderosa pine
ecosystems. Among bird species, fires in interior ponderosa pine tend to increase guilds
that use open stands and snags. On the Prescott National
Forest in Arizona, a stand-replacement burn in interior ponderosa pine attracted relatively more 
granivores, aerial insectivores such as
flycatchers, and bark-feeding insectivores such as woodpeckers, while unburned areas attracted
more ground and foliage insectivores [<a href="#47">47</a>].&nbsp;A 20-year wildlife study
on 4 stand-replacement burns near Flagstaff had similar findings for birds. Most
rodent species, except chipmunks, also increased on burned interior ponderosa pine
sites relative to adjacent unburned control sites. Wild ungulate
use increased greatly on burned sites compared to unburned sites. Mule deer use
of burned sites declined at postfire year 1, but&nbsp; increased to 2.5 times
that of unburned sites for the next 19 years. Elk use also dropped at postfire
year 1 relative to unburned sites, but increased to 3 times that of controls
until postfire year 20, when use of burned and unburned sites was nearly equal.
Elk use of the burns peaked at postfire year 7 [<a href="#203">203</a>].</p>

<p>Availability of interior ponderosa pines as nesting
sites for cavity-nesters, particularly secondary cavity-nesters, is limited due
to the scarcity of large, old-growth trees. Brawn and Balda [<a href="#59">59</a>] reported that
violet-green swallow, pygmy nuthatch, and western bluebird populations increased
after artificial nest boxes were placed in open and thinned plots, but not on
untreated (dense) plots. Prescribed underburning that leaves large trees
may encourage nesting.&nbsp;Prescribed fire in interior ponderosa pine of Wind Cave National Park, South
    Dakota, significantly&nbsp; (p&lt; 0.05) increased the number of breeding bird
pairs and deer mice on burned sites compared to unburned control sites [<a href="#49">49</a>].&nbsp;Creating small 
openings with prescribed fire may
also promote nesting. Aulenbach and O'Shea-Stone [<a href="#27">27</a>] noted differential songbird use of
burned sites created by a small, crowning wildfire compared to adjacent unburned
sites in interior ponderosa pine on the
Front Range of Colorado. Several species including red-breasted nuthatch, chipping sparrow, yellow-rumped 
warbler, and northern flicker occurred only on the burn. American robin,
Steller's jay, and dark-eyed junco preferred the burn but 
used the control, while pygmy nuthatch, downy woodpecker, white-breasted 
nuthatch, and mountain chickadee occurred only on the unburned site.
</p>

Standing time of interior ponderosa pine snags is
somewhat predictable. Harrington [<a href="#146">146</a>] found
that 75% of fire-killed interior ponderosa pine snags on the San Juan National
Forest of southwestern Colorado fell within 10 postfire years. Fall rates were
not significantly different (p=0.1) among trees 2 to 16 inches (5-41 cm) dbh, but large trees that died
quickly after 80% or greater crown scorch were likely to fall more quickly,
while large trees that survived 2 or 3 postfire years before succumbing were likely to
remain standing for longer periods of time.

Slopes above the study sites were forested with interior ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus
ponderosa</i> var. <i>scopulorum</i>); lower slopes were mixed plains grasslands composed of&nbsp;sedges (<i>Carex</i> spp.), big bluestem (<i>Andropogon gerardii</i> var. <i>gerardii</i>),
little bluestem, (<i>Schizachyrium scoparium</i>), Sandberg bluegrass (<i>Poa
secunda</i>), blue, hairy, and sideoats grama (<i>Bouteloua gracilis, B.
hirsuta, B. curtipendula</i>), and western wheatgrass (<i>Pascopyrum smithii</i>).
The study site was a mosaic of interior ponderosa pine savanna and interior
ponderosa pine forest with an understory of graminoids and shrubs. Important
shrubs on the study site were western snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos occidentalis</i>),
currant (<i>Ribes </i>spp.), chokecherry (<i>Prunus virginiana</i>), leadplant (<i>Amorpha
canescens</i>), and Saskatoon serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier alnifolia</i>).
Based upon dendrochronological analysis, presettlement fire return interval at the
Park was 13 to 21 years. Before prescribed fire treatments, mean interior
ponderosa pine density on study plots was 3.2 stems/17 m<sup>2 </sup>(~762
trees/acre); most of
those trees on study plots were saplings less than 4 inches (10 cm) dbh [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].

<br />

The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of cool-season fires on
woody vegetation at the interior ponderosa pine-grassland ecotone. Objectives
were: (1) determine if prescribed fire increases understory shrub and tree
density, (2) quantify mortality of immature interior ponderosa pine on the
ecotone, and (3) determine if prescribed fires had consistent and predictable
results throughout the study area. 

<p>
Two cool-season fires were conducted. The fall fire was a 157-acre (63 ha) burn on 17
October 1979. The fire was set at mid-day and passed over the area in 4 hours. A
few snags smoldered until the next morning, when it started raining. Fire
weather conditions were [<a href="#49">49</a>]:
</p>

windspeed 10 miles/h (16 km/h)<br>
temperature 57.9 <sup>o</sup>Fahrenheit (14.4 <sup>o</sup>C)<br>
relative humidity: 45%<br>
soil/fuel moisture: 4-29%

<p>The spring fire was an 815-acre (326 ha) burn on 14 April 1980. The fire was set at
10:30 a.m. and burned most of area within control lines within 36 hours. It was
declared out on 15 May 1980. Fire
weather conditions were [<a href="#49">49</a>]:</p>

windspeed: 5 miles/h (8 km/h)<br>
temperature: 57 <sup>o</sup>Fahrenheit (14 <sup>o</sup>C)<br>
relative humidity: 32%<br>
soil/fuel moisture: 21-36%

<p>The effects of the 2 fires were similar, so pre- and postfire litter and vegetation data
were pooled for the 2 sites. Litter depth averaged 1.61 inches (4.02 cm) before fire [<a href="#49">49</a>].</p>

Interior ponderosa pine canopies, trunks, and saplings were reduced through the
2 postfire years of the study. Nearly all pines less than&nbsp;4.6 feet (1.4 m)
tall were killed. Among taller trees, most mortality was in trees less than 2
inches (5
cm) dbh. Pine canopy was reduced 12% by the fires. Changes in percent interior ponderosa pine cover over

<br />

The study demonstrates that prescribed spring or fall fire can control interior
ponderosa pine encroaching plains grasslands. Outcome of the study objectives,
listed by number above, follow. (1) A single fire treatment had little effect on
the density of shrubs and deciduous understory trees. Overall shrub cover was reduced in
the 1st but not the 2nd postfire year [<a href="#49">49</a>]. Density of currants was reduced and
leadplant increased, but density of other shrubs was unaffected by fire. Overall graminoid cover was
also unaffected by
burning, although species showed different responses. (2) The prescribed fires
reduced fuels and dramatically slowed interior ponderosa pine invasion and
recruitment. (3) The prescribed fires gave consistent and predictable results
across the study areas. Grassland fires are more predictable than fires in woody
vegetation [<a href="#50">50</a>]. The Bocks' hypothesis of consistent and predictable results was also borne out in an earlier Wind Cave National Park study by Gartner and
Thompson [<a href="#123">123</a>].

The study sites were in an interior ponderosa pine/Gambel oak (<i>Pinus
ponderosa</i> var. <i>scopulorum</i>/<i>Quercus gambelii</i>) stand. A fire history study
showed that the last fire occurred in the stand in 1877. Prior to 1877, fires burned at 1- to 16-year intervals [<a href="#141">141</a>],
and stand structure was presumably open. Pretreatment stand
structure in 1977 was a dense overstory of pole-sized pines, and a dense understory of
shrubby oaks. Herbaceous species and shrubs other than Gambel oak were sparse. 
Tree density was 300 per acre (750 trees/ha); basal area averaged
124 square feet per acre (28 m<sup>2</sup>/ha). Size class distribution of interior ponderosa 
pine was [<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>]:<br><br>

The study objective was to compare interior ponderosa pine mortality resulting
from crown scorch incurred during fall, spring, and summer prescribed surface
fires. Tree scorch classes, defined as the percentage of total crown height on
all sides of the tree in which foliage was killed, were 10-30%, 34-66%, 67-89,
90-98%, 99%, and 100%. Study trees were monitored for 5 postfire years. In order to
avoid the interactive effects of cambium and crown scorch damage, tree with
boles that were charred enough to sustain damage to the cambium were not
included in the study [<a href="#141">141</a>].

The management objective was to reduce the density of understory Gambel oak with
2nd-year reburns.
Treatment effects to Gambel oak are summarized in the Fire Case Studies section
of the FEIS report on that species.

<p>At the end of 5 years, overall interior ponderosa
pine mortality from fall
crown scorch was significantly less (p=0.05) than that from spring or summer.
Tree mortality equaled 12, 26, and 29% for fall, spring, and summer fires,
respectively. Differences in mortality between seasons were most substantial
during the 1st postfire season: only 5% of fall-scorched trees died, compared
with 17% of spring-scorched trees and 21% of summer-scorched trees. Subsequent
mortality for all seasons was relatively similar over the length of the study,
suggesting good survival potential for those trees not killed outright by scorching.
Generally mortality decreased as d.b.h. increased regardless of season. Trees
less than 7 inches (17.5 cm) d.b.h. accounted for approximately 85% of the
observed mortality. Mortality from fall burns was comparable to that recorded on
the control plots. Mortality in trees in the &lt; 4-inch and 7 to 10.9-inch
d.b.h. classes was significantly greater on spring and summer burn plots than on fall
burn and unburned plots. Percent mortality of scorched trees by diameter class
and season of fire is given below. Means in rows followed by different letters
differ at the 5% significance level. Means in columns followed by different
numbers differ at the 5% level [<a href="#144">144</a>].

<p>Trees subjected to dormant-season burning were
resistant to severe crown scorch damage. Of those trees
sustaining 100% damage, only 10 of 28 (39%) ultimately died. All 8 trees sampled in the 7 to 10.9-inch (17.5-27.3 cm) category survived.
Harrington [<a href="#141">141</a>] cautioned that this resistance to fire mortality is demonstrated for
trees where crown scorch was the only type of fire damage recorded; such
extensive damage would probably be fatal when combined with bole damage.</p>

Fall burning is the best option if minimizing mortality in the smaller size
classes is a management objective; this is particularly true in burn units where
fuel concentrations are heavy. If management objectives include large reductions
in fuels or the elimination of undesirable understory brush species,
growing-season fire may be the most effective. Although trees are generally more
susceptible to fire damage during the growing season, most mortality due
exclusively to crown scorch occurs in the smaller size classes. Such mortality
can be beneficial if thinning from below is desired.

The study site was in an interior ponderosa pine/Arizona fescue (<i>Pinus
ponderosa</i> var. <i>scopulorum/Festuca arizonica</i>) forest. Interior ponderosa pine was the only overstory tree
species. Stand structure was small, even-aged groups in an
uneven-aged stand. Site index was 82, based&nbsp;on 100
years. Mean density of interior ponderosa pine on study sites was 39 per acre
(96/ha). Size class
distribution is presented below [<a href="#251">251</a>]:<p>Seedlings: &lt; 4.5 feet tall, 395
stems/acre (&lt; 1.4 m, 975 stems/ha)<br><br>
Saplings: 0.6 to 3.9 inches d.b.h., 1,114
stems/acre (1.5-9.9 cm d.b.h., 2,750 stems/ha), age = app. 57 years<br><br>
Poles: 4.0 to

<p> Relative tree cover on the experimental plots consisted of the following: sapling
17%; pole 62%, sawtimber 17.3%; small openings comprised
the remaining 3.7%. Irregular distribution of the pine understory
resulted in numerous grass-dominated openings [<a href="#251">251</a>]. Fendler's ceanothus (<i>Ceanothus</i>

Rainfall was below normal during the late summer and fall. The following
precipitation amounts were recorded at the fire site just prior to prescribed
burning on November 5, 1976:<br><br>
October 21 - 0.27 inch (69 mm)<br>
October 25 - 0.03 inch (8 mm).

<p>Ignition began at 5:30 p.m. and continued until 11:00 p.m.
Backing fires were used initially, but later in the evening when these ceased to
carry effectively, short strip headfires with 30 to 40 feet (9-12 m) between
strips were utilized. Although rate of spread approximated 4 to 6 feet per
minute (1.2-1.8 m/min), it sometimes increased to as much as 12 feet per minute
(3.7 m/min). Flame lengths in surface needles rarely exceeded 16 inches (40 cm).
Air temperature dropped from 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 <sup>o</sup>C) at 5:30 p.m. to 37
degrees Fahrenheit (3 <sup>o</sup>C) at 12:00 a.m., when most of the flaming combustion
was complete. Measured surface needle moisture content increased from 8
to 12% during the night as temperatures fell; similarly, ground fuel (F
&amp; H layers) moisture content of the forest floor increased from 10
to 19%. Glowing combustion in deep duff fuels continued for 2 to 3 days;
some large woody debris and stumps smoldered for up to 4 weeks. Forest floor
material less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter was reduced 63%; material
greater than 1 inch (2.5 cm) was reduced 69%. Mineral soil was exposed on
about 19% of the area, mostly around large mature trees and rotten logs. Pre-
and postfire fuel loads were as follows [<a href="#251">251</a>]:

FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES:</a>
</span>
<br />

Seedlings appeared soon after summer rains started in mid-July, 1977. High
seedling concentrations occurred under large, mature pines and near heavy fuel
accumulations where the forest floor layers had been completely consumed.
Although partial shade was provided by the overstory, charcoal chunks, and
unburned debris, seedlings appeared to be most frequent on the northeast side of
seed trees. Needles cast over the period from November to July covered seeds
with a fresh litter layer of 300 to 475 pounds/acre (268-424 kg/ha). In
comparison to unburned controls, burned areas produced better germination and
stocking; burns had approximately 2,600 seedlings/acre, with 38% of sample
quadrats stocked versus control plots where seedlings equaled 833
seedlings/acre with a 17% stocking. Germination was most
successful in areas where fire disturbance was most pronounced, and correlation
between quadrat bare area (feet<sup>2</sup>) for each burning treatment and
quadrats stocked with interior ponderosa pine seedlings was high (r=0.92). Number of
seedlings in relation to seedbed is presented below:<br><br>

Germination and initial establishment were excellent on burned areas despite
below normal precipitation during the spring and summer of 1977. The enhanced
survival under these conditions may have resulted from the improved moisture
relations, increased nutrient availability, and more favorable soil temperatures
associated with mineral soil seedbeds. However, subsequent mortality was quite
high due to the combined effects of drought, frost heaving, animal damage, and
interval burning (see below). By the fall of 1981, only 12% of tagged
seedlings (25 on each of 18 plots treatment plots and 8 on controls) remained. Survival of 4-year-old tagged seedlings on plots subjected to interval
burning was 6%; 19% of tagged seedlings survived on plots
receiving the initial treatment only. Probable cause of death (by %) of
seedlings&nbsp; selected 1 year after 1977 postfire germination is presented
below [<a href="#254">254</a>].

<p> Although very few sample seedlings were still alive by the
fall of 1980, many 1977 seedlings remained on treatment plots. As a result,
prior to interval burning in the fall of 1980, all seedlings on the 1-, 2-, and
4-year rotation plots were inventoried; a 100% inventory of 1977
seedlings on projected 6-, 8-, and 10-year rotations was done in the spring of 1981. Dry
burning conditions in the fall of 1980 created more intense fires than had
previously occurred during the study. Fireline intensities ranging between 260
to 650 btu/sec/fireline foot were produced on 4-year rotation plots, killing 94%
of 3-year-old seedlings. Reduced fuel accumulations on annual and
biennial plots produced less intense fires that resulted in 50 and 87% seedling mortality, respectively. Regardless of interval treatment, most
surviving seedlings were located in areas of sparse or discontinuous fuels.
Number of seedlings remaining from 1977 germination is
presented below by treatment [<a href="#254">254</a>].

FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS:</a>

<br />

Prescribed fire represents an effective means of site preparation for interior ponderosa pine establishment in the
Southwest, especially when regeneration is needed in dispersed, small openings
where hand planting is not cost effective. Despite abundant initial
establishment on mineral soil seedbeds created by burning, drought, frost
heaving, and animal damage still constituted obstacles to long-term
establishment. Seedbeds remained favorable for natural regeneration for at least
4 years after fire, allowing managers some leeway in attempting to
coordinate site preparation with good seed crop years. Burning can be
deferred for several years after germination so interior ponderosa pine seedlings
are large enough to resistant to surface fire damage. 

<p>Sackett and others [<a href="#254">254</a>] concluded that 4-year
interval burning was most effective for fire hazard reduction while protecting
the overstory. Annual burning or 2-year interval burning was highly successful because conditions were too damp for
light fuels, even though scarcity of fuels was not limiting.
Six-year rotations allowed fuels to build up to the point that overstory could
be damaged, and wildfires may be difficult to control under extreme fire weather
conditions. They noted that mullein (<i>Verbascum thapsus</i>), Dalamation
toadflax (<i>Linaria dalmatica</i>), and Cainville thistle (<i>Cirsium calcareum</i>) were most likely to invade severely burned sites, favoring
bases of large, old-growth snags as microsites [<a href="#255">255</a>].</p>
