<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Cow parsnip is a valuable forage species for livestock, deer, elk,
moose, and bear [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  In West Virginia cow parsnip provides
forage for livestock and deer [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Moose in Montana and Yellowstone
National Park eat cow parsnip [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  In low elevation riparian areas
it is an important food for grizzly bear, especially in the spring
[<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>].  In Glacier National Park, cow parsnip comprised 15
percent of grizzly bear total diet volume, spring through fall, in
1967-1971 and 1982-1985 [<a href="#43">43</a>].  In Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta,
grizzly feeding sites were examined from June to early August; 77
percent of the cropped umbelliferous plants were cow parsnip (stems,
petioles, and blossoms) [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Black bear in Alberta cow parsnip in
summer [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Yellow-bellied sapsuckers in Idaho ues cow parsnip as cover [<a href="#19">19</a>], and
Columbian sharp-tailed grouse use the black hawthorn-cow parsnip habitat
type as escape cover, especially in the winter [<a href="#50">50</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Cow parsnip is rated moderately good for erosion control, short-term
revegetation potential, and long-term revegetation potential [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Cow
parsnip has fair soil stabilization value if seeded in the fall in
quaking aspen, mountain brush, and subalpine herbland communities of
Intermountain rangelands [<a href="#72">72</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Native Americans of Alaska, British Columbia, the Great Plains, and
Arizona used cow parsnip for medicinal and nutritional purposes
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  Native Americans in Alaska ate the inside of stems raw
and boiled the roots to extract sugar [<a href="#39">39</a>].  In Arizona, the Apache ate
the young leaves and stems and used the roots to treat epilepsy [<a href="#42">42</a>].

Cow parsnip is planted as an ornamental [<a href="#38">38</a>].  

In the Great Plains cases of dermatitis have been reported in persons
who came in contact with the foliage of cow parsnip [<a href="#26">26</a>].  


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In Washington cow parsnip is sensitive to grazing and can be eliminated
from steppe vegetation if overgrazed [<a href="#13">13</a>].  In Colorado cow parsnip
decreases with grazing [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Cow parsnip is sensitive to soil
compaction or severe soil disturbances which may be caused by mechanical
scarification or trampling [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].

In high mountain ecosystems of Utah, cow parsnip should be broadcast or
drill-seeded in the fall at 1 to 2 pounds per acre in a mixed seeding
for best forage results [<a href="#38">38</a>].  

Parsnip webworm, a European-introduced herbivorous insect, feeds on
developing flowers and seeds of cow parsnip.  Floral herbivory can
decrease seed production by up to 40 percent and seed biomass 53 percent
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].
  
Cow parsnip appears to persist or increase after clearcutting [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>],
but to decrease after soil scarification [<a href="#87">87</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Heracleum lanatum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Cow parsnip is a native, perennial forb that grows from 3.3 to 10 feet
(1-3 m) tall [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>] and has broad, flat-topped umbels [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].  It
grows from a stout taproot or a cluster of fibrous roots [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].
Leaves are 8 to 20 inches (20-50 cm) long and wide [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].  The
egg-shaped fruit is 0.32 to 0.48 inch (8-12 mm) long and 0.24 to 0.36
(6-9 mm) wide [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].  


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Cow parsnip reproduces by seed [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  For successful germination in
the laboratory, seed should not be stored more than 3 years [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>].
Some flowers within an umbel only produce stamens, while others are
hermaphroditic.  Secondary umbels develop synchronously approximately 10
to 14 days after the primary umbel.  Hermaphroditic flower and seed
production may be increased by herbivory [<a href="#33">33</a>].

The potential for cow parsnip to regenerate vegetatively is not clear;
Cole and Trull [<a href="#9">9</a>] include cow parsnip in a group of plants that
"regenerate rapidly from subsurface adventitious buds."  


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Cow parsnip occurs in a variety of habitats including woodlands, forest
openings, grasslands, and riparian areas such as wet meadows, stream
terraces, alluvial benches, floodplains, and stream and lake margins
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].  It is commonly found growing in snow-maintained
disclimaxes such as avalanche chutes [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  Cow parsnip is a
facultative wetland species [<a href="#29">29</a>]; it grows best in moist, shaded areas
[<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>] but can also be found in open woodlands and clearings
[<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].

Cow parsnip grows best on moist to semiwet soils with good drainage
[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  It grows best on loam and sandy loam soils derived from
limestone and shale, but occurs on clay, clay loam, and gravelly
substrates as well [1531,65].

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Cow parsnip occurs in seral and climax communities.  It is shade
tolerant, but also grows in some open habitats [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  Cow
parsnip is a common understory species in quaking aspen community types,
which are often successional in subalpine forests of the Intermountain
region [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Cow parsnip is a member of the red alder (Alnus
rubra) association of Oregon that may be replaced in 30 to 50 years by
black cottonwood or in 30 to 70 years by grand fir (Abies grandis) [<a href="#31">31</a>].
The red-osier dogwood-cow parsnip community type of Utah and
southeastern Idaho is an early seral type that colonizes streambanks and
adjacent areas [<a href="#60">60</a>].  In the black hawthorn-cow parsnip habitat type of
Washington, cow parsnip can grow as well with or without the black
hawthorn canopy [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Cow parsnip occurs in climax aspen forests
throughout the Intermountain West, and in mature to climax subalpine
forests in Wyoming and Montana [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].

Studies of cow parsnip in clearcuts indicates that its response to
canopy removal is variable.  In northern Utah cow parsnip cover was
variable in both control and clearcut stands.  Early succession
following a 1974 clearcut of aspen communities (with no slash treatment)

The effects of clearcutting on wildlife habitat were studied in a moist
subalpine forest in central Colorado.  Understory cover of cow parsnip
before and after clearcutting (with no slash treatment) was [<a href="#12">12</a>]:

         before logging               years after logging (1978-1982)

In the subalpine fir/queencup beadlily habitat type in northwestern
Montana, cow parsnip occurs in a variety of disturbed and undisturbed
communities.  Relative frequency and average canopy cover of cow parsnip
were as follows [<a href="#87">87</a>]:  

                                           relative frequency    % cover

Snowchutes are "topographic climax" or disclimax communities that
produce an abundance of grizzly bear foods.  In subalpine fir/menziesia,
subalpine fir/queencup beadlily, and subalpine fir/smooth woodrush
habitat types, relative frequency/average precent canopy cover of cow
parsnip in snowchutes was 50/19, 65/13, and 75/6.2, respectively [<a href="#87">87</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Heracleum lanatum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Cow parsnip can occur throughout succession in moist or wet subalpine
fir-Engelmann spruce habitat types in Idaho and Wyoming.  These habitat
types have estimated average fire-free intervals of about 330 years.
Stands are susceptible to severe burns when drought occurs [<a href="#91">91</a>].  Cow
parsnip also occurs throughout succession in communities characterized
by more frequent fire, including quaking aspen [<a href="#93">93</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Heracleum lanatum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Cow parsnip is probably killed or top-killed by fire.  



<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Cow parsnip may benefit from both canopy removal and increased water
availability after tree cover is removed by fire.  Cow parsnip had
greater percent cover following both wildfire and clearcutting without
scarification (some stands broadcast burned) than after clearcutting
with scarification [<a href="#87">87</a>].  


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
NO-ENTRY
