<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Leucothoe racemosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Fetterbush is a small to large, widely branched, deciduous shrub [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].
It is prostrate to erect in form, reaching heights between 3 to 12 feet
(1.0 - 3.5 m).  The leaves are short, thin, and smooth with the smaller
leaves occurring on the twig among the larger leaves.  The short,
tubular flowers are borne in clusters at the end of the stems.  The
fruit is a five-part capsule that persists over the winter [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State: Phanerophyte (microphanerophyte)
   Undisturbed State: Phanerophyte (nanophanerophyte)


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Fetterbush reproduces vegetatively by sprouting from adventitious buds
on the roots following disturbance [<a href="#21">21</a>].  It also regenerates sexually,
although the details have not been described.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Fetterbush grows on a variety of sites in the coastal plains of the
southeastern United States but is restricted to climates with mild
winters and long, hot, humid summers.  It grows best in shrub-tree bogs,
cypress (Taxodium spp.)-gum (Nyssa spp.) depressions, along marshy
streambanks, and forest edges [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  It is an important shrub species
in pocosins [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].

Common overstory associates include swamp blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica var.
biflora), loblolly bay (Gordonia lasianthus), sweetbay (Persea
borbonia), red maple (Acer rubrum), titi (Cyrilla racemiflora), and
southern white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides).  Understory associates
include hurrahbush (Lyonia lucida), sweet pepperbush (Clethra alnifolia)
southern bayberry (Myrica cerifera), and laurelleaf greenbrier (Smilax
laurifolia) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Fetterbush is an early- to mid-seral species that is intolerant to shade
and grows best in full sunlight [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  In a southern white cedar
forest in southeastern North Carolina, fetterbush was present in the
intial stages after disturbance, gradually reduced in the middle-age
forest, and disappeared in the mature forest [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Fetterbush begins extensive growth in early March and peaks in growth in
early summer [<a href="#17">17</a>].  It flowers between April and June [<a href="#20">20</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Leucothoe racemosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fire does not usually invade the wetlands and lower slopes of the
floodplain because the soil and duff layers are usually very damp
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Shallow burns favor fetterbush because of its ability to
sprout quickly after aboveground portions of the plant are killed
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site survivng root crown or caudex
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by animals or water; postfire yr 1&2

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire typically top-kills aboveground portions of fetterbush [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Fetterbush will sprout from adventitious buds on the root following fire
[<a href="#4">4</a>].
