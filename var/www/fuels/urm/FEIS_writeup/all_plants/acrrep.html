GENERAL DISTRIBUTION:</a>
</span>
<br />

Russian knapweed is native to Mongolia, western Turkestan, Iran, Turkish Armenia,
and Asia Minor [<a href="#45">45</a>], and is found in
cultivated fields and dry pastures of the southern Ukraine, southeastern Russia,
and western Kazakhstan. It is considered a serious weed of dryland crops in the southern
parts of the former Soviet Republics ([<a href="#83">83</a>], and sources therein). Russian
knapweed was initially introduced to North America in the early 1900's, primarily as a contaminant of Turkestan
alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i>) seed (Groh 1940, as cited by [<a href="#83">83</a>]) and possibly sugarbeet (<i>Beta
vulgaris</i>) seed
(Robbins and others 1951, as cited by [<a href="#45">45</a>]). Rogers [<a href="#61">61</a>] suggests
that Russian knapweed is likely to have established wherever Turkestan alfalfa
has been planted. Its spread from these locations is linked to the distribution of knapweed-infested hay [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>].

<p>
Russian knapweed is widespread in the U.S. and especially common in the semiarid portions of the western
states and
adjacent Canada. Maddox and others
[<a href="#45">45</a>] reported infestations in South Dakota, Minnesota, and
Virginia in 1985, and current distribution maps indicate its occurrence in
several midwestern and Great Plains states [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>]. The <a href="https://plants.usda.gov/">Plants</a>
database provides a distribution map of Russian knapweed in the United States.
</p>


<p>
The following table reflects estimates of Russian knapweed acreage as reported by
surveyed states or provinces in 1988 and again in 2000 (from [<a href="#25">25</a>]):

<p>
Although
inventories are more common and more accurate in the year 2000 than in 1988, 50% of these states reported only
50% accuracy, while 31% reported 51 to 75% accuracy, and 2 states reported 75 to
100% accuracy in the 2000 survey [<a href="#25">25</a>].
</p>


<p>The following biogeographic classification systems
are presented as a guide to demonstrate where Russian knapweed might be
found based on reported occurrence and biological tolerance to factors that are
likely to limit its distribution. Precise distribution information is limited,
especially in the southwestern, central, midwestern, and eastern states.
Therefore, these lists are speculative and not exhaustive.

Russian knapweed invades many disturbed western grassland and shrubland communities as well as
riparian woodlands, such as the Fremont cottonwood (<i>Populus fremontii</i>)/skunkbush
sumac (<i>Rhus trilobata</i>) community [<a href="#17">17</a>].	

<p>
Pacific Northwest:<br>
In eastern Washington, the most common associate of Russian knapweed is basin wildrye
(<i>Leymus cinereus</i>) [<a href="#75">75</a>]. In this area, Russian knapweed occurs in big
sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i>)/bluebunch wheatgrass (<i>Pseudoroegneria
spicata</i>), black greasewood (<i>Sarcobatus
vermiculatus</i>)/saltgrass (<i>Distichlis spicata</i>) and basin wildrye/saltgrass
habitat types [<a href="#59">59</a>]. Russian knapweed may also be found in the big
sagebrush/basin wildrye habitat type in Oregon [<a href="#56">56</a>].
</p>

<p>
In Idaho, Russian knapweed may be found with bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue (<i>Festuca
idahoensis</i>), snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos</i> spp.), and rose (<i>Rosa</i>
spp.). In this area it may threaten rare plants such as Spalding's silene (<i>Silene
spaldingii</i>), smallhead goldenweed (<i>Pyrrocoma</i> <i>liatriformis</i>), sagebrush
Mariposa lily (<i>Calochortus macrocarpus</i> var. <i>maculosus</i>), and
Idaho hawksbeard (<i>Crepis</i> <i>bakeri</i> ssp. <i>idahoensis</i>)
[<a href="#56">56</a>].
</p>

<p>In Montana, Russian knapweed was found growing in
alfalfa and grain fields in Missouri River bottomlands
in the north-central part of the state. Vegetation in the area included sagebrush (<i>Artemisia</i> spp.)-grassland (where
dominants included western wheatgrass (<i>Pascopyrum smithii</i>),<i> </i>smooth
brome (<i>Bromus inermis</i>), and<i> </i>Canada wildrye (<i>Elymus canadensis</i>)); black
greasewood; plains cottonwood (<i>Populus deltoides</i> ssp. <i>monilifera</i>); willow (<i>S</i><i>alix</i>
spp.) and &quot;meadow&quot; types. Plants associated with Russian knapweed included barley (<i>Hordeum</i>
spp.), witchgrass (<i>Panicum capillare</i>), green bristlegrass (<i>Setaria
viridis</i>), pigweed (<i>Amaranthus</i> spp.), <i>Chenopodium</i>  spp., old-man's-whiskers (<i>Geum triflorum</i>),
summer-cypress (<i>Kochia scoparia</i>), and
common dandelion (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i>) [<a href="#1">1</a>]. Of 21 diverse sites in
southwestern Montana dominated by curlleaf mountain-mahogany (<i>Cercocarpus
ledifolius</i>), Russian knapweed occurred on 2 sites west of the
Continental Divide in 1975 [<a href="#26">26</a>].
</p>

<p>Middle Rocky Mountains:<br>
In Wyoming Russian knapweed occurs on perennial grasslands dominated by blue grama
(<i>Bouteloua gracilis</i>) [<a href="#17">17</a>].
</p>

<p>In Colorado the most severe infestations of Russian knapweed occur in mountain and
western slope counties, with lighter infestations
associated with blue grama on the eastern plains [<a href="#17">17</a>]. Habitats in which Russian knapweed
may be found include riparian
woodlands
dominated by cottonwood (<i>Populus</i> spp.), skunkbush sumac, and willow; riparian shrubland; and sagebrush/fourwing saltbush
(<i>Atriplex canescens</i>) shrublands.</p>

Great Basin:<br>
In Utah, Russian
knapweed is found in cottonwood/willow and tamarisk (<i>Tamarix</i> spp.) communities. In Nevada, Russian knapweed can be found with creosotebush (<i>Larrea tridentata</i>)
and saltgrass, and it may threaten plants found in ash (<i>Fraxinus</i> spp.)
meadows [<a href="#56">56</a>].

Russian knapweed is a non-native, perennial, invasive forb that often forms dense,
monotypic colonies from widely spreading horizontal roots. Roots are scaly and dark-brown to black in
color, and can extend 14 square yards (12 m<sup>2</sup>) radially, and up to 23 feet
(7 m) deep within 2 growing seasons ([<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>] and sources
therein). Records indicate that an infestation of Russian knapweed can survive
75+ years through its root system [<a href="#83">83</a>].

<p>
Russian knapweed shoot development originates from
root-borne buds. A patch of Russian knapweed may have 9 to 27 shoots per square foot
(100-300/m<sup>2</sup>) [<a href="#83">83</a>]. Russian knapweed stems
are thin, erect and openly branched, standing up to 3 feet (0.9 m) tall.
Rosette leaves are 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm) long and 0.4 to 1 inch (1-2.5 cm) wide.
Leaves grow smaller near the tops of the stems. Flowerheads arise terminally and
are 0.25 to 0.5 inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm) in diameter. Russian knapweed seeds are achenes and are oblong, 2.1 to 2.4
mm in length by 0.6 to 0.7 mm in width. Seeds are covered with many fine hairs
and have a pappus on the apex ([<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>] and sources therein).
</p>

<p>Several allelopathic compounds have been isolated
form Russian knapweed [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>]. It is known that allelopathy plays an
important role in Russian knapweed ecology and that these compounds can
interfere with the growth of associated plants [<a href="#41">41</a>].

<br />

Russian knapweed reproduces by seed and by adventitious
buds on horizontally spreading roots. Since Russian knapweed produces relatively
few seeds and lacks effective
mechanisms for seed dispersal, local infestations increase primarily by adventitious
roots [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].

<p>
<font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Breeding system:</b></font> Russian knapweed is monoecious and is an obligate
outcrosser [<a href="#36">36</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Pollination:</b></font>  Russian knapweed is insect pollinated [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>].
</p>


<p>
<b>
<font face="Bell MT">
Seed production:</font>   </b>  A single Russian knapweed plant can produce about 1,200
seeds per year (Ivanova 1966, as cited by [<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>]). Watson [<a href="#83">83</a>]
reported Russian knapweed seed production of about 100 seeds per plant per year along
roadsides, and about 292 seeds per plant on rangeland in British Columbia, with
a high ovule
abortion rate. Beck [<a href="#8">8</a>] reports seed production of about 50 to 500 per shoot
in Colorado. Flower production declines with
decreasing light levels [<a href="#22">22</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Seed dispersal:</b></font>  Russian knapweed seedheads generally remain closed at
maturity, and the relatively heavy seeds tend to lose the small pappus bristles
at maturity; therefore, wind dispersal is an unlikely method for long-range seed
dispersal [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>]. Ballistic dispersal may be more important
than wind dispersal: Mature achenes dehisce from the receptacle and usually remain in the
involucre, but can be launched
over distances roughly equal to the height of the plant when the involucre sways in a
breeze [<a href="#2">2</a>]. The primary means of long-range seed dispersal is probably via contaminated hay and other seed (primarily alfalfa),
or by movement of farm machinery or other vehicles [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Seed banking:</b></font>   Seed banking of Russian knapweed is not reported in the literature. It is unclear how long Russian knapweed seeds can
remain viable, as reports vary from 2 to 3 years (Ivanova 1966 as cited by [<a href="#83">83</a>]), while
Andersen (1968) reported successful germination after 5
years of dry storage [<a href="#17">17</a>], and Selleck [<a href="#66">66</a>] reported successful germination of seeds
after up to 9 years storage at room temperature.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Germination:</b></font> Russian knapweed seeds do not germinate
readily [<a href="#58">58</a>], and
germination rarely occurs in the field [<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>]. An initial
dormancy period has been observed in Russian knapweed seeds and can be broken by alternating
temperatures. Russian knapweed seeds are able to
germinate under a wide range of temperatures (33 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit (0.5-35 &deg;C)) with optimum
germination occurring between 68 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit (20-30 &deg;C) ([<a href="#83">83</a>], and sources therein).
Light is not essential for germination, but alternating light and darkness
improves germination, and white light appears to stimulate germination [<a href="#50">50</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seedling establishment/growth:</b> </font> No information</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Asexual regeneration:</b></font>   Russian knapweed reproduces primarily by
vegetative means, and can spread rapidly and form dense
colonies. The root system consists of the taproot, 1 to many horizontal roots, and their vertical extensions. Buds on the horizontal roots
can form adventitious shoots that can grow to be independent plants ([<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>] and sources therein). Spread can be hastened by cultivation [<a href="#58">58</a>].

SITE CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT">

<b>

General:</b></font> Russian knapweed is commonly found along roadsides, railways, riverbanks, irrigation ditches,
pastures, waste places, clearcuts, and croplands. It does not readily establish in
healthy, natural habitats [<a href="#17">17</a>]. Because Russian knapweed
regenerates primarily vegetatively, it does not spread as readily alongside roads
and trails as do other knapweeds [<a href="#60">60</a>]. In its
native lands, Russian knapweed is weedy along roads and among crops, in abandoned areas and
near dwellings (Klokov and others 1963, as cited by [<a href="#58">58</a>]). In Washington it
may grow
in hayfields, pastures, grainfields and irrigation ditches, and is
reportedly not a problem weed
on most rangelands [<a href="#58">58</a>].

<p>
<font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Elevation:</b></font> There are few reports in the literature on the elevational range of
Russian knapweed. It is primarily an invader of croplands. It can be found up to 8,600-9,300 feet (2,620-2,835 m) in
its native
land (Klokov and others 1963, as cited by [<a href="#58">58</a>]), and up to 6,300 feet (1,900
m) in California [<a href="#37">37</a>]. It has been observed between 4,025 to 7,850 feet (1,220-2,380 m) in Utah [<a href="#85">85</a>].
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Moisture and temperature</b>:</font> Watson [<a href="#83">83</a>] reports a typical infestation
of Russian knapweed in British Columbia with annual precipitation
of 9.8 inches (245 mm) and mean summer temperature of 70.5 degrees Fahrenheit (21.4 &deg;C) [<a href="#55">55</a>]. Fructan metabolism
in Russian knapweed gives it a competitive advantage by facilitating growth at
relatively cool temperatures when soil moisture is usually most
plentiful [<a href="#19">19</a>]. Only relative descriptions of the moisture
requirements of Russian knapweed are available in the literature. Observations
in southeastern Colorado suggest that stands of Russian knapweed are denser where
precipitation is &quot;lower&quot; [<a href="#30">30</a>]. Similarly, while Russian knapweed is found in both irrigated and
arid areas in Canada, it is more common and more competitive in &quot;drier&quot; regions
[<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>]. However, it has been documented as well established under irrigated
conditions [<a href="#83">83</a>]. In Washington,
Russian knapweed is most commonly found in areas with relatively high soil moisture
content such as irrigated or
irrigation runoff areas; near rivers, creeks, canals, coulees, and draws; on
toeslopes; in deep,
fine textured soils in high precipitation zones and valley bottoms; and in poorly drained
soils [<a href="#59">59</a>]. Russian knapweed can tolerate some flooding,
but not severe drought [<a href="#58">58</a>].
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Soils:</b></font> In its native land, Russian knapweed grows on clayey, sandy or
rocky steppes and sunny meadows, on saline soils, clayey, rocky, or sandy
shores of lakes and rivers, on rocky and clayey slopes of hills, and on
bottomlands (Klokov and others 1963, as cited by [<a href="#58">58</a>]). In Washington, Russian knapweed is
often found on sites with either greater effective rooting depth or greater effective moisture
than adjacent areas [<a href="#21">21</a>], and it tolerates saline and alkaline soils [<a href="#58">58</a>]. Russian knapweed occurs mostly in alkaline, seasonally wet
habitats in Montana [<a href="#43">43</a>]. Researchers in Colorado have noted
that while Russian knapweed can grow on a variety of soil types, it appears to
be most competitive on soils with high clay content [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>]. Goslee and others
[<a href="#32">32</a>] suggest that the ability of Russian knapweed to dominate on fine-textured
soils while
forming a
persistent
mixture with other species on coarse soils may be due to allelopathy, since
allelopathy is likely to have more impact on fine-textured soils.
</p>

<p>Watson [<a href="#83">83</a>] reports that the
northern limit of Russian knapweed in British Columbia is 54 �N, but that most infestations
occur in the drier southern regions of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan.
</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SUCCESSIONAL STATUS">
SUCCESSIONAL STATUS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Watson [<a href="#83">83</a>] reports that
Russian knapweed invades open, disturbed land and suppresses growth of surrounding
plants. Goslee and others [<a href="#32">32</a>] suggest that because Russian knapweed produces
few seeds and has poor dispersal mechanisms, it does not colonize new sites
efficiently. Once established in open areas, however, it is highly
competitive and spreads aggressively, often forming dense, single-species stands
that can persist indefinitely [<a href="#83">83</a>]. Computer
simulations suggest that the ability of Russian knapweed to dominate aboveground biomass in
blue grama grassland is related to soil texture. Russian knapweed dominates clay soils within 30 years after establishment, will codominate with perennial grasses on clay-loam soils,
but will not achieve dominance over perennial grasses on coarse-textured soils.
These differences in dominance are
related to differing allelopathic effects in different soil textures [<a href="#32">32</a>]. Russian knapweed is sensitive to decreased
amounts of sunlight, does not compete well under a heavy canopy, and is weakened by dense
shade [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>]. Dall'Armellina and Zimdahl [<a href="#22">22</a>]
found that the number of shoots
and flowers produced by Russian knapweed in a greenhouse study was highly correlated with light
level, and that
shoot and root dry weight decreased with each light reduction. Leaf area increased
with initial light reduction, but was reduced at the lowest light level.
Disaccharide, inulin, and nitrogen concentrations also decreased in the roots of shaded
plants ([<a href="#83">83</a>], and sources therein).

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">

Russian knapweed shoots
emerge from perennial roots early in spring, shortly after soil temperatures remain above freezing.
Plants form rosettes and bolt in late May to mid-June. Russian knapweed flowers from June to
October in the U.S. and from July to September in Canada [<a href="#83">83</a>]. Seeds develop in late summer

Concentrations of carbohydrate reserves in the
roots of Russian knapweed follow a seasonal pattern. Disaccharide reserves
decreased during the spring
form 6.8 to 3.6% and peaked at 8.5% at the end of the growing season. Inulin
content in Russian knapweed roots was 4.3% in the spring and 11% at the end of the growing
season ([<a href="#83">83</a>], and sources therein).

<br />

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font>   Information regarding
fire adaptations of Russian knapweed is not available in the literature. Russian
knapweed has a deep-seated, extensive perennial root
system that is likely to allow it to survive even severe fire, depending
on site conditions. Russian knapweed is also capable of establishing
from seed; however, the tolerance of the seeds to heating is unknown, and seed
dispersal over any distance larger than the height of the plant requires a
dispersal agent [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>]. It is not known whether Russian knapweed is likely
to establish from seed after fire.

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font> Russian knapweed
occurs primarily in agricultural communities in
the western U.S. and southwestern Canada, where historic fire regimes have been
dramatically altered.
The historic fire regimes of the more native communities in which Russian
knapweed sometimes occurs are of varied frequency and severity.
Russian knapweed did not occur in these communities at the time in which
historic fire regimes were functioning,
but has established since fire exclusion began. It is unclear
how historic fire regimes might affect Russian knapweed populations. It
is also unclear how the presence of Russian knapweed might affect these fire
regimes. Dense infestations of Russian knapweed may change the
fire regime by changing the fuel characteristics and fire
return interval at a given site. Research in this area is needed.</p>

Researchers in Wyoming burned plots of Russian knapweed after first mowing them
to a height of 3 to 5 inches (8-12 cm). Observations made following these treatments
suggest that Russian knapweed plants were injured to a depth of 2.5-4 cm below
the soil surface, and that lateral roots at the 7.5 to 15 cm depth did not
appear to be injured. Russian knapweed seedheads were also burned but the
seed &quot;appeared to be viable&quot;.&nbsp;However, Russian knapweed seedlings

Fire as a control agent:</b></font>  The only study in the literature that reports results from burning Russian knapweed
states that it is
not effectively controlled by burning [<a href="#12">12</a>]. However, the experimental methods
used in this study were not clearly reported, and there was no mention of how the burning was
carried out. It is stated in the introduction
to this paper that Russian knapweed
infested areas &quot;must be tilled before newly established grass seedlings can survive. 
Without tillage, grass seedlings can survive only after Russian knapweed residues 
have been exposed to moisture for two growing seasons.&quot; No experimental evidence
is
given, however, to support this assertion [<a href="#12">12</a>]. If it is
valid, one might consider researching the use of prescribed burning of plant
residues to volatilize allelopathic compounds.

<p>
<b>
<font face="Bell MT">
Postfire colonization potential:</font>    </b>   There is no information in the
literature regarding the postfire colonization potential of Russian knapweed;
however, general precautions should be followed to prevent establishment after
fire. The USDA Forest Service's &quot;Guide to noxious weed prevention practices&quot; [<a href="#76">76</a>] provides several fire management
considerations for weed prevention in general that may apply to Russian knapweed. Wildfire managers might consider
including weed prevention education and providing weed identification
aids during fire training; avoiding known weed
infestations when locating firelines, monitoring camps, staging areas,
helibases, etc., to be sure they are kept weed free; taking care that equipment is weed free;
incorporating weed prevention into fire rehabilitation plans; and acquiring restoration
funding. 
</p>

<p>When planning a prescribed burn,
preinventory the project area and evaluate cover and phenology of any Russian knapweed present on or adjacent to the site, and avoid ignition and burning in areas at high risk
for Russian knapweed establishment or spread. Avoid creating soil conditions that promote weed
germination and establishment. Discuss weed status
and risks in burn rehabilitation plans [<a href="#76">76</a>].
</p>

To prevent
infestation, re-establish vegetation on bare ground as soon after fire as possible, using
either natural recovery or artificial techniques as appropriate to site
conditions and objectives. When reseeding after wildfires and prescribed burns, use only certified weed-free seed. Monitor the burn site and associated disturbed areas after the fire and the following spring for emergence of
Russian knapweed, and treat to eradicate any emergent Russian knapweed plants.
Regulate
human, pack animal, and livestock entry into burned areas at risk for weed
invasion until desirable site vegetation has recovered sufficiently to resist weed
invasion. Additional guidelines and specific recommendations and requirements are
available [<a href="#76">76</a>].

Russian knapweed is generally avoided by grazing animals due to its bitter taste
[<a href="#83">83</a>]. Prolonged ingestion (more than 30 to 60 days)
of Russian knapweed by horses causes a fatal neurological disorder, nigropallidal
encephalomalacia,
when cumulative plant quantities of 60 to 200% of the animal's body weight are
consumed [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].

<p>Examination of feeding sites and analysis of rumen
contents indicate some use of Russian knapweed by white-tailed deer in
north-central Montana in the summer and winter months [<a href="#1">1</a>]. Russian
knapweed is considered important forage for Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep in
British Columbia [<a href="#7">7</a>]. Birds and rodents eat the seeds [<a href="#58">58</a>].

<b>

<font face="Bell MT"><u>Impacts:</u></font>     </b>    Russian knapweed is considered a
serious habitat invader [<a href="#86">86</a>]. A single patch or infestation of Russian knapweed can grow quite
rapidly. Once established, it can form dense infestations that reduce desirable
vegetation through a combination of competition and allelopathy [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>]. Both roots and leaves of Russian knapweed have been found
to produce chemicals inhibitory to the germination and growth of other species
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>]. The presence of Russian knapweed can thereby reduce forage for
livestock and biodiversity
for wildlife habitat [<a href="#86">86</a>]. Russian knapweed plants, ingested in sufficient
quantities as
fresh or dried forage, are toxic to horses causing the neurological disorder
nigropallidal encephalomalacia [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>]. The presence of Russian knapweed in hay decreases
its feed and market value [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>].

<p> Whitson [<a href="#86">86</a>] claims an 11% average
annual increase of infestations in Wyoming. See the &quot;Distribution and Occurrence&quot;
section of this report for current estimations of infested acres for several
western states. Olson [<a href="#51">51</a>] and Griffith [<a href="#34">34</a>] provide guidelines and methods for
estimating the ecologic and economic impact of noxious weeds on rangelands.
</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><u><b>Control:</b></u></font>   Russian knapweed has a competitive
advantage in a variety of environments, and will continue to persist unless it is suppressed long enough to allow the introduction and
establishment of desirable species [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>]. Continued monitoring and follow-up
treatments must be conducted at least annually to eliminate reinfestation of Russian
knapweed [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>]. 
</p>

<p>Keys to controlling Russian knapweed are 1) stressing
the plant and causing it to expend nutrient reserves in its root system [<a href="#8">8</a>], 2)
eliminating new seed production, and 3) controlling its vegetative spread by
planting competitive species and/or isolating
the infestation so as not to spread root fragments to other locations during
treatment. If
sufficient human resources are available, mechanical control is a good place to
start. Hand pulling or cutting the plants to kill the tops will starve the roots
if done repeatedly, every time they sprout [<a href="#61">61</a>]. Continued vigilance is
necessary since removed aerial parts are rapidly regenerated from vegetative buds on the roots [<a href="#83">83</a>]. 
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Integrated weed management:</b></font> Managers are encouraged to integrate
control methods that complement one another. Integrated
management includes considerations of not only killing the target plant, but also
of establishing desirable species and maintaining weed-free systems over the
long term. Factors to be addressed before a management decision is made include
inventory and assessment to identify the target weed(s) and determine the size of
the infestation(s); assessment of nontarget vegetation, soil types, climatic
conditions, and important water resources; and an evaluation of the benefits and
limitations of each control method [<a href="#48">48</a>]. Components of any integrated weed management program are sustained
effort, constant evaluation, and the adoption of improved strategies [<a href="#67">67</a>].</p>

<p>Conceptual models can be developed to determine the probability that the weed
management strategy will result in the desired plant community, based on the
life histories and population dynamics of the species in the existing plant
community [<a href="#68">68</a>].
A weed management strategy may include designed disturbance (e.g. mechanical or
chemical control), controlled colonization (e.g. planting competitive species),
and controlled species performance (e.g. biological control) [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>]. An integrated management plan for Russian
knapweed includes efforts to place continual stress on the plant [<a href="#8">8</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Prevention:</b> </font> The most efficient and effective method of managing invasive species is
to prevent their invasion and spread [<a href="#69">69</a>]. The fact that Russian knapweed became established
wherever Turkestan alfalfa seed was planted suggests that only seed that
has been cleaned and tested for purity should be used [<a href="#61">61</a>]. Preventing the establishment of
Russian knapweed in natural areas is achieved by
maintaining healthy natural communities and by conducting aggressive monitoring
at least 3 times each year
[<a href="#17">17</a>]. Begin monitoring in spring (late May to
mid-June) when the plants have recently bolted; next in the summer (July) to
find any
missed plants that have flowered and are easily recognizable; and finally in the
fall (late
August or early September) to find any late-blooming plants that might have
regrown from the root system of plants that had been pulled during an earlier
search. Monitoring efforts are best concentrated on
the most disturbed areas in a site, particularly along roadsides, parking lots,
fencelines, and waterways. When an infestation is found, the location can be
recorded and the surrounding area surveyed to determine the size and extent of the infestation,
so these sites can be revisited on follow-up surveys [<a href="#17">17</a>]. For
more on monitoring see Johnson [<a href="#38">38</a>]. It is important to
kill whatever plants are found, followed by some combination of mechanical, chemical
and/or biological control [<a href="#17">17</a>]. 
</p>

<p>Weed prevention and control can be incorporated into
all types of management plans, including logging and site preparation,
management of grazing allotments, recreation management, research projects, road
building and maintenance, and fire management [<a href="#76">76</a>].
See the &quot;Guide to noxious weed prevention practices&quot; [<a href="#76">76</a>]
for specific guidelines in preventing the spread of weed seeds and propagules
under different management conditions. 
</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Physical or mechanical control:</font><font face="Times New Roman">
</font></b>Removal of the aboveground portion of
Russian knapweed plants reduces the current year's growth and will eliminate seed
production for that year, but it will not kill the roots of Russian
knapweed. Cutting,
mowing or disking Russian knapweed infestations several times annually will control the existing
topgrowth. Often, the plants that reemerge are smaller in size and lower in
vigor. This is a good indication that the plants are under stress and that their
nutrient reserves are declining [<a href="#17">17</a>]. Cutting (or mowing) 3 times a year (spring, summer, fall) stresses Russian
knapweed plants and forces them to use nutrient reserves stored in the root
system. Unless repeated frequently, the cut plants recover
vigorously the following year [<a href="#8">8</a>]. Mowing can also damage surrounding plants and
is not likely to be feasible in natural areas [<a href="#17">17</a>]. Mowing
twice during the growing season in Wyoming was not effective in controlling
Russian knapweed [<a href="#10">10</a>].
Mowing may stimulate regeneration of aerial parts and prevent dehydration of
underground organs (Tarshis 1967, as cited by [<a href="#83">83</a>]).
</p>

<p>Cutting is slightly less effective than pulling since
cutting does not remove any portion of the Russian knapweed root. Pulling plants
2 to 3 times annually contained, but did not eliminate,
a Russian knapweed infestation in Washington (Youtie 1998, as cited by [<a href="#17">17</a>]). Cutting roots for 3 years to a depth of 12 inches (30 cm) can destroy the root system in the top meter of soil.
Root fragments up to 16 inches (40 cm) long are killed by burial below 12 inches
(30 cm), indicating some control by deep plowing ([<a href="#83">83</a>], and sources therein).
</p>

<p> Early control attempts
involved starving the roots by smothering with straw and manure, which worked on
small patches when materials were thick enough to prevent stems from penetrating
through to sunlight. Sheet metal and paper have also been used successfully to
control small patches [<a href="#61">61</a>], indicating that solarization with black plastic
may be effective for controlling Russian knapweed, especially since its growth form causes
it to occur in patches.</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Fire: </b> </font>See &quot;Fire Management Considerations: Fire as a control
agent&quot; in the FIRE EFFECTS section of this summary.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Biological:</b></font>  <i>Subanguina
picridis</i>, a gall-forming nematode, is the first biological control agent approved for release on Russian
knapweed and is established at limited sites in Colorado, Montana, New Mexico,
Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, Alberta, and British Columbia [<a href="#25">25</a>]. <i>Subanguina
picridis</i> has not proven to be an effective agent under field conditions. Additional agents are being sought and tested
[<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>]. The biology, gall
morphology and physiology, and effectiveness in weed control of <i>S.
picridis </i>are discussed by Harris and Shorthouse [<a href="#35">35</a>] and Rosenthal [<a href="#62">62</a>].
</p>

<p> Grazing is not a viable method of control for
Russian knapweed since the plant is generally avoided by grazing animals and can be
poisonous to horses. When Russian knapweed is present on horse pasture, it must be removed or
fenced off to prevent horses from eating it.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Chemical:</b></font>   Before using herbicides for control of invasive plants,
managers must consider the effectiveness of the herbicide on the target plant, appropriate timing and rates of
application, the potential impacts on nontarget organisms, and residual activity and toxicity of
the herbicide. If chemical
control is used it must be incorporated into long-term management plans that
include replacement of weeds with desirable species, careful land use
management, and prevention of new infestations [<a href="#16">16</a>]. Use of herbicides may be
limited in natural areas. See the <a href="https://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/handbook.html">Weed
Control Methods Handbook</a> for considerations on the use of herbicides in
natural areas and detailed information on specific chemicals.
</p>

<p>In most situations, Russian knapweed cannot be
effectively managed by herbicide alone [<a href="#8">8</a>]. Chemical
control of Russian knapweed has proven more difficult than that of other
knapweed species [<a href="#58">58</a>]. However, herbicide treatments may stress
the plant enough to give desirable plants a competitive advantage [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>]. Herbicides evaluated for control of Russian knapweed include
2,4-D, picloram, dicamba, clopyralid, glyphosate, and combinations thereof.
Comparative trials designed to evaluate chemicals, combinations, rates, and/or
timings are available [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. Carpenter and Murray [<a href="#17">17</a>] give a synopsis of the effects of picloram, clopyralid, and glyphosate
on Russian knapweed and associated species, available online (<a href="https://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/esadocs.html">Russian knapweed
- Element Stewardship Abstract</a>). Benz and others [<a href="#10">10</a>] evaluated several
chemicals with and without seeding of &quot;improved&quot; grass species. Best
results were obtained with clopyralid + 2,4-D and 'Sodar' thickspike wheatgrass (<i>Elymus
lanceolatus</i>) [<a href="#10">10</a>]. Carpenter [<a href="#18">18</a>] includes extensive data on the effects of different rates of
picloram, clopyralid, and metsulfuron on the density of nontarget plants from
several families.
</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Cultural:</b></font> Russian knapweed is sensitive to light
competition [<a href="#22">22</a>], and crops that produce dense shade under irrigation (e.g.
alfalfa) have been successfully used to suppress Russian knapweed [<a href="#59">59</a>]. Any treatment that provides control of Russian
knapweed must
either release competitive species present in the understory or be combined with reseeding
before long-term sustainable control can be achieved [<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>]. When perennial grasses
such as western wheatgrass and blue grama were present in the understory, single
applications of picloram resulted in 85% control of Russian knapweed 8 years following
treatment. When sites that lacked a desirable understory were similarly treated, annual weeds
replaced Russian knapweed. Two applications of picloram and clopyralid
before seeding and 1 application 1 year after seeding with wheatgrass (Triticaceae) species
and Russian wildrye provided control up to 5 years after
seeding [<a href="#87">87</a>]. Herbicide application and planting of Russian wildrye
provided a
competitive monoculture 7 to 9 years after treatment in Wyoming. The dense, fibrous root system
of Russian wildrye may give it a
competitive advantage in the capture of moisture and nutrients and physically inhibit the
entry of Russian knapweed lateral roots [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].
</p>

Whitson [<a href="#86">86</a>] suggests that the use of herbicides to control Russian knapweed before
establishing perennial grasses can be an important part of a management system. Benz
and others [<a href="#10">10</a>] found that seeded grass species needed
an initial control treatment of Russian knapweed in Wyoming old fields before
they could establish. It has also been suggested that tillage of Russian
knapweed surface residue is necessary to hasten the decomposition of allelochemicals
before planting competitive species [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>], although no experimental evidence
was given to support this assertion.
Furthermore, experimental evidence provided by Bottoms and Whitson [<a href="#12">12</a>]
suggests that grass cover is similar between tilled and untilled plots, and that
&quot;the only significant treatment providing both yield and control was
nontilled Russian wildrye treated with picloram.&quot; Tilling is not possible or appropriate for most natural
areas [<a href="#17">17</a>]. The non-native smooth brome competes well with young Russian knapweed shoots and is somewhat tolerant to the growth inhibitors in the soil [<a href="#8">8</a>]. Unfortunately, smooth brome is itself invasive in
many grassland and meadow habitats across North America [<a href="#17">17</a>].
