<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The accepted scientific name of sticky cinquefoil is Potentilla
glandulosa Lindl.  Sticky cinquefoil is highly variable both in
morphologial characteristics and habitat affinities.  Several varieties
have been identified and many intergradations occur; authorities differ
in the treatment of these taxa.  The following varieties are currently
recognized by many taxonomists:

        P. glandulosa var. intermedia (Rydb.)C.L. Hitchc.
        P. glandulosa var. pseudorupestris (Rydb.)Breitung
        P. glandulosa var. glandulosa
        P. glandulosa var. micropetala (Rydb.)Welsh and Johnston
        P. glandulosa var. nevadensis S.Wats.
        P. glandulosa var. reflexa Greene
        P. glandulosa var. campanulata Hitchc.

The morphological characteristics of P. glauca var. intermedia and P.
glauca var.  pseudorupestris often merge, and these taxa are described
as transitional to one another [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Several other species of
cinquefoil, including P. arguta, P. campanulata, and P. fissa, exhibit
significant intergradation with P. glandulosa [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Comparatively little is known about the value of sticky cinquefoil to
livestock and wildlife.  Cinquefoils (Potentilla spp.) in general are
fairly high in tannic acid and are not highly palatable to most species
[<a href="#36">36</a>].  Some cinquefoils are browsed when other more desirable species
are unavailable.  Mule deer feed on sticky cinquefoil during the fall in
parts of Montana [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Sticky cinquefoil is less palatable than most
associated forb species in central Idaho [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability and degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife
species for Potentilla glandulosa variety intermedia in Utah and Wyoming
has been rated as follows [<a href="#3">3</a>]:

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Potentilla glandulosa var. intermedia is rated as fair in energy
content and poor in protein value [<a href="#3">3</a>].  General nutritional values for
Potentilla spp. are as follows [<a href="#22">22</a>]:

                             aerial part,

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The degree to which sticky cinquefoil provides environmental protection
during one or more seasons for wildife species has been rated as follows
[<a href="#3">3</a>]:

                      UT       WY

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Sticky cinquefoil is rated as low in value for both short- and long-term
revegetation projects.  It has little value for erosion control [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Many species of cinquefoil, although typically erect, assume a
prostrate, matlike growth form when trampled by livestock [<a href="#36">36</a>].
Cinquefoils increase in response to grazing on many subirrigated and
wetland range sites in Montana [<a href="#26">26</a>]..

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Potentilla glandulosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Shrubby cinquefoil is a highly variable glandular pubescent perennial
herb which grows from 0.3 to 2.6 feet (8-80 cm) in height [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  One
to several erect woody stems grow from a branched woody caudex [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].
Individual stems are simple below the inflorescence [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Some
varieties or populations of sticky cinquefoil have rhizomes which range
from short to well-developed [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Other varieties or populations are
described as nonrhizomatous [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  The inflorescence is a few- to
many-flowered open cyme [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Flowers may be inconspicuous or quite
showy [<a href="#38">38</a>].  The fruit is an achene [<a href="#8">8</a>].



<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chameaphyte
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Achenes are generally produced in abundance [<a href="#38">38</a>]; most fall
directly beneath the parent plant [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Wind dispersal or other types
of long-distance dispersal have not been reported for this species
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

Sticky cinquefoil stores comparatively large numbers of seed in the soil
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Viable seed densities at several central Idaho sites ranged
from 0 to 840 per meter square [<a href="#14">14</a>].

The length of time buried seed remains viable is unknown.  Seeds
germinate prolifically after scarification of the forest floor by timber
harvest or heavy livestock use [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].

Shrubby cinquefoil seedlings emerged from soil 1 inch deep (2 cm) or
less in an eastern Oregon study [<a href="#35">35</a>].  In a central Idaho study, Kramer
[<a href="#14">14</a>] found that the viability of seeds obtained from the lower soil
layer was only 13 percent compared with 24 percent for seeds taken from
upper soil levels.  Maximum viable seed density was 840 per meter
square.  Overall seed viability was 19 percent.

Vegetative:  Some populations or varieties of sticky cinquefoil
reportedly have short to well-developed rhizomes [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Other
individuals, populations, or varieties are described as nonrhizomatous
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sticky cinquefoil grows on a wide range of sites in meadows, shrublands,
and montane coniferous forests.  It is a constituent of sagebrush
(Artemisia spp.), mountain brush, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa),
lodgepole pine (P. contorta), aspen (Populus tremuloides), subalpine fir
(Abies lasiocarpa), and alpine meadow communities [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  Sticky
cinquefoil occurs on both dry and moist sites from low to high
elevations on a number of soil types [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Potentilla glandulosa var. intermedia grows best on sandy loam to clay
loam soils [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Many varieties grow well on granitic soils [<a href="#32">32</a>].
Optimum soil depth for P. glandulosa var. intermedia is between 10 and
20 inches (25-51 cm) [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Site preferences for several recognized
varieties are given below [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>]:

     var. campanulata - washes to tallus slopes
     var. intermedia - mountain brush, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine,
                       aspen, spruce-fir
     var. micropetala - sagebrush, mountain brush, alpine meadows
     var. pseudorupestris - open rocky sites, subalpine fir, alpine
                            sites
     var. nevadensis - moist sites, montane coniferous forests
     var. reflexa - dryish slopes, many plant communities

Elevational ranges of sticky cinquefoil are as follows [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>]:
  
           5,000 to 12,400 feet (1,525-3,782 m) in California
           9,000 feet (2,745 m) in Colorado
           3,200 to 9,000 feet (976-2,745 m) in Montana
           4,689 to 10,700 feet (1,430-3,782 m) in Utah
           6,000 to 9,700 feet (1,830-2,959 m) in Wyoming


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

Sticky cinquefoil is an early seral species in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
menziezii)/ninebark (Physocarpus malvaceus), grand fir (Abies
grandis)/mountain maple (Acer glabrum), grand fir/globe huckleberry
(Vaccinium globulare), and Douglas-fir/pinegrass (Calamagrostis
rubescens) habitat types of central Idaho [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  This
shade-intolerant species responds well following grazing, fire, or other
types of disturbance.  Sticky cinquefoil is commonly the dominant
understory plant on heavily grazed sites with granitic soils.  It is
rarely found in mature, climax forests [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Daubenmire [<a href="#4">4</a>] referred to unspecified "cinquefoils" as common climax
dominants in some alpine meadow communities of the Rocky Mountains.
Athough sticky cinquefoil is a consituent of many mountain meadow
communities, it is unclear whether or not this species could be regarded
as a climax dominant on these sites.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Flowering occurs from May or June to July or August [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Potentilla glandulosa

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Very little is known about the adaptations of sticky cinquefoil to fire.
Fire is infrequent on many of the more mesic alpine sites occupied by
sticky cinquefoil but probably occurs at least occasionally on some of
the more xeric montane coniferous sites.  Some varieties or populations
of sticky cinquefoil have short to well-developed rhizomes [<a href="#8">8</a>], while
others are nonrhizomatous [<a href="#14">14</a>], suggesting the possibility of variable
responses to fire.  Plants with rhizomes could potentially resprout
after fire.  Nonrhizomatous individuals would probably be killed by
fire.

Sticky cinquefoil is a seedbanker in parts of central Idaho and
presumably elsewhere [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Large numbers of seed which are stored in
the soil germinate after mechanical- or fire-induced scarification.

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Nonrhizomatous populations of shrubby cinquefoil are probably killed by
most fires.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Vegetative regeneration has not been documented for this species.
However, the potential for some individuals, populations, or varieties
to sprout after fire is strongly suggested by the presence of "short to
well-developed" rhizomes [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Sticky cinquefoil typically produces
numerous seeds [<a href="#38">38</a>], and reestablishment through seed stored in seed
banks has been well documented [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Seed is typically derived from
individuals which are reproducing on-site [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Long-distance dispersal
mechanisms have not been reported for this species [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  The length
of time buried seed remains viable is unknown.

Various forms of mechanical scarification are known to promote
germination of sticky cinquefoil seed [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Fire may also stimulate
seed to germinate.  Seedlings of this early seral, shade-intolerant
species often grow rapidly following fire or other types of disturbance.

Recovery time for sticky cinquefoil has not been well studied. After a
fire in a Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) community in northern Utah, the
frequency and total number of sticky cinquefoil shoots on burned sites
exceeded those on unburned control plots 2, 9, and 18 years after the
fire.  Total shoot numbers, cover, and frequency were reduced on burned
sites 1 year after the burn [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Factors such as fire intensity and
severity, site characteristics, and possible ecotypic variation
influence how sticky cinquefoil responds to fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Frequency, cover, and total numbers of shoots of sticky cinquefoil
following fire in a Gambel oak community in northern Utah were as
follows [<a href="#18">18</a>]:

                   Frequency (#)   Total Shoots (#)    Total Cover (%)
1st Year Burn:
          Burned-       1                 2                Trace
          Unburned -    4                 9                 .6   

2nd Year Burn:
          Burned -      2                 6                 .3
          Unburned -    1                 1                Trace

9th Year Burn:
          Burned -      6                12                 .4
          Unburned -    2                 5                 .4

18th Year Burn:
           Burned -     4                14                 .7
           Unburned -   2                 4                 .2

                (50 burned and unburned plots)
                
Sticky cinquefoil remained well-represented on many central Idaho burn
sites for as long as 14 years after fire [<a href="#32">32</a>].
