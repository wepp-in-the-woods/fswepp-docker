<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ribes aureum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
The distribution of golden currant ranges from British Columbia east to
Saskatchewan, south to western Nebraska, Colorado, and northwestern
Texas, west to Los Angeles, California, and north to the eastern slopes
of the Cascade Range [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].

Golden currant is native to the West, but it has been cultivated and
has naturalized in the East [<a href="#28">28</a>].  The distribution of Ribes aureum var.
villosum, formerly Ribes odoratum [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>], ranges from Minnesota east to
Michigan south through Tennessee to Arkansas, west to Texas, and north
through Colorado to South Dakota [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  The distribution of R. aureum
var. villosum is not considered in the ecosystems, plant associations,
and cover types listed here because information is lacking.

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Golden currant occurs in grassland, coniferous forests and woodlands,
and riparian and mountain shrub communities [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].

In addition to the plant associations and cover types listed in
preceding slots, golden currant occurs in the alluvial scrub vegetation
of the San Gabriel River floodplain [<a href="#44">44</a>] and in central coast riparian
forest [<a href="#39">39</a>] in California.  In the Malheur National Forest, Oregon,
golden currant is a member of the Mackenzie willow (Salix rigida var.
mackenzieana) riparian dominance type; associated species include Wood's
rose (Rosa woodsii), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratense), smooth brome
(Bromus inermis), meadow barley (Hordeum brachyantherum), and redtop
(Agrostis alba) [<a href="#32">32</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
In Logan, Utah, golden currant twigs and foliage were browsed May 31 to
August 1 by captive deer [<a href="#43">43</a>].

The fruit of Ribes spp. is a valuable food source for songbirds,
chipmunks, ground squirrels, and other animals [<a href="#27">27</a>].

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Currants (Ribes spp.) contain high concentrations of mono- and
disaccharides [<a href="#48">48</a>].

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Golden currant can be used to revegetate roadsides and disturbed areas
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  In Alpine County, California, container-grown golden
currant seedlings were planted on mine spoils.  The average percent
survival of golden currant seedlings was 91 percent after 1 year and 77
percent after 2 years [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Schroeder [<a href="#40">40</a>] rated golden currant high
in hardiness, low in soil requirements, and medium in growth rate.
Plummer and others [<a href="#37">37</a>] rated the suitability of golden currant for
restoring rangeland in Utah as follows:

        initial establishment		good
        growth rate			good
        persistence			good
        germination			medium to fair
        seed production	        	medium to fair
        ease of planting		very good
        natural spread			good


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The fruit of golden currant is used for making jam, jelly, and pie [<a href="#34">34</a>].
Some western Indian tribes used currants (Ribes spp.) for making
pemmican [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Golden currant is cultivated as an ornamental [<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Golden currant is an alternate host for white pine blister rust
(Cronartium ribicola) which infests five-needled pines [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Because of
their association with the rust, Ribes spp. have been targets of various
eradication efforts [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>]; however, these efforts have had some
success only in the Great Lake States [<a href="#20">20</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ribes aureum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Golden currant is a native, deciduous, rhizomatous shrub [<a href="#53">53</a>] growing
from 3.3 to 10 feet (1-3 m) tall.  Its numerous, stiff, erect branches
are smooth-barked.  The orbicular, three-lobed (three- to five-lobed for
Ribes aureum var. villosum) leaves are 0.24 to 1.9 inch (0.6-4.7 cm)
long and 0.4 to 2.7 inches (1-6.7 cm) wide.  Drooping racemes are five-
to fifteen-flowered.  Globose berries, 0.24 to 0.36 inch (6-9 mm) in
diameter, contain numerous seeds [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Golden currant reproduces vegetatively and by seed.

Golden currant reproduces vegetatively by rhizomes [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>]; it sprouts
after cutting and fire [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Plants can also be grown from cuttings
[<a href="#41">41</a>].

Ribes spp. begin fruiting after 3 years [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Many seeds fall beneath
the parent plant; they are also dispersed by birds and mammals.  Fallen
seeds may remain viable in the soil and duff for many years [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].
Seed germination is generally enhanced by scarification [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>];
however, 63 percent germination was obtained in the laboratory by
stratifying golden currant seeds at 28 and 36 degrees Fahrenheit (-2.2
and 2.2 deg C) for 60 days without scarification [<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Golden currant has wide ecological amplitude.  It commonly occurs on
floodplains, along streams, in ravines and washes, by springs, and on
mountain slopes [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Golden currant grows on fine- to
course-textured loam soil [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>] at elevations up to 8,000 feet
(2,400 m) [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Golden currant is somewhat shade tolerant.  On the Pine Ridge
escarpments in northwestern Nebraska, golden currant grows in open,
scattered, and dense pine stands [<a href="#49">49</a>].  In Minnesota, where fragrant
golden currant occurs, very dense balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and
northern whitecedar (Thuja occidentalis) overstories suppress Ribes spp.
[<a href="#2">2</a>].  In riparian vegetation throughout their range, Ribes spp. often
constitute an important part of the shrub cover.  They are only
occasionally shaded out by dense thickets of taller shrubs [<a href="#29">29</a>].

In western coniferous forests, Ribes spp. are early seral species,
sometimes persisting into the midseral stage [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  In the
Bitterroot Mountains of Idaho, roots of Ribes spp. stabilize the soil
after disturbance, and foliage may shelter fir (Abies spp.), spruce
(Picea spp.), and western white pine (Pinus monticola) seedlings [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Golden currant flowers from early spring to June [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  In the
Intermountain region, seeds mature from mid-July to mid-August [<a href="#37">37</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ribes aureum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Severe fire that consumes the entire organic mantle probably kills
golden currant and may destroy soil-stored seeds [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Golden currant
may survive low- to moderate-severity fire by sprouting from rhizomes
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].  Golden currant regeneration is probably favored by low- to
moderate-severity fire because germination of soil-stored seed is
generally enhanced by scarification in Ribes spp. [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].

<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Golden currant seedlings may establish after fire, and golden currant
probably sprouts from surviving rhizomes after low- to moderate-severity
fire.

In Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota, low-severity prescription
fires conducted during the spring and fall of 1979 resulted in decreases
in Ribes spp., including fragrant golden currant, during postfire years
1 and 2.  Weather conditions were as follows [<a href="#35">35</a>]:

                wind speed      temperature     relative
                mi/h (km/h)     deg F (deg C)   humidity (%)

spring burn      5 (8)          57 (13.9)       32

The origin of golden currant on postfire plots (seedling or sprout) was
not described. Prefire and postfire values for Ribes spp. on
experimental (burned) and control (unburned) plots were as follows [<a href="#35">35</a>]:

  greater than value for experimental plot.  

In Nevada County, California, the Donner Ridge Wildfire "completely
razed" a pine (Pinus spp.)-fir forest [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].  Golden currant was
observed growing on the site in postfire year 8.  It is not clear
whether golden currant had sprouted or established from seed.  Other
members of the postfire vegetation community included mules ears
(Wyethia mollis), mahala mat (Ceanothus prostratus), greenleaf
manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula), rabbitbrush goldenweed (Haplopappus
bloomeri), and young Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) and lodgepole pine
(P. contorta) which had germinated after the fire [<a href="#7">7</a>].
