Idaho fescue is one of the most common and widely
distributed grasses in the western states [<a href="#282">282</a>]. It occurs from northern New
Mexico and the White Mountains and San Francisco Peaks of Arizona [<a href="#153">153</a>] to the
Sierra Nevada of east-central California; north through Colorado, Utah,
Wyoming, Montana, Idaho and the Cascade and Olympic ranges of Oregon and
Washington; into British Columbia, Alberta, [<a href="#133">133</a>] and Saskatchewan [<a href="#36">36</a>]. Idaho
fescue is a minor component of plains grasslands east of the Rocky Mountain Front
[<a href="#247">247</a>]. Its range is reported to extend east into western South Dakota [<a href="#283">283</a>],
although Houtcooper and others [<a href="#139">139</a>] list it as possibly rare, declining, or
extirpated in that state since no sites had been verified. Hinckley [<a href="#129">129</a>] reports
Idaho fescue in the Mount Livermore area of western Texas. Idaho fescue is also
occurs in the coastal prairies and annual grasslands of coastal northwestern
California [<a href="#126">126</a>,<a href="#155">155</a>]. It is rare or does not occur in southern portions of
California, Nevada, and Arizona [<a href="#282">282</a>]. Idaho fescue is associated with the
rough fescue (<i>Festuca altaica</i>) prairie in south-central Canada and
Montana [<a href="#67">67</a>], and with Palouse prairie in eastern Oregon and Washington, southern
Idaho and British Columbia, and the intermountain valleys of western Montana
[<a href="#81">81</a>].&nbsp; The Natural Resources Conservation Service provides a distributional
map of Idaho fescue&nbsp;in the United States (<a href="http://plants.usda.gov/plants/">http://plants.usda.gov/plants/</a>)
[<a href="#283">283</a>].

Idaho fescue provides important forge for many types of domestic livestock
and several wildlife species. In Oregon, Idaho fescue is
the main grass selected most seasons by cattle and horses [<a href="#289">289</a>]
and by elk and sheep in spring [<a href="#144">144</a>]. Idaho fescue makes up 29% of cattle 
diets from June to October, it had more green leaves in summer than did other grasses, and it 
was sought out for regrowth in the late summer and fall
[<a href="#136">136</a>]. It is valuable domestic sheep forage on many
high-altitude range sites in eastern Idaho [<a href="#101">101</a>], and excellent forage in
grassland and open ponderosa pine summer cattle ranges of western
Colorado [<a href="#218">218</a>]. The ponderosa pine/Idaho fescue community is well suited for spring and fall grazing
in the Similkameen Valley of British Columbia [<a href="#185">185</a>]. Idaho
fescue is major livestock forage species in western Montana [<a href="#205">205</a>,<a href="#302">302</a>], and is generally preferred
over its codominant, bluebunch wheatgrass [<a href="#251">251</a>]. The foliage cures well and is
preferred by livestock
in late fall and winter [<a href="#246">246</a>].</p>

<p> Idaho fescue is an important component in elk diets throughout
the Rocky Mountain region [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#161">161</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>,<a href="#246">246</a>,<a href="#269">269</a>]. The Idaho fescue-bluebunch wheatgrass habitat type in southwestern Montana is widely used by big game animals.&nbsp;
Elk and deer use the type as low-elevation winter range, and pronghorn use it year-round.&nbsp; At intermediate elevations
Idaho fescue is important spring-fall range, and at upper elevations it provides summer range
for elk and mule deer [<a href="#205">205</a>].&nbsp; Some researchers report moderate to heavy use of
Idaho fescue as forage for deer [<a href="#161">161</a>,<a href="#215">215</a>,<a href="#249">249</a>,<a href="#274">274</a>,<a href="#285">285</a>,<a href="#289">289</a>].
Others indicate that Idaho fescue plant associations are important deer habitat,
but that Idaho fescue is not a preferred forage species [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#166">166</a>].
Bodurtha and others [<a href="#32">32</a>] report that Idaho
fescue communities are among the least used by mule deer in eastern Oregon.
Idaho fescue is a common grass on
pronghorn summer range in Yellowstone National Park [<a href="#244">244</a>]
and southeast Oregon [<a href="#273">273</a>] and is reported to be good forage for pronghorn, cattle and sheep in ranges of northern
Nevada [<a href="#116">116</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<p>Climax bunchgrass
communities are dominant components of winter ranges of bighorn sheep, and bunchgrasses
are the dominant forage class during the winter [<a href="#228">228</a>]. Some Idaho fescue sites at moderately high elevations are
used by bighorn sheep and Rocky Mountain goats (<i>Oreamnos americana missoulae</i>)
as winter range [<a href="#154">154</a>,<a href="#205">205</a>,<a href="#257">257</a>]; however, Idaho fescue is not
commonly used by bighorn sheep in Glacier National Park, Montana [<a href="#229">229</a>].&nbsp; Idaho fescue was an identified component in the stomach of Rocky Mountain goats
in the fall
in Montana [<a href="#239">239</a>], and in Olympic National Park, Washington,&nbsp;it was a selected
forage species of mountain goats. It decreased in cover under high mountain goat density,
while the less palatable western yarrow (<i>Achillea millefolium</i>) increased
in cover [<a href="#241">241</a>].</p>
<p> Northern pocket gophers eat primarily the leaves and stems of Idaho
fescue in June through September, although they prefer forbs [<a href="#293">293</a>].
Cox [<a href="#68">68</a>] found that grasses constituted only 2.4% of the shoot matter in
northern pocket gopher diets. Idaho fescue was most commonly consumed
grass in their diet, probably
because it was the most abundant grass on the study site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subframeText">Idaho fescue is a component of grizzly bear
habitat in Yellowstone National Park [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>] and other locations [<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#188">188</a>,<a href="#236">236</a>]. Davis and Butterfield [<a href="#82">82</a>] also
include it among foods of the grizzly bear. Idaho fescue
is a common understory component of grouse habitat in Oregon [<a href="#69">69</a>], Idaho [<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#208">208</a>] and Montana [<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#179">179</a>,<a href="#180">180</a>,<a href="#263">263</a>].&nbsp;

It is comparable
(mean value) to other native
grass species in the early season but is less digestible than other grasses at
the end of the season [<a href="#23">23</a>]. Protein and phosphorus

[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#218">218</a>,<a href="#246">246</a>], while calcium remains about the same over the

Johnston [<a href="#23">23</a>] observed in-vitro digestibility of cellulose in cows and calculated
digestibility of protein in 32 plants species of the rough fescue association.
They found that the nutritional value of Idaho fescue was greatest in the
early season, during the leaf and heading stages, and decreased over subsequent
stages of seasonal growth. Bedell [<a href="#18">18</a>] reports similar
seasonal trends in Idaho fescue for crude protein, digestibility, and dry matter. Skovlin
[<a href="#251">251</a>] recorded the same trend in crude protein and
phosphorus, with a rise in protein content at the end of the growing season.
Other researchers report that the protein content of Idaho fescue remains higher
than associated grasses during the latter part of the growing season [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#251">251</a>]. Hickman [<a href="#128">128</a>] found
crude protein&nbsp;was high in early spring
and deficient during seed formation, with ash content
increasing as protein decreased. Fat content was lower than that of the other grasses
sampled. Digestibility was low in early spring, peaked in May, and was still higher
than other species in the fall [<a href="#128">128</a>]. Elliot and Flinders [<a href="#99">99</a>] found Idaho fescue had the
highest average crude
protein content and comparable calcium, phosphorus, and moisture content compared
to bluebunch wheatgrass and alpine timothy (<i>Phleum alpinum</i>) in
a wilderness mountain meadow in Idaho.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subframeText"> Nutritive values for Idaho fescue were highest for plants growing in

In many areas where Idaho fescue is a late seral community dominant,
grasslands are currently occupied by non-native species [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>,<a href="#155">155</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>] or
have species compositions that deviate from historical communities
and favor less desirable species [<a href="#115">115</a>]. The
practice of seeding with native species
in restoration efforts has had a &quot;disappointing history,&quot; with some non-native species establishing more rapidly and
having better
longevity than native species (e.g., [<a href="#152">152</a>,<a href="#183">183</a>]). Johnson and others [<a href="#145">145</a>]
cite little success with rangeland improvement seedings, because preferred grass species
are sought
out by grazers immediately after germination. Despite
these difficulties, the trend in restoration requires use of native species such as Idaho
fescue to satisfy the mandate of ecosystem management
[<a href="#42">42</a>]. Chambers and others [<a href="#56">56</a>] suggest inclusion of
late successional species in reseeding programs is important for restoration of ecosystem function.



</p>
<p>Idaho fescue is slow
to establish [<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#286">286</a>], but once established, has abundant growth of fine leaves
that provide effective ground cover,
and high yields of tough, fine, fibrous roots that control erosion and improve soil
structure [<a href="#119">119</a>]. It has poor
tolerance to salinity [<a href="#286">286</a>], although Ho [<a href="#134">134</a>] suggests this
may be overcome through inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi. Idaho fescue is
suitable for year-round planting (fair in winter) [<a href="#286">286</a>], has good stand maintenance [<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#286">286</a>],
and retards or prevents the
invasion of weeds <span class="subframeName"> once firmly established </span>[<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>]. Its close
relative, sheep fescue (<i>Festuca ovina</i>), provides excellent ground cover
and has a dense root mass that improves soil structure, holds the soil in place,
and resists
invasion of cheatgrass (<i>Bromus tectorum</i>) and other weeds [<a href="#168">168</a>].&nbsp;


</p>
<p>The competitive influence of invasive species such as
spotted knapweed (<i>Centaurea maculosa</i>) and cheatgrass can interfere with the re-establishment of
slower growing, native perennials [<a href="#169">169</a>,<a href="#183">183</a>]. 


Borman and others [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>] found Idaho fescue was 1 of the perennial
grasses that, once established, suppressed resident annual plant
production.&nbsp; Nasri and Deoescher [<a href="#209">209</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>]
studied the effects of competition by cheatgrass on shoot growth of Idaho fescue
and found that increasing cheatgrass cover depleted soil moisture and
reduced growth of Idaho fescue; however, Idaho fescue produced greater tiller and leaf
numbers than did cheatgrass. Lindquist and others [<a href="#169">169</a>] found Idaho
fescue had no impact on spotted knapweed growth in greenhouse studies.&nbsp;Furthermore,
Marler and others [<a href="#176">176</a>] found that vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae enhance spotted
knapweed's competitive dominance over Idaho fescue.</p>
<p> Site preparation and seeding method are important considerations for
rehabilitation of disturbed sites.
Everett [<a href="#103">103</a>] found that the litter of singleleaf pinyon (<i>Pinus monophylla</i>) appeared to
inhibit
emergence of Idaho fescue. Vallentine
and Stevens [<a href="#287">287</a>] suggested using livestock to &quot;graze out&quot;
invading cheatgrass as site preparation for reseeding with perennials including
Idaho fescue. Seedling emergence
is greater when seed is protected with mulch [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>] or is mixed with an earlier seral, rapid-developing grass
[<a href="#119">119</a>]. Chambers and others [<a href="#56">56</a>] found seeds collected from the Beartooth
Plateau in Montana had high viability and high germination under all conditions in
the laboratory and suggested that adequate field germination could be obtained by
employing a
variety of seeding methods such as surface sowing and shallow drilling.</p>
<p>Selection of seed is an important consideration in any
revegetation program. Idaho fescue exhibits ecotypic development expressed in
differential growth characteristics in seeds collected from different habitat
types [<a href="#89">89</a>]. Seeds of Idaho fescue collected from a pristine
population produced plants with more aboveground biomass than plants collected from degraded
sites, and exhibited a different response to competition than those from the
degraded site [<a href="#209">209</a>]. Plants grown from seed taken from populations
that evolved with frequent and intense defoliation tend to have shorter and more prostrate
genotypes [<a href="#209">209</a>].
Shaw and Cooper [<a href="#246">246</a>] claim that Idaho fescue has not been
successful in Montana reseeding programs, but used seed collected at low elevations to reseed
a site at 9,300 feet (2790 m). 


Age of seed is also an important consideration when seeding with Idaho fescue
[<a href="#54">54</a>]. Eddleman [<a href="#97">97</a>] found germination was highest with new seed (3 months old)
and declined with seed age, although cold temperatures (4 <sup>o</sup>C) promoted
germination for older (15 months) seed. Maguire and others [<a href="#172">172</a>] suggest matriconditioning of
seed (with Ca<span class="subframeName"><sub>2</sub></span>Si) to
improve germination rates.&nbsp;Holzworth and Lacey [<a href="#137">137</a>] discuss 2 cultivars of Idaho fescue with potential for restoration programs. Information
is available regarding the seed collection and production, planting, and monitoring
[<a href="#174">174</a>].</p>
<p>Majerus [<a href="#173">173</a>] lists Idaho fescue among
the native plant species found to reestablish naturally on disturbed sites in
Yellowstone and Glacier national parks, and cites its use in seed mixtures for
restoration of fescue grasslands in those areas. 


 Youtie [<a href="#315">315</a>] used seed propagated in the greenhouse to establish Idaho
fescue in a small native plant garden on the Columbia River Gorge
National Scenic Area, Oregon. A similar small-scale project using propagules of Idaho
fescue and 12 other native species was initiated at Jenkin's Creek Park, Washington,
in 1989 [<a href="#8">8</a>]. Thomas and Gamon [<a href="#267">267</a>] had
good success establishing Idaho fescue on a restoration project in
western Washington (&lt; 10% mortality of planted seedlings). Meier and
Weaver [<a href="#189">189</a>] provide detailed information on roadside rehabilitation and
suggest that Idaho fescue establishes well. Additional guidelines for planting
can be found in several publications [<a href="#246">246</a>,<a href="#292">292</a>,<a href="#295">295</a>].

<p class="subframeText">

Grazing can stimulate plant vitality and play a beneficial role in community
stability; the key is timely grazing of plants and moderate use of the
community [<a href="#144">144</a>]. The amount of use that Idaho fescue can sustain
without adversely affecting vigor is dependent on numerous conditions
including the combination of livestock and wildlife using the range, plant
phenology, the
type of grazing system used, competition from
associated vegetation, plant vigor at the time of use, and site conditions
[<a href="#205">205</a>]. Mueggler [<a href="#204">204</a>] found maximum
leaf length was a good indicator of vigor in Idaho fescue, but noted that <span class="subframeName">
because of yearly variations in weather conditions, </span>evaluation of vigor requires comparison with protected plants of normal
vigor. Many approaches to determining vigor for
Idaho
fescue have been used, sometimes with contradictory results. Mueggler
and
Stewart [<a href="#205">205</a>] concluded that the only reliable approach was to observe the response of
the vegetation over a period of years. 
</p>

<p class="subframeText"> Idaho fescue is a decreaser under heavy grazing by livestock
[<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#301">301</a>] and wildlife [<a href="#107">107</a>]. Several studies have
reported Idaho fescue as less abundant on areas grazed by livestock compared to ungrazed areas
[<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#291">291</a>,<a href="#294">294</a>,<a href="#310">310</a>]. Olson and Wallander [<a href="#213">213</a>]
found root and shoot biomass were 38 and 27% less on grazed than on
ungrazed plants, while carbohydrate pools were similar for grazed and ungrazed
plants. In contrast, spotted knapweed biomass was unchanged by
grazing;
suggesting that repeated grazing may reduce the ability of Idaho fescue to
compete with invading spotted knapweed when both species are grazed [<a href="#213">213</a>]. Merrill and others
[<a href="#191">191</a>] found that at
the end of the growing season, standing dead material on Idaho fescue plants was less in cattle-grazed
sites than on ungrazed sites; however, standing Idaho fescue biomass and crown biomass were equal
on grazed and
ungrazed sites. In an exclosure study including Idaho fescue sites in Wyoming and Montana, Stohlgren and others [<a href="#259">259</a>] report that Idaho fescue showed
inconsistent responses to grazing. Other studies show similar, equivocal
responses [<a href="#199">199</a>,<a href="#304">304</a>,<a href="#305">305</a>]. In northwest Wyoming, Jones [<a href="#149">149</a>] found
Idaho fescue decreased under cattle
grazing but remained relatively unchanged by elk grazing. 


</p>
<p class="subframeText">I<span class="subframeName">n
Yellowstone National Park, </span>Coughenour and others [<a href="#65">65</a>] found no differences in
Idaho fescue cover in exclosed and unexclosed range. Also in Yellowstone
National Park, vegetative culms
of Idaho fescue were shorter on areas grazed by elk and bison than culms on
ungrazed areas. Grazing did not affect the number of
vegetative culms or the height or number of reproductive culms of grasses
[<a href="#250">250</a>]. Dead
bunchgrass clumps (expected on an overgrazed range) did not vary between grazed
and ungrazed sites. Grass biomass was lower on grazed sites in 1986, the drier
year, but not different in 1987 [<a href="#250">250</a>].&nbsp; 


</p>
<p class="subframeText">Northern pocket gopher activity can aggravate impacts of
grazing livestock and can prevent
the return of Idaho fescue on overgrazed ranges [<a href="#264">264</a>,<a href="#265">265</a>]. Idaho fescue decreases as
northern pocket gopher activity increases
[<a href="#301">301</a>], and can give way to <i>Bromus</i> and other undesirable species [<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#310">310</a>].&nbsp;The dense
roots of Idaho fescue are not preferred forage of northern pocket gophers. They
may protect other plants growing among them
[<a href="#252">252</a>], preventing
occupation by <span class="subframeName">northern pocket </span>gophers where turf is intact [<a href="#265">265</a>]. &nbsp; 


</p>
<p class="subframeText"> Anderson and Scherzinger [<a href="#7">7</a>] report
improvement of range for elk with cattle grazing through a detailed resource
management system.
Preconditioning in this manner has been reported to extend the grazing season and improve
production of viable seed in Idaho fescue [<a href="#6">6</a>]. Anderson and others [<a href="#6">6</a>] measured a 38% increase in
Idaho fescue cover after
grazing by elk for 24 years, thereby re-establishing habitat for blue grouse. Late-seral grasslands dominated by
Idaho fescue may provide the best forage for grass-eating ruminants, but mid-seral
stages of Idaho fescue associations may offer more to all users of grasslands due to their
greater plant species diversity [<a href="#144">144</a>].&nbsp; 


</p>
<p class="subframeText"> Bunchgrasses best
tolerate
light grazing after seed formation [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#195">195</a>]. Britton and others [<a href="#38">38</a>] observed the effects of harvest date on
basal area of 5 bunchgrasses in eastern Oregon, including Idaho fescue, and found
grazing from August to October (after seed set) has the least impact on these
bunchgrasses, while plants
harvested in May showed a 40% reduction in basal area, due primarily to
reductions in Idaho fescue
and Thurber needlegrass (<i>Achnatherum thurberianum</i>). Idaho fescue is most sensitive to defoliation from
flowering to seed ripening [<a href="#144">144</a>,<a href="#195">195</a>,<a href="#202">202</a>]. Johnson and Simon [<a href="#146">146</a>] suggest avoiding early grazing
that will deter seed
formation. Johnston and others [<a href="#148">148</a>] discusses &quot;dates of readiness
for grazing&quot; for fescue grassland, using seed set as an important
indicator. Beetle [<a href="#20">20</a>] found Idaho fescue could withstand moderate,
continuous grazing on sedimentary soils, but even light grazing reduced its vigor
on granitic soils [<a href="#205">205</a>]. The greatest modification of Idaho fescue communities
in the Blue Mountains of Oregon occurs
with several consecutive seasons
of early spring grazing, when soils are often wet and trampling can dislodge
plants [<a href="#145">145</a>].&nbsp; 


</p>
<p class="subframeText">Abundant information exists on different grazing systems
and management approaches for Idaho
fescue grasslands [<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>,<a href="#205">205</a>,<a href="#276">276</a>,<a href="#311">311</a>]. Idaho fescue is favored by light to moderate grazing [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#246">246</a>] and is moderately
resistant to trampling [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#246">246</a>]. Heavy grazing may lead
to replacement of Idaho fescue with alien species such as cheatgrass [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#246">246</a>], and can adversely affect soil fertility [<a href="#147">147</a>].&nbsp; 


</p>
<p class="subframeText">Control of associated woody species tends to improve
yield and diversity of Idaho fescue communities [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#194">194</a>,<a href="#196">196</a>,<a href="#200">200</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#262">262</a>]. Mueggler [<a href="#203">203</a>] found
reducing competition
through tilling and clipping more than offset the effects of even extreme
clipping (100% herbage removal at flowering) on the volume of herbage and number
of flowerstalks produced the following year in Idaho fescue plants. Overstory
removal in ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir communities leads to an increase
in yield and abundance of Idaho
fescue [<a href="#184">184</a>,<a href="#197">197</a>].&nbsp;Three summers of domestic sheep
grazing to reduce spotted knapweed led to an increase in Idaho fescue plant
density, although leaves and flowerstems on these plants were shorter than in
ungrazed areas [<a href="#214">214</a>]. &nbsp; 


</p>
<p class="subframeText">At the edge of its ecological range (e.g., where it
occurs with Wyoming big sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata </i>ssp. <i>wyomingensis</i>)
in Oregon), Idaho fescue may be very sensitive
to heavy livestock utilization [<a href="#88">88</a>]. The big sagebrush
ecosystem is particularly sensitive to grazing, and bunchgrasses decrease rapidly
with severe defoliation [<a href="#100">100</a>]. Mueggler [<a href="#204">204</a>] studied the recovery rate of Idaho
fescue and bluebunch wheatgrass after heavy and extreme clipping and found that
Idaho fescue plants of moderately low vigor required about 3 years of protection
to recover normal vigor. He estimated that recovery from a state of low
vigor might take more than 6 years of protection.

<p class="subframeText">

Two cultivars of Idaho fescue have been developed that are adapted to variable climatic and soil
conditions in the Intermountain west and Pacific Northwest where precipitation ranges
from 14-31 inches (350-770 mm).&nbsp; They are cold and drought hardy, moderately shade tolerant, grow well
in ponderosa pine/big sagebrush, and persist on shallow, gravelly
to well-drained soils [<a href="#101">101</a>].

Idaho fescue is a vigorous, native, long-lived, perennial, cool-season, bunchgrass
[<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#261">261</a>]. Plants are strongly caespitose. Leaves are fine, dense, and mostly basal, with  sheaths remaining firm and entire
[<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>]. Culms are densely tufted in large bunches, with tuft 6 to 10 inches (15-25 cm) high, usually more than 1/2
the length of culms.  Culms are erect, from 1 to 3.3 feet (0.3-1 m) tall [<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>,<a href="#261">261</a>].  Spikelets are
5- to 6-flowered, with large, awned seeds
[<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>]. Plants have a strong root system [<a href="#124">124</a>] that can extend
16 inches (40 cm)
deep in a 4-inch (10 cm) diameter plant
[<a href="#306">306</a>]. In
well-drained soils, root biomass is greatest at 0.8- to 1.6-inch (2-4 cm) depths [<a href="#296">296</a>]. Goodwin
and Doescher [<a href="#111">111</a>] found that in
both disturbed and undisturbed sites, 40% of root biomass was contained in the upper
0.8 inch (2 cm) of soil, and 60% was in the upper 4 inches (10 cm) of soil. Idaho fescue roots are infected with
vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae, which may give it a competitive advantage over
non-mycorrhizal plants and/or allow it to thrive on nutrient-poor soils or
extreme environmental conditions [<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>,<a href="#198">198</a>].

Idaho fescue reproduces from seeds and tillers [<a href="#261">261</a>]. Seed&nbsp;production
varies: it may produce a fair amount of seed of high viability [<a href="#282">282</a>] and it may have poor seed production and weak seedling
vigor [<a href="#119">119</a>].

 Ensign and others [<a href="#101">101</a>] observed considerable variation in reproductive
success in Idaho fescue among and within ecotypes. Doescher and others [<a href="#89">89</a>] found
Idaho fescue seeds
selected from big sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i>) habitat types germinated better and faster over wider
temperature and water stress regimes than did seeds gathered from ponderosa pine
habitat types. They speculate that this may reflect the variability
of the environments in which the plants evolved. Chambers and others [<a href="#55">55</a>] note that
Idaho fescue establishment from seed in alpine areas is episodic and
dependent on proper environmental conditions for both seeds and seedlings in
consecutive years.&nbsp;&nbsp;



</p>
<p class="subframeText">Seeds are
produced in all but the driest years [<a href="#111">111</a>], but the percentage of
viable seeds varies
greatly from year to year [<a href="#54">54</a>]. Low seed viability may coincide with low seed fill,
which can indicate poor overall development [<a href="#56">56</a>]. Although Johnston and others [<a href="#148">148</a>] found no relationship
between plant basal area and the number of seeds produced in Idaho fescue on Alberta prairie
topsoil, they did find that plants not summer-grazed by cattle
produced larger seed crops than grazed plants.&nbsp;



</p>
<p class="subframeText">

 Chambers [<a href="#54">54</a>] observed a 13, 32, and 53% decrease in seed viability
over 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Goodwin and others [<a href="#110">110</a>] found Idaho fescue seed requires after-ripening.
 The after-ripening period
assures that at least 35% of the seed crop remains dormant for 6 months following
dispersal - a strategy that promotes germination after winter
precipitation has usually recharged soil moisture. Goodwin and others
 [<a href="#111">111</a>] found percent germination of Idaho fescue seed is related to soil water
potential, with fewer seeds germinating at higher water stress levels.

 Smyth [<a href="#254">254</a>] presents evidence of seedbanking in Idaho fescue in British Columbia.
 Seed dispersal is limited
to the immediate vicinity of the plant.



</p>
<p class="subframeText">Tillering in Idaho fescue arises from a relatively small
budding zone within a compact root crown area [<a href="#62">62</a>]. In cases of disturbance in
which the root crowns of Idaho fescue survive, tillering may result in a rapid
increase in size of Idaho fescue plants in non-competitive environments
[<a href="#145">145</a>,<a href="#209">209</a>].

SITE CHARACTERISTICS:</a>

<p class="subframeText">

Idaho fescue grows on many landforms, elevations, aspects, and soil
types. It occurs at elevations from 990 feet (300 m) in Oregon to nearly 13,200
feet (4000 m) in Colorado [<a href="#261">261</a>]. It thrives in
areas of 15 inches (380 mm) mean annual precipitation or greater [<a href="#295">295</a>], but is
also found in areas with lower precipitation (7.3 inches (186 mm) at 1 site in Oregon). Idaho fescue has broad
ecological amplitude and a wide range of productivity within and between habitat
types in which it is a dominant species [<a href="#205">205</a>]. Because of its ubiquity, site
characteristics are difficult to generalize. For example, Stubbendieck and
others [<a href="#261">261</a>] report that Idaho fescue is most abundant on well-drained loams with a neutral to
slightly alkaline pH, while other authors [<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>,<a href="#140">140</a>,<a href="#223">223</a>] report that it favors a slightly acid
pH. In the northern Rocky Mountain region
it is considered a species of the dry end of the moisture gradient, and in the
southern Rockies it is a species of the moist end [<a href="#75">75</a>].&nbsp;Since Idaho fescue occurs in a variety of
ecosystems (grassland, sagebrush, forest,
and alpine), it is probably most useful to
look at site characteristics within each of these ecosystems. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the grasslands of the Intermountain region, Idaho fescue occurs in valleys,
canyons, benches, slopes, and rolling hills bordering
sagebrush/grasslands, juniper woodlands, or the lower treeline [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#187">187</a>,<a href="#219">219</a>]. It is most commonly found in mesic grasslands, but is
also a component of the more xeric grasslands dominated by bluebunch wheatgrass,
where it usually occupies the cooler, moister microsites on north and east aspects
[<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>,<a href="#271">271</a>]. It can be found on south-facing slopes at
higher elevations [<a href="#120">120</a>]. It is found on a variety of parent materials and soil depths,
but is most productive on well-drained, loamy to
sandy soils [<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#205">205</a>]. In a
western Montana grassland on morainal mounds in the upper Blackfoot Valley, Idaho
fescue tolerated the widest extremes of environmental conditions
present, though it did show a gradual decrease on south and southwest exposures
of the mounds [<a href="#31">31</a>].&nbsp;In the biscuit
scablands (areas of rolling topography on basic
flow lavas with &quot;biscuits&quot; of soil between islands of very shallow
soil over lava) in eastern Oregon, Idaho fescue grows in the cool moist
microsites of the biscuits [<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#315">315</a>].</p>
<p>In semi-arid sagebrush (<i>Artemisia</i> spp.) grasslands, Idaho fescue is found with bluebunch wheatgrass but is
restricted to the cooler, moister
sites [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#313">313</a>,<a href="#316">316</a>], and tends to be found on deeper, well-drained, loamy to sandy
textured soils [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>,<a href="#237">237</a>]. Idaho fescue occurs as a dominant or co-dominant species
on cool, moist microsites protected from wind, where there is more snow retention and less moisture loss
than on less protected sites [73,<font color="#000000">294</font>]. In a study of soil properties in big and low sagebrush
(<i>Artemisia arbuscula</i>) communities in
southern Idaho, Fosberg and Hironaka [<a href="#105">105</a>] concluded that moisture availability
was more important than parent material in determining the distribution of
bluebunch wheatgrass and Idaho fescue.&nbsp;When compared with 5 common grasses in the
Great Basin (bluebunch wheatgrass, Thurber needlegrass, needle-and-thread grass
(<i>Hesperostipa comata</i>), galleta (<i>Pleuraphis jamesii</i>), and Indian
ricegrass (<i>Achnatherum hymenoides</i>), Idaho fescue
and bluebunch wheatgrass were associated with soils in wetter and colder
climates and with a slightly more acidic pH, higher water-holding
capacity, higher clay contents, and lower bulk density than soils of other
grasses. Idaho fescue had the
narrowest environmental tolerances [<a href="#223">223</a>].&nbsp;Johnson [<a href="#144">144</a>] says that moisture availability (which is enhanced by deeper soils and cooler
microsites) determines the
ability of Idaho fescue to persist at lower elevations.</p>
<p>Everett
[<a href="#103">103</a>] examined the possibility of allelopathic effects of singleleaf pinyon and
Utah juniper litter on seedling
emergence of Idaho fescue, and found that the presence of litter can be a
negative factor if seed is buried. Where Idaho fescue occurs in forest habitats with
limber
pine, ponderosa pine, and Douglas-fir, it is usually on the cool, dry aspects that
border&nbsp;sagebrush-grass communities [<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>,<a href="#221">221</a>,<a href="#256">256</a>].</p>
<p>In the northern Rocky Mountains, Idaho fescue also occurs in mountain
parks at upper elevations where tree growth is inhibited [<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#170">170</a>,<a href="#193">193</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>,<a href="#225">225</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>]. Daubenmire [<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>] speculates that the occurrence of these small parks
in northern Idaho and eastern Washington represents areas of soil drought that
may have resulted from the transfer of
snow from the windward to the leeward slopes. Jensen [<a href="#143">143</a>] cites Idaho fescue as
1 of the major grasses at
4,950-9,900 feet (1500-3000 m) on Caribou National Forest, southeastern Idaho.
On these sites, moisture becomes limiting soon after
snowpack melts, producing drought conditions that dominate through most summer
months on predominantly cold, cryic soils. Weaver and Collins [<a href="#297">297</a>] found Idaho fescue
decreased in abundance with increasing snowpack in Montana.
Several authors [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#220">220</a>,<a href="#225">225</a>,<a href="#245">245</a>] have described
alpine and subalpine communities with Idaho fescue
as an important, sometimes dominant, component in several western states. Idaho fescue is the
dominant understory species on many of the most arid whitebark pine sites [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#256">256</a>].&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Mollisols are most commonly associated with grassland ecosystems; however, Nimlos and Tomer [<a href="#211">211</a>] found
Mollisols under dry end Douglas-fir forests in
southwest Montana, usually on sites where Idaho fescue is among the understory grass component.
These sites may have been grasslands that were invaded by conifers. Similarly, the
 absence of Idaho fescue on unproductive Mollisols may indicate a disclimax
where Idaho fescue has
 been eliminated by disturbance.</p>

As a climax species, Idaho fescue is a common
component of many &quot;pristine,&quot; &quot;undisturbed,&quot; or
&quot;relict&quot; areas [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#140">140</a>,<a href="#268">268</a>,<a href="#272">272</a>].&nbsp;It is a major component of late-seral
ecosystems, but may also colonize suitable disturbed sites [<a href="#56">56</a>]. Idaho fescue communities may rely on periodic disturbance
such as soil and slope movement to rejuvenate and maintain vigor of the plant
community [<a href="#144">144</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<p>In cases where the level of disturbance
is such that cover of Idaho fescue decreases (e.g., heavy grazing pressure or
severe fire), Idaho fescue succeeds to various native
and non-native increaser species. Some
examples are bluegrasses (<i>Poa</i> spp.<i>) </i>[<a href="#171">171</a>,<a href="#279">279</a>,<a href="#294">294</a>], sagebrush
(<i>Artemisia </i>spp.) [<a href="#205">205</a>,<a href="#310">310</a>], rubber rabbitbrush (<i>Chrysothamnus nauseosus</i>) and
broom snakeweed (<i>Gutierrezia
sarothrae</i>) [<a href="#310">310</a>], needlegrasses (<i>Achnatherum</i>
and <i>Hesperostipa</i> spp.),<i> </i>lupine (<i>Lupinus</i> spp.)</font> [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#146">146</a>,<a href="#205">205</a>], phlox

In general, Idaho fescue starts growth in early spring, seeds mature by midsummer
[<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#261">261</a>], and dispersal is prompt [<a href="#110">110</a>]. Weaver and Collins [<a href="#297">297</a>] report that the time required for seed maturation varies
with different degrees of water stress - from 63 days
without water stress to 37 days with early water stress. Seed germination
requires 8 to 10 days [<a href="#103">103</a>]. From observations made in common snowberry/Idaho
fescue community and greenhouse studies, Daubenmire [<a href="#75">75</a>] speculated that the ability
of Idaho fescue to survive drought is related to its ability to germinate in
autumn and grow intermittently in winter during periods of favorable weather and
so be sufficiently advanced in development by the time drought intensifies in
early summer that it can aestivate.</p>
<p class="subframeText">Mueggler [<a href="#206">206</a>] compared dates of phenological
events for prominent grasses at 7,100 feet (2130 m) on southwestern and northeastern
exposures
in western Montana over 10 years. The start of growth was uncertain because green leaves were
frequently present at the time of snowmelt, probably because they overwintered
from fall regrowth. The following dates were recorded for phenology of Idaho
fescue on southwestern
exposures [<a href="#206">206</a>]:

<p>Idaho fescue is a small bunchgrass that can survive light-severity fires. It
is usually harmed by more severe fire [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#253">253</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>]. Fires burning at
10- to 25- year intervals have neutral to
negative effects on Idaho fescue [<a href="#2">2</a>]. Rapid tillering occurs when root crowns are not
killed and soil moisture is favorable [<a href="#145">145</a>,<a href="#231">231</a>]. Plants may re-establish from seed after fire if
temperatures are low enough to allow for survival of seed [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#294">294</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subframeText">

Native ranges and forests in which Idaho fescue occurs
have historically been subjected to fires at varying intervals. Native Americans
were probably an important ignition source in prehistoric Idaho fescue
grasslands [<a href="#2">2</a>]. Maintenance of grasslands in the Intermountain West
is dependent, in part, on periodic fires to remove dry matter and invading shrubs
and trees [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>]. A decrease in or loss

noted in many areas [<a href="#113">113</a>]. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p class="subframeText">The following table provides some fire regime

<p class="subframeText">

Idaho fescue grows in a dense, fine-leaved tuft. Fires tend to burn within the accumulated fine 
leaves at the base of the plant and may produce temperatures sufficient to kill some of the
root crown [<a href="#2">2</a>]. Mature Idaho fescue plants are commonly reported
to be severely damaged by fire in all seasons [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#253">253</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>]. Initial mortality may be
high (in excess of 75%) on severe burns, but usually varies
from 20 to 50% [<a href="#15">15</a>]. Idaho fescue is commonly reported to be more sensitive to
fire than bluebunch wheatgrass [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>]; however Robberecht and Defosse
[<a href="#231">231</a>], using special instrumentation to control the intensity and
duration of fire treatment for individual plants, suggested the latter was more sensitive.&nbsp;They
observed culm and biomass reduction with moderate fire severity in bluebunch
wheatgrass, whereas a high fire severity was required for this reduction in
Idaho fescue.&nbsp;Also, given the same fire severity treatment, postfire culm production
was initiated earlier and more rapidly in Idaho fescue [<a href="#231">231</a>].&nbsp;

Fire effects vary with condition and size of the plant, season and severity of fire,
and ecological conditions. Rapid burns leave little damage to root crowns,
and new tillers are produced with onset
of fall moisture [<a href="#145">145</a>]. This was the case with small
bunches of Idaho fescue when a &quot;hot&quot; June wildfire caused incomplete burning of the root crowns
on a western Montana grassland [<a href="#9">9</a>]. After decades of fire
exclusion and/or the absence of grazing, the thicker duff layer and dense, dry
crowns burn longer, so heat penetrates deeper and may kill the plants&nbsp;[<a href="#10">10</a>]. The dense culms may provide enough fuel to burn for hours after
the fire has passed, reaching temperatures as high as 1000<sup> </sup>degrees Fahrenheit (538
<sup>o</sup>C),
thus killing or seriously injuring the plant regardless of the intensity of the
fire [<a href="#309">309</a>]. Bunting [<a href="#44">44</a>] also points out that Idaho
fescue is sometimes rooted in the litter under western juniper (<i>Juniperus
occidentalis</i>) which will, of
course, burn.&nbsp;

<a name="PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE">
PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:</a>

<p class="subframeText">

Most studies show that fire initially reduces frequency
[<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>,<a href="#243">243</a>] and basal area [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#243">243</a>] of Idaho fescue. Recovery to prefire levels may require more than 25 years if
density is severely reduced [<a href="#15">15</a>], as was observed by Harniss
and Murray [<a href="#125">125</a>] in Idaho, where return to prefire cover took over 30 years after
summer prescribed burning in a big sagebrush/Idaho
fescue range. Effects of most fires are not, however, so extreme, and show a
wide range of responses. Idaho fescue plants burned in Nevada in
the spring of 1973
still showed signs of damage in 1976, but they were recovering [<a href="#16">16</a>]. Idaho fescue frequency was not
significantly (p&lt;0.05) different between burn and control plots 2 and 4 years after
prescribed burning on a mountain
big sagebrush/Idaho fescue site in Idaho [<a href="#175">175</a>]. On a lodgepole pine site in Idaho, Idaho fescue plants had regained vigor by the
3<sup>rd</sup> year and
showed improved vigor by the 5<sup>th</sup> year [<a href="#222">222</a>].&nbsp;Idaho
fescue resprouted after spring prescribed burns in central Oregon, and within 3 months more than 80% of
Idaho fescue plants had vigorous growth, with greater production in burned areas than
in adjacent unburned areas [<a href="#1">1</a>]. Forage biomass of burned Idaho fescue
grassland had surpassed that of unburned grassland following fires in Yellowstone National Park in both
grazed (by elk and some bison) and ungrazed portions, 2 years
after burning [<a href="#248">248</a>].&nbsp; 


</p>
<p class="subframeText"> Idaho fescue on burned areas may have more protein than those
on unburned
areas [<a href="#16">16</a>]. Singer and Harter [<a href="#248">248</a>] found that
digestibility of Idaho fescue was enhanced (for 1 year) on grazed but not on
ungrazed sites following the 1988 fires in Yellowstone National Park.&nbsp;Dry matter digestibility was higher in Idaho
fescue plants the 1<sup>st </sup>year following burning in Yellowstone, and both
digestibility and percent protein were higher the 2<sup>nd</sup> year [<a href="#212">212</a>].
Similarly, crude protein in Idaho fescue increased from 0.6 to 2.6% after spring burning in Douglas-fir and limber pine
in central Montana [<a href="#156">156</a>].&nbsp;

<p class="subframeText">

Plant response varies with fire severity, season of
burn, ecological condition at the time of the burn, and management
activities before and after burning [<a href="#2">2</a>]. Vigor of surviving Idaho fescue plants is reduced by
high severity
fires because
the root crown's budding zone is confined to a relatively small area at or above the
surface of the ground where it may be exposed to higher temperatures for
prolonged periods [<a href="#62">62</a>].&nbsp;Spring prescribed burns in
a Nevada big sagebrush/grassland were
classified as &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cool&quot; fires, and cool fires resulted in only a small decrease
in Idaho fescue cover, while hot burns resulted in a significant (p&lt;0.05) decrease that recovered
to prefire
levels in 3 years [<a href="#162">162</a>].&nbsp;

<p class="subframeText">Idaho fescue is sensitive to severe burns in late summer
and early fall in eastern Oregon [<a href="#146">146</a>]. Such fires favor succession to forbs in Idaho fescue plant associations
[<a href="#2">2</a>]. Both
number of plants and basal crown area were severely reduced in Idaho fescue
following an August wildfire on northern California perennial range and remained
reduced 5 years later [<a href="#66">66</a>]. A hot June wildfire in a Montana
grassland reduced biomass and cover of Idaho fescue. The damaged clumps
failed to produce much autumn growth, so Idaho fescue cover remained low in the following
spring in favor of forb species. Idaho fescue recovered completely (98% of unburned cover) 3
years after the fire [<a href="#9">9</a>]. Spring and late fall burns on sites with good soil moisture and
favorable Idaho fescue root
reserves are thought to injure
plants less [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>,<a href="#314">314</a>]. Britton and others [<a href="#37">37</a>]
observed greater plant damage with
late August than mid-October burning; however, they also found that plants watered
immediately before or after
burning had the greatest basal area reduction and produced the least re-growth. They
explained that with increasing water content, thermal conductivity increases,
and therefore the potential for the heat pulse to reach the grass' meristematic
tissue faster and remain at lethal temperatures longer exists when
soils are wet.&nbsp; 


</p>
<p class="subframeText">Idaho fescue is tolerant of late-season burning
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#308">308</a>], but again, results are varied. Armour and others [<a href="#10">10</a>] saw recovery to preburn levels of Idaho
fescue in 3 years after fall prescribed burning in
Douglas-fir/ninebark (<i>Physocarpus malvaceus</i>) habitat type in Idaho. Britton and Clark [<a href="#40">40</a>]
compared early May, mid-June, and mid-October burns in eastern Oregon and found highest mortality
in early May (30%), and no mortality in mid-June or mid-October. Corresponding basal area
reductions were 48% in May, 52% in June, and 34% in October [<a href="#40">40</a>]. A comparison of spring and fall burning in
Idaho fescue grassland in Oregon
showed no difference for season of burn [<a href="#277">277</a>]. A significant (p&lt;0.05) decrease in Idaho
fescue cover occurred in both seasons, although frequency was not
reduced, and Idaho fescue remained the dominant prairie species [<a href="#277">277</a>].
Conversely, Shwecke and Hann [<a href="#243">243</a>] observed 25% kill of
Idaho fescue after a spring burn, compared with 40% kill after a fall burn, in a Douglas-fir and
big sagebrush/grass mosaic in western Montana.
There was a similar decrease in basal crown sizes for both burns, but the canopy cover of surviving
fescue (<i>Festuca</i> spp.) plants
almost doubled compared to prefire canopy cover. Sagebrush sites became dominated by fescues
1 year after fire in both cases [<a href="#243">243</a>]. Another comparison of spring and fall
burning found that fall burning killed 20% of the Idaho fescue population
and reduced basal area by 23% the 1<sup>st</sup> year. Spring burning resulted in no significant
change in basal area and only 3.5% mortality. Plants recovered to 90% of their
preburn size by the 2<sup>nd</sup> year after the fall burn [<a href="#238">238</a>]. Idaho fescue is sensitive to burning
in any season in areas where it is at the margins of
its ecological range [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>].&nbsp; 


</p>
<p class="subframeText">Fire in water-limited environments generally reduces the
productivity of grasses during the 1st postfire growing season [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#231">231</a>,<a href="#307">307</a>], and in many cases
reduces productivity of Idaho fescue for several years to come [<a href="#125">125</a>].&nbsp;Defosse and Robberecht
[<a href="#84">84</a>]
used a special device to apply similar fire severity levels inside the
meristematic root crown region to several Idaho fescue and bluebunch wheatgrass plants and
followed the treatment with different levels of competition simulated by
removing varying amounts of aboveground biomass of neighboring potential
competitors. Idaho fescue did show
meristematic damage after the fire, but no mortality was observed. Regrowth&nbsp;occurred within 15 days - more rapidly than bluebunch
wheatgrass. Subsequent competition reduced root production and restricted aboveground
productivity by
115% in Idaho fescue, and by 70% for bluebunch wheatgrass. These results suggest
that survival and productivity following fires is related to subsequent soil water
availability. A species with roots concentrated in upper soil layers (e.g., Idaho
fescue) will experience a decline of water availability when compared with a deeper
rooted species (e.g., bluebunch wheatgrass), thus affecting subsequent growth
[<a href="#84">84</a>].
This may help explain why many studies show that Idaho fescue is more severely
damaged by fire than bluebunch wheatgrass [<a href="#2">2</a>].&nbsp; 


</p>
<p class="subframeText">Conrad and
Poulton [<a href="#62">62</a>] observed that Idaho fescue basal diameter
reduction was less after fire in grazed conditions (27%) than in ungrazed conditions
(40%). Idaho fescue basal area was reduced equally by burning and clipping (an average of
48%) in
May and June in eastern Oregon [<a href="#39">39</a>]. Other
treatment-date combinations (late summer and fall) did not significantly
(p&lt;0.05) reduce basal area,
suggesting that it is less susceptible to late-season defoliation than reported previously.&nbsp; 


</p>
<p class="subframeText">Recovery of Idaho fescue frequency is also a
function of seed production and germination after a fire. Sapsis [<a href="#238">238</a>] found
higher numbers of vegetative culms in burned plants compared with unburned
plants. Seed
production of Idaho fescue plants subjected to fall prescribed burning in the sagebrush/grassland
region in Idaho and Oregon was not different from seed production on unburned controls in postfire years 1
and 3, but was greater on a 5-year-old burn [<a href="#217">217</a>]. Both severe and lower-severity fire treatments reduce emergence of
Idaho fescue from seed [<a href="#57">57</a>]. Warg [<a href="#294">294</a>] cites a study
in which seeds of Idaho fescue are exposed to temperatures of 80,
100, 125, and
150 <sup>o</sup>C for periods of 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes. Germination was good for
seeds exposed to 80, 100 and 125 <sup>o</sup>C for
5 minutes, but did not occur beyond that temperature or time period. Clark and others
[<a href="#59">59</a>] studied the effects of fire on seed
banks and found the LD 50 for most seeds was between 70 to<sup> </sup>85 <sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp;

FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />
<p class="subframeText">

Fire suppression coupled with grazing pressure has
changed the structure of Idaho fescue communities, often by increasing
cover of woody species [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>]. Prescribed burning can be an effective management tool for all types of Idaho
fescue communities. Early spring burning is preferred in some cases e.g., [<a href="#163">163</a>,<a href="#243">243</a>], late season burning in others
(e.g., [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#238">238</a>,<a href="#308">308</a>]). Beardall and Sylvester
[<a href="#16">16</a>] recommend burning of big sagebrush/grasslands before or just after the
plants have broken dormancy, when root
reserves remain high, to improve survival of perennial species. Johnson
and Simon&nbsp;[<a href="#146">146</a>] suggest that cool, light burns
in late winter or
early
spring, when plant moisture levels are high, help protect root crowns from damage.&nbsp;Similarly,
Wright [<a href="#307">307</a>] suggests conducting burns when preferred plants are dormant, and
includes that it is better to burn during wet years and never during extended dry periods, so as to
not magnify drought stress on plants.&nbsp; 



</p>
<p class="subframeText">Bunting and others [<a href="#45">45</a>] concluded that postfire plant mortality and productivity
might be related to the
length of time grazing is excluded during postfire regeneration period. Early spring fire alone resulted in low mortality,
and early season defoliation (simulated grazing) after fire resulted in
50 % mortality for Idaho fescue. Detrimental effects were lessened when
defoliation was delayed by 1 growing season after fire [<a href="#45">45</a>]. In a big sagebrush/grassland in Idaho burned once in September of 1933,
again in
August
of 1936, and subsequently &quot;conservatively&quot; grazed after 1 full year of
protection, Blaisdell [<a href="#27">27</a>] observed no significant differences in total grass production on any severity
of burn 15 years after burning. Idaho fescue was, however, significantly
reduced, achieving prefire levels within 12 years after a light-severity burn,&nbsp;and at only
77 and 53% of prefire levels 12 years after a
moderate and heavy burn, respectively. All other grasses had recovered beyond
prefire levels by postfire year [<a href="#27">27</a>].&nbsp;
