<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Gaylussacia dumosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Dwarf huckleberry is a small, deciduous, erect, much-branched,
rhizomatous shrub which grows from 12 to 30 inches (30-75 cm) in height
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].  Many stems ascend from the base, forming a low, dense, rounded
crown.  The twigs are usually copiously pubescent with short, curly
hairs.  The small deciduous leaves are simple, leathery, obovate to
elliptical with the lower surface typically glandular.  The bell-shaped
tubular flowers are borne on racemes at the end of the branchlets.  The
fruit is a berry with 10 nutlets, each carrying one seed [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte (nanophanerophyte)
   Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Dwarf huckleberry can reproduce through seed, although details have not
been described [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Seeds are dispersed by a variety of birds and
mammals [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Dwarf huckleberry sprouts from underground rhizomes or
runners after aboveground vegetation is removed by fire or other types
of disturbance [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Dwarf huckleberry commonly grows in pine forest or pine barrens, and at
the edge of shrub-tree bogs, pitcher plant bogs, and bays [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].
Dwarf huckleberry grows on xeric to mesic sites with well-drained sandy
to clayey soils [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].

Common overstory associates of dwarf huckleberry include eastern red
cedar (Juniperus virginiana), tamarack (Larix laracina), redbay (Persea
borbonia), sweetbay (Magnolia virginia), and flowering dogwood (Cornus
florida).  Common understory associates include dangleberry (Gaylussacia
frondosa), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), fetterbush (Leucothoe racemosa), and
blueberry (Vaccinium spp.)  [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Fire is an integral part of pine barrens, pine flatwoods, and sand pine
scrub communities in which dwarf huckleberry grows [<a href="#2">2</a>].  These
communities have been described as "pyric disclimax" or fire climax
communities.  Fire in these communities does not initiate multistage
succession but instead rejuvenates species which were present in the
preburn community, such as dwarf huckleberry [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Dwarf huckleberry flowers in early spring; the fruit ripens in late
summer or early fall [<a href="#11">11</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Gaylussacia dumosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Dwarf huckleberry is well able to persist despite periodic fire [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].
Abrahamson [<a href="#2">2</a>] reports that dwarf huckleberry "exhibits a 'sit and wait'
strategy, in that plants apparently survive with little aboveground
biomass for long periods of time before fire causes release from shading
and/or nutrient depletion."  Dwarf huckleberry typically sprouts from
underground rhizomes after the foliage is consumed by fire [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Birds
and mammals may transport some seed to burned sites.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving rhizomes
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by animals or water; postfire yr 1&2

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Gaylussacia dumosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire typically kills aboveground portions of dwarf huckleberry [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].
Underground rhizomes are generally protected from the damaging effects
of heat and apparently survive most fires.  


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Fire stimulates the growth of dwarf huckleberry [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>].  Density and
cover of dwarf huckleberry reached peak levels 1 year after a January
prescribed burn in central Florida [<a href="#2">2</a>]

Plants will typically sprout from underground rhizomes after aboveground
vegetation is consumed [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fruit production of dwarf huckleberry was higher on burned sites than on
unburned sites [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>].  Fire exclusion greatly reduced density and cover
of dwarf huckleberry on slash pine (Pinus elliottii) plantations in
Georgia [<a href="#14">14</a>].
