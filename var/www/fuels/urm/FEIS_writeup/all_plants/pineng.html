<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus engelmannii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Apache pine has a very limited distribution in the United States.  It
occurs in the Chiricahua, Huachuca, Dragoon, and Santa Rita mountains of
Arizona and in one area of extreme southwestern New Mexico [13,18,34,
42,61].  The main part of its range is in Mexico.  Apache pine occurs
commonly in the Sierra Madre Occidental, extending southward from the
United States border to Zacatecas [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Apache pine primarily occurs in Madrean pine-oak and oak-pine forests
and woodlands.  Codominant and subdominant species that occur with
Apache pine in these communities are Chihuahua pine (Pinus leiophylla
var.  chihuahuana), Mexican pinyon (P. cembroides), and alligator
juniper (Juniperus deppeana); the understories are predominatly oak
(Quercus spp.) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  The communities may extend upward
into the mixed pine forests [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Apache pine forms open stands and is widely scattered in mixed pine
forests with Arizona pine, Chihuahua pine, and southwestern white pine
(P. strobiformis) [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].

Apache pine is the principal species in the Apache pine series
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].

Scattered Apache pine occur in riparian habitats.  Along streamsides,
Apache pine is a minor species in some stands of Chihuahua pine/pinyon
ricegrass (Piptochaetium fimbriatum) habitat types and is codominant in
Arizona cypress (Cupressus arizonica) types [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  It is a
minor species in the Arizona sycamore (Platanus wrightii) series and
community types [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].

Apache pine is listed as a dominant or indicator species in the
following publications:

(1)  Classification of the forest vegetation on the National Forests of
       Arizona and New Mexico [<a href="#1">1</a>]
(2)  Forest and woodland habitat types (plant associations) of Arizona
       south of the Mogollon Rim and southwestern New Mexico [<a href="#6">6</a>]
(3)  A digitized computer-compatible classification for natural and
       potential vegetation in the Southwest with particular reference to
       Arizona [<a href="#11">11</a>]
(4)  A series vegetation classification for Region 3 [<a href="#39">39</a>]
(5)  A forest habitat type classification of southern Arizona and its
       relationship to forests of the Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico [<a href="#40">40</a>].

Species associated with Apache pine but not previously mentioned in
Occurrence and Distribution include Arizona madrone (Arbutus arizonica),
Apache plume (Fallugia paradoxa), western white honeysuckle (Lonicera
albiflora), and slimflower scurfpea (Psoralea tenuiflora) [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus engelmannii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
The limited distribution of Apache pine restricts its commercial
importance [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  The wood of Apache pine is hard and heavy
[<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  It is sometimes harvested with associated pines for lumber and
construction timbers.  Apache pine is used locally for fuel [<a href="#45">45</a>].
  


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Apache pine is of limited use to wildlife [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Birds, rodents, and
other animals consume its seeds [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  The intensity of seed
predation was not described in the literature.  However, Apache pine has
synchronous cone crops at irregular intervals [<a href="#52">52</a>]; such masting may
have evolved in response to heavy seed predation.

Mexican spotted owls are yearlong residents of the Madrean oak-pine
forests to which Apache pine belongs [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Apache pine provides cover for wildlife [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Apache pine was planted with 37 other pine species in trials on sandhill
sites in northwestern Florida.  It did not survive [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Apache pine was evaluated for suitability as a timber tree at the Wind
River Arboretum in Wyoming.  Most transplanted trees died; three trees
survived for 55 years.  At that time, they had poor vigor, needle
disease, snow and ice damage, and no reproduction [<a href="#51">51</a>].

Apache pine was included in a breeding program that studied pollen
production at the Eddy Arboretum in California.  Apache pine produced
pollen from April through June over a 6-year period [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Equations to estimate understory production have been developed for the
oak-pine forests in which Apache pine occurs [<a href="#22">22</a>].

In the oak-pine forests where Apache pine is an overstory tree, the
removal of large nest trees for fuelwood can reduce habitat suitability
for the Mexican spotted owl [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Apache pine is susceptible to southwestern dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium
vaginatum ssp. cryptopodum).  Control methods are discussed in the
literature [<a href="#27">27</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus engelmannii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Apache pine is a native, monoecious tree.  Mature individuals are 50 to
82 feet (15-25 m) tall and have trunk diameters from 14 to 32 inches
(35-80 cm) [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  The bark on mature trees is about 1.5 inches
(3.8 cm) thick [<a href="#25">25</a>].  The crown is open and round with few large
branches [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Evergreen needles are in bundles of three or
occasionally four or five and are 8 to 15 inches (20-38 cm) long
[<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Cones are 4 to 7 inches (10-18 cm) long and are borne in
pairs or groups of four [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Seeds are just over 0.25 inch (0.6
cm) long with large wings up to 1 inch (2.5 cm) long [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Apache pine reproduces by seed; no information on vegetative
reproduction was found in the literature.  Apache pine populations in
Chihuahua, Mexico, produce synchronous seed crops at irregular intervals
[<a href="#52">52</a>].  Apache pine begins to bear cones when 28 to 30 years old [<a href="#30">30</a>].
Although the intervals between large seed crops are 2 to 4 years, some
seeds are produced every year in parts of its range [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  Cones
mature in 2 years [<a href="#25">25</a>].  The seeds weigh only 0.002 ounces (0.05 g) and
are wind dispersed [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].  Animals consume some seed [<a href="#25">25</a>], but it was
not found in the literature whether animals contribute to effective
dispersal and establishment of Apache pine.

Information about cone and seed collection and seed germination
conditions are discussed in the literature [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Optimal germination
occurs on broken and washed mineral soil [<a href="#25">25</a>].

Apache pine seedlings tolerate significantly (P<0.05) lower light than
found in random microsites [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Seedlings and saplings have long
needles, about 6 inches in length (15 cm) [<a href="#33">33</a>], which may increase net
photosynthesis under low light conditions.

Apache pine seedlings produce a relatively deep taproot and little
top-growth during their first few years [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Near the lower
elevational limit of this species, Apache pine seedlings occur in
relatively moist microsites.  Just below the lowest elevational limit,
Apache pine seedlings die from water stress [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Juveniles and saplings
that have trunk diameters less than 2 inches (5 cm) at the base and are
less than 3.2 feet (1 m) tall have less effective root systems for
withstanding drought than mature trees [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Apache pine grows in climates that range from semiarid with bimodal
precipitation to temperate-subhumid with most precipitation falling in
summer [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].

Apache pine grows on dry to moderately moist canyon slopes, ridges,
mesas, lower slopes, valleys, and streamside terraces [6,15,39,43,
45,54].  Apache pine ranges from 5,000 to 9,100 feet (1,524-2,750 m) in
elevation [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].

Apache pine occurs on soils of varying depths and textures.  Soils can
be 4 to 6 inches (10-15 cm) deep with textures ranging from sandy to
clayey sand with gravel [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  Parent material can be igneous,
rhyolite, basalt, or schist [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Apache pine is shade tolerant during establishment [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  It becomes
shade intolerant after about 6 years [<a href="#25">25</a>].

The successional status of Apache pine depends on location and
associated species.  It may be seral to or climax with any of the
conifer species in mixed pine forests [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Apache pine is a climax
species in the Madrean pine-oak woodlands and forests [<a href="#6">6</a>].



<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Needles remain on Apache pine for 2 years.  Seed production requires 2
years [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Pollination occurs mainly during May [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Cones mature
from November to December of the second year [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Seeds disperse
from November to February [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus engelmannii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Mature Apache pine endure most fires and become dominant when fire
susceptible species are eliminated [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].

Apache pine grows in oak-pine woodlands; these are probably
fire-tolerant, fire-maintained communities, although the fire regime is
not well understood for these associations [<a href="#54">54</a>].  Apache pine occurs in
the Madrean oak-pine forest and adjacent conifer gallery forest in
Rhyolite Canyon in the Chiricahua National Monument, Arizona.
Historically, surface fires occurred episodically every 1 to 38 years
[<a href="#55">55</a>].  Based on the fire-scars of Apache pine, the mean fire interval
from 1655 to 1924 was 12.5 years in the lower canyon area [<a href="#54">54</a>].  Fire
intervals increased with livestock grazing and the subsequent reduction
in surface fuels [<a href="#55">55</a>].

Fire is characteristic of interior ponderosa pine forests.  Fires from
these communities may extend downward into mixed pine or oak-pine
forests in which Apache pine occurs.  In the Rincon Mountains close to
the northern latitudinal limits of Apache pine, the estimated mean fire
intervals from 1757 to 1983 for Arizona pine communities ranged from 1
to 13 years [<a href="#3">3</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus engelmannii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire effects on Apache pine are probably influenced most by tree size
and fire intensity.  Apache pine seedlings and saplings are probably
killed by fire.  With thicker bark and deeper roots, mature trees are
fire resistant [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Once shed, the small seeds with large wings are
probably killed by fire unless they are covered with an insulating layer
of soil.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
The response of Apache pine to fire was not described in the literature.
Since regeneration of Apache pine is exclusively through seed, rates of
regeneration are probably dependent on survival of mature trees within
the burn and the proximity of seed trees.  Seeds will germinate in
mineral soil exposed by fire as long as adequate moisture is present.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Increased grazing coupled with fire suppression has resulted in crowded,
stunted Apache pine with high amounts of litter and dead fuel in the
oak-pine communities [<a href="#36">36</a>].  This increases the fire hazard in these
communities.

Fire is the primary control for southwestern dwarf mistletoe infection.
Prescribed understory burning has been used in interior ponderosa pine
forests to control this pathogen [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Since Apache pine and interior
ponderosa pine respond similarly to southwestern dwarf mistletoe
infection [<a href="#27">27</a>], fire may be useful for controlling mistletoe in Apache pine.
