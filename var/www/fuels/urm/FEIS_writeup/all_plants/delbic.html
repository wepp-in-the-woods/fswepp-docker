<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Delphinium bicolor

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Low larkspur is utilized by elk, mule deer, white-tailed deer, pronghorn,
upland game birds, small nongame birds, and small mammals [<a href="#4">4</a>].  

Low larkspur is very poisonous to cattle [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatibility of low larkspur is rated fair for sheep and poor to
fair for cattle and horses [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Low larkspur is poor in protein and energy value [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Low larkspur provides fair cover for small nongame birds and small
mammals [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Larkspur species are cultivated as ornamentals [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Crushed larkspurs
were used by Native Americans for controlling lice and other insects [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Low larkspur is toxic to cattle and causes some losses in the spring and
early summer.  However, it dries rapidly and senesces after seed set.
It is, therefore, probably safe to graze after seed set [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].

Low larkspur is less toxic and more palatable to sheep than cattle.  It
is considered fairly good forage for sheep [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].

Low larkspur increases in response to grazing [<a href="#20">20</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Delphinium bicolor
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Low larkspur is a native, perennial forb with an extensively branched
fibrous to slightly fleshy root system.  Stems are usually solitary and
are 4 to 16 inches (10-40 cm) tall.  Fruits are many-seeded follicles.
Seeds are irregularly winged and about 0.08 inches (0.2 cm) long
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Low larkspur mainly reproduces by seed [<a href="#17">17</a>].  It is pollinated by bees,
and probably self-pollinates as well [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Low larkspur may reproduce
vegetatively [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Low larkspur is found on sites ranging from open woods and grasslands to
subalpine scree [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  It appears early in the spring, often at
the edges of receding snowbanks [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Low larkspur will grow in
fairly dry to moist conditions [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  It grows best in rich, black,
sandy loams or clay loams and in soils of limestone or granitic origin
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>].  It is found on gentle to steep slopes.  Low larkspur is found at
elevations of 4,600 to 11,600 feet (1,400-3,500 m) in Wyoming and 3,000
to 10,500 feet (900-3,200 m) in Montana [<a href="#4">4</a>].
 


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Low larkspur prefers sites with full sun exposure [<a href="#18">18</a>].  It colonizes
recently disturbed sites [<a href="#4">4</a>] and is often found on gravel banks and
along roadcuts [<a href="#8">8</a>].  On alpine tundra sites of the Beartooth Plateau,
Montana, low larkspur is associated with natural ground disturbance,
such as areas of rodent activity [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Low larkspur begins growth as soon as snow melts in the spring.  It
flowers from June to July [<a href="#17">17</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Delphinium bicolor
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Information on adaptations of low larkspur for survival following fire
is not available in the literature.  Larkspur species seeds may survive
in the soil seedbank [<a href="#18">18</a>].  If low larkspur reproduces vegetatively [<a href="#4">4</a>],
it may sprout after fire.
 


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Low larkspur is probably killed by most fires.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Information regarding the response of low larkspur following fire is
lacking in available literature.  Low larkspur was present in postfire
years 1 and 3 following an August wildfire in ponderosa pine (Pinus
ponderosa) stands in Idaho [<a href="#13">13</a>].

NO-ENTRY
