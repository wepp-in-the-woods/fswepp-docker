<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The accepted scientific name for goldthread is Coptis groenlandica
(Oeder) Fern.  There are no recognized subspecies, varieties, or forms.
It is indistinguishable from Coptis trifolia; thus many authors consider
them the same entity [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  This write-up also treats them as
the same entity.

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Goldthread is commonly associated with cool, moist habitats on poor to
moderately well drained soils at low to middle elevations [<a href="#10">10</a>].  It
often occurs in or near peatlands of various types [<a href="#21">21</a>].  It occurs in a
number of plant associations but is not considered indicative of
particular associations, although it is more often associated with
coniferous canopies than with hardwood [<a href="#4">4</a>].

In Ontario, goldthread is usually associated with sites under or near
black spruce (Picea mariana), as opposed to sites that are open or near
other tree species [<a href="#8">8</a>].  In northern Idaho, it usually grows underneath
western white pine (Pinus monticola) stands in association with other
moisture-loving plants [<a href="#30">30</a>].  In Michigan, it is scattered in open
coniferous forests on gleysolic or organic soils on sites receiving
water.  It is common in nutrient-poor wetlands and is an oxylophytic
species characteristic of Mor humus formations [<a href="#26">26</a>].  In New York, it
occurs in riparian areas [<a href="#7">7</a>].  In Labrador, goldthread is a
wide-ranging, upland species that occurs on a variety of soil types from
boggy to well-drained [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

Goldthread is considered diagnostic for particular edaphic conditions
[<a href="#6">6</a>] (see Site Characteristics).  It occurs as a dominant understory
species in an eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis)-wild lily-of-the-valley
(Maianthemum canadense)-goldthread type found in low lying areas in
northern Wisconsin and Michigan [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  It is considered indicative of
minerotrophic water (water that carries mineral nutrients into the peat)
in peatlands [<a href="#22">22</a>].  It is an understory dominant in the mountain hemlock
(Tsuga mertensiana)-yellow cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkaensis)/blueberry
(Vaccinium spp.) type, the western hemlock-yellow cedar/blueberry/skunk
cabbage (Lysichiton americanum) type, the Sitka spruce (Picea
sitchensis)/blueberry/American skunkcabbage type, and the mountain
hemlock/blueberry types of both low and high elevations [<a href="#10">10</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Coptis groenlandica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Goldthread is a small, scapose, evergreen forb.  It has a long, slender
creeping rhizome that is a bright golden yellow.  With no main stem,
goldthread is many branched and frequently matted [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].

Goldthread forms endomycorrhizal associations [<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Goldthread propagates from rhizomes and tends to form colonies [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].
No documentation on seed set or fertility is available.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Goldthread is commmon in coniferous forests, swamps, bogs, and road
banks [<a href="#41">41</a>].  It occurs in thickets, mossy places, cedar swamps, and in a
diversity of damp woods and banks [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  Goldthread is most
frequently found in low light, cool, moist conditions on relatively
infertile soils [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  It usually occurs on Histosolic or
Spodosolic soils (podzolic soils), which are poorly drained and acidic,
with a deep, often not well-decomposed, organic layer [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative seral species.

Goldthread is not tolerant of disturbance and disappears after logging,
although it is not clear whether its disappearance is due to loss of the
canopy or mechanical damage to the roots [<a href="#30">30</a>].  It appears to be
intolerant of closed canopies but does require some shade, possibly
because of its preference for moist sites [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Flowering occurs from May to July, depending on latitude [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Coptis groenlandica

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Goldthread does not appear to be well adapted to fire, despite its
rhizomatous habit.  It is shallow rooted and occurs in areas that tend
to have long fire rotations (up to 500 years) [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Coptis groenlandica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Goldthread will survive cool fires, sprouting from the rhizome if
top-killed.  However, the rhizome is sufficiently near the surface that
it may be killed by moderate-severity fires.  Removal of the overstory
appears to have a negative effect on goldthread survival
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
After both spring and fall prescribed fires, goldthread responded with
vigorous vegetative reproduction but no seed production.  Both fires
were relatively cool, consuming only the surface litter layer.
Overstory scorch was limited to 6.6 feet (2 m), and flame heights were
no higher than 20 inches (50 cm) [<a href="#5">5</a>].  In New Brunswick, a similarly
cool prescribed fire resulted in patchy charring of the surface litter
and negligible removal of the organic matter.  Vegetation returned
quickly from surviving rhizomes [<a href="#44">44</a>].  In a study of post wildfire
changes in average individual biomass, goldthread increased from 0.0004
ounce (0.01 gm) dry weight per individual to 0.001 ounce (0.03 gm) per
individual.  No population decline was indicated [<a href="#48">48</a>].

In other studies of post wildfire succession, goldthread reappeared
slowly [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Goldthread was found to decrease significantly after a
wildfire in a black spruce-feathermoss forest [<a href="#15">15</a>].  In a study to
increase lowbush blueberry, removal of the overstory by logging in the
fall of 1949 followed by prescribed fires in the spring of 1951 and the
spring of 1952 resulted in a severe decline of goldthread [<a href="#20">20</a>].

In a postfire successional study, goldthread did not reappear in burned
plots until crown cover developed to 40 percent or more [<a href="#33">33</a>].
Similarly, Shafi [<a href="#42">42</a>] reports that goldthread increased gradually after
wildfire as the canopy developed, but then the population declined
rapidly as the canopy closed.
