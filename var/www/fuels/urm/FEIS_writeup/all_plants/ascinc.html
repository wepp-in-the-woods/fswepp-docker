<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of swamp milkweed is Asclepias incarnata L.
(Asclepidaceae).  There is disagreement in the taxonomic literature
about infrataxa treatment.  Two subspecies are recognized:

     Asclepias incarnata ssp. incarnata [<a href="#23">23</a>]
     A. i. ssp. pulchra (Ehrh. ex Willd.) Woods. [<a href="#23">23</a>]

Also recognized are the following variety and forms:

     A. i. var. incarnata f. incarnata [<a href="#21">21</a>]
     A. i. var. incarnata f. albiflora--Found only in Missouri [<a href="#21">21</a>]
     A. i. var. incarnata f. rosea Bowin--Found only in southern
                                          Ontario, Canada [<a href="#18">18</a>].

This report does not use infrataxa; they rarely appear in the
literature.

<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Swamp milkweed is found throughout the eastern and midwestern United
States and Canada.  It occurs from Prince Edward Island and Maine west
to southern Manitoba [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Swamp milkweed continues southeast
through the Midwest and Great Plains to Florida [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Its
distribution extends westward to Texas and New Mexico [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Six
disjunct areas of its range occur in southern Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada,

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Swamp milkweed foliage and stems have been reported to cause mortality
in sheep.  It is not known why sheep are so susceptible [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].
Muskrats are unaffected by swamp milkweed and readily eat the roots
[<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Milkweeds in general are not palatable to wildlife.  The bitter milky
juice is high in alkaloids [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Most animals avoid it unless forced to
eat it on overgrazed pastures [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Swamp milkweed is currently used in Wisconsin for wetland rehabilitation
[<a href="#11">11</a>].  It is included in commercially available seed mixes.


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Swamp milkweed seeds have long hairs, called comas.  Seed comas have
been used as pillow and lifejacket stuffing [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Stem fibers have
been suggested as substitutes for flax and hemp [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Young shoots,
inflorescences, and leaves may be cooked with several changes of water
and eaten [<a href="#23">23</a>].  This plant causes dermititis.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Asclepias incarnata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Swamp milkweed is an erect plant, 11 to 18 inches (0.3-0.5 m) tall, with
milky sap.  It has a short rootstock or caudex with shallow fibrous
roots.  A plant may have one to several leafy stems.  Its lance-shaped,
opposite leaves have short stalks.  Flowers have many elaborate
structures (e.g., hoods and horns) and are arranged in flesh-colored
terminal umbels [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Swamp milkweed readily germinates from seed shed the previous year (50
to 88 percent germination [<a href="#11">11</a>]) after cold stratification, 39 degrees
Fahrenheit (4 deg C), for approximately 9 months.  A plant puts up an
average of one stem from a short caudex and sprouts each year from this
rootstock.  Flowers are insect pollinated (Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera)
[<a href="#10">10</a>].  Seeds have long hairs that facilitate wind dispersal in the fall.
Swamp milkweed is self-fertile [<a href="#8">8</a>].  It very rarely reproduces asexually
by rhizomes [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Swamp milkweed is a semiaquatic plant [<a href="#3">3</a>].  It occurs in a range of wet
conditions from standing water to saturated soil.  A riparian species,
it is found on streambanks, pond shores, banks, and floodplains of
lakes, waterways, marshes, swamps, and wet areas of prairies
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Additionally, it occurs in wet meadows and in low wet
woods [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Swamp milkweed is a colonizer.  It has wind-dispersed seeds and can
self-fertilize.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Across its range, swamp milkweed begins to flower during the last week
of June or the first week in July and continues until August or
September [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Individual flowers remain open for about 1
week [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Fruits mature from August through October [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].
After maturation, follicles split open on one side to release seeds
during October and November [<a href="#23">23</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Asclepias incarnata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
The moist habitat of swamp milkweed discourages fire entry.  Swamp
milkweed is very shallowly rooted; it would most likely be killed in a
fire of any severity.  Adjacent communities may serve as seed sources
after a fire.  Swamp milkweed is a component of prairie wetlands, so it
has evolved with some fire exposure.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by wind; postfire years 1 and 2

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Asclepias incarnata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
No fire studies on this plant have been reported.  A fire would kill
swamp milkweed back to the caudex.  In moist soil, the caudex is usually
not deeply rooted.  Death would depend upon fire severity.  It may
survive a cool fire.  Late season (summer and fall) fires would have the
greatest effect on this species.  Since its seeds are not shed until
October or November, a late season fire would kill the seed crop of the
current year.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Following a cool surface fire, swamp milkweed sprouts from the caudex
and produces fruit.  If plants have been killed, off-site seeds will be
wind dispersed into the burned area.  This seed will germinate on burned
areas during the first postfire growing season, provided soil conditions
are wet.

Long-term response:  Swamp milkweed should have no difficulties in
maintaining populations.  It can self-fertilize; sexual reproduction
will continue, despite a reduced number of colonizing plants.

Plant recovery is controlled by the severity of the fire and
availability of adequately wet habitat.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
NO-ENTRY
