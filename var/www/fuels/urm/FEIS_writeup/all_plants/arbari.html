<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Arizona madrone is widespread in mesic areas of the Madrean (i.e.,
Sierra Madre) evergreen woodlands, extending up into the mixed
coniferous forest [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  Additionally, it is a minor component of
two riparian community types: (1) Arizona sycamore/American ash
(Platanus wrightii/Fraxinus pennsylvanica) and (2) Arizona sycamore
[<a href="#24">24</a>].  Arizona madrone is an important species within the oak-pine
woodland, especially the pygmy conifer-oak scrub (Pinus
cembroides-Juniperus deppeana-Quercus arizonica, Q. emoryi) [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].
It is also found in drier adjacent communities with buckbrush (Ceanothus
huichugore) [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  It is listed as a minor seral species in the
following classification:

Forest and woodland habitat types (plant associations) of Arizona south
  of the Mogollon Rim and southwestern New Mexico [<a href="#33">33</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arbutus arizonica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Arizona madrone has light-colored sapwood that is close grained, heavy,
soft, and brittle.  The wood has a specific gravity of approximately
0.71.  Arizona madrone has been used to manufacture charcoal and
gunpowder [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Arizona madrone is rarely browsed except by goats [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Its fruits are
eaten by mammals and birds and may be an important food source for some
species, such as the elegant trogan [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Arizona madrone may provide
nest sites for cavity-nesting or other birds.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arbutus arizonica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Arizona madrone is a native, broadleaf, evergreen tree or shrub [<a href="#11">11</a>].
Stout, spreading branches form a compact, round-topped crown [<a href="#21">21</a>].  It
grows 19 to 50 feet (6-15 m) tall with a diameter of 18 to 24 inches
(46-61 cm) [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  The bark is smooth, thin, and peels off in
sheets [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Thick, oblong leaves are leathery, and 2 to 3 inches
(5-7.2 cm) long.  The fruit is a mealy, sweet berry.  The berry contains
many seeds [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Arizona madrone reproduces sexually by seed.  Fleshy, bright-colored
fruits may be animal disseminated, as are the fruits of another madrone
species (Arbutus unedo) [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Madrone species, including Arizona 
madrone, sprout from the root crown after top-kill by burning or other 
disturbance [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Arizona madrone grows slowly [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Arizona madrone is found in mesic canyons, on lower slopes, and mountain
sides [<a href="#1">1</a>].  It occurs on well-drained, gravelly, and sunny sites [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].
Arizona madrone is confined to moist riparian areas at low elevations
(1,600 to 2,200 feet [487-671 m]) but occurs more commonly at elevations
from 4,000 to 8,000 feet (1,219-2,438 m) [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  It occurs on a
variety of soils formed from resideual or colluvial parent materials
[<a href="#33">33</a>].  Arizona madrone is often on open, north-facing or intermediate
east- and west-facing slopes.  In the Santa Catalina Mountains, Arizona,
its highest frequency (23 percent) was on north-facing slopes [<a href="#30">30</a>].

The climate is semiarid to arid with bimodal rainy seasons (July to
September and December to March) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  Rainfall is variable with
mean annual precipitation from 11 to 20 inches (280-500 mm).

Common associated species are New Mexico locust (Robina neomexicana),
silverleaf oak (Quercus hypoleucoides), netleaf oak (Q. rugosa), Apache
pine (Pinus engelmannii), and Chihuahua pine (Pinus leiophylla var.
chihuahuana) [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Other associated species are longtongue
muhly (Muhlenbergia longiligula) and New Mexico groundsel(Senecio
neomexicanus) [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Little information was found in the literature about the successional
status of Arizona madrone.  It reportedly occurs as a mid- to late seral
species [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Based upon the performance of other members of this
genus, Arizona madrone is most likely a facultative seral species.
Another madrone species (Arbutus unedo) that holds a similar ecological
role in Corsican woodlands is a mid-successional species [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
New leaves of Arizona madrone are put out in May and again after the
summer rains; these leaves persist about 1 year [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Arizona madrone
flowers from April to May or June [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Fruits ripen October
through November [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arbutus arizonica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Arizona madrone has thin bark, which makes it susceptible to fire damage. 
It sprouts from the root crown after top-kill [<a href="#34">34</a>]. Published information 
on the fire ecology of Arizona madrone is sparse.  Further research is 
needed in this area [<a href="#1">1</a>].  

Fire is infrequent and has a minor role in the riparian communities in
which Arizona madrone is a component; however, fire occurs frequently in
the pine-oak woodland types in which it also occurs [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Arizona madrone in the Chiricahua and Santa Catalina Mountains of
Arizona has survived fire.  In a Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)/oak
community, an Arizona madrone had eight fire scars, indicating frequent
fires [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by animals or water; postfire yr 1&2
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arbutus arizonica
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Arizona madrone has thin bark and is top-killed by fire [<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Arizona madrone sprouts from the root corwn after top-kill by fire [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Madrean evergreen woodlands in Arizona were prescribed burned in 1983.
In 1989 and 1990, no sprouting or germination of Arizona madrone was
found.  The small, slow-moving fires may have caused root damage to
Arizona madrone, which suppressed sprouting or killed the plants [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Arizona madrone occurs in canyons that are often involved in prescribed
fire programs within the Madrean evergreen woodlands [<a href="#1">1</a>].
