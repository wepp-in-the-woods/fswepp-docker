Purple prairie clover is distributed throughout the Great Plains.  It is
indigenous from southeastern Alberta, southern Saskatchewan, and
Manitoba south to Texas and New Mexico and east to Illinois, Arkansas,
and Missouri.  It occurs infrequently westward to eastern Montana,
Colorado, and Wyoming [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Purple prairie clover is excellent forage for livestock and wildlife and
may be an important component of upland prairie hay [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Purple prairie clover is palatable to livestock as well as to
white-tailed deer and wild turkey [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Palatability of purple prairie
clover in two western states has been rated as follows [<a href="#8">8</a>]:

                CO    ND
cattle        good   fair
sheep         good   good
horses        fair   fair   


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Purple prairie clover is highly nutritious.  It has a high protein
content, particularly in new growth [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Crude and digestible protein
content of purple prairie clover are as follows [<a href="#21">21</a>]:

crude protein                 14.1 %
digestible protein - cattle    9.9 %
                     goats     9.7 %
                     horses    9.5 %
                     rabbits   9.6 %
                     sheep    10.1 %


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Purple prairie clover is used in grass and forb seed mixtures for
stabilization of disturbed sites such as mine spoils, road cuts, and
overgrazed rangelands [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  It is valuable for erosion control due
to its deep, fibrous, branching root system.  It is often seeded with
grass mixtures because of its nitrogen-fixing ability [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
American Indians ate fresh and boiled purple prairie clover leaves.
Bruised leaves were steeped in water and applied to open wounds.  The
Ponca chewed the leaves for their flavor and made tea from the leaves,
and the Pawnee used the stems to make brooms [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Purple prairie clover decreases in response to grazing [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  The
terminal growing points are within reach of the grazing animals soon
after growth begins and are thus quite susceptible to injury by grazing
or mowing [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Survival and growth of purple prairie clover seedlings is decreased in
the presence of allelopathic species such as western ragweed (Ambrosia
psilostachya), common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album), and smooth
brome (Bromus inermis) [<a href="#24">24</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Dalea purpurea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Purple prairie clover is a perennial forb 8 to 35 inches (20-90 cm)
tall.  Usually there are one to three branches per stem, but sometimes
10 to 12 branches may arise from a single stem.  The mature purple
prairie clover develops a strong taproot 5.5 to 6.5 feet (1.7-2.0 m)
deep.  The taproot gives rise to several minutely branched lateral
roots.  The fruit is a one-seeded pod enclosed in bracts [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Purple prairie clover reproduces by seed [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Good seed crops are
produced about every 2 years, with some seeds produced every year [<a href="#3">3</a>].
Bjugstad and Whitman [<a href="#3">3</a>] reported that a temperature of 41 degrees
Fahrenheit (5 deg C) is required to break seed dormancy.

Documentation of this species' ability to sprout is scant.  Nuzzo [<a href="#22">22</a>],
however, reports that purple prairie clover seedlings that appeared dead
due to water loss sent up new shoots within a few weeks when watered
heavily.



<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Purple prairie clover grows on a variety of sites including dry plains,
prairies, hillsides, open woodlands, shaded ravines, and roadsides.  It
occurs on mesic sites in mixed and tallgrass prairies of the northern
and central Great Plains and the shortgrass prairie of the southern
Great Plains [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Where mean annual precipitation is less than 15
inches (380 mm) purple prairie clover occurs infrequently.  It develops
best where mean annual precipitation is 15 inches or more [<a href="#33">33</a>].

Some common associates of purple prairie clover include prairie gentian
(Gentiana puberula), prairie compass plant (Silphium laciniatum),
leadplant (Amorpha canescens), pitcher sage (Salvia azurea), blue false
indigio (Baptisia minor), tall gray feather (Liatris scariosa), and
yellow swetclover (Melilotus officinalis).  Associated grasses include
little bluestem (Schizachynum scoparium) switch grass (Pancium
virgatum), Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans), and big bluestem
(Andropogon geradii) [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Climax Species 

Purple prairie clover is part of the mixed prairie climax vegetation of
several grassland communities [<a href="#39">39</a>].  It is moderately shade tolerant but
can also grow on recently disturbed open areas [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Purple prairie clover begins vegetative growth at the same time as
prairie grasses early in the spring, but purple prairie clover soon
exceeds the grasses in height [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  Purple prairie clover begins to
flower in late May to July when the plant is about 2 feet (60 cm) high.
Seeds mature in July and August [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Dalea purpurea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Purple prairie clover is generally favored by fire.  Purple prairie
clover is usually present in increased numbers following fire because
fire stimulates the germination of soil-stored seed [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Dalea purpurea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
The aerial portions of purple prairie clover are damaged or killed by
fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Purple prairie clover is generally considered an increaser following
fire [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Fire stimulates seed germination; sprouting from the
caudex is also possible [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  Data pertaining to postfire density,
frequency, or growth rates of purple prairie clover were not found in
the literature.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Biennial spring burning favors purple prairie clover, while annual
burning favors prairie grasses and results in a decrease in purple
prairie clover and other forbs [<a href="#33">33</a>].
