<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Prairie goldenrod is rated slightly poisonous to livestock [<a href="#12">12</a>].  The
leaves may be eaten by livestock while the plants are relatively
immature in the spring and early summer, but it is generally considered
poor forage [<a href="#22">22</a>] and is of limited importance as a forage plant [<a href="#17">17</a>].
Prairie goldenrod was available for use by domestic sheep in
southeastern Montana, but was not a component of their diet in June,
July, or August of 1979 [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Prairie goldenrod was eaten by mule deer in east-central Idaho in
February, 1976, but was a very minor component of their diet.  It was
not utilized any other month [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Only incidental use is made of prairie goldenrod by small mammals and
birds [<a href="#44">44</a>].

The flowerheads of prairie goldenrod are used by flies, bees,
butterflies, and beetles for pollen and nectar [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Prairie goldenrod palatability for livestock in several western states
is as follows [<a href="#12">12</a>]:

     Small mammals           ----       fair       poor


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Prairie goldenrod has utility for revegetation of disturbed areas [<a href="#36">36</a>],
minespoil reclamation [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>] and soil stabilization.  It shows winter
hardiness and moderate drought tolerance [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Prairie goldenrod seeds collected in the Badlands of western North
Dakota were grown on raw coal spoil material to evaluate their use in
minespoil reclamation.  Prairie goldenrod had acceptable seedling
emergence and subsequent growth from direct seeding.  Greenhouse plants
had almost 100 percent survival, a higher rate than that of seedlings
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Prairie goldenrod has utility for watershed cover and wildlife plantings
[<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Prairie goldenrod shows weak competitiveness in dense grasslands, but in
more open cover shows moderate aggressiveness and ability to invade and
dominate.  Prairie goldenrod in shortgrass prairie of northwestern
Montana had higher density in quadrats with low spotted knapweed
(Centaurea maculosa) density than in those with high spotted knapweed
density [<a href="#39">39</a>].  In the Great Plains prairie goldenrod increased with
drought during the 1930's, and in some places became a major constituent
of the weedy flora in tallgrass prairie [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Prairie goldenrod is
generally reported to be an increaser with grazing [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>], sometimes
becoming a nuisance [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Seeding often fails, so transplanting rootstock divisions or small
plants may be the only certain way of ensuring stand establishment [<a href="#44">44</a>].
However, prairie hay has been used successfully as a seed source and
mulch [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Grazing or mowing established populations about 1 month
before normal flowering may induce more flower buds to open and extend
flowering period.  In order to maximize seed production flowers should
be permitted to mature before any further defoliation occurs in the fall
[<a href="#44">44</a>].  Rodents and grasshoppers may endanger new seedlings of prairie
goldenrod.  Dodder (Cuscuta spp.), a plant which sometimes parasitizes
prairie goldenrod stands, can be a problem in humid regions [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Prairie goldenrod in northeastern Kansas native tallgrass prairie was
ingested by grasshoppers in relation to its availability, being neither
avoided nor sought after [<a href="#25">25</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Solidago missouriensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Prairie goldenrod is a warm-season [<a href="#22">22</a>] native perennial forb [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].
The leaves are somewhat rigid, the basal leaves being largest, petioled
[<a href="#41">41</a>], and often early-deciduous.  The cauline leaves are progressively
reduced upward.  Leaves are 0.6 to 4.9 inches (1.5-12.5 cm) long [<a href="#5">5</a>].
Stems are 4 to 39 inches (0.1-1.0 m) tall [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>], arising singly or
clustered.  The inflorescence is a rather rounded, compact, branched
terminal panicle [<a href="#19">19</a>] composed of small, congested flowerheads [<a href="#44">44</a>].
Ray flowers are 0.16 to 0.2 inches (4-5 mm) long.  Disk flowers are 0.12
to 0.16 inches (3-4 mm) long [<a href="#14">14</a>].  The fruit is a small achene [<a href="#5">5</a>]; the
pappus consists of numerous bristles [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Plants arise from creeping
cordlike rhizomes [<a href="#14">14</a>] or a spreading caudex [<a href="#19">19</a>], or sometimes both
[<a href="#18">18</a>].  Roots tend to be rather superficial [<a href="#44">44</a>], but can reach 6.6 feet
(2 m) deep [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Prairie goldenrod reproduces by seed and by vigorous rhizomes.  It can
form dense colonies in both uplands and lowlands [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Prairie goldenrod stores seeds in the seedbank.  In the flora of remnant
tallgrass prairie in central Missouri, prairie goldenrod was one of the
most common elements.  Prairie goldenrod seeds made up 7 percent of the
seedbank and 63 percent of the seed rain from June 1 to December 5, 1978
[<a href="#34">34</a>].

Germination rates of prairie goldenrod seeds from western North Dakota
were tested from January through May, 1978.  With wet cold storage the
highest germination rate (64%) was in January, but dropped to low levels
in other months.  With room temperature storage the highest germination
rate (47%) was in March.  With dry cold storage the highest germination
rate (45%) was in February [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Prairie goldenrod inhabits rather dry, open places on the slopes of
valleys and on plains, and reaches moderately high elevations in
mountains [<a href="#20">20</a>].  It is also found in sparsely wooded areas, on grassy
roadsides [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>], on rocky slopes [<a href="#14">14</a>], and in open communities where
sod is broken along railroads, ditches, and fences [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Prairie goldenrod growth is poor on gravel and dense clay, fair on sand
and clay, and good on sandy to clayey loam.  It grows poorly on strongly
acidic and saline soils [<a href="#12">12</a>], though it shows tolerance of weakly acidic
to moderately basic and weakly saline soils [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Its optimum soil
depth is 10 to 20 inches (25-51 cm) [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Prairie goldenrod occurs at the following elevations [<a href="#12">12</a>]:

                   Elevation (feet)     Elevation (m)

        CO          3,700-10,000         1,128-3,048
        MT          3,200-9,000            975-2,743
        UT          4,200-8,600          1,280-2,621 
        WY          3,700-10,600         1,128-3,231


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Prairie goldenrod pioneers disturbed sites, but is also tolerant of
partial shade [<a href="#44">44</a>] and has been characterized as a mid-seral species in
northwestern Iowa [<a href="#33">33</a>].

During the long drought period of the 1930's in the Midwest, prairie
goldenrod colonized bare areas where grasses and other native plants had
died out [<a href="#5">5</a>].  By 1940, after the drought, prairie goldenrod patches had
thinned out and the plants were dwarfed by competition with grasses.  By
1943, prairie goldenrod was mostly or completely suppressed [<a href="#45">45</a>].

In the Konza Prairie, a tallgrass prairie preserve of northeastern
Kansas, prairie goldenrod occurred in trace amounts on disturbed soil of
badger dens and also on undisturbed nearby sites.  It also occurred on
pocket gopher mounds and on prairie vole burrow systems [<a href="#16">16</a>].

In southwestern Montana mining towns abandoned for between 45 and 77
years, prairie goldenrod occurred on some abandoned roads (high-intensity
disturbance), around old foundations of some buildings (moderate-intensity
disturbance), and on some control sites (no disturbance except grazing) [<a href="#24">24</a>].

In contrast to the above reports of prairie goldenrod as a pioneer
species, it occurred on mesic slopes of both undisturbed virgin prairie
and overgrazed prairie in northwestern Iowa, but not on the drier sites
of badger disturbances [<a href="#33">33</a>]. 


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Prairie goldenrod resumes growth from rhizomes and/or the caudex in
spring to early summer.  Plants often shed basal leaves after flowering
begins.  Seeds mature about 6 weeks after flowers bloom.  If plants are
damaged they make variable regrowth in the summer until seed maturation
[<a href="#44">44</a>].

In southwestern North Dakota prairie goldenrod begins growth in
mid-April and obtains mature height by early July to mid-August,
depending on the year [<a href="#17">17</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Solidago missouriensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Prairie goldenrod has good fire tolerance in the dormant state [<a href="#44">44</a>]; it
can reproduce by rhizomes or from a caudex [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Prairie goldenrod
produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>] which can establish
in the open, sunny conditions created by fire.  It may also be an
initial on-site colonizer, since its seeds are found in the seedbank
[<a href="#34">34</a>], but no information was available on seed tolerance of heat or
length of seed viability in the seedbank.

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Prairie goldenrod is probably top-killed by fire during the growing
season.  However, it has good survival from fire, especially on damper
sites and in the dormant state [<a href="#44">44</a>], due to persistent rhizomes and
caudex [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Many reports of burning in communities that contain prairie goldenrod
show that frequency, cover, or flowering are enhanced after burning.  On
some sites prairie goldenrod response is variable or negative (see
DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE).  Prairie goldenrod is
listed as tolerant of fire in the tallgrass prairie of the Central Great
Plains, even though it sometimes declines following fire.  It is listed
as increasing in the Canadian Great Plains after both spring and fall
fires [<a href="#49">49</a>].

In remnant tallgrass prairie in central Missouri burned on a 4-year
rotation, prairie goldenrod was one of the most common elements in the
flora [<a href="#34">34</a>].

In trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) parkland of east-central
Alberta, prairie goldenrod was the forb which increased the most under
annual early spring burning.  Parts of the grassland had been burned
repeatedly in April for at least 24 years.  Frequency of prairie
goldenrod was 18 percent on unburned plots and 50 percent on burned
plots; canopy cover was 1.7 percent on unburned plots and 27 percent on
burned plots [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>].

Prairie goldenrod in northern Wisconsin pine barrens showed a
statistically significant increase on burned compared to contiguous
unburned sites over all study areas [<a href="#43">43</a>].

Prairie goldenrod increased on rolling sands and choppy sands sites in
north-central Nebraska sand hills 2 to 3 months after an early May,
1965, wildfire [<a href="#48">48</a>].

In central Arizona prairie goldenrod percent frequency increased
slightly on burned sites following prescribed fires in 1970 and 1971
[<a href="#31">31</a>].

Prairie goldenrod showed stimulation of flowering on a nearly level
mesic site following prescribed fire May 2, 1972, in northwestern
Minnesota [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Several studies report that fire had no effect or a negative effect on
prairie goldenrod.

On old fields and unplowed prairie in southeastern North Dakota, prairie
goldenrod occurred in small amounts; at no site was canopy coverage
greater than 1.50 percent.  On three old fields burned in late spring,
1973, prairie goldenrod occurred on control but not on burned sites by
August, 1973.  On two unplowed prairie sites, prairie goldenrod occurred
on burned and unburned plots, with no significant difference between
treatments [<a href="#29">29</a>].

A study of logged black spruce (Picea mariana) forests on lowland sites
in southeastern Manitoba harvested during the winter of 1964-65 and
burned in May, 1967, showed that prairie goldenrod invaded after
harvesting on both burned and unburned sites [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Response to burning on disturbed soils of the Konza Prairie was
variable.  Prairie goldenrod was present on frequently burned prairie
vole burrow systems and adjacent prairie.  It occurred on unburned
badger den sites but not on burned sites.  It occurred on burned pocket
gopher mounds, but not on unburned mounds [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Prairie goldenrod was listed as a decreaser in response to fire in
northeastern Wisconsin.  In 1959 and 1960, prairie goldenrod had an
average frequency of 31.2 percent in undisturbed bracken fern-grassland
sites; in sites subjected to prescribed fires average frequency was 19.7
percent [<a href="#43">43</a>].
