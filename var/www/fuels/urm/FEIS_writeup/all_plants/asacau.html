<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Wild ginger occurs in California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia,
Idaho, and Montana [<a href="#9">9</a>].  In California it occurs in the Coast Ranges
from the Santa Cruz Mountains northward [<a href="#14">14</a>].  In Oregon, Washington,
and British Columbia, it is commonly found from the Pacific Coast east
to the Cascades and is found less frequently on the east side of the
Cascades.  Wild ginger is also found in northern Idaho and western

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Wild ginger is commonly found in the understory of grand fir (Abies
grandis), western white pine (Pinus monticola), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
menziesii), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), and western hemlock (Tsuga
heterophylla).  In the understory community, wild ginger is commonly
associated with trail plant (Adenocaulon bicolor), queencup beadlily
(Clintonia uniflora), and western goldthread (Coptis occidentalis) [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Wild ginger is listed as an indicator or dominant in the following

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Food:  The roots and new shoots can be baked or roasted, then eaten.
The leaves can be used to cover various foods while baking.  The roots
can be dried and used for seasoning [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Landscaping:  Wild ginger is a favorite of native plant gardeners in the
Pacific Northwest.  It is considered high garden quality due to its
characteristic showy heart-shaped leaves, aroma, ease of growth, and
ability to form a dense carpet [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Wild ginger will disappear from sites in the more xeric portions of its
range that have been opened up by clearcutting.  Large openings made in
the forest canopy by clearcutting cause an increase in air and soil
temperatures, evaporation rates, and moisture deficits, which present
unfavorable conditions for reestablishment of moisture-loving plants,
such as wild ginger [<a href="#11">11</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Asarum caudatum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Wild ginger is a low, trailing, perennial, evergreen, prostrate herb
which is often found in localized patches on the forest floor.  Its
leaves are softly hairy, borne two per node, alternate, simple,
appearing basal, long petioled, heart shaped, persistent, prominently
veined, entire edged, aromatic, dark to bright green, and sometimes
mottled.  Its large, solitary, thimblelike flowers grow close to the
ground and are often concealed by the leaves.  They are brownish-purple
to green and have three broad lobes which taper into long linear tails. The
fruit is a large, fleshy capsule containing small seeds.  The seeds are
angled or compressed, smooth or wrinkled, and have a minute embryo in a
fleshy endosperm.  They are widely distributed.  The roots of wild
ginger are rhizomatous.  They are extensive, slender, elongate,
aromatic, and can become matted.  [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Wild ginger reproduces sexually by seed [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Vegetative:  Wild ginger spreads by a system of extensive rhizomes.  It
may form localized patches [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Wild ginger is an indicator of moist, shady, lowland to midmontane
forests in Oregon, Washington, and coastal British Columbia [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].

Soil:  Wild ginger is characteristic of Moder and Mull humus soil forms
[<a href="#8">8</a>].

Climate:  Wild ginger is found in areas with cool temperate and cool
mesothermal climates [<a href="#8">8</a>].  In northern Idaho and British Columbia the
climate is an inland expression of the Pacific Maritime influence [<a href="#15">15</a>].
This plant prefers locations with moist weather in the fall, winter, and
spring with dry summers [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Elevation:  Wild ginger generally occurs below 5,000 feet (1,524 m)
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Wild ginger is  shade tolerant [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Wild ginger flowers from May through July in California [<a href="#14">14</a>], and from
April through July in Oregon and Washington [<a href="#5">5</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Asarum caudatum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
In Moder and Mull soil types the organic layers (L,F, and H) are
typically shallow [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Therefore, a fire of light to moderate intensity
would remove the organic layers and the vegetative propagules of wild
ginger, thus requiring it to be seeded on the site from an off-site
source [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Asarum caudatum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Wild ginger is very susceptible to fire-kill.  Above and belowground
parts can be killed by fires of even light to moderate intensity.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Wild ginger is removed from the understory until it can be seeded onto
the site from an off-site source after fires of light to moderate
intensity.  Studies in Idaho and Oregon found that wild ginger presence
was significantly higher in plots that were clearcut and not burned than
in those plots that were clearcut and then broadcast burned [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].
Steen [<a href="#19">19</a>] found that wild ginger was absent from the burned stands for
up to 16 years after slash fires of moderate intensity.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Wild ginger did not occur on clearcut and burned plots but did occur on
clearcut and unburned plots in an Oregon study [<a href="#19">19</a>].
