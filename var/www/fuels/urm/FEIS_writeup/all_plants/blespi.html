<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Deer fern is an indicator of moist to wet forests from sea level to
montane zones in southwestern Washington and western Oregon [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  It
is also an indicator of moist to wet, poor-nutrient to moderate-nutrient
forests in British Columbia [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Deer fern is scattered to abundant,
and occasionally dominant, in understories of old-growth forests on
"water-receiving" sites [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Publications listing deer fern as a
dominant or codominant understory component include the following:

Natural vegetation of Oregon and Washington [<a href="#12">12</a>]
Gradient structure of forest vegetation in the central Washington
  Cascades [<a href="#8">8</a>]
Plant communities in the old-growth forests of north coastal Oregon [<a href="#20">20</a>]
Forest associations of Little Lost Man Creek, Humboldt County,
  California:  reference-level in the hierarchical structure of
  old-growth coastal redwood vegetation [<a href="#27">27</a>]
 
Some species commonly associated with deer fern include Alaska-cedar
(Chamaecyparis nootkatensis), noble fir (Abies procera), lodgepole pine
(Pinus contorta), Alaska blueberry (Vaccinium alaskensis), red
huckleberry (V. parviflorum), thimbleberry (Rubus parviflorus),
salmonberry (R. spectabilis), devil's club (Oplopanax horridus),
menziesia (Menziesia ferruginea), salal (Gaultheria shallon), Oregon
oxalis (Oxalis oregana), bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), false
lily-of-the-valley (Maianthemum dilatatum), twisted stalk (Streptopus
spp.), threeleaf foamflower (Tiarella trifoliata), woodnymph (Moneses
uniflora), pioneer violet (Viola glabrella), western swordfern
(Polystichum munitum), ladyfern (Athyrium filix-femina), bracken fern
(Pteridium aquilinum), oakfern (Gymnocarpium dryopteris), woodfern

species of mosses [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Blechnum spicant
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Deer fern fronds are dimorphic.  Sterile leaves are evergreen and are
spreading or appressed to the ground.  They are usually 4 to 16 inches
(10-40 cm) long.  Fertile leaves are fewer in number, deciduous, and
much longer than the sterile leaves.  Sporangia are confluent and
parallel to the midrib.  Deer fern has woody rhizomes [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Deer fern reproduces from spores and by sprouting from rhizomes.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Deer fern is found in moist to wet forests and generally on heavily
shaded sites [<a href="#21">21</a>].  It is an indicator of hypermaritime to maritime
subalpine boreal and summer-wet cool mesothermal climates.  It is found
on fresh to very moist nitrogen-poor soils and grows best on
well-decomposed organic material and nutrient-rich soils produced from
decaying wood.  Deer fern is very sensitive to frost [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Deer fern is shade tolerant [<a href="#25">25</a>].  It is found in old-growth and climax
western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla)-Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis)
stands in southeast Alaska.  Disturbance in these cool, wet forests is
generally from windthrow or logging.  After disturbance, deer fern forms
dense clumps if tree regeneration is sparse, but declines in cover as
the shrub layer develops (20-25 years after logging).  After 50 to 60
years, ferns, including deer fern, begin to increase in abundance and
cover and eventually dominate the understory [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Deer fern is found in
old-growth and climax western hemlock, Sitka spruce, western redcedar
(Thuja plicata), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and Pacific silver
fir (Abies amabilis) forests throughout its range [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].

Along the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, deer fern
may be present in young seral stands in floodplain succession.  However,
its cover increases in climax stages and it is typical of the rich
climax forests of the region [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Deer fern was present on shaded sites
within 6 years following logging in white spruce (Picea glauca) stands
in British Columbia [<a href="#9">9</a>].  It was also present 5 years after clearcuts in
Douglas-fir stands in Washington [<a href="#29">29</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Blechnum spicant
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fire is infrequent in the cool, wet forests in which deer fern is found.
Fire intervals are estimated to be several hundred years.  When
large-scale fires do occur, they are usually catastrophic [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Deer
fern may colonize sites after small patch fires by spores or the spread
of rhizomes from adjacent unburned areas.
 


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Blechnum spicant
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Deer fern is probably top-killed by fire.  Rhizomes may survive light
surface fires.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Information on the response of deer fern to fire is sparse.  It was not
destroyed by a March fire in a Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris) stand in
Great Britain, and survived by sprouting from rhizomes.  It had a
postfire frequency of 95 percent in the year of the fire and in the
first two postfire years [<a href="#35">35</a>].

Frequent, light surface fires encourage redwood (Sequoia
sempervirens)/deer fern forest associations in northern California [<a href="#27">27</a>].
Deer fern probably survives these low-severity fires by sprouting from
surviving rhizomes.
