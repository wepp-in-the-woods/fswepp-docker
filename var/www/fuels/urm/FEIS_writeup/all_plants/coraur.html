<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of golden corydalis is Corydalis
aurea Willd. [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  The following subspecies are recognized
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>]:
  
  C. aurea ssp. aurea --racemes generally surpassed by leaves
  C. aurea ssp. occidentalis (Engelm.) Ownbey --racemes generally
     surpassing leaves

Some authors, however, make this distiction at the varietal level [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>LIFE FORM : </b>

<b>FEDERAL LEGAL STATUS : </b>
No special status

<b>OTHER STATUS : </b>
Golden corydalis is classified as threatened in New York.  Its
state rank there is listed as S1 (critically imperiled in New York State
because of extreme rarity or is extremely vulnerable to extirpation from
the New York State due to biological factors [<a href="#29">29</a>].

<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Golden corydalis is distributed from Quebec west to Alaska and south
(from east of the Cascade Mountains) to California [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>]. In the
central United States it is found to Texas and Missouri.  Golden

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Corydalis aurea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Golden corydalis is a winter annual or biennial forb.  It is highly
branched with stems usually 4 to 20 inches (10-50 cm) tall, but becoming
prostrate with age [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  Leaves are one to four times pinnately
compound [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Flowers are borne in racemes.  The fruits are
capsules with seeds about 0.08 inches (0.2 cm) in diameter [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].
Golden corydalis has a slender taproot [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Therophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Golden corydalis reproduces by long-lived, wind-dispersed seed
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Seeds may lie dormant for over 160 years [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Golden corydalis grows on open prairies and hillsides, along streams and
rocky banks or shores, and in open woodlands [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  It is
also often found on disturbed sites such as along roads, in clearings,
and around gravel or sand pits [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  It grows well on moderate
to steep slopes [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Golden corydalis grows in moist to dry,
well-drained rocky, gravelly, or sandy soil [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Lower and upper
elevational limits of golden corydalis in a few western states are as
follows:

                  Feet               Meters

Arizona       1,500-9,500            454-2,878  [<a href="#16">16</a>]
California    5,000-7,500          1,515-2,272  [<a href="#20">20</a>]
Colorado      5,000-10,500         1,515-3,181  [<a href="#13">13</a>]
Utah          2,640-11,071           800-3,355  [<a href="#28">28</a>]


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

Golden corydalis usually appears in communities following disturbance
and dies out within a few years if conditions are stable [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Depending on latitude, golden corydalis generally flowers from May to
June or July [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  In Arizona, however, it blooms from
February to June [<a href="#16">16</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Corydalis aurea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Golden corydalis reproduces from long-lived seeds.  It may also invade
recently burned areas by wind-dispersed seed [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Germination of seeds
of other corydalis species (C. sempervirens) is stimulated by fire [<a href="#25">25</a>].

Anderson [<a href="#1">1</a>] stated that golden corydalis regenerates vegetatively
following fire, but no specific information was given.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Corydalis aurea

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Golden corydalis is probably always killed by fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Golden corydalis quickly invades recently burned areas by seed.
However, its survival in the postfire community appears to be very short
lived.

Golden corydalis invaded recently burned areas by wind-dispersed seed
after stand-replacing summer fire in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta)
stands in Colorado.  It was not present in adjacent unburned stands, but
in burned areas it had a frequency of 27.9 percent in the first postfire
year.  By the second postfire year, frequency had diminished to 9.7
percent, and it was thereafter eliminated from the postfire community
[<a href="#2">2</a>].  Golden corydalis was also present 1 year after moderate-severity
fires in lodgepole stands in Yellowstone National Park.  Information for
response after postfire year 1, however, was not given [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Golden corydalis bloomed and set seed in the first growing season
following severe fire in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)/ninebark
(Physocarpus malvaceus) habitats in western Montana.  However, it had
almost completely disappeared from the postfire community by the second
growing season.  The origin of the postfire seedlings was unknown, but
it may have been soil-stored seed [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Golden corydalis flowered the August following a May fire in black
spruce (Picea mariana)-white spruce (P. glauca) stands in Alaska [<a href="#15">15</a>].
No additional information was given.
