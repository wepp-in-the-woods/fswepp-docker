<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Dasylirion leiophyllum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Smooth-leaf sotol is a large leaf-succulent shrub [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  The leaves
are 0.7 to 0.9 inches (2-2.5 cm) broad, 23 to 31 inches (60-80 cm) long,
and basally clumped from a short trunk [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  The inflorescence is a
stout, narrow, spicate panicle [about 1 foot (0.3 m) long] borne on a
rather tall scape.  The fruit is an indehiscent, winged capsule [<a href="#15">15</a>].

No specific information was found in the literature regarding longevity
or roots.  However, a similar species, Texas sotol (Dasylirion texanum)
has a large number of roots, each about 0.2 inch (0.5 mm) in diameter,
forming a cluster at the base of the stem.  The roots of Texas sotol run
downward at an acute angle and also extend horizontally into the soil.
The roots are coarse and are found between 5.9 to 14.1 inches (15-36 cm)
below the soil surface.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction - Smooth-leaf sotol plants are dioecious.  They
produce thousands of tiny flowers in a long narrow cluster [<a href="#11">11</a>].  The
seed is contained in a one-celled three-winged capsule [<a href="#15">15</a>].

Vegetative reproduction - Smooth-leaf sotol reproduces vegetatively
by sprouting from the terminal bud, which is located at the base of the
leaf [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Smooth-leaf sotol is found on hillsides, in deciduous woodlands, and in
grasslands of desert regions [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].  It is often found growing in soils
with limestone substrate [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].  Smooth-leaf sotol is commonly found on
south-facing boulder slopes and streambeds at elevations between 4,200
and 5,500 feet (1,280-1,676 m).  This shrub is generally not abundant
where permanent surface water is present [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Smooth-leaf sotol is often associated with lechuguilla (Agave
lecheguilla), walnut (Juglans spp.), prickly pear (Opuntia spp.), yucca
(Yucca spp.), nolina (Nolina spp.), Pinchot juniper (Juniperus
pinchotii), wavyleaf oak (Quercus undulata), skeleton goldeye (Viguiera
stenoloba), curlyleaf muhly (Muhlenbergia setifolia), grama (Bouteloua
spp.), threeawn (Aristida spp.) and slim tridens (Tridens muticus)
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
No specific information on seasonal development of smooth-leaf sotol was
found.  However, a similar species, Wheeler sotol (Dasylirion wheeleri),
flowers in spring or early summer [<a href="#2">2</a>].  In the Chihuahuan Desert, New
Mexico, Wheeler sotol flower buds are initiated in mid- to late May,
flowering occurs in June and July, and fruits are mature by August [<a href="#16">16</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Dasylirion leiophyllum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Smooth-leaf sotol occurs in southwestern desert and semidesert plant
communities of North America that are subject to naturally occurring
fire [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Small, presumably young, plants have green leaves extending
to the ground and are usually only slightly scorched by fire [<a href="#9">9</a>].  The
sheath of dead leaves surrounding the trunk of mature smooth-leaf sotols
makes them especially susceptible to fire, and plants with fire-girdled
trunks usually die [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Mature smooth-leaf sotols are tall enough and have sufficient fuel at
the base that fires will ignite after plants are struck by lightning
[<a href="#9">9</a>].  These large plants contribute to fire travel, but their spacing is
such that other fuel is often required to carry fire from one
smooth-leaf sotol to another.  Plant material covered only about 60
percent of the ground in grama grass-rosette scrub communities in the
Chisos Mountains, Texas [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Smooth-leaf may burn for hours.  If the
stem burns through, the top of the plant may spread fire by falling and
rolling downhill.  Suppression crews frequently chop mature smooth-leaf
sotols off at their trunks and split them open to check fire spread [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Smooth-leaf sotol regrows from the terminal bud after fire [<a href="#1">1</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Dasylirion leiophyllum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
The ability of smooth-leaf sotol to survive fire is dependent upon
individual plant morphology and the frequency and severity of fire.  On
3- to 7-year-old burned sites near the northern limits of the Chihuahuan
Desert, smooth-leaf sotol showed losses in excess of 50 percent [<a href="#1">1</a>].
Coverage and frequency of smooth-leaf sotol were 75 percent lower on
burned sites than on unburned sites [<a href="#1">1</a>]. Two years after an August fire
in a desert mountain shrub community, density of smooth-leaf sotol was
reduced 30 percent.  Coverage on the control (unburned site) was 9.06
percent, while it was only 2.44 percent on the burned site [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Smooth-leaf sotol occasionally sprouts from the terminal bud if lightly
or moderately burned [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  Surviving sotol regain most of their
postfire cover within 3 years, but 15 to 20 years are required for
plants to accumulate shaggy bases of dead leaves [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Periodic fires can be used to maintain or even increase grass cover at
the expense of shrubs such as smooth-leaf sotol in desert communities
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].
