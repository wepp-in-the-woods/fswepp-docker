<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Prince's pine is a common understory species in many habitat types
throughout its range but often does not reach dominance.  It is found in
coniferous and mixed forests with numerous tree species.  In addition to
those already mentioned, prince's pine may occur with sugar pine (Pinus
lambertiana), giant sequoia (Sequoia gigantea), and Brewer spruce (Picea
breweriana) [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>].  Several publications that list prince's pine as
a dominant understory species in the western United States follow.

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Prince's pine is of minor importance in winter, spring, and fall diets
of Roosevelt elk in the Pacific Northwest [<a href="#43">43</a>].  It is a component
of white-tailed deer winter diets in the Swan Valley, Montana [<a href="#56">56</a>].

Mature stands of white fir (Abies concolor)-giant chinquapin
(Chrysolepsis chrysophylla)/pachistima (Pachistima myrsinites)-prince's
pine and Shasta red fir (Abies magnifica var. shastensis)-white
fir-giant chinquapin/prince's pine-long stolon sedge (Carex inops) plant
associations in the Winema National Forest are critical elk calving and
deer fawning habitat.  They are also important for feeding and nesting
sites for birds and are suitable habitats for spotted owls, goshawks,
and pileated woodpeckers [<a href="#40">40</a>].  White fir-Brewer spruce/prince's pine
plant associations in the southern Oregon Cascade Mountain Province are
also excellent wildlife habitat [<a href="#8">8</a>].

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Prince's pine is sensitive to trampling and has a low potential for
recovery.  It may, however, recover from very low (less than 40 passes
per year) or low (75-100 passes per year) trampling intensities [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Historically, prince's pine roots and leaves were boiled and the
infusion was ingested as a treatment for tuberculosis and long-lasting
colds.  The leaves were also used as an astringent.  Prince's pine can
also be used as an ingredient in root beer [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].
 


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In a study of lodgepole pine stands in spruce (Picea engelmannii and P.
glauca)/queencup beadlily (Clintonia uniflora) habitat types in Glacier
National Park, prince's pine displayed a significant (p<.10) decrease in
frequency in response to a mountain pine beetle infestation and was more
numerous on sites never infested than sites infested 80 years earlier.
It was negatively correlated to overstory removal and increased light
intensity, as shown by a steady decline in cover and frequency following
the epidemic [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Prince's pine is a major constituent of old-growth forests in the Swan
Valley, Montana.  It often persists only on sheltered, unburned
microsites.  It is present (39% frequency) in untreated old-growth and
mature stands but is absent from burned clearcuts and plantation sites
(20-30 years old).  Where standing trees remain to provide cover,
frequency may be as high as 67 percent in stands that have been select
cut without burning [<a href="#22">22</a>].  At other locations prince's pine has
essentially disappeared from stands or has had a major decrease in
frequency or cover following stand removal with or without subsequent
burning [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].

In the Vancouver Forest Region of British Columbia, prince's pine is an
indicator species in several variants of biogeoclimatic units for which
guidelines for site diagnosis, tree species selection, and slash burning
have been developed [<a href="#26">26</a>].  It is used as an indicator of good forest
sites in the Winema and Fremont National Forests, Oregon.  When
associated with twinflower, it is an indicator of the best fir (Abies
spp.) sites [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  The presence of prince's pine is used to predict
natural regeneration success under partially cut stands on the Dead
Indian Plateau in southwest Oregon [<a href="#55">55</a>].

Prince's pine is not a serious competitor to conifer seedlings [<a href="#7">7</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Chimaphila umbellata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Prince's pine is a native evergreen low shrub or perennial rhizomatous
herb.  The woody stems are usually 4 to 12 inches (10-30 cm) tall and
the leathery, whorled leaves are sharply serrate.  The fertile stems are
generally erect and may have 2 to 15 flowers.  Fruits are depressed,
globose capsules which often persist through the winter
[<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].

Across its range, prince's pines show wide variation in size; in leaf
blade length, number of teeth, and prominence of lower surface venation;
in sepal shape; and in stigma and capsule size [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Prince's pine reproduces both sexually and vegetatively.  Flowers have
been observed being pollinated by bumblebees and staphylinid beetles
[<a href="#11">11</a>]. Prince's pine develops numerous, minute seeds [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].  Their
dispersal mechanism has not been documented.  A New Brunswick study of
boreal herb reproductive biology found that prince's pine flowered for
an average of 30 days.  Fruit set was low for flowers opening at the
beginning of the flowering period.  Eighty-three percent of buds opened
and 76.5 percent survived the flowering period.  Forty-seven percent of
flower buds eventually developed fruit, and 45.6 percent actually
matured fruit [<a href="#36">36</a>].

Prince's pine produces long rhizomes that normally grow at a fast rate.
Genets are generally long-lived [<a href="#83">83</a>].  Reports differ concerning the
depth of prince's pine rhizomes.  In a study of the Douglas-fir forest
zone in southern interior British Columbia, McLean [<a href="#52">52</a>] listed prince's
pine with species that have rhizomes growing from 2 to 5 inches (5-13
cm) below the mineral soil surface.  Most of those species are able to
regenerate from those depths, but he stated that only prince's pine
rhizomes near the soil surface are able to produce new shoots.  Stickney
[<a href="#78">78</a>] reported that in the northern Rocky Mountains, prince's pine
rhizomes are confined to the duff near or above the mineral soil
surface.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Prince's pine is found in a wide variety of soils and soil moisture
regimes.  It most commonly occurs in mixed woods and coniferous forests
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>] on dry, well-drained, rocky or sandy soils
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  In coastal regions of British Columbia, prince's pine is
an indicator of dry to very dry, nutrient-poor soils in montane boreal,
temperate, and cool mesothermal climates.  Its occurrence decreases with
increasing elevation and precipitation, and increases with
continentality [<a href="#47">47</a>].  In Ontario, prince's pine most often occurs on
sandy or rocky soil on well-drained sites, on gravel terraces, and in
jack pine (Pinus banksiana) barrens [<a href="#70">70</a>].  In red pine (P.
resinosa)-white pine (P. strobus) forests of Voyageurs National Park,
Minnesota, prince's pine is found on dry, shallow, well-drained,
nutrient poor to medium loamy sand to sandy loam soils [<a href="#51">51</a>].  In the
nearby Boundary Waters Canoe area, prince's pine is found on shallow,
sandy soils to deep soils with a high clay content [<a href="#59">59</a>].

Prince's pine also occurs in moist or imperfectly-drained situations
throughout its range.  It is found on moist sites in oak ecosystems of
Michigan [<a href="#2">2</a>], on moist sites in the Black Hills of South Dakota [<a href="#72">72</a>],
and in lodgepole pine (P. contorta) forests in Alberta [<a href="#9">9</a>].  In the
Adirondack Mountains of New York, prince's pine occurs on well- to
imperfectly-drained sites, most often under pines (Pinus spp.) on
outwash soils, but also on tills in mixed woods [<a href="#50">50</a>].

Prince's pine occurs in the following elevational ranges:

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Prince's pine has been classified as moderately shade tolerant to
tolerant throughout its range [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  Its highest
frequency or cover is probably reached at intermediate light levels,
such as in relatively open conifer stands in the Siskiyou Mountains of
Oregon [<a href="#15">15</a>].

In the western Cascades, prince's pine is significantly more frequent
(p<.05) under a Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) canopy than under a
western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) canopy (71% vs. 4% frequency).
Average cover under western hemlock is less than 1.0 percent compared to
12.5 percent under Douglas-fir.  The difference may be due to less
direct radiation in the western hemlock stands [<a href="#73">73</a>].

Prince's pine is present throughout succession and occurs in stands of
all ages [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].  It is found in relatively young stands
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>], but is probably more frequent in mid-successional stages and
mature forests [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Prince's pine is a common understory
component in many old-growth and climax forests of the Pacific Northwest
[<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Prince's pine flowers from June to August throughout its range
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Prince's pine is a fire-sensitive species that is very susceptible to
damage and often shows a strong decline following fire [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>].
Survival probably depends to a great extent on damage to rhizomes, so it
depends on depth of rhizomes, fire severity, and consumption of duff
[<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>].  Loss of the long-lived evergreen leaves may also reduce
survival.  Postfire vegetative recovery depends primarily on the
survival of scattered individuals in undisturbed microsites [<a href="#33">33</a>].

Prince's pine has a moderate to high probability of being killed by fire
[<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>].  Low-severity fires that do not consume the organic mantle may
only top-kill it.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Postfire response of prince's pine is variable and is probably most
dependent on fire severity and the uniformity of the burn.  Some studies
have reported prince's pine surviving fire.  In mixed western
hemlock-Douglas-fir-western redcedar (Thuja plicata) stands in North
Cascades National Park, Washington, prince's pine was considered a
residual species following a July wildfire.  Its frequency in postfire
years 1, 2, and 3 was 65.3, 52.1, and 52.1 percent, respectively [<a href="#54">54</a>].

Prince's pine appeared to survive on moderately burned sites following
the Waterfalls Canyon Fire in Grand Teton National Park in July, 1974,
but was eliminated from severely burned sites.  The prefire vegetation
was spruce-fir with lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and whitebark pine
(P. albicaulis).  Prince's pine had the following percent frequency and
cover as measured in 1975 [<a href="#10">10</a>]:

                         Frequency     Cover
______________________________________________
Unburned sites              52           5
Sites burned in 1932         2         trace
Moderately burned sites     17           1
Severely burned sites        0           0  

In the northern Rocky Mountains, slow recovery after fire has been
reported.  Prince's pine was eliminated from initial postfire
communities by a severe wildfire in western larch (Larix
occidentalis)-Douglas-fir stands on the Flathead National Forest,
Montana [<a href="#75">75</a>].  In western larch-fir (Abies grandis and A. lasiocarpa)
stands on the Flathead and Lolo National Forests, Montana, prince's pine
had not recovered by postfire year 9 following logging and broadcast
burning [<a href="#74">74</a>].  Prince's pine was also absent 10 months after a
late-summer wildfire in lodgepole pine stands in the Chamberlain Basin,
Idaho.  It was found on adjacent unburned sites and was present on
burned sites 5 years after the fire, but had less biomass production
than on unburned sites [<a href="#61">61</a>].

Variable responses to fire have been reported for prince's pine in
Minnesota.  It survived the Little Sioux Wildfire in May, 1971, in mixed
conifer-hardwood stands in northeastern Minnesota.  Number of
individuals (on seventy 0.605 sq m plots) and aboveground average dry
weight per individual prince's pine were measured at the end of each
growing season for the first 5 postfire years [<a href="#58">58</a>]:

                       1971     1972      1973     1974     1975
________________________________________________________________
No. of individuals      15     no data     57       30        7
Ave. dry wt. (g)       .07     no data    .33      .29      .46

Prince's pine responded more slowly after wildfires in second-growth
mixed conifer-hardwood forests in northeastern Minnesota.  It was not
present in postfire years 3, 5, or 14 after the April Heartlake Fire.
It was not present on the Kelley Creek Burn, resulting from a July fire,
at postfire year 2 but had a frequency of 3 percent in postfire years 5
and 11 [<a href="#48">48</a>].




<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Prince's pine is a component in many subzones in which guidelines for
prescribed burning and tree species selection have been developed in the
Vancouver Forest District, British Columbia [<a href="#46">46</a>].
