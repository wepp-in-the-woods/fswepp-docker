<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus torreyana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Torrey pine is the rarest pine in North America [<a href="#9">9</a>].  The natural
distribution of Torrey pine consists of two disjunct populations.  The
mainland population, in and near the Torrey Pines State Reserve (TPSR),
is confined to the low coastal bluffs flanking the Soledad Valley in San
Diego County, California.  It consists of approximately 7,000 trees
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  The other population occurs on Santa Rosa Island off the coast
of southern California, 175 miles (280 km) northwest of the mainland
population [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  This population consists of approximately 2,000
trees [<a href="#20">20</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
The Torrey pine forest is the only southern California coastal pine
forest [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Torrey pine part of the California closed-cone pine
forests [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  These forests merge with coastal sage scrub,
chaparral, dune scrub, and coastal salt marsh [<a href="#37">37</a>].  On Santa Rosa
Island, Torrey pine is a member of the Torrey pine woodland.  This
community ranges from a monotypic assemblage of Torrey pine with a
litter understory to more open stands that resemble woodlands mixed with
California scrub oak (Quercus dumosa) and shrubs [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Torrey pine is listed as a codominant or dominant species in the
following publications:

Plant communities of Santa Rosa Island, Channel Islands National Park [<a href="#5">5</a>]
The closed-cone pines and cypress [<a href="#37">37</a>]  
Preliminary descriptions of the terrestrial natural communities of
  California [<a href="#41">41</a>]
Plant communities of southern California [<a href="#42">42</a>].  
  
Some species commonly associated with Torrey pine include chamise
(Adenostoma fasciculatum), California sagebrush (Artemesia californica),
toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia), lemonadeberry (Rhus integrifolia),
California scrub oak, mule fat (Baccharis viminea), bush poppy
(Dendromecon rigida), California encelia (Encelia californica), white
sage (Salvia apiana), black sage (S. mellifera), saw-toothed goldenbush
(Haplopappus squarrosus), Costa Baja manzanita (Arctostaphylos
glandulosa ssp. crassifolia), Santa Rosa Island manzanita (A.

warty-stem ceanothus (Ceanothus verrucosus), feltleaf ceanothus (C.
arboreus), western yarrow (Achillea millefolium), sea fig (Carpobrotus
chilensis), iceplant (Mesembryanthemum spp.), Indian paintbrush
(Castilleja spp.), monkeyflower (Mimulus spp.), California poppy
(Eschscholzia californica), sedge (Carex globosa), oniongrass (Melica
imperfecta), bent grass (Agrostis spp.), slender wild oat (Avena
barbata), and purple cudweed (Gnaphalium purpureum).

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus torreyana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Seeds of Torrey pine are eaten by birds, rodents, and other mammals.
The dusky-footed and desert woodrats consume large quantities of Torrey
pine seeds and may greatly reduce their numbers in the seedbank [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Torrey pines are planted on wildlands and disturbed sites in San Diego,
California.  Near Point Loma, San Diego, they provide wildlife habitat
and protect existing coastal sage scrub shrubs [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Torrey pine is widely planted as an ornamental and has been evaluated as
a commercial species in Kenya, Australia, and New Zealand [<a href="#26">26</a>].  


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
The Torrey pine population in TPSR consists of large, mature
individuals; seedlings and saplings are infrequent [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Given the low
rate of seedling establishment and survival in the recent past, stand
age of Torrey pine will continue to increase within the TPSR [<a href="#26">26</a>]. 

Cattle grazing has significantly reduced the amount of native shrub
cover within Torrey pine stands on Santa Rosa Island.  The average
amount of open ground on four transects on Santa Rosa Island is about 78
percent compared to 30 percent on the mainland.  Seedling establishment
is higher on Santa Rosa Island than on the mainland [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Because of low genetic variability, Torrey pine has little capacity to
respond to change through natural selection.  Native populations should
be managed to maintain the maximum number of trees possible to minimize
the chance of catastrophic loss [<a href="#21">21</a>].   

Both the island and mainland populations of Torrey pine are threatened
by air pollution.  The mainland population is adjacent to densely
populated areas that generate extreme amounts of air pollution.  The
island population is threatened by seasonal easterly Santa Ana winds
carrying air with high concentrations of ozone and other pollutants from
the Los Angeles Basin [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].   

In 1988, a bark beetle (Ips paraconfusus) infestation occurred at TPSR.
By 1990, 12 percent of the adult trees had been killed.  In 1991, the
U.S. Forest Service utilized synthetic pheromones to lure ips beetles
into traps placed on trees.  Nine weeks after placement of the traps
130,000 beetles were captured [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Only one additional tree was
attacked after the trapping began.  The number of trapped beetles
eventually fell to about 100 per week [<a href="#2">2</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus torreyana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Torrey pine is a native, slow-growing tree endemic to California
[<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  It grows from 25 to 60 feet (7.5-18 m) tall, but is usually
around 40 feet (12 m) in height [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  The mature crown is open and
rounded with many large branches [<a href="#14">14</a>].  The needles are in fascicles of
5 and are 8 to 12 inches (20-30 cm) long [<a href="#16">16</a>].  The bark is rough and
flaky [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Cones are large, 4 to 6 inches (10.2-15.2 cm) wide, and
long.  They are harder and heavier than most other pine cones [<a href="#33">33</a>].
Torrey pine taproots may reach 25 feet (7.5 m) into sandstone, and
lateral roots can extend up to 225 feet (67.5 m) from the trunk [<a href="#9">9</a>].
The oldest Torrey pines are about 150 years old [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Torrey pine regenerates sexually.  It does not reproduce naturally by
vegetative methods.    

Seed production and dissemination:  Torrey pines begin to produce seed
when they are 12 to 18 years old.  Torrey pine exhibits delayed seed
dispersal, a pattern of seed release intermediate between open- and
closed-cone species.  In the TPSR, Torrey pine cones begin to open when
seeds are mature, but seed fall continues for up to 13 years after cone
maturity.  Over 76 percent of available seeds were in cones 1 or more
years after seed maturity [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Seed release accelerates through the
fourth year when cones retain 22 percent of seeds, and then levels off
or slowly declines [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Over 15 percent of the original seed is
retained 11 years following cone maturity [<a href="#26">26</a>].  At age 14, cones are
mostly open but still retain about 10 percent of seed [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Torrey
pines on Santa Rosa Island may release seed more rapidly than those in
the TPSR [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Seed viability decreases with cone age, but seeds at least partially
exposed for 10 years remain viable [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Predispersal loss of seed is
high in Torrey pine.  Before dispersal, 6.8 percent of seed is lost to
arthropod seed predators within the cone and 4.6 percent of seed has
already germinated.  Germination of seed in the cone is unique to Torrey
pine in the genus Pinus [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  The seed of Torrey pine is nearly
wingless; wind dispersal is negligible.  Birds such as scrub jays aid in
seed dissemination [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].   

Seedling development:  Cold stratification periods of 30 to 90 days at
33 to 41 degrees Fahrenheit (.56-5 deg C) are recommended for rapid and
complete germination [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Seedling mortality is largely a function of
water stress and is highest in July and August.  Seedling establishment
increases with disturbance such as fire.  Very few seedlings are
currently survive to reproductive age [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Torrey pine has adapted to a harsh environment of poor soils and little
moisture [<a href="#33">33</a>].  The climate is maritime with low winter rainfall and
frequent fog [<a href="#40">40</a>].  The species occurs in scattered groves or is widely
dispersed on ridgetops, slopes, and gullies.  It is also found in
coastal highlands, canyons, and mesas [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  It grows in open,
shallow, humus-poor, sandy soils [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Torrey pine is found at
elevations of 200 to 500 feet (60-150 m) [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Torrey pine is shade tolerant.  Approximately 90 percent of Torrey pine
seedlings are found under adult trees [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Torrey pine is monoecious.  Cones are pollinated from January to March
and reach maturity in the summer two and a half years later [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Cone
opening initiates when seeds are mature [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Seed dispersal begins in
September after cone-ripening [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus torreyana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Torrey pine exhibits delayed seed dispersal which is beneficial in the
event of fire [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Some seeds are released immediately after fire
and exploit postfire conditions such as sterilized soil, reduced
competition from other species, and the absence of seed-eating rodents
[<a href="#11">11</a>].  Other seeds are released gradually and increase Torrey pine
stocking.  Cones can be retained on trees and release viable seed for up
to 15 years [<a href="#28">28</a>].
  
McMasters [<a href="#27">27</a>] stated that delayed seed dispersal of Torrey pine and
reduced serotiny of other coastal and insular conifers may arise form
the same cause:  a fire pattern in which large scale, intense crown
fires have alternated with long intervals in which ther were no fires at
all or in which there were only low-severity surface fires.  


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tree without adventitious-bud root crown
   Crown residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<pre>
<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus torreyana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Torrey pine is fire-intolerant [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Low-severity fires will kill trees
up to 21 inches (52 cm) dbh even if no crown damage is sustained [<a href="#40">40</a>].
Severe fires kills trees of all sizes [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Seed drop is substantial after crown fires [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Establishment of
seedlings from stored seeds released by fire-killed trees has been
confirmed after both wildfires and prescribed fires [<a href="#39">39</a>].
  
An arson fire in TPSR occurred on July 12, 1972.  Ninety-three mature
trees were killed on 11.3 acres (4.8 ha).  Seedling establishment
occurred in postfire year 1 [<a href="#27">27</a>].  In May of 1979, 220 saplings and
seedlings were found in the burned area.  Juvenile tree density was two
and a half times greater than the prefire mature tree density [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].

On November 6 and 7, 1978, 31,204 square feet (2,900 sq m) were burned
in the TPSR under controlled conditions.  Results on Torrey pine
regeneration were inconclusive.  However, prescribed fires in the spring
of 1984 and winter of 1985, which killed 19 trees and 17 saplings, did
promote seedling establishment.  In January 1986, a total of 201
seedlings were found in the burned area [<a href="#40">40</a>].
 


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Torrey pine may be declining in the TPSR because past fire-exclusion
policies have created an unnatural setting.  Infrequent, severe fires
are best for Torrey pine seedling establishment, although disturbance is
not essential to seedling establishment [<a href="#26">26</a>].  According to Zedler and
others [<a href="#40">40</a>], maintaining a natural system in the TPSR may require that
it be allowed to burn to the ground every century [<a href="#40">40</a>].  If fires occur
in a Torrey pine population at intervals shorter than 12 to 18 years,
(when saplings begin to produce cones), they could seriously impair the
ability of the population to survive [<a href="#26">26</a>].
