<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The scientific name for slender bunchflower is Melanthium latifolium
Desr. (Liliaceae) [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Most eastern United States floras [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>]
use the synonym M. hybridum Walt., but Bodkin [<a href="#1">1</a>], who wrote the
monograph for the Melanthium genus in North America in 1978, argues
convincingly that this name is misapplied.  The taxonomy of slender
bunchflower is further complicated by the placement of the entire
Melanthium genus into the Veratrum genus by Zimmerman [<a href="#21">21</a>].  There are
no currently accepted infrataxa.

<b>FEDERAL LEGAL STATUS : </b>
See OTHER STATUS

<b>OTHER STATUS : </b>
Slender bunchflower was not found in 1978 in Delaware, Maryland, or
Virginia [<a href="#15">15</a>].  It was listed as probably extirpated in Delaware in 1979
[<a href="#15">15</a>]; in 1994, it was listed as extremely rare in Delaware [<a href="#9">9</a>].  In
1978, slender bunchflower was listed as possibly extirpated in
Tennessee, but it was rediscovered in four counties from 1981 to 1985
[<a href="#2">2</a>].  No existing populations of slender bunchflower are known in New
York [<a href="#20">20</a>].

<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Melanthium latifolium

<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Slender bunchflower occurs in the Appalachian Mountains from
southwestern Connecticut and southeastern New York south to northern
Georgia [<a href="#1">1</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Slender bunchflower occurs in the eastern deciduous forest biome [<a href="#1">1</a>].

At a Shenandoah National Park site dominated by oak (Quercus spp.) and
hickory (Carya spp.), herbaceous associates of slender bunchflower
included white snakeroot (Ageratina altissima), flypoison (Amianthium
muscitoxicum), white wood aster (Aster divaricatus), bigleaf aster (A.
macrophyllus), wild yam (Dioscorea villosa), Allegheny hawkweed
(Hieracium paniculatum), widowsfrill (Silene stellata), Atlantic
goldenrod (Solidago arguta), mountain decumbent goldenrod (S. caesia
var. curtisii), hairy goldenrod (S. hispida), and meadow zizia (Zizia
aptera).  Some slender bunchflower stalks emerged from a dense cover of
eastern hayscented fern (Dennstaedtia punctilobula) [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Slender bunchflower is found at lower elevations than Appalachian
bunchflower (Melanthium parviflorum) where populations overlap [<a href="#1">1</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Melanthium latifolium
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Slender bunchflower is a native, bulbous, perennial herb with an open
terminal panicle on a stem that grows 1.6 to 5 feet (0.5-1.6 m) tall.
The leaves are mostly basal and are 0.4 to 2.8 inches (1-7 cm) wide. The
fruit is a capsule.  Seeds are winged.  Underground vegetative parts
consist of a 0.2- to 0.7-inch (0.6-1.7 cm) diameter bulb composed of the
thickened bases of basal leaves.  Attached to the bulb base is a short
rhizome.  Roots arise from the peripheral area of the bulb at the
junction with the rhizome.  There are often at least two series of
lateral roots which are radially segmented and branch distally [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Bunchflowers flower irregularly.  Bodkin [<a href="#1">1</a>] estimated that less than 20
percent of bunchflower plants in the Appalachian Mountains flower in any
given year.  During 5 years of observations of a slender bunchflower
population in Shenandoah National Park, only 7 of approximately 50
plants flowered [<a href="#1">1</a>].

The winged seeds are presumably dispersed by wind.  

In a germination experiment, no slender bunchflower seeds germinated
under a variety of conditions although some dissected seeds contained
embryos [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Bodkin [<a href="#1">1</a>] suggested that slender bunchflower reproduction may be
primarily vegetative.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Slender bunchflower occurs on slopes and in ravines, gorges, and coves.
It grows on rich, moist sites on rocky, well-drained soils.  Although
soils may appear dry, the roots of slender bunchflower usually penetrate
to moister subsoils [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Slender bunchflower occurred on a rock outcrop
with seepage in the Thompson River Gorge in South Carolina [<a href="#18">18</a>].
Slender bunchflower generally occurs from 1,000 to 5,500 feet (305-1,677
m) elevation [<a href="#1">1</a>].  It is restricted to areas of high elevation in
eastern Tennessee [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Slender bunchflower is shade tolerant.  It occurs in dense, shaded
habitats [<a href="#1">1</a>] and is not reported as occurring on open, sunny sites.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Slender bunchflower flowers from July to August, and fruits ripen
September through October [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Melanthium latifolium
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Information on the fire ecology of slender bunchflower is lacking in the
literature.  Slender bunchflower probably survives most fires because
its bulb and growing points are located beneath the soil surface.
However, it may not thrive on sites where cover is completely removed by
severe fire.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Geophyte, growing points deep in soil

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Slender bunchflower is probably top-killed by fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Slender bunchflower probably regenerates after fire with vegetative
growth from bulbs and rhizomes.
