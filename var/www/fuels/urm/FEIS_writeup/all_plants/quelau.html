<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The historical nomenclature of laurel oak is complicated.  In the past,
most authorities, including Little [<a href="#24">24</a>], treated laurel oaks as a single
species but differed on the appropriate scientific name [<a href="#43">43</a>].  More
recent authorities [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>] recognize two species, Quercus laurifolia
and Q. hemisphaerica, based on anatomical differences and vast
differences in site preferences.  Diamond-leaf oak, swamp laurel oak,
and laurel oak are common names for the wetland form, currently called
Q. laurifolia and formerly called Q. obtusa.  The upland form, currently
called Q. hemisphaerica by some authorities, has acute leaf tips and
flowers 2 weeks later than the wetland form in the same area [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].
This report recognizes one species of laurel oak under the scientific
name of Quercus laurifolia L. [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Information from authors that
recognize and discuss Q. hemisphaerica as a separate species is included
and noted as such.

Laurel oak has been placed within the subgenus Erythrobalanus, or black
(red) oak group.  Laurel oak is difficult to identify and is often
confused with willow oak (Q. phellos) and water oak (Q. nigra) [<a href="#40">40</a>].  It
has been suggested that laurel oak is a hybrid between these two
species, but that may not be the case because willow oak is absent from
southeastern Georgia and peninsular Florida where laurel oak is abundant
[<a href="#27">27</a>].

Laurel oak hybridizes with the following species [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>]:

   x Q. falcata (southern red oak):  Q. X. beaumontiana Sarg.
   x Q. incana (bluejack oak):  Q. X. atlantica Ashe
   x Q. laevis (turkey oak):  Q. X. mellichampii Trel.
   x Q. marilandica (blackjack oak):  Q. X. diversiloba Tharp ex A. Camus

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Laurel oak is often present in forested wetlands, a transitional
community between swamps and pine (Pinus spp.) flatlands or mesic
hammocks.  It grows throughout hydric hammocks, from the swamp margin to
the drier sections, being replaced at the very dry end by live oak (Q.
virginiana) and water oak [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Q. hemisphaerica is present in high
hammocks which are situated between sand or clay hills and midslope
hammocks [<a href="#34">34</a>].  The following published classifications list laurel oak
as a dominant species:

   The natural communities of South Carolina [<a href="#16">16</a>]
   Eastern deciduous forest [<a href="#45">45</a>]
   Forest vegetation of the Big Thicket, southeast Texas [<a href="#26">26</a>]

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Although laurel oak has hard, heavy, and strong wood, it is not good
quality lumber.  It is marketed for pulp wood and also used for firewood
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
The consistent and abundant acorn crops are an important food source for
many animals, including white-tailed deer, raccoon, squirrels, wild
turkey, ducks, quail, smaller birds, and rodents.  Laurel oak ranked
second in quantity and frequency of acorns consumed by wild turkey in
Florida.  In a study of the 10 most heavily used winter foods of deer in
Florida, laurel oak acorns rated fifth, sixth, and seventh in a 6-year
period.  Acorns of the black oak group do not germinate until spring,
unlike those of the white oak group, and are an important winter food
source [<a href="#27">27</a>].



<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Laurel oak is considered a good deer browse [<a href="#38">38</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Laurel oak has attractive leaves and is often planted as an ornamental
[<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Laurel oak is susceptible to oak leaf blister (Taphrina caerulescens),
actinopelte spot (Actinopelte dryina), and canker rots by various fungi.
Although not damaged itself, laurel oak is a very susceptible host for
the alternative stage of fusiform rust (Cronartium quercuum f. sp.
fusiforme), a serious disease of southern pines.  Weevils (Curculio
spp.) infest the acorns of laurel oak [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Laurel oak will grow well on moderately drained sites using several
silvicultural systems.  Natural regeneration is possible using the
shelterwood system but requires a relatively high density of 35 to 40
square feet basal area per acre (3.7-4.2 sq m/ha).  If clearcutting is
used, direct seeding is the best method to regenerate laurel oak.
Planting seedlings may be difficult because of poor drainage and
difficult access into bottomland sites [<a href="#15">15</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus laurifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Laurel oak is a rapidly growing, short-lived, semi-evergreen tree.  It
can reach 148 feet (45 m) in height and 6.6 feet (2 m) in d.b.h.  Laurel
oak identified as Q. hemisphaerica is slightly smaller at 131 feet (40
m) [<a href="#8">8</a>], and a geographic or climatic form in east Texas grows to only 30
feet (9.1 m) [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Poor site conditions may be responsible for the
smaller heights reported for Q. hemisphaerica.

Laurel oak develops a large, well-defined taproot on upland sands, but
little else is known about its rooting habit [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Roots of trees
growing in wet areas are often buttressed, which provides stability in
wet soils and may help aerate the root system [<a href="#43">43</a>].



<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Laurel oak is monoecious.  Acorn production begins when the
tree reaches 15 to 20 years of age.  Laurel oak produces abundant
flowers almost every year and is a prolific seed bearer.  Dissemination
of the heavy acorns is mainly by squirrels, but gravity and water also
play a role [<a href="#27">27</a>]. 

Germination is hypogeal.  Although laurel oak acorns generally germinate
in the spring, they exhibit only mild dormancy [<a href="#27">27</a>].  In one study,
acorns showed a 50 percent germinative capacity without cold
stratification [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Germination is unaffected or even slightly
increased by soaking acorns in water, a condition frequently encountered
in bottomland forests [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Seedlings grow rapidly [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Vegetative:  If cut or burned, laurel oak sprouts from the base of the
stump.  Older trees do not sprout vigorously, and their sprouts are more
susceptible to decay than those of younger trees [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Laurel oak is generally considered a bottomland [<a href="#47">47</a>] or facultative
wetland species [<a href="#1">1</a>].  It is not as dependent on specific site conditions
as other hardwood associates [<a href="#30">30</a>].  It generally grows in soils that are
better drained than where water oak and willow oak grow, but grows in
very wet sites as well [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Laurel oak commonly grows on alluvial
flood plains and sandy soils near rivers, swamps, and hammocks.  It
grows best on soils of the Ultisol and Inceptisol orders [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Laurel oak is moderately tolerant of flooding [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  It is more
tolerant of prolonged soil saturation than is water oak or live oak, but
it cannot survive inundation during the entire growing season.  Short
periods of deep inundation have been known to kill laurel oak [<a href="#43">43</a>].
Laurel oak grows on high lands surrounding swamps and major rivers which
flood deeply and frequently but drain rapidly because of relief.  It
also grows on wet flats which are better drained than swamps [<a href="#18">18</a>].

In addition to bottomland forests, laurel oak is found in bay swamps,
mixed hardwood swamps, river swamps, hydric hammocks, and cypress
(Taxodium spp.) ponds and strands [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Laurel oak also grows on
barrier islands off the Atlantic Coast [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  On an island off South
Carolina, laurel and live oaks grow 0.3 mile (0.5 km) inland from the
ocean on the southern end of the island and to the beach on the northern
end [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Q. hemisphaerica grows on dry, sandy sites [<a href="#11">11</a>] including stable dunes
of beaches and islands [<a href="#20">20</a>], mesic and xeric hammocks, and sandhills
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  In east Texas, a form of laurel oak, described as Q.
hemisphaerica, forms extensive mottes on sandy hammocks and prairies
[<a href="#40">40</a>].

In addition to trees mentioned in SAF Cover Types; Habitat Types and
Plant Communities; and Taxonomy, overstory associates include Nuttall
oak (Q. nuttallii), white oak (Q. alba), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron
tulipifera), red maple (Acer rubrum), green ash (Fraxinus
pennsylvanica), swamp hickory (Carya glabra), and honeylocust (Gleditsia
triacanthos); and on wetter sites water hickory (Carya aquatica),
waterlocust (Gleditsia aquatica), and overcup oak (Q. lyrata).  On
better-drained sites, laurel oak is associated with spruce pine (Pinus
glabra), swamp chestnut oak (Q. michauxii), and cherrybark oak (Q.
falcata var. pagodifolia).

Common associates in Florida are southern magnolia (Magnolia
grandifolia), pignut hickory (Carya glabra), scrub hickory (C.
floridana), and Carolina basswood (Tilia caroliniana).

Associated shrubs and small trees include American hornbeam (Carpinus
caroliniana), Virgnia-willow (Itea virginica), poison-sumac
(Toxicodendron vernix), swamp cyrilla (Cyrilla racemiflora), littleleaf
cyrilla (C. racemiflora var. parvifolia), sebastian bush (Sebastiana
ligustrina), dahoon (Ilex cassine), possumhaw (I. decidua), swamp
dogwood (Cornus stricta), sweet pepperbush (Clethra alnifolia), tree
lyonia (lyonia ferruginea), buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis),
pinckneya (Pinckneya pubens), and rhododendron (Rhododendron spp.).
Associated vines include coral greenbrier (Smilax walteri), laurelleaf
greenbrier (S. laurifolia), crossvine (Bignonia capreolata), muscadine
grape (Vitis rotundifolia), and Alabama supplejack (Berchemia scandens)
[<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Laurel oak is shade tolerant and often becomes established under and
grows up through a dense canopy [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Monk [<a href="#28">28</a>] considers laurel oak a
climax pioneer species because it invades successional communities and
is instrumental in the conversion to climax.  It has produced successful
seedlings beneath a laurel oak canopy [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Laurel oak is also an early invader on some sites.  It will invade early
seral wetlands if a seed source is nearby [<a href="#9">9</a>].  With fire suppression,
laurel and willow oaks invaded a wetland savanna in the Big Thicket area
of east Texas.  The savanna eventually became an oak flat with very
little growing beneath the oaks and standing water much of the year
[<a href="#46">46</a>].

In the absence of fire, laurel oak (including Q. hemisphaerica of
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>]) invades and becomes established on former longleaf pine
(Pinus palustris) sites and sandhill sites [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  Laurel oak was
found on upland longleaf sites with colored sand, but not on harsher
white sand soils which are leached and well sorted [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Laurel oak sustains high leaf fall production from October to March
[<a href="#43">43</a>].  It flowers in February or March, at the same time that the last
of the previous year's leaves are shed.  Acorns mature after 2 years and
fall in late September and October.  Germination occurs in the spring
[<a href="#27">27</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus laurifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Laurel oak is fire intolerant.  It is frequently top-killed by even
low-severity surface fires because it has relatively thin bark.  It is
also a poor natural pruner [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Many laurel oak stands such as those on hydric hammocks owe their
existence to protection from fire [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Hardwood hammocks are extremely
susceptible to fire damage, especially during the dry season.  A
dry-season surface fire may burn the organic soil down to the bedrock
[<a href="#44">44</a>].

If fire is suppressed, laurel oak expands from hydric hammocks into
adjacent communities [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Unlike the original hammock, expanding
hammocks often have a dense saw-palmetto (Serenoa repens) understory.  A
dry-season fire in Myakka River State Park, Florida, killed many large
laurel oaks in the expanding hammock but not in the original hammock.
The dense saw-palmetto understory was, in part, responsible for the high
mortality of laurel oak in the expanding hammock [<a href="#19">19</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus laurifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Laurel oak smaller than 3 inches (7.6 cm) in d.b.h. can be top-killed by
low-severity fire [<a href="#2">2</a>].  More severe fires may completely kill this
fire-sensitive species [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Young laurel oak sprouts vigorously from the root crown if top-killed
by fire.  Older trees do not sprout as readily.  Trees subject to
occasional fires commonly develop heart rot where fire wounded [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Oak-dominated forests on elevated margins of wetland ecosystems are
often converted to loblolly (Pinus taeda) and slash pine (P. elliottii)
plantations because of the high productivity potential of these sites.
Prescibed fire is used to prevent hardwood establishment in the
plantations [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Laurel oak up to 3 inches (7.6 cm) in d.b.h. can be
top-killed and sprouts kept small and controllable with prescribed
winter fires.  Summer fires are also effective at hardwood control, but
do not enhance the wildlife food supply [<a href="#2">2</a>].
