<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Porcupine grass is an important early season forage of good but not
choice palatability for all classes of livestock.  As the species
matures the leaves become somewhat tough for sheep but are still grazed
to some extent.  The value of porcupine grass as forage is relatively
higher in the fall than in midsummer because it remains green after most
grasses have dried [<a href="#24">24</a>].




<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability varies with phenological development.  Palatability is
highest in the spring and early summer when plants are young and
succulent.  Porcupine grass remains moderately palatable until the
seedheads mature, at which time long, sharp awns may injure grazing
livestock and render the plant less palatable [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].
  
The relish and degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife species for
porcupine grass in Montana and North Dakota has been rated as follows
[<a href="#12">12</a>]:

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The nutritional value of porcupine grass during five major stages of
growth are [<a href="#26">26</a>] (values are percentage of dry weight with the exception
of carotene which is in mg/kg):

              Leaf

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The degree to which porcupine grass provides environmental protection
during one or more seasons for wildlife species has been rated as
follows [<a href="#12">12</a>]:

                           ND
Pronghorn                 Good
Mule deer                 Good
White-tailed deer         Fair
Small nongame birds       Good
Upland game birds         Good
Waterfowl                 Fair


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Trail restoration was conducted in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, on old
trails found on a steep (2:1), sandy, south-facing slope.  Seeds found
in prairie hay mulch (primarily needle-and-thread grass (Hesperostipa comata)
and porcupine grass) held down by jute mesh blankets successfully
germinated and established new growth [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Porcupine grass is difficult to establish by seed.  Germination varies
from 0 to 12 percent [<a href="#21">21</a>], and seeds are extremely difficult to clean,
which reduces purity.  Transplanting has been fairly successful but is
very costly [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Porcupine grass mulch seems to be the best choice
for successful, low-cost establishment.


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Native Americans of the Missouri River Region used the stiff awns to
make hair brushes [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Porcupine grass decreases with overgrazing.  Moderate to severe grazing
pressure greatly reduces later growth and seed production [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].
Slight to light use removes standing litter, increasing growth of
porcupine grass [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Frequent early mowing (June or July) results in a decrease in cover of
porcupine grass, whereas delaying mowing until August may increase its
cover [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].

Porcupine grass does poorly under drought conditions but is able to
recover once conditions have returned to normal.  Seedling survival
during simulated drought conditions ranged from 0 to 54 percent [<a href="#36">36</a>].
Porcupine grass was listed among species which had high mortality during
the 30's drought.  Mortality was thought to result from the relatively
shorter roots on these grasses.  However, once drought conditions ended,
porcupine grass regained its original territory and spread widely [<a href="#48">48</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Hesperostipa spartea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Porcupine grass is a native, perennial, cool-season bunchgrass.  It is
often confused with needle-and-thread grass, but its leaves are longer,
generally less rolled, lighter in color, and considerably wider [<a href="#18">18</a>].
It may grow to a height of 4 feet (1.2 m) but generally reaches 1.5 to 3
feet (0.45-0.9 m).  Flower stalks grow from 2 to 4 feet (0.6-1.2 m).
Root systems of mature plants usually reach depths of about 4.5 feet
(1.35 m), but occasionaly extend to 6 feet (1.8 m).  Numerous, profusely
branched, smaller roots occupy the top 8 to 18 inches (20-46 cm) of
soil, spreading horizontally or diagonally downward.  The longer roots
give rise to many laterals which divide into fine branches in deeper
soil [<a href="#47">47</a>].



<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Cryptophyte (geophyte)
   Burned or Clipped State:  Cryptophyte (geophyte)


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Porcupine grass reproduces sexually [<a href="#12">12</a>].  The seeds have a unique
method of planting themselves.  As the twisted awns expand and contract
with variations in temperature and moisture, the seeds are drilled into
the soil.

Strong winds may transport seeds a considerable distance, especially
when awns are twisted together in clumps [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Animals also carry seeds
as the awns become trapped in their coats.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Porcupine grass is found in prairies, foothills, and canyons at lower
elevations, often dominating dry, well-drained sites [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  In
Colorado it is found from 5,300 to 7,500 feet (1,615 to 2,286 m) in dry
to moist habitats [<a href="#12">12</a>].  In Minnesota it is dominant on a sandy level
upland.  It also occurs on well-drained gentle slopes but is not
dominant [<a href="#13">13</a>].  In Nebraska it is found on high prairie, low prairie,
and disturbed areas, but is typically an upland species, generally
dominant on south and east slopes [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  It mainly occurs on poorer
soil types throughout the northern Great Plains [<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Porcupine grass is a climax dominant on several sites in the Great
Plains [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  It also occurs as a pioneer species, often
establishing on small disturbed or denuded areas, such as gopher mounds
[<a href="#42">42</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Leaf growth of porcupine grass begins in late March to early April in
western North Dakota [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Flowering occurs earliest in the eastern and
southern, and latest in the northern and western portion of its range
[<a href="#33">33</a>].  In Wyoming, North Dakota, and Nebraska flowering occurs from May
to June [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>], and in Montana from June to August [<a href="#12">12</a>].

A study in western North Dakota recorded an 8-year average of the
significant phenological stages of porcupine grass [<a href="#18">18</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Hesperostipa spartea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Porcupine grass survives low to moderate severity fires due to
carbohydrate reserves stored in an underground root crown.  It lacks
rhizomes, and the root system is relatively shallow.  Severe fires can
kill the root crown, but such fires are rare on grasslands [<a href="#48">48</a>].

Fire was an important ecological factor on prairies containing porcupine
grass.  In the absence of fire, tree encroachment was common, and the
plant community often changed to forest within 30 years [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
All aboveground portions of porcupine grass are destroyed by fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Kruse and Higgins [<a href="#29">29</a>] reported porcupine grass both increasing and
decreasing following spring burns.  Four studies reported favorable
responses after spring burns which occurred from April 30 to May 26
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>], while four reported neutral or negative responses after
burning between April 9 and May 8 [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Positive effects
include increased seed production and flowering [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>], an increase in
total biomass [<a href="#7">7</a>], and an increase in cover [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Negative effects
include a decrease in cover [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>] and a reduction in culm production
[<a href="#20">20</a>].  Porcupine grass was listed as actively growing in one study [<a href="#25">25</a>],
and growing season precipitation was lower than normal in another study
[<a href="#20">20</a>], which may account for the negative responses.

The majority of the studies provided insufficient information for direct
comparison of the effects of burning in different seasons.  A general
statement about cool-season grasses is that they are harmed by late
spring burns when actively growing.  The four studies which gave results
contradicting this did not report the phenological stage of porcupine
grass prior to burning.



<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Twenty-five years of annual burning decreased cover of western porcupine
grass in east-central Alberta.  No season or intensity of fire was given
[<a href="#1">1</a>].  Annual spring burns (late April to early May) in two Minnesota
studies favored porcupine grass [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Burning was conducted to
return the area to pre-settlement oak savannah woodlands [<a href="#50">50</a>], and to
determine the effects of fire on an aspen-prairie ecotone [<a href="#43">43</a>].

Fall burning (October 3) reduced canopy coverage and seed production.
The growth stage was not determined prior to the fire [<a href="#3">3</a>].



<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Due to the varied results under similar burning conditions, it is
difficult to make accurate management recommendations.
