<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arbutus menziesii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
The wood of Pacific madrone is heavy and dense, but it checks badly
under normal drying procedures and has not been widely used in wood
products manufacturing [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  It has been utilized occasionally for
flooring and cabinet making; the fine-textured, twisted grain produces a
handsome veneer [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Pacific madrone is considered a potentially
valuable source of both pulpwood and fuelwood on many sites [<a href="#49">49</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Although widespread throughout much of its range, Pacific madrone is
rarely browsed by livestock or big game [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  Browse is generally
utilized only when more preferred species are unavailable [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  The
fruits, however, are extensively utilized by a variety of both wild and
domestic species, including the mule deer, raccoon, ringtail,
band-tailed pigeon, American robin, varied thrush, Montezuma quail
[<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>], and poultry [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Pacific madrone typically grows with mixtures of evergreen and hardwood
species.  Mixed stands are highly diverse in both structure and
composition and provide habitat for numerous wildlife species [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability of Pacific madrone foliage ranges from low to moderately
high, depending on plant condition and community associates [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].
Mature leaves are rarely utilized by grazing animals [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Following
fire, however, leafy sprouts are preferred by mule deer, domestic sheep
and goats, and to a lesser degree, cattle [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  Increased postburn
use generally continues for up to two growing seasons.  Pacific madrone
is of moderate browse value to mule deer in portions of California [<a href="#61">61</a>].

Browse ratings for madrone in California are as follows [<a href="#61">61</a>]:

        Deer        fair - useless
        Cattle      poor - useless
        Sheep       poor - useless
        Goats       poor - useless
        Horses      useless


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Mixed stands of hardwoods and conifers provide thermal, hiding, and
escape cover for big game and small mammals, as well as perching sites
for a variety of bird species [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Both open-nesting and
cavity-nesting birds utilize Pacific madrone.  Preliminary research on
cavity-nesting species within mixed-evergreen forests in northwestern
California indicates that Pacific madrone is selected as a nest tree at
a higher rate than its availability would suggest.  Trees greater than
12 inches (30 cm) d.b.h. are an important habitat component for a number
of primary cavity-nesting species, such as the red-breasted sapsucker
and hairy woodpecker [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Secondary cavity nesters, such as the acorn
woodpecker, downy woodpecker, mountain chickadee, house wren, and
western bluebird, also use Pacific madrone.


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Pacific madrone may be useful for erosion control, since it sprouts
vigorously following disturbance.  Pacific madrone is usually propagated
via seedling transplants derived from either spring- or fall-sown seed
[<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  Approximately 1,000 useable plants result from 1 pound (0.45
kg) of Pacific madrone seed [<a href="#61">61</a>].  Plants may also be propagated from
cuttings, grafting, and layering [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Due to burl formation and the
development of a wide, spreading root system, established plants are
extremely difficult to transplant [<a href="#61">61</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Despite its regular shedding of both bark and leaves, Pacific madrone is
a highly ornamental species, prized for its crooked beauty, colorful
bark, showy flowers, and brightly colored fruits [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Trees are
cultivated for landscaping in both the United States and Europe [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].
Other commercial uses of Pacific madrone include utilization of the bark
for tanning leathers and the wood for charcoal production [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].
Pacific madrone is also a well-known bee plant [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].

Historically, West Coast Indian tribes ate Pacific madrone berries and
fashioned eating utensils from the bulbous roots [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  The astringent
leaves have been used medicinally; the berries apparently possess some
narcotic properties [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>]. 


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Competition with conifers:  Pacific madrone competes with conifers
following logging or burning [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  Once released, Pacific
madrone develops with remarkable speed and often forms a dense cover
which interferes with conifer establishment and growth [<a href="#58">58</a>].  Numerous
laboratory studies suggest that Pacific madrone produces allelopathic
chemicals which slow the natural regeneration of Douglas-fir [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].
Under field conditions, however, the allelopathic effect of Pacific
madrone is generally considered rather subtle and part of a "complex" of
influences through which madrone contributes to poor conifer
regeneration [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Although Pacific madrone often competes for light,
nutrients, and moisture, on some sites it actually serves as a nurse
crop for Douglas-fir [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>]; however, beneficial effects probably do
not last much beyond the conifer establishment period.  Pacific madrone
soil apparantly contains Rhizopogon mycorrhizae [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Addition of
madrone soil to sites previously occupied by whiteleaf manzanita
(Arctostaphylos viscida) stimulated growth and survival of planted
Douglas-fir on sites in southwestern Oregon.

Herbicides can be effective in temporarily reducing Pacific madrone
cover [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  In plantations, aerial applications of low volatile
esters of 2,4-D have been used for both ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir
release [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  As with other sclerophyllous understories, preharvest
burning alone or slash burning used in conjunction with either
preharvest or postharvest burning are also potential methods of control
[<a href="#29">29</a>].  Other nonchemical control methods include mechanical means of
site preparation, such as uprooting stumps or stump grinding [<a href="#14">14</a>].
Nonchemical treatments are most successful when applied within a few
years of conifer planting programs; postplanting follow-up treatments
may be necessary on many sites.

Prediction equations have been developed to estimate reliably the
postdisturbance sprouting potential of Pacific madrone from preharvest
inventory data [<a href="#58">58</a>].  Since these equations predict cover by diameter
class, it may be possible to identify that segment of the madrone
understory contributing most to postdisturbance coverages, thereby
aiding the selection of an appropriate control method on a site.

On intensively managed sites, minimizing seedling establishment on
recently logged or burned areas can reduce future populations of
vigorously sprouting Pacific madrones [<a href="#59">59</a>].  Coincidence of madrone seed
production with forest floor disturbance should be avoided.  In stands
where shelterwood or clearcut logging is planned, madrone seed trees can
be removed prior to harvest by using a single stem-injection of
herbicide.  At least 90 percent of madrones are killed or severely
damaged by this type of treatment.  Since trees which survive herbicide
treatment recover slowly, seed production can be substantially reduced
for up to 15 years.  Limited observations also indicate that if madrone
trees are felled when they occur in well-stocked, conifer-hardwood
stands over 30 years of age, sprouts usually do not produce seed [<a href="#59">59</a>].

Pacific madrone management:  Pacific madrone has been considered a "weed
tree" with respect to conifer management [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Since it is a relatively
persistant, seral species on many sites, intensive management of madrone
for hardwood timber production may be a logical management option in
some instances [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Management potential is highest on sites where
extensive, even-aged stands have developed after clearcutting or fire.
Clearcut harvesting and manipulating subsequent sprout stands is the
recommended silvicultural treatment [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Sprouting from burls may be
encouraged by cutting stumps to less than 8 inches (20 cm); basal
sprouts have a low incidence of rot bridging from stump to sprout pith.
Leaving higher stumps encourages stool sprouts and increases the
likelihood of heartrot in young stands.  Better form is achieved with
relatively dense stocking, usually above 102 square feet/acre (23.4
square m/ha) [<a href="#40">40</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arbutus menziesii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Pacific madrone is a native broadleaved sclerophyllous evergreen tree
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Heights range from 25 to 130 feet (7.6 to 40 m) [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].
Trees occupying favorable sites typically range from 50 to 80 feet (15
to 25 m) in height with diameters of up to 2 feet (0.6 m) [<a href="#52">52</a>].  Single
or multiple curved trunks support a broad, spreading crown composed of
heavy, irregularly shaped limbs [<a href="#2">2</a>].  The bark is freely exfoliating,
peeling off in large, thin scales.  Once the bark is shed, the remaining
surface typically exhibits a smooth, polished appearence and a
distinctive reddish color [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Color of young bark varies widely but
darkens to a deep red with age; younger stems may range from green to
chartreuse, while young trunks are frequently orange [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Older
portions of the bark become dark, brownish-red in color and are
fissured.  The glossy, leathery leaves are dark green above and paler
green below and are arranged alternately on the stem.

Inconspicous, bisexual urn-shaped flowers are borne in showy, terminal
clusters [<a href="#52">52</a>].  Flowers range from white to pink in color and are sweet
smelling [<a href="#2">2</a>].  The fruit is a bright red to orange-red, pea-sized berry
consisting of a mealy pulp and numerous, bony seeds [<a href="#2">2</a>].  At the base of
the stem, Pacific madrone possesses a woody, globe-shaped, underground
regenerative organ known as a burl [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  The massive, widespreading
root system is associated with ericoid mycorrhizae [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  Once
established, Pacific madrone is windfirm, drought enduring, and somewhat
tolerant of wet, freezing conditions [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].

Growth:  Best growth occurs on humid, coastal sites [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Trees may
live to 200 years of age or more [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Sprouts grow quite rapidly
following disturbances which kill the aboveground stems [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophtye (mesophanerophyte)
   Burned or Clipped State:  Cryptophyte (geophyte)


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Pacific madrone regenerates both sexually and vegetatively.  Disturbed
environments and early seral situations are extremely conducive to
madrone regeneration; plants produce abundant seed and prolific sprouts
[<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].

Reproduction from seed:  Unlike many evergreen hardwoods, Pacific
madrone is a regular seeder.  Abundant seed is produced almost every
year, with seed production occurring as early as 3 to 5 years of age
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Birds and mammals are important long-distance dispersal agents
for the boney seeds which are contained in brightly colored, pea-sized
berries [<a href="#16">16</a>].  If not animal-dispersed, berries fall directly beneath
parent plants [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Although most seed is viable, a stratification
period of approximately 60 days at 33 to 40 degrees F (0.6 to 4 degrees
C) on a moist seedbed is required to stimulate germination [<a href="#52">52</a>].
Germination rates of previously stratified seed are high.  In laboratory
tests, 94 percent germination occurred over 38 days at temperatures of
approximately 70 degrees F (21 degrees C) [<a href="#52">52</a>].  Scarification with
sulfuric acid does not enhance germination.  Seeds remain viable for at
least 2 years when stored at room temperature [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Natural germination takes place from February to April [<a href="#16">16</a>].  On
mixed-evergreen sites in southwestern Oregon, seedling emergence
occurred from early March to early May; more than 90 percent of
seedlings emerged within a 1-month period and no second or third year
emergence was observed [<a href="#59">59</a>].  Despite high rates of germination and
emergence, seedling survival is poor on most sites.  Approximately 90 to
100 percent of seedlings die within the first year [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  Few
seedlings survive beneath well-stocked conifer-hardwood stands.  Forest
floor layers contain damping-off fungi and invertebrates (probably
slugs) which kill large numbers of seedlings.  Since hypocotyls are soft
and flabby, first year seedlings are also very susceptible to mortality
from litterfall.  Seedlings are sometimes able to survive their first
summer under light canopy densities in conifer-hardwood stands; however,
most die from litterfall over the winter [<a href="#59">59</a>].  Other factors
contributing to poor seedling establishment on forested sites include
drought, seed predation, and perhaps insufficient light.

Successful germination and establishment occurs most frequently on
moist, partially shaded, mineral soil [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Favorable nursery
conditions are present in young clearcuts where logging has exposed
mineral soil and reduced overstory litterfall [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Recent studies of
Pacific madrone seedling establishment on mixed-evergreen sites indicate
that first year survival appears significantly related to overstory
canopy density (P=0.05) [<a href="#59">59</a>].  On these southwestern Oregon sites,
better average seedling survival occurred on clearcut versus forested
environments.  Seedling survival was highly variable even within
clearcuts, however, and depended on microsites protected from direct
radiation, frost heaving, and cold temperatures.  Litterfall from
associated shrubs and sprouting hardwoods also contributed to seedling
mortality on clearcuts.  On recently logged redwood (Sequoia
sempervirens) sites, madrone seedlings readily established in open
environments on relatively hot, dry sites with poor soils [<a href="#62">62</a>].

Madrone seedlings grow slowly [<a href="#40">40</a>].  First year seedlings are typically
0.6 to 1.4 inches (1.5-3.5 cm) tall with a taproot less than 4 inches
(10 cm) long.  Average height of second year seedlings is approximately
1 inch (2.5 cm) [<a href="#59">59</a>].  Once established, seedlings are extremely drought
tolerant [<a href="#16">16</a>].
 
Vegetative regeneration:  Pacific madrone regenerates vegetatively by
adventitious budding from stumps and basal burls following fire and
other disturbance [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Pacific madrone is widely distributed throughout the Pacific Coast
region, occurring from coastal redwood forests to oak woodlands and
chaparral communities [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  This species is generally restricted
to sites having mild oceanic winters [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Temperature and moisture
regimes vary considerably throughout its distribution; annual
precipitation may range from 15 to 150 inches (37.5 to 373 cm) [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].
Although ubiquitious throughout its range, Pacific madrone rarely occurs
in pure stands [<a href="#16">16</a>].
  
Southern range:  Pacific madrone is often associated with dry foothills,
wooded slopes and canyons in California and southwestern Oregon [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].
In California, elevations range from 300 to 4,000 feet (91 to 1,220 m)
[<a href="#53">53</a>].  A common component of coastal redwood and mixed-evergreen
forests, Pacific madrone reaches greatest stature and abundance on dry
sites at low to moderate elevations along the east slope of the Coast
Ranges and in the Siskiyou Mountains [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  Common conifer
associates include redwood, Douglas-fir (Psuedotsuga menziesii),
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), sugar pine (P. lambertina), and
incense-cedar (Libocedrus decurrens) [<a href="#54">54</a>].  Common hardwood associates
include tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflora), canyon live oak (Quercus
chrysolepis), and chiquapin (Chrysolepsis chrysophylla); ceanothus
(Ceanothus spp.), manzanitas (Arctostaphylos spp.), and raspberries
(Rubus spp.)  are common associated shrubs [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  Pacific
madrone is also a characteristic species of oak woodlands in the
interior valleys of northern California and southern Oregon where it
occupies harsh sites with Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana), canyon
live oak, California black oak (Q. kelloggii), and poison-oak
(Toxicodendron diversiloba) [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  On particularly severe sites,
Pacific madrone often grows as a shrub [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Shrubby ecotypes are most
prevalent from northern California southward [<a href="#61">61</a>].

Northern range:  Farther northward, Pacific madrone typically grows as a
small tree [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  It is widespread west of the Cascades in Oregon and
Washington and is associated with relatively hot, dry lowland sites
within coastal Douglas-fir and western hemlock forests [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].
Increased regional rainfall apparently allows Pacific madrone to occupy
drier habitats than in mixed-evergreen forests [<a href="#64">64</a>].  Greatest abundance
is usually attained on sites unfavorable to conifer growth [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].
Sites include ridgetops and south-facing slopes up to 5,000 feet in
elevation (1,524 m) [<a href="#60">60</a>].  Towards the northern edge of its distribution
in southern British Columbia and northwestern Washington, Pacific
madrone is restricted to areas along the immediate coast [<a href="#18">18</a>].  The only
broadleaved evergreen tree native to Canada [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>], Pacific madrone
rarely extends inland more than five miles (8 km) in southern British
Columbia [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Sites consist of rocky bluffs along the seacoast;
elevations do not exceed 1,000 feet (305 m) [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  Common associated
species include Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), Rocky
Mountain juniper (Juniperus scopulorum), Oregon white oak, salal
(Gaultheria shallon), and Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis) [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Soils: Although soil types are highly variable, soils supporting Pacific
madrone usually exhibit a low soil moisture content thoughout most of
the summer.  Pacific madrone grows on glacial tills or shallow rocky
soils in the northern portion of its range.  Soils may also be fine
textured, ranging from loam to clay loam.  Towards the southern end of
its distribution, soils are often derived from granite, quartz diorite,
sandstone, or shale [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Within coastal redwood and mixed-evergreen forests, Pacific madrone is a
long-lived, moderately shade-tolerant, seral species which survives
disturbances such as fire, logging, blow-down, insect devastation, or
mass soil movement [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Not only is madrone capable of vigorous
sprouting following disturbances which kill aboveground stems, but
exposed mineral soil and light canopies associated with early seral
situations are optimal conditions for madrone seedling establishment
[<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  Consequently, Pacific madrone is a strong competitor during
early stages of succession, particularly on drier sites within redwood
and mixed-evergreen forests [<a href="#54">54</a>].  Although frequently abundant within
young stands, coverage gradually declines as the conifer canopy closes
[<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].

Pacific madrone is fire maintained throughout most of its range,
depending on periodic fire to eliminate or greatly reduce the conifer
overstory [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  With continued fire exclusion, madrone is replaced by
more shade-tolerant competitors [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  Pacific madrone is often a
component of broad sclerophyll forests and brushfields in northern
California and southwestern Oregon [<a href="#18">18</a>].  In the Klamath Mountains,
Pacific madrone is a common species in chaparrallike brushfields
dominated by evergreen shrubs [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  Repeated fires have converted
many of these brushfields into semipermanent communities [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Pacific madrone typically flowers from March to June [<a href="#52">52</a>].  Fruits ripen
in the fall and persist until December or January [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  Leaves
remain on the plant for 2 years before they turn red to orange and fall;
abscission typically coincides with the development of a new leaf crop
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].

Generalized trends in the phenological development of Pacfic madrone are
presented below [<a href="#16">16</a>]:

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Pacific madrone depends on periodic fire to eliminate or greatly reduce
the conifer overstory [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  Postburn regenerative modes include both
the production of prolific sprouts and abundant seed [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Following
fires which kill aerial stems, madrone sprouts vigorously via dormant
buds located on an underground regenerative organ known as a burl
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  Burls serve as a source of stored carbohydrates and
aggregations of adventitious buds, enabling madrone to rapidly occupy
the initial postburn environment [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Burl development also
enhances survival after repeated burning [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  On favorable growth
sites within redwood and mixed-evergreen forests, trees attain diameters
and bark thicknesses capable of surviving light groundfires [<a href="#4">4</a>].
Exposed mineral soil seedbeds and light canopy densities associated with
recent burns are conducive to madrone seedling establishment [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Arbutus menziesii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Madrone is a fire-sensitive species; aboveground portions are very
susceptible to fire mortality [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>].  Low-intensity ground fires
usually top-kill madrone seedlings and sapling-sized stems [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Thin
bark provides little insulation from radiant heat, which usually kills
the cambium around the base of the stem [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Larger trees with thicker
bark frequently survive light underburning on favorable growth sites
within redwood and mixed-evergreen forests.  Although young, vigorous
trees usually exhibit bole injuries following burning, fire scars tend
to heal over rapidly.  Older madrones may initially survive light ground
fires; however, bole wounds facilitate the entry of insects and disease
and many fire-damaged trees eventually die [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Vegetative regeneration: Following fires which kill aerial stems,
Pacific madrone initiates a rapid postburn recovery by sprouting from
adventitious buds located on an underground, globelike structure known
as a burl [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  Burls may reach diameters of 8 inches (20 cm) or
more [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Since burls contain aggregations of buds, newly sprouted
madrones occur as "sprout clumps" [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Sprouts are quite tolerant of
direct sunlight and develop well in the initial postburn environment
[<a href="#16">16</a>].  After 10 years of growth on a good site in the northern Sierra
Nevada, Pacific madrone sprout clumps averaged 22 feet (6.7 m) in height
and 10.2 feet (3.1 m) in crown width with an average of 15 sprouts per
clump [<a href="#39">39</a>].

The initial postburn recovery is aggressive.  Pacific madrone sprouts
sometimes grow more than 5 feet (1.5 m) during the first postburn
growing season [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Although prolific spouting usually occurs during
the first 2 years following burning, sprout numbers are drastically
reduced between postburn years 2 and 3 as growth is concentrated into
multiple dominant stems.  Initial trends in postburn recovery of Pacific
madrone in northwestern California are presented below [<a href="#66">66</a>]:

                                              Years postburn
                                         1          2            3 


Average ht of tallest sprout            4.7        7.7         10.1

Average crown diameter of sprout        4.5        6.8          7.6
     clump (feet)
Average sprouts per clump               17         16           13

Seedling regeneration:  Pacific madrone seedling establishemnt is
favored following fire.  Mineral soil seedbeds and light canopy
densities of the initial postburn environment are extremely conducive to
the successful establishment and growth of madrone seedlings [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].
On sites where fires are not too severe, abundant seed is available from
residual trees.  Off-site seed is also dispersed by mammals and birds.
Initial postburn seed production of sprouted madrones has not been
reported.  Minimum seed-bearing age of seedling-derived plants is 3 to 5
years [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Since sprout production is initially fueled by the residual root system,
postburn sprouting potential of madrone is strongly related to the size
and vigor of the parent tree.  Sprout clumps produced by larger diameter
parent trees are generally taller and wider in diameter than those of
smaller diameter parent trees; they also produce greater numbers of
resprouts [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].  Site quality apparently has almost no influence
on sprout clump development for at least 6 years after fire [<a href="#58">58</a>].
Limited observations on sites in southwestern Oregon indicate that
previous fires and the subsequent entry of pathogens can substantially
reduce the sprouting potential of parent trees greater than 17.2 inches
(43 cm) d.b.h. [<a href="#58">58</a>].


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Broadcast burning:  Where conifer regeneration is a primary management
concern, broadcast burning is generally an ineffective site preparation
tool following clearcutting in stands where madrone is widespread in the
understory.  Not only is madrone difficult to control with repeated
burning, but sprouts often grow faster than many associated hardwoods
[<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Even though burning delays the recovery of madrone for
approximately one growing season, removal of logging debris promotes
sprouting by exposing basal buds to solar heating and permits sprouts to
grow unimpeded [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Sites where the preburn vegetation consists of low
conifer stocking combined with high densities of madrone are
particularly prone to the rapid development of a dense madrone
understory.

Underburning:  Pacific madrone seedlings establish readily following
logging and burning of conifer-hardwood stands [<a href="#59">59</a>].  Light underburning
at sometime during the rotation may minimize seedling establishment,
thereby reducing the density of madrones capable of sprouting after
future disturbances.  Control of madrone seed trees should accompany
such prescribed fire treatments (See Management slot under Value and Use
subframe.)

Hardwood management:  Burning should not be used as a method of slash
disposal in partially cut hardwood stands where madrone is managed for
timber production.  Instead, logging debris should be lopped and
scattered, or piled [<a href="#40">40</a>].

Wildlife management:  Burning initially increases the palatability of
Pacific madrone browse; spouts are utilized for up to 2 growing seasons
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].
