<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Bog Labrador tea is dominant or codominant in a variety of habitats
within its range.  It may occur as an understory component in open or
closed forest habitats, primarily with black or white spruce (Picea
mariana, P. glauca).  Bog Labrador tea can also dominate or codominate
in dwarf shrub types, bogs, muskegs, or open tundra [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Associated
overstory and understory species of bog Labrador tea include low sweet
blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium), chokecherry (Prunus virginiana),
serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia), bog birch (Betula glandulosa), bog
blueberry (V. uliginosum), mountain cranberry (V.  vitis-idaea),
leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata), bog laurel (Kalmia polifolia),
feathermoss (Pleurozium schreberi), lichens (Cladonia spp.), and
sphagnum mosses (Sphagnum spp.) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

The following publications lists bog Labrador tea as a dominant or
codominant species:

Old-growth forests of the Canadian Rocky Mountain National Parks [<a href="#1">1</a>]
Alpine and high subalpine plant communities of the North Cascade Range,
  Washington and British Columbia [<a href="#12">12</a>]

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ledum groenlandicum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Bog Labrador tea leaves and twigs are browsed by caribou and moose.  In
Ontario, caribou browse bog Labrador tea as supplemental winter browse
[<a href="#11">11</a>].  In a study in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and the Northwest
Territories, leaves and twigs of bog Labrador tea occrrred in 100
percent of caribou rumen samples [<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Bog Labrador tea is rated low in digestibility for black-tailed deer [<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Bog labrador tea presumably provides cover for a variety of small
wildlife species.  


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Bog labrador tea has potential for revegetating disturbed sites.  It
naturally recolonized local sites after powerline construction in the
subartic bogs of northern and central Manitoba [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Bog labrador tea
has also recolonized mined peatlands in the northeastern United States
and may be of use in managing mined reclamation projects [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The strongly aromatic leaves of bog Labrador tea can be used to make a
palatable tea.  As a folk medicine the tea was used externally for all
kinds of skin problems.  Taken internally, the tea was used to stimulate
the nerves and stomach.  A syrup made from the tea was sometimes used
for coughs and hoarseness [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
On Willow Island, Alaska, white spruce stands were subjected to clearcut
and shelterwood treatments.  Second-year average percent cover and
average percent frequency of bog Labrador tea were as follows [<a href="#13">13</a>]:

                                    shelterwood         shelterwood

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ledum groenlandicum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bog Labrador tea is a low, native, evergreen shrub from 1 to 4 feet
(0.3-1.2 m) high [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].  It is prostrate to erect in form and generally
circular in outline.  The leaves are 1 to 3 inches (2.5-7.5 cm) long.
The flowers are borne on slender stalks in crowded clusters at the ends
of the branches.  The fruit is a many-seeded capsule [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Bog
labrador tea roots in the organic layer and is rhizomatous.  Rhizome
depth can reach 6 to 20 inches (15-50 cm) [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte
   Chamaephyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Bog Labrador tea reproduces primarily vegetatively but can reproduce by
seed [<a href="#24">24</a>].  It regenerates vegetatively through sprouting from rhizomes.
Length and depth of rhizomes are greatly influenced by soil and moisture
characteristics [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bog Labrador tea grows on a broad range of sites from dry to wet, but it
is most common on wetter sites with low subsurface water flow and low
nutrients.  It reaches its greatest cover in bogs [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].



<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Bog Labrador tea is an important component of woodland understories
through the early, midseral, and late stages of succession.  It is
often abundant in the shaded portions of the forest [<a href="#4">4</a>]  It is also
important in the early shrub stages of tundra succession [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Bog Labrador tea flowers from late May to early June.  Fruits ripen from
late August through late fall [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ledum groenlandicum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Bog Labrador tea would likely survive fire because the rhizomes are
found deep in the organic layer.  It will sprout from rhizomes or the
root crown following fire [<a href="#28">28</a>].

The bogs in which this species often occurs are usually too wet to burn
except in years with exceptionally low rainfall.



<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Small shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Rhizomatous shrub, rhizome in soil

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ledum groenlandicum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire generally top-kills bog Labrador tea.  The underground stems are
not usually damaged by fire [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Bog Labrador tea sprouts from rhizomes or the root crown following low-
to moderate-severity fires.  It is one of the first plants to recolonize
burned bogs and grows rapidly following fire [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  Chandler
[<a href="#9">9</a>] reported that bog Labrador tea cover was 45 percent 5 years after
fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
NO-ENTRY
