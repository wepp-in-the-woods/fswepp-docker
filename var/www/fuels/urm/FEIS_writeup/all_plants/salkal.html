<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
Several specific epithets for Russian-thistle are used in current
literature.  Salsola kali L. is most widely used [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>], and
will be used in this write-up.  There are three varieties of S. kali in
North America, with varietal differences based upon degree of pubescence
of stems [<a href="#50">50</a>] and size of leaves and fruits [<a href="#53">53</a>].  Recognized varieties
are as follows [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>]:

     S. k. var. caroliniana (Walter) Nutt.
     S. k. var. tenuifolia G. F. Meyer
     S. k. var. kali

S. kali hybridizes with S. paulsenii (barbwire Russian-thistle) [<a href="#9">9</a>], and
may hybridize with S. collina (no common name in current use) [<a href="#28">28</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salsola kali
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Native to Eurasia, Russian-thistle is distributed throughout most arid
and semiarid regions of the world.  In North America Russian thistle
occurs from British Columbia east to Labrador and south through the
conterminous United States to northern Mexico [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  It is most
common in central and western regions of Canada and the United States,
and along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.  Limited southern and eastern
inland populations occur along waste areas and railroad tracks [<a href="#61">61</a>].
Russian-thistle is adventitious in Hawaii [<a href="#66">66</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Russian-thistle occurs in many communities.  It is most common along
seabeaches and in disturbed grassland and desert communities, with the
largest populations occurring in semiarid regions [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  Pure stands
occur in southern Nevada between elevations of 4,000 and 6,000 feet
(1,219-1829 m) [<a href="#9">9</a>].  A published classification listing Russian-thistle
as dominant is:

Valley grassland [<a href="#32">32</a>]

Russian-thistle associates are too numerous to list due to its
widespread distribution.

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Cattle and sheep eat Russian-thistle, and it is a minor component (less
than 10%) in bison, mule deer, and elk diets [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  It is an
important prairie dog food [<a href="#13">13</a>], and pronghorn show high preference
for the summer growth in years of high precipitation [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Russian-thistle seeds are eaten by at least eight species of granivorous
birds, including scaled and Gambel's quail [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  Small mammals
also consume the seeds [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Russian-thistle is preferred by prairie dogs [<a href="#13">13</a>].  It is palatable to
sheep and cattle from early spring until flowering, at which time sharp
spines form, and again during winter when spines are softened by
moisture [<a href="#53">53</a>].  Foliage is palatable to pronghorn in summer and fall,
and is palatable year-round in wet years.  Pronghorn find it low in
palatability in dry years and in spring [<a href="#8">8</a>].

The palatability of Russian-thistle for livestock and wildlife species
is rated as follows [<a href="#19">19</a>]:

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The nutritional value of Russian-thistle varies by season.  In spring
Russian-thistle provides fair nutrition for livestock and wildlife.  The
nutritional value of fresh, immature Russian-thistle leaves and stems
was as follows [<a href="#44">44</a>]:
  
       Composition (%)            Digestible Protein (%)
     ash            12.0             cattle      8.5
     crude fiber    12.4             goats       8.6
     protein        11.5             horses      8.3
                                     rabbits     8.1

The nutritional value of winter forage, after the plant has dried, is
higher.  It is a good source of vitamin A and phosphorus.  Dry
Russian-thistle from a western Utah rangeland had the following
nutiritional value for sheep [<a href="#15">15</a>]:

     digestible protein (%)         12.4
     digestible energy (cal/lb)    997
     ash (%)                        22.8
     calcium (%)                     2.47
     phosphorus (%)                  0.22
     carotene (mg/lb)                4.1

Russian-thistle contains small amounts of oxalate that are probably not
harmful to livestock [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Weanling mice showed favorable growth responses when fed a diet of
Russian-thistle seed meal.  The nutritional value of Russian thistle
seed meal from Saskatchewan, Canada was as follows [<a href="#16">16</a>]:

     protein (%)     49.9
     ash (%)          7.4
     fiber (%)       10.4
     oxalate (%)      2.2
                                                  


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Russian-thistle provides hiding cover for small mammals, songbirds,
upland game birds, and waterfowl [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Seven percent of sage grouse in
a southeastern Idaho big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) community used
Russian-thistle for nesting cover [<a href="#35">35</a>].

The degree to which Russian-thistle provides environmental protection
to wildlife has been rated as follows [<a href="#19">19</a>]:

                              MT      ND       UT       WY       
     Pronghorn               ----    good     poor     poor     
     Elk                     ----    ----     poor     poor

     Waterfowl               good    ----     poor     poor


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Russian-thistle is beneficial when rehabilitating disturbed sites.  It
is frequently an unwanted weed on such sites, but disturbed sites often
recover more quickly when Russian-thistle is left on-site because its
presence accelerates the rate of revegetation [2,18, 29].  If topsoil
remains on the site, Russian-thistle roots are readily invaded by
mychorrhizal fungi harbored in the soil [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Russian-thistle does not
form mychorrhizal associations, and fungal invasion results in the death
of the infected root.  The fungi consequently invade other
Russian-thistle roots.  Russian-thistle populations decline, but
mycorrizal fungus populations increase and subsequently invade the
mycorrhizal association-forming species which comprise the next stage of
plant succession.  These species usually flourish as a consequence of
increased mychorrhizal fungus populations [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Dead Russian-thistle
plants provide microshading for other establishing plant species [<a href="#29">29</a>].
If topsoil is gone, however, Russian-thistle can dominate disturbed
sites for up to 10 years.  Such sites benefit more from the addition of
topsoil than the removal of Russian-thistle [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Dry Russian-thistle foliage has been used as an inexpensive mulch on
replanted coal mine spoils in Arizona [<a href="#17">17</a>].  


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Agricultural:  Russian-thistle is sometimes harvested for hay and
silage.  Russian-thistle hay is credited with saving the beef cattle
industry in Canada and the United States during the Dust Bowl era, when
conventional hay crops failed and no other feed was available for
starving animals [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].

Russian-thistle is sometimes used for Christmas decoration [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Range:  Lambs entering winter ranges for the first time sometimes
develop mouth ulcerations from eating dry Russian-thistle.  The
ulcerations usually persist for 2 to 3 weeks.  Additionally, rain- or
snow-softened Russian-thistle often has a laxative effect upon
livestock, which may harm already weakened animals [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].

Livestock ranges that have deteriorated from drought or overgrazing are
frequently invaded and dominated by Russian-thistle [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].

Agricultural:  Russian-thistle competes with crop plants for space,
water, and nutrients [<a href="#55">55</a>].  In Washington, Russian-thistle ranked
seventh in importance when compared to other crop weeds based upon
hectares infested [<a href="#60">60</a>].  Russian-thistle is the primary host for the
beet leafhopper (Circulifera tenellus) that vectors the curly-top virus
of sugar beets, tomatoes, and curcubits (Cucurbita spp.) [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].

Russian-thistle shows promise as a hay crop in semiarid regions.  When
irrigated and fertilized, Russian-thistle grown on a New Mexican site
produced 73 percent as much total dry weight matter per annum per
hectacre as alfalfa, and contained 65 percent as much protein, while
requiring only half as much water [<a href="#30">30</a>].

Other:  Russian-thistle is often considered a troublesome weed because
it obstructs roadways and stream channels, buries fence lines, and
causes fire hazards [<a href="#55">55</a>].

Control:  Burrill and others [<a href="#14">14</a>] reported that either 2,4-D or
bromoxynil used in combination with dicamba was 80 to 94 percent
effective in controlling Russian-thistle, and metribuzin used in
combination with chlorsulfuron gave 95 to 100 percent control.  Young
and Whitesides [<a href="#60">60</a>] reported only 12 percent control of Russian-thistle
with 2,4-D.

Insects from the genera Celeophora, Microlarinus, and Trichosirocalus
are being tested as biological contol agents of Russian-thistle.  Insect
populations of these genera have established in California, but
preliminary results suggest that of the three genera, only
Trichosirocalus is able to establish in cold climates.  Trichosirocalus
horridis has been successfully introduced in Canada for Russian-thistle
control [<a href="#40">40</a>].  To date, there are no data regarding the effectiveness of
these insects as contol agents.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salsola kali
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Russian-thistle is an exotic, annual, erect, xerohalophytic forb
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>]. It is highly branched and rounded in form, growing from 1 to
3 feet (0.3-1 m) in height and from 1 to 5 feet (0.3-1.5 m) in diameter.
The awl-shaped, spiny-tipped leaves bear small, inconspicuous flowers in
the leaf axils.  The small, winged seed, retained in the leaf axils
until after plant death, contains no endosperm tissue, but is instead
comprised of a spirally-coiled, complete embryo [<a href="#34">34</a>] already containing
some chlorophyll [<a href="#56">56</a>].  The root system consists of a taproot, reaching
0.3 foot (1 m) or more in depth, and extensive lateral roots.  Under
crowded conditions, roots are shallow [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Therophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Russian-thistle is a highly effective reproducer.  After seeds mature in
late fall the plant stem separates from the root [<a href="#61">61</a>].  The plant is
then blown by wind.  Seeds, held in the leaf axils, fall to the ground
as the plant tumbles [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Further dispersal is accomplished when wind
scatters the winged seeds.  The seed wings may aid in seed germination
by absorbing soil moisture.  One plant typically produces about 250,000
seeds, which remain viable for less than a year [<a href="#61">61</a>].  Fresh seed will
germinate at a very limited range of alternating day/night seedbed
temperatures:  68/41 degrees Fahrenheit (20/5 deg C) [<a href="#62">62</a>].  Over winter,
temperature restrictions disappear.  In spring, Russian thistle seeds
will germinate at virtually any conceivable seedbed temperature,
including alternating day/night temperatures of 122/29 degrees
Fahrenheit (50/-2 deg C) [<a href="#63">63</a>].  In tests conducted in a big sagebrush
community in Nevada, Evans and Young [<a href="#23">23</a>] noted the following
germination percentages at various nighttime minimum temperatures:

     Temperature (deg C)    Germination (%)    
           -3                     0               
            0                    26              
            3                    43               
            5                    56             
            7                    88            
            9                    78
           10                    88
           15                    78
           20                    66
           25                    29

At optimum temperatures (44 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit [7-10 deg C]),
germination is accomplished within minutes [<a href="#55">55</a>].  This extremely short
germination time aids in establishment in desert environments.
Germination is epigeal or hypogeal [<a href="#63">63</a>].  The spirally-coiled embryo
unwinds and pushes the root into the soil.  Embryos do not survive if
they germinate on compacted soil, or at a soil depth of greater then 5
inches (13 cm) [<a href="#55">55</a>].  Russian-thistle seedlings are poor competitors,
and do not establish well in crowded communities [<a href="#61">61</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Russian-thistle grows in disturbed or unoccupied sites at elevations
from below sea level (in Death Valley, California) to 8,550 feet (2,600
m) [<a href="#61">61</a>].  It grows in any type of well-drained, uncompacted soil with a
sunny exposure [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  It is most frequent, however, in alkaline or
saline soils due to reduced competition.  Russian-thistle cannot
tolerate saturated soil for extended periods of time [<a href="#61">61</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Intitial Community Species

Russian-thistle is a shade-intolerant initial colonizer in primary and
secondary succession.  It colonizes barren desert areas that cannot
support other flora [<a href="#61">61</a>], and invades many different disturbed plant
communities [<a href="#9">9</a>].  In disturbed big sagebrush communities,
Russian-thistle dominates for the first 2 years.  After this time plants
become overcrowded and stunted [<a href="#49">49</a>] and are often replaced by mustards
(Descurainia and Sisymbrium spp.)  [<a href="#46">46</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
The following seasonal development has been reported for
Russian-thistle:

     germinates:  late April - August [<a href="#62">62</a>]
     flowers:  June - August [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>]
     seeds mature:  August - November [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>]
     plant dies:  first fall frost [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>]
     seeds disseminate:  late fall [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>]

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salsola kali
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fire ecology:  Russian-thistle aids in spreading fire.  It burns easily
because the stems are spaced in an arrangement that allows for maximum
air circulation [<a href="#61">61</a>].  Also, dead plants contribute to fuel load by
retaining their original shape for some time before decomposing [<a href="#23">23</a>].
The rolling action of the plant spreads prairie wildfire quickly.

Fire adaptations:  Russian-thistle colonizes a burn when off-site,
abscised plants blow across it, spreading seed [<a href="#61">61</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
The immediate effects of fire upon Russian-thistle were not found in the

Russian-thistle colonizes a burn site within 1 to 3 years.  It dominated

percent of the total community biomass [<a href="#26">26</a>].  On the Mesa Verde Plateau
of Colorado, it codominated a burned area with Bigelow aster
(Machaeranthera bigelovii) at postfire year 3 [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Once dominant,
Russian-thistle retains dominance for an average of 1 more year.  At
postfire year 3 or 4, populations decline until further disturbance
[<a href="#61">61</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
The tendency of dead plants to aggregate against fencelines and
buildings creates a fire hazard.  Tumbling, ignited plants can spread
fire, and may bounce across fire lines [<a href="#61">61</a>]. 

Prescribed burning will not control Russian-thistle, since it colonizes
from off-site and thrives in disturbed communities.
