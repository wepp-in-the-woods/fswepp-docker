ARTDRA

<b>SYNONYMS : </b>
   Artemisia glauca Pallas

<b>COMMON NAMES : </b>

<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The fully documented scientific name of tarragon is Artemisia
dracunculus L.  This species exhibits considerable morophological
variation.  Although recent taxonomic treatments have not been
completed, three to five subspecific entities have been previously
described [<a href="#23">23</a>].  The taxonomy presented here follows that of Cronquist
[<a href="#2">2</a>] who does not recognize any subspecies or forms in the Pacific
Northwest.  Plants indigenous to North America are indistinguishable
from the Eurasian form, Artemisia glauca.  Two weakly defined subspecies
have been described for Colorado [<a href="#10">10</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Artemisia dracunculus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Although primarily a species of the Missouri River drainage, tarragon is
considered one of the most common of the herbaceous sagebrush in the
western United States [<a href="#3">3</a>].  This species is widely distributed from the
Yukon, British Columbia, and Washington, south to Baja California, and
eastward to Illinois, Texas, and northern Mexico.  In the Pacific
Northwest, its range is typically east of the Cascade Range [<a href="#2">2</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Tarragon is a minor seral species within a variety of nonforested and
forested communities throughout the western United States.  Mueggler and
Stewart [<a href="#15">15</a>] report its presence in a number of grassland and shrubland
habitat types in Montana including those within the rough fescue
(Festuca scabrella), bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata), big
sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata), and
skunkbush sumac (Rhus trilobata) series.  In forested habitat types it
occurs as an understory species within the limber pine (Pinus flexilis),
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
menziesii) series [<a href="#16">16</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Tarragon has limited value as a forage species.  It may be of seasonal
importance to domestic sheep, mule deer, and other game animals [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].
Plants generally increase in response to grazing pressure on native
grasssland sites in Montana [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Following frost, this species becomes a preferred domestic sheep forage
in portions of Idaho and Utah; apparently the fruiting heads are highly
palatable [<a href="#21">21</a>].  The palatability and degree of use shown by livestock
and wildlife species for false tarragon in several western states is
rated as follows [<a href="#4">4</a>]:

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Artemisia dracunculus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Tarragon is a native, variously fragrant to inodorous, usually
glabrescent, shortly rhizomatous, warm-season, perennial forb, typically
ranging in height from 19.5 to 58.5 inches (50-150 cm) [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Stems
are often reddish and originate in clusters or sometimes singly from a
distinct, nearly woody rhizome [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Leaves are usually at least
partially deciduous by fall.  The infloresence is an open panicle.
Outer flowers are pistillate and fertile; disk flowers are sterile with
an abortive ovary.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Tarragon regenerates both sexually and vegetatively.  Numerous,
wind-dispersed fruits (<a href="../../../glossary.html#CYPSELA:">cypsela</a>) are produced in the fall.  Perennating buds are
located on a stout, somewhat woody rhizome.  The degree to which new
plants are established through rhizome intiation is unclear.  This
species does not appear to spread rapidly through creeping rhizomes.
Rhizome initiation in a morophologically similar herbaceous sagebrush,
Louisiana sagewort (Artemisia ludoviciana), is extensive; however, this
characteristic is highly variable among ecotypes [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Tarragon is a somewhat weedy species which is not exacting in its site
requirements.  Typical habitats include dry, open sites from the low
plains to moderate elevations in the mountains [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Plants invade
disturbed sites throughout a variety of nonforested and forested
communities and are often found growing along roadways and similar
anthropogenic sites.  Dix [<a href="#5">5</a>] reports tarragon growing on disturbed
sandy soils in western North Dakota.  Generally plants occur in
scattered amounts and rarely dominate extensive areas.

Elevational ranges for several western states is follows [<a href="#4">4</a>]:

	     5,000 to 10,300 feet (1,524-3,140 m) in CO
	     3,000 to 6,900 feet (915-2,104 m) in MT
	     4,900 to 11,000 feet (1,494-3,354 m) in UT
	     3,700 to 8,400 feet (1,128-2,561 m) in WY


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Tarragon is a pioneer species.  It invades disturbed sites in a wide
variety of nonforested and forested communities.  Although densities are
typically low on most sites, frequencies appear to increase where
disturbance results in decreased species competition [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Tarragon flowers from July through October throughout its range [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Artemisia dracunculus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Although plants are readily top-killed by all fire intensities, this
species appears somewhat resistant to fire mortality [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Plants are
probably able to reestablish rapidly via surviving rhizomes and the
germination of numerous, wind-dispersed seed.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil
   Initial-offsite colonizer (offsite, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Artemisia dracunculus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Tarragon is easily top-killed by low-intensity fires.  The presence of
underground rhizomes suggests that the majority of individuals are
somewhat resistant to fire mortality.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Limited fire response data for tarragon indicates that preburn densites
are regained immediately following burning.  Dix [<a href="#5">5</a>] conducted burns on
sandy upland sites in the mixed-grass prairie of North Dakota.  He
reported that tarragon frequencies on burned sites equaled those on
unburned sites in less than 3 months after a spring burn [<a href="#5">5</a>].  On
similar sites tarragon increased substantially within 4 years of a late
August burn.  Dix suggested that tarragon was able to increase
dramatically due to the loss in vigor of associated species.  It is
unclear whether increases in tarragon frequencies resulted via the
germination of off-site seed, from seedlings established via on-site
residual plants, or from rhizome sprouting.
