<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Plains lovegrass produces quality forage on the grazing lands of Arizona
and New Mexico [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  It is an important cattle forage species in
oak woodland of southern Arizona [<a href="#33">33</a>].  However, because it has a high
seedstalk to leaf ratio it is a relatively low forage producer [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Cattle in south-central Arizona ate plains lovegrass at 45 percent of
availability.  Plains lovegrass was intermediate in preference and
production compared to other grasses growing on the range [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Upland game birds eat plains lovegrass seeds [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Plains lovegrass is palatable [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Even on steeper slopes it is often
the first species to be grazed [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Plains lovegrass was collected in Sutton County, Texas, in 1973.
Nutrient composition (percent) of leaves and stems was as follows [<a href="#27">27</a>]:

<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Plains lovegrass has decreased in abundance in Arizona.  This reduction
is probably the result of long-continued grazing.  Because of its
palatability and early greening habit, plains lovegrass is often
overgrazed in early spring [<a href="#26">26</a>].  To renew its vigor [<a href="#31">31</a>] and also allow
for seed production and establishment of seedlings [<a href="#32">32</a>], plains lovegrass
should be rested from grazing during July and August about every third
year [<a href="#31">31</a>]. 

In southeastern Arizona, plains lovegrass was measured in 1983 on
grassland ungrazed since 1968 and on adjacent grazed grassland.  Plains
lovegrass was increasing on the ungrazed area, but not on adjacent
grazed sites. In an area ungrazed since the early 1950's, plains
lovegrass occurred in dense, nearly pure stands [<a href="#8">8</a>].  In the same area
in 1990, plains lovegrass made up 15 percent of canopy cover on ungrazed
quadrats, but only 5 percent on grazed quadrats [<a href="#5">5</a>].  The grass canopy
was significantly taller (p<.01) where it was protected from grazing.
Plains lovegrass is not found in pure stands in areas where it is grazed
[<a href="#31">31</a>].

Plains lovegrass production in southern Arizona semidesert grasslands is
related to current summer rainfall and also to rainfall during previous
growing periods [<a href="#32">32</a>].  (See SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT)

Plains lovegrass in southwestern semidesert grass-shrub ranges is
favored by light to moderate grazing.  When overgrazed, the plants lose
vigor, die, and are replaced by less palatable species [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Plains
lovegrass is a component of Southern Plains grasslands which, when
overgrazed, are invaded by large-shrub monocultures and/or by short
semishrubs [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Plains lovegrass in south-central Arizona grasslands
has been greatly reduced where mesquite (Prosopis spp.) has invaded the
range [<a href="#37">37</a>].

In the Southwest, plains lovegrass and other native species do not
reestablish in areas planted with the African species Lehmann and
weeping lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana and E. curvula).  In
southeastern Arizona, areas of the Appleton-Whittell Research Sanctuary
were seeded with mixtures of Lehmann and weeping lovegrass in the 1940's
and 1950's.  By 1984, African lovegrasses covered more than 50 percent
of the ground; native grass cover was reduced by nearly 60 percent.
Plains lovegrass was one of the indigenous grasses significantly
reduced.  Nearby unseeded areas supported mixtures of native herbs,
shrubs, and perennial grasses including plains lovegrass.  Since cattle
were removed in 1968, species-rich plant assemblages have developed on
the Sanctuary in all areas except those planted with African lovegrasses
[<a href="#6">6</a>].

Plains lovegrass seed is available commercially [<a href="#17">17</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Eragrostis intermedia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Plains lovegrass is a native, warm-season, C-4, perennial bunchgrass
[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Culms are wiry [<a href="#19">19</a>], erect, pith filled to hollow [<a href="#24">24</a>],
and 12 to 35 inches (30-90 cm) tall [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Leaf blades are 4 to 10
inches [10-25 cm] long [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>]. The inflorescence is an erect, open,
diffuse, pyramidal panicle [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>] 6 to 14 inches (15-35 cm) long.
Spikelets are three- to nine-flowered [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>]; the fruit is a
caryopsis [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Plains lovegrass sprouts from perennating buds at the bases of culms
[<a href="#24">24</a>].  It also reproduces by seed [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Dispersal occurs when the
large, loose, fruiting stalks detach and tumble across the ground,
releasing seed [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Plains lovegrass seeds were collected from plants growing at two
semidesert grassland sites in south-central Arizona, one not irrigated
and one irrigated.  Rate of germination was tested 7 months after
harvest.  The seeds from irrigated land were germinable (18%) in the
laboratory at moderate temperature alternations representative of wet
seedbeds in April (50/86 degrees Fahrenheit [10/30 deg C]).  However,
maximum germination (47%) occurred at temperature alternations of 68/104
degrees Fahrenheit (20/40 deg C), which is similar to wet seedbed
temperature extremes during the summer rainy period when plains
lovegrass usually emerges.  Plains lovegrass seeds from unirrigated
plants had much lower germination rates than those from irrigated
plants.  Germination response varied with seed collection year [<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Plains lovegrass is found on dry or sandy prairies [<a href="#25">25</a>], dry slopes
[<a href="#19">19</a>], rocky hillsides, in canyons [<a href="#29">29</a>], open woods [<a href="#24">24</a>], and on
disturbed sites [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Its occurrence is related to topography, but
varies from one area to another.  Plains lovegrass in south-central
Arizona showed a strong positive correlation with slope.  Over 60
percent of occurrences were on slopes steeper than 30 percent [<a href="#14">14</a>].  In
southeastern Arizona, plains lovegrass on undisturbed grassland occurred
on level to gently rolling uplands [<a href="#8">8</a>].  In northwestern Arizona, plains
lovegrass was found on rocky ledges and among boulders in interior
chaparral [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Plains lovegrass grows on most soil textures [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  In
south-central Arizona it is most productive on sands and sandy loams
with weak profile development.  It shows intermediate productivity on
soil with well developed horizons and clayey subsoils.  It is least
productive on shallow, stony, and cobbly soil [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Plains lovegrass often grows in areas where annual precipitation is
bimodal, with a wet season in winter and another in summer.  Over half
the annual rainfall usually occurs in summer, when the bulk of plains
lovegrass forage is produced [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  Spring and fall are generally
characterized by drought [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Mean annual precipitation usually
exceeds 15.7 inches (400 mm).  Winters are mild [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].

In Arizona, plains lovegrass is found at elevations from 3,500 to 6,000
feet (1,067-1,829 m) [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  In New Mexico, it grows at
elevations from 3,800 to 8,500 feet (1,158-2,591 m) [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Plains lovegrass is apparently not tolerant of dense cover.  In Arizona,
plains lovegrass is not abundant in interior chaparral with dense crown
cover (>70%) except in the scattered interscrub openings, on rocky
outcrops, or in early postfire succession [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Plains lovegrass did
occur in chaparral with shrub cover of 60.5 percent and average herb
cover of 12.4 percent.  The sparse herb layer was composed of plains
lovegrass and red brome (Bromus rubens) [<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Plains lovegrass growth starts in early spring; it is one of the first
herbs to green up [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Plains lovegrass blooms in spring in central Florida [<a href="#49">49</a>] and from June
to September in Arizona [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Seed dispersal in Arizona begins in late
summer [<a href="#8">8</a>].

A minimum of 2 years is required for plains lovegrass to tiller.  Culms
produced during the current summer originated as basal buds that broke
dormancy either during the preceding spring, or more commmonly, the
preceding fall.  A wet fall, or a wet winter and spring, activates basal
buds and enlarges individual plants.  Two good rainfall summers in
succession, or a good rainfall summer preceded by an exceptionally wet
spring, can be expected to produce high forage yields.  Production will
be low in drought years because few culms are produced [<a href="#32">32</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Plains lovegrass culms and leaves are killed by fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>



<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Plains lovegrass frequency decreases the first year after fire [<a href="#28">28</a>], but
generally increases thereafter [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].  Seedstalk production sometimes
increases after fire [<a href="#48">48</a>].

Plains lovegrass on native grassland in southeastern Arizona was burned
in a July 16 to 17, 1987, wildfire.  When measured in August 1987, it
was reduced to one-third of its prefire cover.  However, by August 1988,
plains lovegrass cover had increased over prefire levels.  By August
1990, it had increased to twice its prefire cover [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Plains lovegrass was less on burned than unburned sites during the first
growing season after prescribed fire in Kerr County, Texas.  Live oak
(Quercus fusiformis) and post oak (Q. stellata) savanna containing
plains lovegrass was burned between 12:30 and 1:15 p.m. on February 1,
1982.  Air temperature was 55 degrees Fahrenheit (12.8 deg C), relative
humidity was 42 to 48 percent, and wind speed was 10 to 32 miles per
hour (16-51 km/hr).  Highest recorded fire temperatures were at the
litter surface.  Maximum temperature was 412 degrees Fahrenheit (211 deg
C) at the litter surface in the grasslands surrounding trees.
Temperatures above and below the litter surface were substantially
lower.  In July and early August 1982, samples from quadrats in control
and burned units were collected.  Plains lovegrass biomass was less on
burned than on control sites.  Dominance (lbs/ac), relative dominance
(%), relative frequency, and importance are reported [<a href="#28">28</a>]:

Plains lovegrass decreased the first growing season following a fire in
south-central Arizona desert grassland, but then increased.  In June
1963 a wildfire burned a 17-square-mile area in Pima County near Sasabe,
Arizona.  After the fire, study sites were located on burned and
unburned slopes at elevations from 4,000 to 4,400 feet (1,219-1,341 m).
Indicators of plains lovegrass basal area (basal area index) before and
for two growing seasons following the fire showed that plains lovegrass
was at first reduced as a result of the fire.  However, by the second
growing season, it equalled or exceeded prefire density [<a href="#48">48</a>]:

The numbers of plains lovegrass plants measured along transects
decreased on burned areas in postfire year 1.  In postfire year 2,
plains lovegrass numbers increased slightly on control sites, but the
increases on burned sites were significantly greater than on control
sites [<a href="#48">48</a>]:

Plains lovegrass on the north slope burned area had significantly more
seedstalks and fewer plants without seedstalks during the second growing
season than did the control area.  Plains lovegrass apparently was well
adapted to utilize the above normal winter precipitation of 1963.
Greater seedling survival and larger plants occurred on the north and
west study areas, which received more favorable precipitation, than on
the east study area [<a href="#48">48</a>].

Plains lovegrass was more plentiful in recent than old burns in
southwestern Oklahoma prairie and buffalo wallows.  Plains lovegrass was
common on plots close to and in buffalo wallows.  The wallows and
surrounding land were first prescribed burned in early April 1979; some
were burned again in late February 1982.  Sampling occurred between late
June and early July 1982.  At the time of sampling all wallows had 2 to
4 inches (5-10 cm) of standing water.  Exterior quadrats were placed
just adjacent to wallows for comparison of compositional differences
between wallow and other prairie vegetation.  Plains lovegrass was found
only outside the eight buffalo wallows burned in 1972, with average
cover of 43.6 percent.  It occurred throughout the six recently burned
wallows (average cover 18.6% on burned land outside the wallows, 17.3%
at the edge of the burned wallows, and 4.0% in the interior of the
burned wallows) [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In interior chaparral in Arizona, presettlement fire intervals were
usually 50 to 100 years.  Postfire succession is rapid and species
composition is changed little by natural fires [<a href="#38">38</a>].

Burning can be used in desert grassland ranges to reduce the number of
shrubs competing with plains lovegrass and other perennial grasses [<a href="#48">48</a>].
Grazing should be deferred before burning to insure enough fuel to carry
fire [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].
 
Plains lovegrass was subjected to prescribed fire in ungrazed
southeastern Arizona grassland.  The fire had no persistent negative
impact on plains lovegrass density [<a href="#10">10</a>].

bicuspidatum), dwarf morningglories (Evolvulus spp.), spreading
snakeherb, tanseyleaf aster (Machaeranthera tanacetifolia), catclaw
mimosa, velvet-pod mimosa, and yerba de pasmo.

Prefire vegetation data was collected during August 1983.


<b>TARGET SPECIES PHENOLOGICAL STATE : </b>
Unknown


<b>SITE DESCRIPTION : </b>
The study sites have 17 inches (430 mm) average annual precipitation,
with half to two-thirds occurring between July and September.  Elevation
is 4,922 feet (1,500 m).  At the time of the study no fires or grazing
had occurred at the sites since 1969.


<b>FIRE DESCRIPTION : </b>
There were five burned plots and five control plots each at the
grassland and woodland sites.  All fires were conducted under hot, dry,
relatively calm conditions prior to the onset of summer rains.

Plots in oak woodland were burned between 10:00 a.m. and noon on May 25,
1984.  Air temperatures ranged from 90 to 92 degrees Fahrenheit (32-33
deg C).  Relative humidity varied from 16 to 18 percent.  Winds were
variable, gusting from 5 to 10 miles per hour (8-16 km/hr).  Fine dead
fuel moisture was estimated at between 5 and 6 percent.  In four of the
five burned plots, fires moved slowly (1.6 to 4.9 feet per minute
[0.5-1.5 m/min]) with flame lengths of 0.7 to 1.6 feet (0.2-0.5 m) and
fireline intensities of 8-58 kW/m.  In the fifth plot the fire moved
very rapidly (about 98 feet per minute [30 m/min]) with fireline
intensity of 260 kW/m.

Semidesert grassland plots were burned between 10:00 and 11:30 a.m. on
June 12, 1984.  Air temperatures ranged from 84 to 88 degrees Fahrenheit
(29-31 deg C).  Relative humidity varied from 13 to 16 percent.  Winds
were variable, gusting from 5 to 22 miles per hour (8-35 km/hr).  Fires
moved slowly on all burned plots (3.3-13.1 feet per minute [1-4 m/min])
with flame lengths ranging from 2.6 to 4.6 feet (0.8-1.4 m).  These
fires produced fireline intensities of 160 to 540 kW/m.


<b>FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES : </b>
Prefire vegetation data were collected on all plots during summer 1983.
Postfire data were collected on the burned plots and their controls
during the summers of 1984 and 1985.  All vegetation sampling was
carried out in August, the time of maximum growth during the summer wet
period.  Density and plant height were recorded within each quadrat each
year, as were bare ground cover and overall aboveground plant biomass.

In oak woodland plots, plains lovegrass densities on burned and control
plots were similar prior to the fires.  Plains lovegrass declined
significantly (p<0.5) in density on burned plots in the first postfire
growing season of 1984, but this difference had disappeared by the
growing season of 1985.

In semidesert grassland plots, plains lovegrass densities on burned and
control plots were similar prior to the fires.  Plains lovegrass
declined significantly (p<.01) in density on burned plots in 1984, the
first postfire growing season, but this difference had disappeared by
the second postfire year.


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS : </b>
Plains lovegrass usually declines the first growing season after fire,
but by the second growing season it has regained or exceeded its
original cover.
