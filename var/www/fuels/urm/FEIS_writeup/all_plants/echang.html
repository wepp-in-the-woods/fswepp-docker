<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name for purple coneflower is
Echinacea angustifolia DC.  There are two recognized varieties [<a href="#13">13</a>]:
 
        E. angustifolia var. angustifolia
        E. angustifolia var. strigosa R.L. McGreg.

All taxa of the genus Echinacea hybridize, and hybrids within this genus are
therefore common [<a href="#18">18</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Purple coneflower provides fair to good quality forage for livestock and
wildlife before plants reach maturity [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Cattle avoid purple
coneflower once it reaches maturity [<a href="#20">20</a>], and white-tailed deer do not
browse it at any stage of growth [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Purple coneflower is an important
food source for pronghorn [<a href="#4">4</a>].



<b>PALATABILITY : </b>

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Purple coneflower direct seeded on coal spoil materials did well the
first year following planting.  It showed excellent establishment
characteristics, although it did not make outstanding height growth or
provide exceptionally good cover [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Plants may be propagated using
tissue culture [<a href="#15">15</a>] or by root cuttings or divisions of the crown [<a href="#6">6</a>].
Dickerson discusses field establishment, harvesting, and seed-cleaning
methods for large-scale production of purple coneflower seed [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Medicinal:  Roots were used by Native Americans in several forms to
treat snake and insect bites, toothache, swollen glands, sore throat,
rabies, fits, and stomach cramps.  Anglo-Americans began using it as an
aromatic and carminative by 1852.  In 1887 an extract of the plant was
marketed and used for several decades.  Recent research has shown the
plant to have active medicinal constituents.  The root possesses a mild
antibiotic activity against streptococcus and staphylococcus aureus.  It
also possesses antiinflammatory activity and has therapeutic use in
urology, gynecology, internal medicine, and dermatology [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Horticultural:  Purple coneflower survives harsh growing conditions,
outlasts most other cut flowers, and is nearly indestructible in dried
arrangements [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Purple coneflower decreases in response to moderate grazing and is
eliminated by heavy grazing [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Its prescence is an indicator of
good range condition [<a href="#22">22</a>].  The 1930's drought practically eliminated
purple coneflower, but it returned slowly once drought conditions ended
[<a href="#20">20</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Echinacea angustifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Purple coneflower is a perennial forb which grows from a woody base
[<a href="#20">20</a>].  Flowerheads are singular, with purple to pinkish flowers formed
around a spiny center [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  Plants grow 2 to 3.5 feet (0.6-1.1 m)
tall and may spread 5 to 10 inches (12-24 cm) in the first year from
short vertical rhizomes [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  The strong taproot extends 4.7 to 6.5
feet (1.5-2 m) into the soil [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Although perennial, coneflowers behave more like annuals, sending up
only a few shoots from the crown and putting most of their energy into a
prolonged period of flower and seed production [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Sexual:  Plants do not produce seed the first year [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Seedlings have
low vigor and require careful tending for good establishment [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].
Filled seeds have excellent viability, but germination is impeded by a
corky seed covering.  Removal of the covering increased germination from
13 to 92 percent [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Vegetative:  Rhizomes allow plants to increase vegetatively [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Purple coneflower is common on dry open prairie and plains [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>].  It is
common on sandy soils and rocky areas [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  In Kansas it was found
on thin shaley silt loam soil but not on nearby silt loam and deep silt
loam soils [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Plants require a large amount of sunshine and grow
best in open areas [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Common associates include little bluestem
(Schizachyrium scoparium) and big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii var.
gerardii).


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Purple coneflower flowers from May to August, depending on location [<a href="#6">6</a>].
Flowering occurs from May to July in Kansas [<a href="#15">15</a>], June to July in
Colorado, July in Montana, and June to August in North Dakota [<a href="#8">8</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Purple coneflower is top-killed by fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Purple coneflower was unaffected by a March prescribed burn.  Frequency
was high in May, June, and August immediately following the burn [<a href="#19">19</a>].
Late spring burning in the tallgrass prairie, however, generally reduces
the number of forbs [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Purple coneflower was a predominant species in a South Dakota study
where forb production increased dramatically following fall burning
(October 16), with no difference in production in spring-burned (May 9)
and unburned meadows [<a href="#10">10</a>].  However, spring-burned slopes had an
increase in forb density [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].
