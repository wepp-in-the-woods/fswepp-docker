<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Starry Solomon's seal is an indicator species in a wide variety of
habitats.  It generally occurs on moist sites supporting overstories
consisting of cottonwoods and aspens (Populus spp.), oaks (Quercus
spp.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), lodgepole pine (Pinus
contorta), and spruce (Picea spp.).  Understory associates range from
grass species such as bluegrasses (Poa spp.) and wheatgrasses (Agropyron
spp.) to moist site forbs such as bedstraws (Galium spp.), western
meadowrue (Thalictrum occidentale), and false Solomon's seal (Smilacina
racemosa).  Shrub associates generally include willows (Salix spp.),
serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia), and Douglas hawthorn (Crataegus
douglasii) [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Starry Solomon's seal fruits and leaves are eaten by grizzly bears
foraging in avalanche chutes and stream bottoms in northern Montana and
southern British Columbia [<a href="#17">17</a>].  In northern Idaho, elk consume the
leaves of starry Solomon's seal in summer, and ruffed grouse eat the
berries in the fall [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability of starry Solomon's seal is rated fair to poor.  Piper [<a href="#22">22</a>]
found no frugivory of green fruits of starry Solomon's seal, suggesting
toxicity or unpalatability of unripe pericarps protecting the immature
seeds.  In livestock palatability ratings for the Intermountain West
starry Solomon's seal was listed as "poor" for cattle and horses, and
"fair" for sheep [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Research Natural Area, southeast Washington, are as follows* [<a href="#21">21</a>]:

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Starry Solomon's seal is considered to have low to medium revegetation
value [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The Nuxalk Indians of British Columbia collected the ripe berries from
starry Solomon's seal from July to August for food [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Management of starry Solomon's seal is indirect.  This forb generally
occurs individually or in small clusters distributed over a short
distance.  Overstory management techniques that can damage the ground
surface should be limited to seasons of least potential impact; e.g.
winter timber harvesting.  Harvesting should be restricted to
rubber-tire vehicles and aerial skidding techniques.  Overgrazing of
this species by livestock or wildlife does not seem to be a problem due
to its rhizomatous nature [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>]

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Maianthemum stellatum

<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Starry Solomon's seal is a rhizomatous perennial forb approximately 8 to
24 inches (20-60 cm) tall.  The stem is erect and the leaves are
alternate.  It has 5 to 10 white flowers in a terminal raceme.  The
fruits are glabose.  The roots of starry Solomon's seal are dimorphic.
A large root that grows straight downward occurs at the junction between
some segments; numerous small roots emanate in all directions from the
rhizome [<a href="#1">1</a>].

<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Starry Solomon's seal regenerates primarily through rhizomes.  Its
rhizomes grow rapidly and develop into long, complex systems.  Rhizome
plasticity after burial is moderate.  Following burial by volcanic
tephra from Mount St. Helens, Starry Solomon's seal was observed to
sprout from rhizomes upward through the ash [<a href="#2">2</a>].  The roots of starry
Solomon's seal steadily die-off so that the oldest rhizome segments have
few roots remaining [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Contents of starry Solomon's seal rhizome per meter length from the
Cascade Mountain Range, Oregon and Washington, are as follows [<a href="#33">33</a>]:

stellata

The rhizomes can produce aerial stems.  These are determinate, annual
shoots which normally bear seven to nine leaves and occasionally produce
flowers at the tip.  Aerial shoots are produced on both long and short
rhizome segments in most years [<a href="#1">1</a>].  In northern Idaho, aboveground
production was greater on grazed plots [1.44 pounds/acre (3.20 kg/ha)]
than on ungrazed plots [0.58 lbs/acre (1.30 kg/ha)] [<a href="#32">32</a>].

Seed:  No information concerning seed viability was found.  The probable
mode of dissemination is through fruit consumption by wildlife.
Pollination patterns indicate that larger starry Solomon's seal
inflorescences attract more insect visits than do small inflorescences.
This differential favoritism is considered to be a determining factor of
plant distribution when such uneven visitation activity persists from
year to year [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Morphological characteristics of starry Solomon's seal fruit from the
Rainbow Creek Research Natural Area, southeastern Washington, are as
follows [<a href="#21">21</a>]:

<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Starry Solomon's seal is generally an indicator of moist environments;
however, it also occurs on rocky, well-drained sidehills and coastal
plains [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  Tester [<a href="#27">27</a>] listed starry Solomon's seal as a true
prairie species.  Starry Solomon's seal is common in thickets and open
forests on gently sloping benches adjacent to streams.  It has also been
found as high as the lower subalpine zone on slopes ranging from 15 to
25 percent [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Elevational range of starry Solomon's seal is
generally from 4,400 to 8,700 feet (1341-2650 m).

Soil:  Starry Solomon's seal is usually found on shallow soils derived
from calcareous and noncalcareous parent materials.  Soil texture ranges
from gravelly loams to silt and sandy loams.  Soil acidity is often
neutral to acidic (average pH 5.9) [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].
  


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Faculatative Seral Species

Starry Solomon's seal is generally a seral herb species.  On dune sites
near Lake Michigan, it has remained dominant for more than a 1,000
years.  It is eventually replaced by false Solomon's seal on the oldest
dunes [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Starry Solomon's seal showed a variety of successional
responses to silvicultural treatments of western redcedar/western
hemlock (Thuja plicata/Tsuga heterophylla) stands in northern Idaho.  It
showed the highest coverage values within stands treated by shelterwood
methods compared to those receiving partial thinning, clearcut, or
selection harvest methods.  All stands had been treated by regenerative
or stand improvement methods between 5 and 25 years prior to sampling
[<a href="#11">11</a>].  Starry Solomon's seal showed a higher percent cover in climax
stands of Douglas-fir/ninebark (Physocarpus malvaceus) habitat types in
northern Idaho, than on burned, logged, or grazed sites of the same type
[<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Shoots of starry Solomon's seal generally appear in late April, and
flowering occurs from late May through early June [<a href="#23">23</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Starry Solomon's seal is considered a survivor species following fire.
Its fire adaptation strategy is via sprouting from surviving rhizomes
located in mineral soil [<a href="#5">5</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire will consume all aboveground parts of starry Solomon's seal.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>

<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Starry Solomon's seal is moderately resistant to fire-kill.  It may,
however, be killed by fire that removes the duff layer and heats the
upper mineral layer [<a href="#5">5</a>].  In northern Idaho, starry Solomon's seal cover
percentage was reduced the first growing season after a
moderate-severity fire.  It regained or surpassed all preburn
frequencies by the fourth growing season [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Following prescribed
burning in northern pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis) in central
Minnesota, the average frequency value on burned sites (15.5) was higher
than on unburned sotes (11.0) [<a href="#30">30</a>].
