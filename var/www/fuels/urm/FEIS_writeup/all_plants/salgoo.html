<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of Goodding willow is Salix

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Goodding willow is dominant in many riparian communities of the West,
where it frequently codominates with Fremont cottonwood (Populus
fremontii) [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  It is listed as a dominant plant species in the
following published classifications:

Classification of riparian habitat in the Southwest [<a href="#21">21</a>]
Southwestern riparian plant communities:  site characteristics,
   tree species distributions, and size-class structures [<a href="#28">28</a>]
Terrestrial natural communities of California [<a href="#11">11</a>]

Common plant associates of Goodding willow are Arizona sycamore
(Platanus wrightii), mesquite (Prosopis spp.), desertwillow (Chilopsis
linearis), and southwestern condalia (Condalia lyciodes) [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix gooddingii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Willows (Salix spp.) provide excellent browse and cover for wildlife and
domestic animals.  They are a preferred food of beaver and are often
used as building material for beaver dens.  Mature willows provide
valuable shade in rangelands of southern Arizona [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Goodding willow is used for streambank stabilization and erosion
control.  It has both abundant small surface roots and deeper main root
branches.  Zimmerman [<a href="#33">33</a>] has noted root depths of up to 7 feet (2.1 m)
in Arizona.  Goodding willow also provides shade for fish and other
wildlife [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  It tolerates flooding and long, hot growing seasons,
making it ideal for rehabilitating riparian zones of the Southwest.
Cutting or topping trees in order to encourage sprouting is commonly
practiced in Arizona and New Mexico in order to reestablish Goodding
willow stands [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Willow shoots and bark were used by early Americans to make baskets and
fish traps, and for fence posts, shelters, and firewood [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].

All willows produce salacin, a chemical related to aspirin.  A decoction
of Goodding willow leaves is used in Mexico for treating fevers [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Willows are usually planted using stem cuttings.  Establishment of
Goodding willow in riparian zones can be aided by deep tillage of the
soil, preferably to the water table, before transplanting.  This is
especially effective where soils are compacted or salinized [<a href="#2">2</a>].

If Goodding willow seeds are sown, they must be collected and dispersed
as soon as fruits ripen.  Seeds remain viable for only a few days.
Commercial seed is not available.  Seeds may be stored for up to 1 month
if moistened and refrigerated in a sealed container [<a href="#5">5</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix gooddingii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Goodding willow is a fast-growing, deciduous, dioecious, native shrub or
tree.  It attains a height of 20 to 60 feet (6-18 m) and has an average
d.b.h. of 30 inches (76.2 cm).  Leaves are 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm) long;
female catkins are 1.5 to 3.2 inches (4-8 cm) long.  Fruits are
capsular.  The bark of Goodding willow is thick, rough, and deeply
furrowed [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction:  Goodding willow begins producing seed at 2 to 10
years of age.  Optimum seed-bearing age of willows is 25 to 75 years,
and large seed crops are produced annually.  The minute, hairy seed is
dispersed by wind and water and does not exhibit dormancy.  Seed remains
viable for only a few days.  Germination is epigeal and usually occurs
within 12 to 24 hours.  Seedling establishment is best on moist, bare
soils.  Both fire and flood create favorable seedbed conditions
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Goodding willow sprouts from the root crown
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Goodding willow occurs in riparian zones.  Sites are typically
seasonally inundated by water and have shallow water tables and
fine-grained alluvial soils.  Goodding willow grows well in the pH range
of 6 to 7 and tolerates alkaline desert soils [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

Goodding willow is an initial to early seral species.  It has very low
shade tolerance but high flood tolerance [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  It does not sprout
beneath its own canopy.  Gooding willow seedlings compete poorly with
grasses [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Catkins of Goodding willow appear in early March.  Seeds ripen and are
dispersed in early spring [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix gooddingii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Information concerning effects of fire on Goodding willow is lacking.
It probably sprouts vigorously after a fire, as do most members of the
willow genus.  Fires are uncommon in the riparian zones in which
Goodding willow occurs.

Wind-dispersed Gooding willow seed are probably important in the
colonization of recently burned sites [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Severe fires expose mineral
soil, creating ideal conditions for seedling establishment.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tree with adventitious-bud root crown/soboliferous species root sucker
   Tall shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix gooddingii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Low- to moderate-severity fires probably top-kill young Gooding willow
stems.  Mature trees probably survive such fires.  Severe fires
sometimes kill willows by completely removing soil organic layers and
charring the roots [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Goodding willow probably sprouts vigorously from the root crown
following fire [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
NO-ENTRY
