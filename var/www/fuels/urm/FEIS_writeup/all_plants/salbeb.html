<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix bebbiana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
The wood of Bebb willow is medium hard, fine grained, lightweight, and
brittle [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Bebb willow is the most important producer of "diamond
willow".  This term applies to several species with diamond-shaped
patterns on their trunks.  When the stems are carved they result in a
pattern of diamond-shaped cavities with a sharp contrast between the
white sapwood and the reddish brown heartwood.  Bebb willow is carved
into canes, lamp posts, furniture, and candle holders [<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Wildlife:  Bebb willow is a major source of browse for moose, elk, and
deer [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Along the Flathead River in Montana, Bebb willow
has been rated as highly valuable browse for elk, with heavy utilization
common [<a href="#18">18</a>].  One year after a fire in northeastern Minnesota, Bebb
willow was browsed frequently by moose [<a href="#32">32</a>].  In winter, heavy snows
tend to bend the branches down so that they are in reach of both moose
and snowshoe hares [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Results of a southwestern Montana food habit
study showed that Bebb willow became increasingly important browse for
moose during late winter, making up 15.4 percent of the total forage
taken.  Its height made it easily accessible when low-growing shrubs
such as bog birch (Betula glandulosa) and Wolf willow (Salix wolfii)
were covered with snow [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Bebb willow shoots, buds, and catkins are
eaten by many small mammals, birds, and beaver [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>]. In Illinois,
Carolina and black-capped chickadees excavate cavities in Bebb willow
for nesting [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Livestock:  Bebb willow stands usually grow as widely scattered shrubs,
allowing for easy livestock access.  Forage production is moderate to
high, and heavy livestock use of shrubs and grasses in this habitat is
common [<a href="#4">4</a>].  In southwestern Montana, Bebb willow made up 10.9 percent
of the total forage consumed by cattle in the summer [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Bebb willow has been rated as highly palatable to livestock, big game,
and beaver [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Willow (Salix spp.) palatability increases as the
season progresses [<a href="#40">40</a>].  The relish and degree of use shown by livestock
and wildlife species for Bebb willow in several western states is rated
as follows [<a href="#9">9</a>]:

Nutrient composition (percent) of Bebb willow bark collected in the
spring from Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska, was as follows
[<a href="#29">29</a>]:

Neutral detergent fiber: 35.5

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Bebb willow provides cover and protection for many birds and mammals.
It also provides shade for fish in streams and ponds [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  The
degree to which Bebb willow provides environmental protection during one
or more seasons for wildlife species is rated as follows [<a href="#9">9</a>]:

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Bebb willow is a relatively good soil stabilizer and is valuable for
revegetating streambanks and other disturbed sites [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Bebb willow
readily invades mine spoil piles and has been observed invading barren
acid soils near Sudbury, Ontario, particularly after such soils were
treated with lime and phospate [<a href="#45">45</a>].

Bebb willow cuttings should be planted on sites that have sufficient
moisture to start and carry the cuttings through the growing season
[<a href="#44">44</a>].  Cuttings are best taken in the spring from dormant 2- to
4-year-old wood [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Cuttings 12 to 20 inches (30-50 cm) long and
greater than 0.4 inch (1 cm) in diameter produce best results, with the
cuttings rooting freely along the entire length of the stem.  Roots and
shoots from cuttings can be expected to appear 10 to 20 days after
planting.  Using root cuttings and nursery-grown stock will produce the
best results [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Bebb willow hardwood stem cuttings had a survival
rate of 30 to 70 percent on mine overburden in northern Alberta.
Mortality was largely attributed to rodent damage.  It had poor
overwintering ability on oil sand tailings [<a href="#45">45</a>].

Bebb willow seed is not available from commercial sources because it is
generally viable for only a few days.  The maximum period of storage is
4 to 6 weeks, but viability is markedly reduced after 10 days for seed
stored at room temperature [<a href="#45">45</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Bebb willow was formerly used for baseball bats, charcoal, and gunpowder
[<a href="#41">41</a>].  Native Americans used the flexible willow stems for baskets,
arrow shafts, scoops, and fish traps.  Willows provided medicine for
many ailments such as cuts, indigestion, worms, and stomach complaints
[<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Soil management:  Soils of sites dominated by Bebb willow are often
compacted by livestock.  Deferring grazing until sites are drier may
reduce trampling and compaction problems [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Insects:  The willow sawfly can be a serious pest of willow cuttings
[<a href="#45">45</a>].

Control:  Herbicides are sometimes used to remove willows from riparian
areas, but current environmental constraints make this practice
uncommon.  Results are erratic, due to high variability within
populations and the ability of Bebb willow to rapidly sprout from
undamaged root crowns [<a href="#18">18</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salix bebbiana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bebb willow is a large shrub 10 feet (3 m) tall or a small multistemmed
tree with a bushy top 15 to 25 feet (4.6-7.6 m) tall [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].
The twigs are slender and branch at wide angles, and are thinly to
densely hairy [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Largest mature leaves are 2.6 to 6 inches (7.2
cm) long [<a href="#1">1</a>].  The bark is smooth when young but becomes rough and
furrowed with age [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Roots of Bebb willow are shallow and dense
[<a href="#45">45</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte (Microphanerophyte)
   Phanerophyte (Nanophanerophyte)


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction:  Male and female flowers of Bebb willow are borne
on separate individuals.  Bebb willow starts flowering from 2 to 10
years of age, with optimum seed-producing years from 10 to 30
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Bees are the chief pollinating agents [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Large
quanities of lightweight seed (approximately 2 to 3 million per pound
[4.4-6.6 million/kg]) [<a href="#15">15</a>] are produced and dispersed in the spring, but
seeds remain viable for only a few days [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Seeds do not
require a period of dormancy prior to germination, but successful
establishment requires a moist, exposed mineral substrate that receives
full sunlight.  These conditions are best on recent deposits of alluvial
silts and gravels along waterways or in silted-in, abandoned beaver
ponds [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Bebb willow seed germination in Alaska was 90 to
100 percent at temperatures between 41 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit (5-25
deg C).  This adaptation to a wide range of temperatures is particularly
important in interior Alaska, where surface soil temperatures may vary
over a relatively wide range [<a href="#46">46</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Bebb willow will establish by root shoots and
basal stem sprouting [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Stem and root fragments root naturally if
buried in moist soil.  Damaged and cut stems produce prolific sprouts
from the stem base or root collar.  Layering also occurs readily if
branches become buried [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
In northern Alberta, Bebb willow is common around sloughs in prairies,
and in foothills, upland forests, wet lowlands, thickets, and muskegs.
It is often found in thickets adjacent to streams, swamps, and lakes in
Alaska [<a href="#45">45</a>].  In Idaho and Montana, Bebb willow is best represented in
riparian communities within the Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) zone
and sagebrush/grass habitats.  It is apparently absent in the subalpine
zone but does sometimes occur in cool Engelmann spruce (Picea
engelmannii) dominated streambottoms in the upper Douglas-fir zone
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].

Soils:  Bebb willow is usually found on moist sandy or gravelly soils
but is adapted to a wide variety of soil textures [<a href="#45">45</a>].  It will
tolerate moderately alkaline soils but does poorly in extremely acidic
or alkaline conditions [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  The general pH range for willows is 5.5
to 7.5 [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Bebb willow can survive short periods of standing water,
but growth rates decline sharply if water persists above the root collar
[<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  This willow is not drought tolerant, however, and prefers
sites with adequate moisture.  It is also shade intolerant and grows best
in full sunlight [<a href="#45">45</a>].

Elevational range:  The elevational range of Bebb willow in several
states is as follows [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>]:

        Utah: 4,400 to 8,600 feet (1,341-2,621 m)
        Colorado: 5,000 to 9,600 feet (1,524-2,926 m)
        Wyoming: 4,500 to 8,300 feet (1,372-2,530 m)
        Montana: 2,800 to 8,500 feet (853-2,591 m)
        Arizona: 8,000 to 11,000 feet (2,438-3,353 m)               
        Idaho: 3,300 to 7,900 feet (1,010-2,410 m)

Plant associates:  Bebb willow is commmonly associated with the
following species:  Pacific willow (Salix lasiandra), thinleaf alder
(Alnus tenuifolia), redosier dogwood (Cornus stolonifera), dwarfed
blackberry (Rubus pubescens), black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa),
quaking aspen (P. tremuloides), water birch (Betula occidentalis),
bluejoint reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis), beaked sedge (Carex
rostrata), water sedge (C. aquatilis), false-Solomons-seal (Smilacina
stellata), sweet scented bedstraw (Gallium triflorum), rush (Juncus
spp.), and bluegrass (Poa spp.) [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Bebb willow is a pioneer species and once established may persist in
areas with moist site conditions or frequent disturbance such as fire or
flooding.  Channel changes that reduce the availability of water may
prevent successful germination and establishment of Bebb willow within
established stands.  Bebb willow has low shade tolerance and therefore
loses dominance on sites as the more shade-tolerant species such as
black cottonwood, quaking aspen, and Engelmann spruce become established
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
In general, Bebb willow flowers from April through July or August
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  The fruit ripens soon after flowering, followed by seed
dispersal [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Blooming dates for several western states are as
follows [<a href="#9">9</a>]:

                Utah: April-July
                Colorado: May-August
                Wyoming: June-August
                Montana: April-June
                North Dakota: April-May

Fire will kill aboveground parts of Bebb willow.  High-severity fires
can completely remove organic layers and leave charred roots of willow
exposed, thus eliminating basal sprouting [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
Spring and fall prescribed burns in a Minnesota prairie killed
aboveground portions of Bebb willow.  In wet habitats, fire killed the
tops of Bebb willow but did no apparent harm to underground parts [<a href="#38">38</a>].


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Bebb willow will sprout vigorously from the basal stem following fire
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Quick hot fires will maximize sprouting [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  The light
seeds readily colonize exposed mineral soil after hot fires.  Bebb
willow usually becomes the dominant species in willow stands that follow
forest fires on upland sites and in thickets adjacent to streams,
swamps, and lakes of interior Alaska [<a href="#41">41</a>].  The degree to which this
species invades after fire, however, depends on the time of year,
weather, and presence of a mineral seedbed.  A wet period after seed
dispersal allows for germination, but a dry period can cause enough seed
viability loss to prevent germination.  The chance of Bebb willow
establishing after a fire lessens as available mineral soil seedbeds
become occupied by faster growing herbaceous species and mosses [<a href="#42">42</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Following a low-severity August evening burn in central Saskatchawan,
revegetation started within a few days.  By the sixth growing season,
alder (Alnus spp.), Bebb willow, and aspen (Populus spp.) were the
dominant broadleaf species [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Bebb willow was common in the moss-herb
stage 2 to 5 years after fire on white spruce (Picea glauca) dominated
sites in Alaska and persisted through the shrub and tree stage 6 to 25
years after fire.  Bebb willow density declines in these stands as more
shade-tolerant species become established [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Prescribed burning is a common wildlife management tool used to
rejuvenate decadent Bebb willow communities [<a href="#18">18</a>].
