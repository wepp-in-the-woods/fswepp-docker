<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of creeping bentgrass is Agrostis
stolonifera L. [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  It is a member of the Poaceae family.
Recognized varieties are [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>]:

A. s. var. compacta Hartm.
A. s. var. palustris (Huds.)Farw.
A. s. var. stolonifera

Creeping bentgrass hybridizes with rabbitfoot grass (Polypogon
monspeliensis) and colonial bentgrass (A. capillaris).  It apparently
hybridizes with ticklegrass (A. scabra), spike bentgrass (A. exarata)
and water polypogon (P. semiverticillatus) [<a href="#59">59</a>].

The names A. gigantea, A. alba, and A. stolonifera var. major have been
misapplied to creeping bentgrass, which is recognized as distinct from
those species [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Creeping bentgrass occurs in a wide variety of habitats including
pinyon-juniper (Pinus-Juniperus spp.), aspen (Populus spp.), fir-spruce
(Abies-Picea spp.), ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa), willow (Salix spp.),
subalpine forest, meadow, and alpine [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  It is an indicator
of riparian community types in the Intermountain region; willows are

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Agrostis stolonifera
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Creeping bentgrass is important forage for livestock because it stays
green and palatable throughout the summer.  In general, it is moderately
productive [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  On moist sites, creeping bentgrass produces good
forage throughout the growing season, but is less productive and less
palatable than many introduced perennial grasses [<a href="#59">59</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Creeping bentgrass has a high palatability rating in the spring and
early summer, fair after flowering, and poor in winter [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  It is
rated fair to good for livestock and highly satisfactory for elk
[<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Creeping bentgrass is rated good in nutritional value for elk and mule
deer, poor for pronghorn, and fair for white-tailed deer, small mammals,
small nongame birds, upland game birds, and waterfowl [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Energy
rating is fair and protein content is poor [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Cover value of creeping bentgrass is rated good for upland game birds
and waterfowl and fair for small mammals and small nongame birds [<a href="#24">24</a>].  


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Creeping bentgrass is moderately effective in stabilizing streambanks
due to its typically dense network of intertwining roots and rhizomes.
However, bank undercutting and sloughing may occur, especially when
soils are wet or stands are weakened by excessive grazing [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].
Erosion control, short-term revegetation potential, and long-term
revegetation potential are rated high for creeping bentgrass [<a href="#24">24</a>].  In
subalpine and spruce-fir (Picea-Abies) habitats of the Intermountain
West, creeping bentgrass is recommended for direct seeding and
transplanting on riparian sites.  Transplant capability is good, growth
rate is moderate, and flooding tolerance is moderate [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Creeping
bentgrass is used in the Northeast for erosion control [<a href="#50">50</a>].

An abandoned tailings pond from a zinc-lead mill near Pecos, New Mexico,
was sampled after 50 years of mining.  An ephemeral stream ran through
the tailings pond and had resulted in extensive flooding and deposition
of sediment on top of original tailings.  A distinct vegetational
community had developed and creeping bentgrass was found in the mesic
meadow site.  High levels of zinc and lead were found in vegetation
being grazed by cattle.
 


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Creeping bentgrass is widely used in turf culture, especially for golf
courses [<a href="#59">59</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Overgrazing on sites formerly dominated by native grasses produces
changes in vegetational communities.  Once a suitable site is disturbed,
the extensive stolon system of creeping bentgrass allows it to rapidly
spread and establish.  It also withstands high levels of grazing, making
replacement with former dominants difficult [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Creeping bentgrass is tolerant of close grazing due to its somewhat
prostrate growth form, rhizomatous growth habit, and lower palatability
than associated species.  If creeping bentgrass is used as a pasture
grass, close grazing followed by rest in a rotation system is
recommended to keep plants producing palatable forage all season.
Plants should be cut during early flowering to obtain highest quality
hay [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

Creeping bentgrass readily colonizes areas disturbed by logging,
plowing, burning, or excessive grazing [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Agrostis stolonifera
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Creeping bentgrass is a stoloniferous perennial, and is sometimes
mat-forming or tufted [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Culms are prostrate, usually
1.3 to 3.3 feet (0.4-1 m) long [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  The blades are flat to
folded, 0.08-inch to 0.4-inch (2-10 mm) wide, and 0.8 to 4 inches (2-10
cm) long [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  The panicle is open to somewhat narrow, and up to 16
inches (40 cm) tall [<a href="#59">59</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Creeping bentgrass reproduces by seed and by stolons [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  It can
set seed in one growing season, thus sometimes functioning as an annual.
In southern Ontario, creeping bentgrass seed has a 52 percent
germination rate after 30 days under approximate optimal germination
conditions; seeds were cold stratified for 9 months prior to planting
[<a href="#53">53</a>].  Grasses in the genus Agrostis are seed-banking species [<a href="#60">60</a>].  In
pastures and meadows of Europe, creeping bentgrass seeds can survive in
the soil for at least 1 year [<a href="#48">48</a>].  In a northern subarctic community in
Manitoba, Canada, creeping bentgrass is a persistent perennial that
spreads vegetatively to form clumps or large patches but sometimes fails
to reproduce by seed, although flowering is observed [<a href="#53">53</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Creeping bentgrass occurs in a wide variety of habitats including
woodlands, forest openings, grasslands, shrublands, prairies, sandhills,
meadows, marshes, bogs, vernal pools, and stream and lake margins
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  It is most commonly found in moist places such as
recently exposed sand and gravel bars, wet meadows, and along streams
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Creeping bentgrass grows on disturbed sites such as
in ditches or along roadsides, and in pastures and hayfields
[<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  It also grows in salt marshes [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].

Creeping bentgrass grows best on moist to semiwet soils, but is
tolerant of poorly drained and subirrigated conditions, submergence,
and frequent flooding [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  It grows best on loam, clay-loam, and
sandy soils, but occurs on gravelly and rocky substrates as well
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  It is moderately tolerant of drought [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Elevations for creeping bentgrass for several states and provinces are
as follows:  

         Montana      2,800-7,000 feet     (854-2,134 m) [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>]
         Idaho        6,600-7,920 feet     (2,000-2,400 m) [<a href="#10">10</a>]
         Oregon       6,680 feet           (2,036 m) [<a href="#15">15</a>]
         Nevada       6,400-8,480 feet     (1,950-2,585 m ) [<a href="#36">36</a>]
         Utah         3,234-10,065 feet    (980-3,050 m) [<a href="#41">41</a>]
         California   less than 3,300 feet (<1000 m) [<a href="#26">26</a>]
         Ontario      990 feet             (300 m) [<a href="#5">5</a>]


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>

Facultative Seral Species

Creeping bentgrass is generally a pioneer or invader species [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>],
but is tolerant of semishaded environments [<a href="#62">62</a>].  It is a facultative
wetland species in Montana and California [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  It is a member of
the creeping bentgrass community type in riparian areas of Montana that
will eventually be taken over by later successional species [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].
Creeping bentgrass may persist under a regime of repeated fluvial
disturbance in wetland riparian areas of Montana [<a href="#25">25</a>].  In Oregon,
creeping bentgrass is an early successional species that colonizes
low-lying gravel bars and newly formed depositional surfaces [<a href="#15">15</a>].  In
Nevada, it is an increaser on moist sites; the creeping bentgrass
community type probably resulted because of past heavy grazing levels.
It may have replaced communities dominated by tufted hairgrass [<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Creeping bentgrass flowers from June to August in the Upper Great Plains
[<a href="#21">21</a>].  It flowers from June to October in the Carolinas [<a href="#44">44</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Agrostis stolonifera
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Creeping bentgrass has fair tolerance to fire [<a href="#62">62</a>].  No information was
available in the literature concerning creeping bentgrass fire ecology
or adaptations.  However, a similar species, ticklegrass (Agrostis
scabra), colonizes bare mineral soil on recently burned sites and may
store seeds in the soil for short durations, allowing for early
establishment of areas burned in the spring (see the FEIS write-up for
Agrostis scabra). The stolons are probably killed by moderately severe
and severe fires.

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Agrostis stolonifera
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Creeping bentgrass is probably top-killed by fire, as are most grasses.
Specific fire effects on creeping bentgrass are not described in the
literature.
        


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
In 1972, prescription burning at the Buffalo River State Park in
northwest New Mexico was initiated as a tallgrass prairie management and
restoration technique.  The response of creeping bentgrass to burning
varied with the site.  On a nearly level mesic site in a badly disturbed
prairie, stimulation of flowering occurred at postfire year 1.
Inhibition of flowering occurred, however, on a wet swale site in an
undisturbed prairie [<a href="#42">42</a>].

In 1950, a fire burned 1,000,000 acres (400,000 ha) of woodland in
Alberta and British Columbia.  Creeping bentgrass established on plots
where seeded species did not produce full stands [<a href="#2">2</a>].  

 


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Since creeping bentgrass is considered an increaser species when
overgrazed, fire plans may have to be coordinated with grazing
management to ensure seedling establishment or inhibition.
