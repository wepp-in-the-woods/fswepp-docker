<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cupressus macrocarpa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Monterey cypress occurs in two natural stands in Monterey County,
California.  One stand is between Point Cypress and Pescadero Point on
the north side of Carmel Bay, Monterey Peninsula.  A smaller one is near
Point Lobos on the south side of Carmel Bay [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Monterey cypress
is widely planted and naturalized on the California coast [<a href="#13">13</a>].  It has
been planted in Hawaii, Europe, South America, Australia, and New
Zealand [<a href="#17">17</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Monterey cypress is the dominant component of the Monterey cypress
forest community [<a href="#13">13</a>].  This community is a moderately dense,
fire-maintained forest up to 82 feet (25 m) tall in sheltered areas
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Monterey cypress typically grows in pure stands with an
understory of scattered dwarf shrubs and perennial herbs [<a href="#13">13</a>].  It
intergrades with northern coastal bluff scrub on exposed seaward edges
and with Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) forest away from the ocean
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Monterey cypress is associated with closed-cone coniferous
woodlands and closed-cone pine-cypress forests [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Monterey cypress wood is durable [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Natural durability of
heartwood of Monterey cypress is high, 10 to 15 years' ground life and
over 15 years above ground [<a href="#22">22</a>].  It is suitable for a wide range of
exterior uses including joinery, shingles, and boats.  Possible interior
uses include moulding and panelling [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Cypress shelterbelts
provide good firewood.  Most cypress species develop a large proportion
of heartwood, which splits well, dries quickly, and is clean burning.
Monterey cypress wood is moderately fast burning because of its low to
medium density [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  As cypress woods are prone to sparking, they
are recommended only for enclosed fires [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Monterey cypress is planted in Africa and New Zealand for lumber and
pulp production [<a href="#14">14</a>].  


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Rodents and deer consume cypress seedlings.  Cypress are considered
undesirable forage for livestock, although young plants are occasionally
browsed [<a href="#34">34</a>].

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Monterey cypress has been planted widely for ornament, hedges, and
windbreaks in the Pacific States, Europe, South America, Australia, New
Zealand, and the Falkland Islands [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Monterey cypress is considered rare in its range.  Portions of the
Monterey cypress grove on Monterey Peninsula have been destroyed for
housing developments and golf courses [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>].  

Grazing and trampling by livestock are detrimental to cypress seedlings
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>].    

In Tasmania, ingestion of foliage of Monterey cypress trees has been
associated with abortion in cattle and cerebral leucomalacia of the
aborted fetus [<a href="#26">26</a>].  

Monterey cypress seedlings are susceptible to damping-off fungi [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].
Monterey cypress is highly susceptible to coryneum canker (Coryneum
cardinale), which can kill trees.  Coryneum canker (cypress canker) may
spread naturally by rain, wind, birds, rodents, and bark beetles, which
disseminate fungal spores [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Coryneum canker has eliminated some
inland plantations of Monterey cypress [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Monterey cypress trees on
the coast seem resistant to coryneum canker possibly because of the
constant spray of salt, which decreases fungal spore viability [<a href="#33">33</a>].

One species of bark beetle (Ernobius conicola) infests green and dry
cones of Monterey cypress and dead branches of the same host.  It only
infests trees found in the two native populations on Monterey Peninsula.
Two moth species (Laspeyresia cupressana and Henricus macrocarpara) are
associated with the bark beetle in 2-year-old Monterey cypress cones.
The larvae of these insects can cause damage to the seeds [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].

In park plantings in San Francisco, Monterey cypress trees grow rapidly
and are overmature by 70 years of age.  Many have root rot, excessive
lean, large dead branches, and a small proportion of live crown [<a href="#5">5</a>].  

Methods for establishing Monterey cypress in New Zealand are described
by Glass {10].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cupressus macrocarpa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Monterey cypress is a native, evergreen tree.  In native groves, trees
on the coastal fringe are severely sculptured and distorted.  A short
distance inland, an erect form and light branching are apparent, showing
that this cypress, although capable of enduring wind and salt-blasting,
responds well to shelter [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Monterey cypress grows to 82 feet (25
m) tall.  Mature leaves are 0.08 inch (2 mm) long, although they can be
up to 0.4 inch (10 mm) on vigorous shoots [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Ovulate cones are
solitary, up to 1.4 inches (35 mm) long. Staminate cones are 0.24 (6 mm)
long [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  The bark is thick and fibrous, becoming furrowed with
age [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  A well-defined taproot and numerous laterals are formed
the first year [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Naturalists at the Point Lobos State Reserve
have estimated the maximum age of Monterey cypress at 200 to 300 years
[<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Monterey cypress reproduces exclusively from seed.  Cone production is
abundant.  Staminate cone production begins on trees that are 6 to 7
years old [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Ovulate cone production begins on trees that are less
than 10 years of age [<a href="#5">5</a>].  The cones require 2 years to mature [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>]
and can contain 140 seeds [<a href="#14">14</a>].  The cones of Monterey cypress remain
closed for only a few years after maturity; seed dispersal is a
continuous process and can occur without fire [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Seeds maintain
viability for up to 4 years on trees [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Seed dispersal is primarily
by wind and rain [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].

Cypress seeds require bare mineral soil for germination and
establishment.  Seedling mortality is high on shaded sites with abundant
litter because of damping-off fungi [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Seedlings are sensitive to
excessive moisture [<a href="#34">34</a>].  
   


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
In native stands, Monterey cypress is confined to rocky, granitic soils
of coastal headlands and bluffs exposed to nearly constant onshore winds
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  These acidic, sandy soils generally have a pH of 4.5 to 5.5
[<a href="#33">33</a>].  Monterey cypress occurs at elevations from sea level to 100 feet
(30 m) [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Site requirements for cypress seedlings are typical of those for pioneer
conifers.  Seedlings are shade intolerant and survive best in full
sunlight on bare mineral soil [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  According to Armstrong [<a href="#2">2</a>],
cypress trees of southern California are very sensitive to lack of
light, losing their foliage when growing in shade.  

Although chaparral species inhibit the establishment of cypress
seedlings, few chaparral species are able to compete on infertile soils
where Monterey cypress is found [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>].  Pines may outcompete Monterey
cypress where they are found together [<a href="#34">34</a>].  


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
In California, growth and development of Monterey cypress cones begins
in January and extends to December of the same year.  In the second year
of development, cones are pollinated in February and March [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Seeds
mature 15 to 18 months after pollination [<a href="#14">14</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cupressus macrocarpa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Monterey cypress is a fire-adapted species with serotinous cones [<a href="#33">33</a>].
Serotiny is less pronounced in Monterey cypress than in other California
cypress species, possibly due to reduced frequency of intense crown
fires near the ocean [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Monterey cypress is capable of seedling
establishment with or without crown fire, although fire provides optimum
site conditions for regeneration [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Some Monterey cypress trees
survive fire; "fire-hollowed" trees were reported on sites containing
both Monterey cypress and pines [<a href="#34">34</a>].  

When cones of the California cypress species are opened by the heat of a
fire, the seeds fall on exposed mineral soil [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Most seed falls
in the first few months following fire [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Fires that occur in late
summer and fall and are followed by winter rains ensure seed
dissemination on bare mineral substrates and moist conditions for
germination [<a href="#33">33</a>].  No information was available on fire-free intervals
for communities dominated by Monterey cypress.  Tecate cypress
(Cupressus guadalupenis var. forbesii), a cypress found in southern
California, has an average interval between fires of 25 years, ranging
from 15 to 63 years [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tree without adventitious-bud root crown
   Crown residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cupressus macrocarpa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Most fires probably kill Monterey cypress.  Cypress thickets are
conducive to crown fires, which usually kill most trees in the burned
area.  Some trees survive when fires are patchy [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Large trees might
survive surface fires.

Cones of the California cypress species open as the resin melts and
boils.  Rapid charring of the thick cone scales extinguishes the flames,
leaving seeds unburned [<a href="#2">2</a>].  


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
California cypress species trees release large quantities of seed
after fire [<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fires occurring too frequently in groves of California cypress species
may destroy them, as reproduction could be eliminated before trees have
a chance to produce cones [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Fire followed by intensive grazing could
eliminate a cypress grove [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>].
