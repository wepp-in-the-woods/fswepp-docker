<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of red elderberry is Sambucus
racemosa L. ssp. pubens (Michx) House [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>].

Sambucus racemosa is the designation of a circumboreal species.  The
American plants are considered as S. r. ssp. pubens by many authorities
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>], but others [<a href="#31">31</a>] believe they should be recognized as a
separate species and use the designation of S. pubens.

Sambucus is a genus in which there is much hybridization and
backcrossing.  Hybridization occurs between S. racemosa ssp. pubens var.
arborescens (S. callicarpa) and S. cerulea [<a href="#57">57</a>].  Some plants regarded
as S. racemosa var.  melanocarpa in northwest Oregon may actually be S.
racemosa var. microbotrys x S. cerulea hybrids (Peck 1954 in [<a href="#57">57</a>]).
Chromosome numbers and configurations show the close relationship
between the three varieties of S. racemosa ssp. pubens studied to date
(var. microbotrys has not been studied).  These studies also indicate a
close relationship to S. cerulea and more distant relationships with S.
canadensis and S. simpsonii [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>], although hybrids with S. canadensis
have been produced [<a href="#43">43</a>].

Recognized North American varieties of Sambucus racemosa ssp. pubens
include [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>]:

    var. arborescens (T. & G.) Gray  (S. callicarpa of some authors)
    var. melanocarpa (Gray) McMinn

<pre><center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Sambucus racemosa ssp. pubens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
S. racemosa ssp. pubens is found across North America from Newfoundland
to Alaska [<a href="#33">33</a>].  It is restricted to moist, cool sites in the south and
extends southward into California in the coastal mountains, into Arizona
and New Mexico in the Rocky Mountains, and into Georgia and Tennessee in
the Appalachian highlands [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>].

The distribution by variety is as follows [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>]:

    Var. melanocarpa is primarily found in the northern Rocky Mountains
    of Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, and into western Alberta and British
    Columbia.  It also extends west into Washington and Oregon, and south
    into northeastern California and northern New Mexico and Arizona.

    Var. microbotrys occurs primarily from southern Wyoming, south to
    New Mexico then west into the Sierra Nevada and northern Coast
    ranges of California.

    Var. arborescens is found along the Pacific coast from the Aleutian
    Islands and southern Alaska south to the California coast ranges
    ending around San Francisco Bay.

    Var. leucocarpa extends from southeastern British Columbia, Montana,
    and South Dakota east through Canada to Newfoundland and the
    northeastern United States.  It also extends south into the
    Great Lakes states and through the Appalachian Mountains into
    Georgia and Tennessee.

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
S. racemosa ssp. pubens may occur as an understory dominant in red alder
(Alnus rubra) or quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) stands and as a
dominant or codominant species in seral conifer forests in the West.  It
may persist in climax deciduous forests of the East.  

Published classification schemes listing S. racemosa ssp. pubens as an
indicator species or as a dominant part of vegetation in community
types, habitat types, or plant associations are presented below.

Associated Species:  S. racemosa ssp. pubens is so widespread that any
complete list of associated species would be excessively long.  A few of
its common western associates include aspen, red alder, big sagebrush
(Artemisia tridentata), snowberry (Symphoricarpos spp.), serviceberry
(Amelanchier spp.), other shrubs, and many herbaceous species [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].
In northeastern hemlock-white pine (Tsuga canadensis-Pinus
strobus)-northern hardwood forests, it grows with American fly
honeysuckle (Lonicera canadensis), beaked hazel (Corylus cornuta),
hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), and winterberry (Ilex verticillata).
In the Appalachians it is associated with striped maple (Acer
pensylvanicum), mountain maple (Acer spicatum), hobblebush (Viburnum
alnifolium), and winterberry [<a href="#118">118</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Sambucus racemosa ssp. pubens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Many wildlife species use elderberries for food [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>].
Elderberries provide valuable nesting and perching habitat, and their
fruit provides food for many species of birds including bluebirds,
magpies, woodpeckers, grosbeaks, veeries, warbling vireo, red-eyed
vireo, scarlet tanager, western tanager, house finch, green-tailed
towhee, Townsend solitaire, American crow, grouse, quail, pheasant, and
hummingbirds who visit flowers for nectar [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>].
Elderberries also provide food for mammals such as rabbits, squirrels,
foxes, woodchucks, chipmunks, ground squirrels, woodrats, and mice [<a href="#61">61</a>].
One study showed that bird use of S. racemosa ssp. pubens is primarily
determined by fruit crop size of individual shrubs, and use increases
with larger crop size [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Use may vary by variety.

    Elk in Idaho prefer var. melanocarpa and utilize it from June
    through September, usually stripping all of its leaves.
    Heaviest utilization is in the fall [<a href="#120">120</a>].  It is considered an
    "ice cream" plant rather than a "key" species because it does not
    occur in sufficient abundance to be part of the carrying capacity 
    of the range [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>].  An Arizona study found that Kaibab mule deer
    use var. melanocarpa, but it is not a major part of their diet [<a href="#44">44</a>].
    In northwestern Montana, grizzly bears use berry-producing shrubs,
    including S. racemosa ssp. pubens var. melanocarpa, for summer food,
    but it is not generally considered a key bear food [<a href="#121">121</a>].

    When fed to captive mule deer in Utah, var. microbotrys was used
    only in late June and August and was considerably less important
    as browse than S. cerulea [<a href="#93">93</a>].  It is, however, sometimes
    extensively browsed during the summer [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Sheep in Utah use
    80 to 90 percent of the leaves in late August and early September,
    while cattle use 40 to 70 percent of the leaves plus some stem
    tissue. During the winter porcupines and mice eat the buds
    and bark [<a href="#12">12</a>].

    In the Lake States var. leucocarpa is usually heavily browsed
    by deer and moose [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife species for Sambucus
racemosa ssp. pubens in several western states is rated as follows
[<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>]:

The palatability of S. racemosa ssp. pubens appears to vary by variety.

    Var. melanocarpa is one of the most palatable browse species for
    elk in Idaho and Montana [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>].  During the summer palatability
    varies by area for livestock.  It can be fair to very good for
    sheep and poor for cattle in one area, and worthless in other areas.
    After frost the palatability is excellent for goats, good to
    excellent for sheep, and fairly good to good for cattle [<a href="#17">17</a>].

    In California the palatability of var. callicarpa is rated as good
    to fair for sheep, goats, and deer; fair to poor for cattle; and poor
    for horses [<a href="#93">93</a>].  In the fall it is good for sheep and fairly good
    for cattle [<a href="#17">17</a>].

    Var. microbotrys is most palatable in the late summer and fall [<a href="#3">3</a>].

    Var. leucocarpa is not palatable until July and then increases in
    palatability until, by September, it is excellent for sheep and
    fairly good for cattle in Washington [<a href="#5">5</a>].  A Wisconsin study
    found that fruit sugar content varies between bushes, and birds
    prefer higher sugar content [<a href="#7">7</a>].
    


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The energy value of S. racemosa ssp. pubens is rated as fair and its
protein value is rated as poor [<a href="#20">20</a>].  The fruit is high in ascorbic acid
[<a href="#89">89</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The degree to which Sambucus racemosa ssp. pubens provides environmental
protection during one or more seasons for wildlife species is as follows
[<a href="#20">20</a>]:
                              UT          WY
Pronghorn                    poor        poor

Upland game birds            good        good
Waterfowl                    poor        poor


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
S. racemosa ssp. pubens can be useful in stabilizing soil and
controlling erosion on moist sites [<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>].  Its growth on moderate and
gentle slopes is good, and its growth on steep slopes is fair.  In Utah
its potential biomass production, erosion control, and long-term
revegetation potential is rated as medium.  Its establishment
requirements are low, but it has poor short-term revegetation potential
[<a href="#20">20</a>].  Nursery seedlings and container grown stock of var. microbotrys
are recommended for planting on disturbed riparian areas in the aspen
and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) zones of the western United States.
It establishes slowly, but grows well on moist sites, occasional seeps,
and streambanks [<a href="#80">80</a>].  

Best establishment of S. racemosa ssp. pubens in Utah has been obtained
by direct seeding [<a href="#82">82</a>], but establishment can be erratic [<a href="#83">83</a>].  This
plant can be propagated by cuttings, either using hardwood cuttings
started in the winter or softwood cuttings during the spring or summer
[<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>].  Cuttings of rhizomes with stems can also be transplanted
[<a href="#12">12</a>].

S. racemosa ssp. pubens is adapted for use in the forested, northern
desert shrub, pinyon-juniper (Pinus edulis-Juniperus spp.), and mountain
brush zones of Nevada [<a href="#100">100</a>].  Var. microbotrys is useful in the
Southwest for rehabilitation in the subalpine zone, in aspen
communities, and in mountain brush communities.  Its rankings for
characteristics that are useful on disturbed areas are as follows [<a href="#81">81</a>]:

    Establishment by seed              Medium
    Establishment by transplants       Medium
    Seed production and handling       Very Good
    Natural spread by seed             Poor
    Natural vegetative spread          Very Good
    Growth rate                        Very good
    Soil stability                     Very good
    Adaptation to disturbance          Medium


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Elderberries are good ornamentals and their colorful fruit attracts
birds [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>].  Var. microbotrys may become a sprawling shrub with a
longer growing season and plenty of water [<a href="#49">49</a>].  The fruit of var.
melanocarpa was dried by the Indians and may be used for jelly or wine.
Fruit of the other varieties, however, is not palatable to humans and
may be slightly poisonous, although it is harmless when cooked [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].
S.  racemosa ssp. pubens contains a cyanogenetic glycoside and an
alkaloid that can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal
pain [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>].  The berries contain very little of these substances, the
stems contain moderate amounts, and the roots contain enough to cause
death to hogs.  Medical uses have been made of all parts [<a href="#89">89</a>].  Dyes can
be made from the bark, fruit, and stems, and an insecticide from the
dried leaves [<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>].  The name Sambucus is derived from the Greek
sambuca which was a stringed instrument supposed to have been made from
elder wood.  The hollow stems have been fashioned into flutes and
blowguns.  The wood is hard and has been used for combs, spindles, and
pegs [<a href="#70">70</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Browsing:  In the Lake States S. racemosa ssp. pubens responds somewhat
erratically to heavy clipping, but can withstand moderate use [<a href="#3">3</a>].  In a
Utah study of var. microbotrys, severe clipping in the fall did not
cause significant changes in either the number or length of rhizome
stems, or in the weight of stems and leaves [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Competition:  In moist forests of the Pacific Northwest S. racemosa ssp.
pubens is a component of the seral shrub field complex that can inhibit
tree regeneration following fire, although it is rarely a primary
competitor [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>].  On dry sites in Utah conifer regeneration
is limited to shrub communities, including S. racemosa ssp. pubens, that
form a fringe around Engelman spruce-subalpine fir (Picea engelmanni
-Abies lasiocarpa) associations [<a href="#23">23</a>].

S. racemosa ssp. pubens may have some allelopathic potential.  A
laboratory study in western Washington found that leaf and litter
extracts inhibited germination and growth of three other species,
including Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), although there was little
interference in the field [<a href="#18">18</a>].  A second study in Utah using leaf and
stem extracts of var. microbotrys found weak inhibition of grass amd
forb germination in the laboratory, but the tests indicated that the
inhibition was not strong enough to be effective in the field [<a href="#64">64</a>].

Herbicide treatment:  Several herbicides are effective against S.
racemosa ssp. pubens including 2,4,-D, Roundup, Garlon 4, Tordon, and
Picloram [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Sambucus racemosa ssp. pubens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
S. racemosa ssp. pubens is a deciduous shrub (occasionally var.
arborescens may be a small tree) from 20 inches to 20 feet (0.5 to 6 m)
in height [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].  Young twigs are soft and pithy, but the wood
is quite hard [<a href="#70">70</a>].  The stems may have a rank odor if bruised [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>].
Elderberries have large, opposite, compound leaves with five to nine
leaflets [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  The creamy white flowers are in pyramidal heads and
followed by round, berrylike fruits called drupes [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>].  The
fruit normally contains two to four seeds [<a href="#12">12</a>] and is usually bright red,
although that of var. melanocarpa is black.

Information on differing morphology and growth forms of varieties is
summarized below [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>].

    Var. melanocarpa has black or purplish black fruit.  The
    leaflets may be pubescent underneath, and it is usually 3 to 7 feet
    (1 to 2 m) tall.  It appears to have thicker foliage because it has
    shorter internodes.

    Var. arborescens may occasionally be a small tree, but it is
    normally a clumped shrub from 6 to 20 feet (2 to 6 m) tall which
    coppices freely.  It has bright red fruit with three poisonous seeds 
    or nutlets.

    Var. microbotrys has glabrous leaflets and may be from 20 inches
    to 6.5 feet (0.5 to 2 m) tall.  It is rhizomatous and forms clones
    which persist by vegetative reproduction.

    Var. leucocarpa is more or less stoloniferous, from 3 to 10 feet
    (1 to 3 m) tall, and usually has red fruit.  New stems are glaucus.
  


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual regeneration in S. racemosa ssp. pubens begins with small,
perfect flowers which are pollinated by insects [<a href="#79">79</a>], usually resulting
in three nutlets in a fleshy, edible drupe [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  There are good seed
crops most years, and seeds are dispersed by birds and other animals
that eat the fruit [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>].  Plants are able to reproduce by 3 to 5
years of age [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Elderberry seeds have a hard seed coat and dormant
embryos that delay germination [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>], but heat treatment or sulfuric
acid scarification and stratification can hasten germination.  Several
authorities give detailed descriptions of seed gathering and germination
treatments [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>].  Without treatment, germination of seedlings
may be delayed for 2 or more years after planting [<a href="#39">39</a>].

A Utah study of var. microbotrys found that only about 60 percent of the
seed was filled; 74 to 91 percent of that was viable; and 37 to 51
percent of the filled seed germinated following stratification in the
laboratory.  Germination of seed stratified under field conditions was 8
percent, and less than 1 percent of seed planted under aspen germinated.
None of the seedlings in the field survived, and the researchers
concluded that vegetative reproduction was more important to this
variety than sexual reproduction [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Viable seeds of S. racemosa ssp. pubens have been found buried in the
forest floor [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>] at all sampled soil depths when soil was
stratified [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  In Minnesota viability of the buried seeds was
25 percent [<a href="#1">1</a>].  A detailed study in Idaho found overall viability of
Sambucus seeds to be only 16 percent [<a href="#54">54</a>].  Theories about the origin of
seed found in seed banks include:  a) the seed has long-term viability
and remains from early seral stages; b) birds may bring in seed; and, c)
understory plants may occasionally produce some fruit [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>].

S. racemosa ssp. pubens regenerates vegetatively from sprouts, rhizome
suckers, and layering [<a href="#118">118</a>].  A Utah study of vegetative regeneration in
var. microbotrys following clipping found new shoots arising from buds
at the base of old stems, but no new stems initiating from the rhizome.
When old growth was completely killed, however, numerous new stems
started from the rhizomes, suggesting that living stems growing from the
rhizome suppress rhizome bud growth.  Seedlings form a thickened crown
with buds which can become a rhizome by the third year [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
S. racemosa ssp. pubens is not well adapted to warm climates and in the
southern part of its range is found in cooler uplands, swamps, and along
cool drainages [<a href="#118">118</a>].  Where its range overlaps with S. cerulea, it will
usually be found on higher, cooler sites, although they grow together in
the mountains [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>].  Where it is found on upland sites, S.
racemosa ssp. pubens is relatively high in frequency and low in density,
so that the few plants are well scattered through the forest [<a href="#15">15</a>].  S.
racemosa ssp. pubens is found in riparian systems in California [<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>]
and in northern Ohio swamp forests [<a href="#118">118</a>].

Soils:  S. racemosa ssp. pubens prefers rich rocky soils with ample
moisture [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>].  It will tolerate saturated soils (although not as
well as S. canadensis) [<a href="#118">118</a>].  In Utah growth on gravel and sand is fair,
growth on sandy loam, loam, and clay loam is good, growth on clay is
fair, and growth on dense clay is poor [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  S. racemosa prefers
soils with a pH of 5.0 to 8.0 [<a href="#118">118</a>].  In Utah growth on acidic soils is
fair while growth on saline and sodic-saline soils is poor.  Best
development is on soils over 20 inches deep [<a href="#20">20</a>].  In Utah soils ranged
from loam to silt loam to sandy clay loam [<a href="#12">12</a>].  An Idaho study found S.
racemosa ssp. pubens on soils with high (5.6-8.0 percent) organic matter
[<a href="#71">71</a>].  A study of Douglas-fir plantations in British Columbia clearly
associates increasing frequency and cover of S. racemosa ssp. pubens
with moist, nutrient-rich soils along a gradient from very dry to moist
and nutrient-poor to nutrient-rich [<a href="#53">53</a>].

Elevation:  Elevational ranges in some western regions are as follows
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>]:

                            Minimum              Maximum

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
In western coniferous forests S. racemosa ssp. pubens is primarily an
early to mid-seral species [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>] which can persist in relatively
open conifer stands [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].  Thinning operations may produce an increase
in S. racemosa ssp. pubens, but it disappears again as overstory shade
redevelops [<a href="#2">2</a>].  In deciduous forests of aspen or red alder, S. racemosa
ssp. pubens may be a dominant part of a long-lived seral or climax
forest [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].  If conifers gain dominance, it disappears along
with other seral species [<a href="#72">72</a>].

Shade tolerance is important in determining a plant's role in
succession, and several authors list S. racemosa ssp. pubens as shade
tolerant or partially shade tolerant [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>].  In forests with
dense shade S. racemosa ssp. pubens is chiefly found in openings with
higher light levels [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].  Where it grows under a canopy, it
develops poorly, is lower in height, and fruits sparingly, if at all
[<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>].  A Vermont study showed that S. racemosa ssp. pubens
presence went from 50 percent with light levels of 48 percent full
sunlight reaching the forest floor in deciduous forest to nothing when
light levels were 15 percent in boreal forest [<a href="#97">97</a>].  An Oregon study
along a gradient from red alder to conifer forest had similar findings
and attributed the difference to light levels [<a href="#28">28</a>].  S. racemosa ssp.
pubens would seem to be restricted to a seral role in dense, coniferous
forest but could be part of a climax deciduous forest community
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
In southern Quebec, Sambucus racemosa ssp. pubens flowers from April to
July, its fruit ripens from June to August, and its seed is dispersed
from June to November [<a href="#66">66</a>].  In the subalpine fir/beadlily (Abies
lasiocarpa/Clintonia uniflora) habitat type in northwestern Montana,
flowering is in early June with fruit set at the end of June to early
July.  Fruit ripens by late July to early August, and seed dispersal is
in September and October [<a href="#121">121</a>].  Flowering in Alaska is from May to July,
with fruit maturing in July and August [<a href="#113">113</a>].  In West Virginia fruit
ripens in early July and is dispersed by late August [<a href="#77">77</a>].  In Utah var.
microbotrys begins growth in early June, and flower buds begin to open
from mid-June to early July.  Fruits and seeds mature between late July
and mid-August [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Flowering times for S. racemosa ssp. pubens in some western states are
as follows [<a href="#20">20</a>]:

Pacific Northwest are as follows [<a href="#42">42</a>]:

    var. melanocarpa blooms from May to July
    var. arborescens blooms from March to July

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Sambucus racemosa ssp. pubens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
S. racemosa ssp. pubens can resprout from rhizomes or rootcrowns
following fire [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>].  It also has the ability to store seed in
seed banks so that viable seeds can germinate following fire or other
disturbance even if plants are absent from the prefire stand
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tree with adventitious-bud root crown/soboliferous species root sucker
   Rhizomatous shrub, rhizome in soil
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<pre><center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Sambucus racemosa ssp. pubens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire effects vary with the season, severity and intensity of fire, site
characteristics, and the age and vigor of the plants.  However, fire
generally kills aboveground parts of S. racemosa ssp. pubens which
resprouts [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>].  Sprouting can occur from dormant buds on the stems
following a very light fire.  If stem buds are killed in a higher
severity fire, sprouting can occur from rhizome or rootcrown buds,
depending on the variety [<a href="#12">12</a>].  A very severe fire might expose and kill
the rhizome or rootcrown and thus the plant.  Fire also scarifies buried
seed, and germination usually occurs the first growing season following
the fire [<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
All S. racemosa ssp. pubens varieties can survive either by sprouting
from rootcrowns or rhizomes, or by colonizing a site from seed stored in
seed banks [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Repeated fires may reduce elderberries [<a href="#71">71</a>].  Because
of its quick resprouting, S. racemosa ssp. pubens had the third largest
volume of all shrubs by the second year following prescribed fire in
central Idaho [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  Most studies simply record the presence of S.
racemosa ssp. pubens after fire, so few details of its precise fire
response are available [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>].

Variety arborescens responds most vigorously from buried seed
[<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>].  In Oregon, for example, clear cutting and spraying
with 2,4,5-T resulted in 650 seedlings per acre on north aspects
(1606/hectare) and 40 seedlings per acre (99/hectare) on south aspects.
The same site was then burned, resulting in 1,640 seedlings per acre
(4,052/hectare) on north aspects and 2,240 seedlings per acre
(5,535/hectare) on south aspects [<a href="#104">104</a>].  A coastal British Columbia study
only recorded the presence of var. arborescens early in succession [<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Browsing:  S. racemosa ssp. pubens appears to be well adapted to both
fire and browsing.  Postfire data from a 1936 fire in an aspen-paper
birch (Populus tremuloides-Betula papyrifera) community are presented
below [<a href="#88">88</a>].

 Year      Exclosure (no browsing)        Control (browsing by moose)
          Stems/acre   Stems/hectare      Stems/acre    Stems/hectare

 1949        13.4           33               10.1            25
 1966        23.5           58               16.6            41
 1982         6.5           16               23.5            58

Apparently fire stimulated regeneration of S. racemosa ssp. pubens.
Without browsing, it increased until it was overtopped by aspen and
paper birch, then began to decline.  With browsing it increased more
slowly, but browsing kept overall stem density and height reduced, and
S.  racemosa ssp. pubens was still increasing in density 46 years after
the fire.

Competition:  On moist sites along the Oregon coast var. arborescens and
var. melanocarpa may be part of a postfire seral shrub community that
severely competes with tree seedlings, although elderberries are seldom
primary competitors [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>].  Ruth [<a href="#92">92</a>] suggests first piling
slash in brush areas to increase fuels, then burning and planting tree
seedlings to give them a head start.  He also suggests that chemicals
may offer some control and that slashing competing vegetation may
release tree seedlings.  Combinations of chemicals, mechanical
treatment, and fire apparently increased the number of S. racemosa ssp.
pubens seedlings [<a href="#50">50</a>].  The same problem occurs on moist sites in
British Columbia, and immediate planting on those sites is recommended
since few seral shrubs are present before burning [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Burning before
harvest to induce shrub sprouting and seed germination in Oregon
brushfields, then burning again to kill those seedlings and sprouts, has
also been suggested [<a href="#62">62</a>].
