<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Berberis nervosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
In many parts of the Pacific Northwest, Douglas-fir-western
hemlock/dwarf Oregon-grape and western hemlock/dwarf Oregon-grape-salal
habitat types provide important big game wintering areas [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].
Stands often offer good structural diversity and remain relatively
snow-free [<a href="#43">43</a>].  However, where dense shrub thickets develop, big game
use may be limited [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Western hemlock/dwarf Oregon-grape-Oregon
oxalis and western hemlock/dwarf Oregon-grape-deerfoot vanillaleaf types
serve as big game summer range [<a href="#43">43</a>].
            
Browse:  In some areas, dwarf Oregon-grape is browsed by black-tailed
deer [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>].  In other locations it is seldom used [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Harcombe [<a href="#37">37</a>]
reported moderate use of dwarf Oregon-grape by Roosevelt elk during
winter but not in the spring or summer [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Various small mammals feed
extensively on the foliage.  It is, for example, an extremely important
dietary component of the white-footed vole in the Coast Ranges of Oregon
[<a href="#88">88</a>].  Dwarf Oregon-grape comprised 32 percent of the vole's diet in
February but declined to 17 percent by June.  The value of dwarf
Oregon-grape browse to domestic livestock is apparently low in most
locations.  Utilization by domestic sheep in the Cascade Ranges in
Washington may reach 6.8 to 23.7 percent [<a href="#49">49</a>].  The fruits are readily
eaten by many small birds [<a href="#63">63</a>] and mammals.  In some areas, black-tailed
deer also eat the fruits [<a href="#12">12</a>].  The nectar of several species within the
genus Berberis is favored by the Anna's hummingbird [<a href="#55">55</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Dwarf Oregon-grape browse is relatively low in palatability to most big
game species and domestic livestock [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].  The fruit is palatable to
a wide range of birds and mammals.


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Browse:  The nutrient content of dwarf Oregon-grape browse has been
documented as follows [<a href="#76">76</a>]:

                  average percent by weight -

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Dwarf Oregon-grape presumably provides cover for small birds and
mammals.  The diverse structure of western hemlock/dwarf
Oregon-grape-salal types provides good big game hiding cover [<a href="#2">2</a>].
Pacific silver fir/dwarf Oregon-grape and western hemlock/dwarf
Oregon-grape-Oregon oxalis communities offer good thermal cover for deer
and elk [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Dwarf Oregon-grape can be easily propagated from seed and from rhizome
or stem cuttings [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].  However, plants may be slow to establish
[<a href="#56">56</a>].  Detailed information on propagation techniques is available
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Dwarf Oregon-grape fruits are tart but edible [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Native peoples of
the Pacific Northwest traditionally ate the fruits and made medicinal
teas from the boiled roots [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].  Dyes for baskets were also obtained
from the roots [<a href="#35">35</a>].

Dwarf Oregon-grape is a popular ornamental.  It is well suited for shady
locations and is widely planted in gardens throughout the Pacific
Northwest.  Its attractive foliage and short stature make it a
particularly effective border plant [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Although it multiplies well
under cultivation, it does not form dense thickets.  Foliage often turns
a striking reddish-purple in winter after exposure to cold temperatures
[<a href="#81">81</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Timber harvest:  Dwarf Oregon-grape commonly persists on cutover sites
[<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  In many parts of British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest, it
assumes prominence in brushfields made up of such species as salal,
bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum), blackberries and raspberries (Rubus
spp.), fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium), huckleberries (Vaccinium
spp.), and willows (Salix spp.) [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  Brushfield species may compete
with conifer regeneration in some locations [<a href="#43">43</a>].

Biomass:  The green weight of dwarf Oregon-grape has been estimated at
130 pounds per acre (145 kg/ha) in certain western hemlock types of
Oregon [<a href="#43">43</a>].

Grazing:  Grazing by domestic sheep apparently has little effect on
dwarf Oregon-grape [<a href="#49">49</a>].

Chemical control:  Percent frequency following herbicide applications
combined with mechanical treatment or fire in central coastal Oregon was
as follows [<a href="#51">51</a>]:

                  glyphosate        spray and burn          spray and crush

   pretreatment         13               13                        9
   posttreatment        --                3                       --

The effects of various herbicides on Berberis spp. have been considered
in detail [<a href="#10">10</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Berberis nervosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Dwarf Oregon-grape is a low-growing rhizomatous evergreen shrub which
typically reaches 4 to 24 inches in height [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].  On exceptional
sites, plants may grow to 7 feet (2.1 m) [<a href="#81">81</a>].  The simple stems are
ascending to erect and generally occur in loose colonies of several
stems [<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].  Compound leaves are borne in terminal tufts [<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].
Coarsely serrate to spinose, ovate to lance-ovate or acute leaflets
occur in groups of 7 to 21 [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].  Leaflets are dark green, thick,
and leathery [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].  Yellow flowers are borne in erect clusters or
racemes up to 8 inches (21 cm) in length [<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].  The fruit is a
large, dark blue, globose berry with grayish or whitish bloom
[<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].  Berries are 0.3 to 0.4 inch (8-10 mm) in diameter, occur
in clusters [<a href="#35">35</a>], and contain a number of black seeds [<a href="#95">95</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Dwarf Oregon-grape can reproduce from seed or by vegetative means.

Seed:  Seed of most Oregon-grapes exhibit internal dormancy and require
cold stratification for germination.  However, in certain laboratory
tests, dwarf Oregon-grape seed did not germinate after 90 days of cold
stratification [<a href="#75">75</a>].  Results of other studies indicate that seed will
germinate if sown immediately or if stratified and planted in the spring
[<a href="#15">15</a>].  Maximum germination capacity in laboratory tests was estimated at
77 percent [<a href="#75">75</a>].  Under natural conditions, seeds of most species within
the genus germinate during the spring [<a href="#15">15</a>].  The role of sexual
reproduction on disturbed sites is poorly known [<a href="#32">32</a>].

Vegetative regeneration:  Dwarf Oregon-grape is rhizomatous [<a href="#47">47</a>] and
gradually expands laterally in the absence of disturbance.  Layering has
also been reported [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Plants generally sprout from rhizomes or
"creeping rootstocks" after aboveground portions of the plant are
destroyed [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>].  Vegetative regeneration appears to be the
dominant mode of regeneration after fire or other disturbances [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Dwarf Oregon-grape occurs across a wide range of habitats in submontane
to montane forests of the Pacific Northwest [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  It is a
characteristic shrub of spruce-fir forests [<a href="#14">14</a>] but also occurs in
northern coastal coniferous forests and in redwood, mixed evergreen, and
bottomland forests [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>].  In Pacific silver fir communities, dwarf
Oregon-grape is generally restricted to warm, dry sites.  In old-growth
Douglas-fir stands of northwestern Oregon, it reaches greatest abundance
on relatively dry sites [<a href="#82">82</a>].  This shrub occurs on dry to fairly moist
sites in western hemlock types but reaches greatest abundance on warmer
sites [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].  Dwarf Oregon-grape is also common in the warmer
Port-Orford-cedar communities [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Dwarf Oregon-grape commonly grows as scattered, or abundant, individuals
but can dominate the understory of semiopen forests [<a href="#54">54</a>].  It frequently
forms "lush carpets" in open meadows bordering coniferous stands [<a href="#71">71</a>]
and commonly persists in coastal brushfields created by timber harvest
[<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  Dwarf Oregon-grape grows well in sun or shade [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>].

Plant associates:  Common overstory associates in addition to those
mentioned above include Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia), Sitka spruce
(Picea sitchensis), and tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflora)
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>].  In spruce-fir forests, dwarf Oregon grape grows
with understory species such as twinflower, rhododendron (Rhododendron
spp.), and queencup beadlily (Clintonia uniflora).  Beargrass
(Xerophyllum tenax) occurs on drier sites [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Common associates in
Douglas-fir or western hemlock forests include oceanspray, trailing
blackberry (Rubus ursinus), red huckleberry (Vaccinium parvifolium),
Alaska huckleberry, salal, Pacific rhododendron, vine maple, broadleaf
starflower (Trientalis latifolia), and mosses such as Kindbergia oregana
[<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].  Old-growth stands are often characterized by a
depauperate understory [<a href="#48">48</a>].  In redwood (Sequoia sempervirens)
communities, western swordfern, salal, Oregon oxalis, and redwood violet
(Viola sempervirens) are common associates [<a href="#60">60</a>].

Soils:  Dwarf Oregon-grape grows well on a variety of soil types [<a href="#70">70</a>]
including coarse, shallow rocky soils, coarse alluvium, or glacial
outwash [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Soils are well drained to poorly drained, and dry to
fresh [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].  Soils are derived from a wide range of parent
material including basalt and metavolcanics, sandstone, siltstone,
diorite, and gabbro [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>].  Good growth has been reported on
acidic to moderately alkaline or even somewhat saline soils [<a href="#70">70</a>].

Climate:  Dwarf Oregon-grape grows in maritime to submaritime climates.
Growing seasons are fairly long [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Some sites experience summer
drought [<a href="#43">43</a>].

Elevation:  Dwarf Oregon-grape grows at low to middle elevations
[<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>].  In California, it is restricted to sites below 6,000 feet
(1,829 m) [<a href="#69">69</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Dwarf Oregon-grape is an important component of both seral and climax
communities of the Pacific Northwest.  It occurs in recent clearcuts as
well as in stands 300 to 600 years or older [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].  It is a woody
survivor or residual colonizer, generally increasing dramatically after
low intensity disturbances such as light fires [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>].  It commonly
persists on cutover [<a href="#54">54</a>] or lightly burned sites.  Residual survivors
sprouted soon after the eruption of Mount St. Helens [<a href="#34">34</a>] and were
particularly evident in protected microsites such as near the bases or
rootwads of trees.  The intensity of disturbance, and of fires in
particular, exerts a great influence on dwarf Oregon-grape [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  In
many areas, it codominates a site soon after light-severity disturbance
but may decline in early seral stages when it is overtopped by rapidly
growing conifer seedlings [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].

Annuals and weedy invaders commonly dominate early seral stages where
disturbance has been intense [<a href="#58">58</a>].  Fireweed and wood groundsel (Senecio
sylvaticus) assume dominance during the first 1 to 3 years on many
intensely disturbed sites [<a href="#71">71</a>].  Perennials such as dwarf Oregon-grape
may not become prominent on intensely burned sites until midsuccessional
stages.  In some areas, 30 to 40 years or more may be required before
maximum abundance of dwarf Oregon-grape is reached [<a href="#79">79</a>].  It does not
attain maximum cover until later seral stages in many western
redcedar-western hemlock-Douglas-fir forests of thge Cascade Ranges of
Oregon and Washington [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>]. 

Dwarf Oregon-grape can assume importance in shrub-dominated stages which
develop 4 to 5 years after disturbance in western hemlock forests of the
Pacific Northwest [<a href="#24">24</a>], and can achieve peak abundance within 5 to 10
years after fire in many parts of this region [<a href="#32">32</a>].  In the central
Oregon Coast Ranges, is exhibits rapid regrowth and shares understory
dominance in 7- to 50-year-old forests [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Dwarf Oregon-grape is tolerant of shade and can complete its life cycle
even in dense forests of the Pacific Northwest [<a href="#73">73</a>].  In the Coast
Ranges of central Oregon, it dominates many old-growth western
hemlock-western redcedar forest understories [<a href="#7">7</a>].  It is also an
important component of many climatic or topoedaphic climax western
hemlock communities [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Many seral Douglas-fir/dwarf
Oregon-grape communities ultimately give rise to climax western hemlock
types [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>] as Douglas-fir declines late in succession [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Late
seral Douglas-fir/vine maple-dwarf Oregon-grape communities become
climax western hemlock-Pacific rhododendron-dwarf Oregon-grape
communities [<a href="#24">24</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Berberis nervosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Dwarf Oregon-grape persists in closed forest stands with
long fire-free intervals.  However, as a residual survivor, it is also
well-adapted to a regime of "relatively frequent surface fires" such as
those common in certain Douglas-fir-western hemlock/dwarf Oregon-grape
types of Oregon [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Fire intervals in Douglas-fir-western hemlock
forest inhabited by dwarf Oregon-grape commonly range from 137 to 320
years [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].  Fire intervals in other forest types occupied by dwarf
Oregon-grape have been estimated as follows in Desolation Peaks,
Washington [<a href="#1">1</a>]:

      ponderosa pine-Douglas-fir          52 years
      lodgepole pine-Douglas-fir          76 years
      Douglas-fir-grand fir               93 years
      Douglas-fir-Pacific silver fir      108 years   

Fire can produce gaps in old-growth redwood forests which are conducive
to dwarf Oregon-grape growth [<a href="#60">60</a>].

Dwarf Oregon-grape commonly sprouts and grows vigorously after fire [<a href="#74">74</a>].
Reestablishment through seed may occur, although vegetative regeneration
is the dominant mode of postfire establishment [<a href="#32">32</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Berberis nervosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Dwarf Oregon-grape is moderately damaged by light- to moderate-severity
fires [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Underground regenerative structures often survive even if
aboveground portions are consumed by fire [<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>



<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Dwarf Oregon-grape often sprouts from underground rhizomes after
aboveground portions of the plant are killed [<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>].  However, response
varies with fire intensity, severity [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>], and season.  Atzet and
Wheeler [<a href="#4">4</a>] noted sprouts after light-severity fires but did not observe
sprouting after moderate-severity fires.  Seedling establishment after
fire has not been documented [<a href="#32">32</a>] and may be insignificant.

Postfire recovery:  Postfire reestablishment and growth of dwarf
Oregon-grape is often rapid [<a href="#74">74</a>].  In western Washington, sprouts are
commonly observed soon after fire [<a href="#53">53</a>].  Under some circumstances cover
may equal or exceed that of prefire levels within several years [<a href="#65">65</a>].
Dwarf Oregon-grape cover 9 years after slash burning near Oakridge,
Oregon, surpassed that of adjacent unburned plots [<a href="#83">83</a>].

Dwarf Oregon-grape abundance may not peak until mid- to late seral
stages, particularly after hot fires [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Recovery can be slow after
moderate to hot fires that damage or kill portions of underground
rhizomes.  Few dwarf Oregon-grape were present by the third growing
season after a moderate fire in coastal British Columbia [<a href="#58">58</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Recovery of dwarf Oregon-grape after July, 1970 wildfires in North
Cascades National Park was as follows [<a href="#65">65</a>]:

                  1971              1972              1974

<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Timber harvest:  Dwarf Oregon-grape commonly exhibits dramatic
reductions soon after timber harvest and subsequent slash fires in
western hemlock-western redcedar-Douglas-fir forests of the Cascade
Ranges, but then often undergoes a dramatic recovery [<a href="#32">32</a>].  In some
areas, dwarf Oregon-grape cover has tripled during the first 5 years
after logging and slash fires [<a href="#17">17</a>].  However, initial recovery may be
fairly slow on some sites [<a href="#91">91</a>].  Posttreatment cover is presumably
related to a number of factors including fire intensity and severity,
season of fire, and site characteristics.  Dwarf Oregon-grape commonly
reaches greatest abundance during secondary succession [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Abundance
peaked at 30 to 40 years after clearcutting, broadcast burning, and
planting in western hemlock-Douglas-fir forests of the western Cascades
[<a href="#79">79</a>].  Posttreatment recovery was as follows [<a href="#79">79</a>]:

                      years since treatment
                        (percent cover)

  2     5     10     15     20     30     40     undisturbed old growth

1.88  5.04   4.22   9.48  6.98  22.18  20.97            11.52

Posttreatment response of dwarf Oregon-grape has been documented in a
number of other studies [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>].

Fuels:  Many dwarf Oregon-grape communities are characterized by low to
medium fuel levels [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Prescribed fire:  Prescribed fire in Pacific rhododendron-dwarf
Oregon-grape communities can greatly increase herb and shrub production
[<a href="#26">26</a>].

On plot 7, dwarf Oregon-grape had not regained vigor within 3 years
after fire.


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS : </b>
Dwarf Oregon-grape and others shrubs are more likely to dominate early
seral stages after fires of low intensity.  Damage or destruction of
underground regenerative structures is more probable after severe fires
and can result in a slow recovery.  Shrubs in general are less severely
harmed by fires in early spring or late fall when carbohydrate reserves
are still concentrated in the roots than by fires occurring during
growth periods.
