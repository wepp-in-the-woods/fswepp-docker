<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Livestock:  Whitepoint locoweed causes locoism in all classes of
livestock [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  The toxin in locoweed is an indolizidine alkaloid,
swainsonine, that causes chronic neurological damage [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Livestock
must consume large amounts of whitepoint locoweed for 1 to 3 months
before death occurs.  Signs of poisoning will appear after 2 to 3 weeks
of continuous grazing [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Symptoms are as follows:  rough coats,
nervous disorders such as trembling and paralysis, uncoordinated muscle
movements, blindness, constipation, and emaciation [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Most cattle will readily graze whitepoint locoweed in the spring when
grass is scarce.  Sheep and cattle can become chemically addicted to
whitepoint locoweed and will continue to graze it when grass becomes
abundant.  They are, however, more resistant than horses to its toxic
effects [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Horses never recover once poisoned.  Cattle gain
weight slowly and often have abortions, while sheep have a high number
of abortions after grazing whitepoint locoweed [<a href="#43">43</a>].

On high mountain ranges, whitepoint locoweed has been identified as a
predisposing factor in high mountain brisket disease, or congestive
right-sided heart failure, in cattle [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

Wildlife:  Whitepoint locoweed is poisonous to deer and elk if consumed
in large quantities [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Whitepoint locoweed is a minor component in
the diet of desert cottontails.  Greatest utilization is in the spring
and summer, when whitepoint locoweed is the most succulent [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Immature whitepoint locoweed seed pods are palatable and voluntarily
selected by free-ranging cattle during the normal grazing season [<a href="#22">22</a>].
The reproductive heads of locoweed are preferred and readily consumed
even when other forage species are abundant [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Palatability ratings for whitepoint locoweed from selected western
states are as follows [<a href="#3">3</a>]:

                      WY       UT       CO       MT

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
All parts of whitepoint locoweed plants are toxic, and plants are
poisonous at all stages of growth.  It loses little toxicity after 3
years of storage [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Swainsonine inhibits the enzyme
alpha-mannosidase which is essential in the metabolism of glycoproteins
[<a href="#22">22</a>].

Relative magnitude of alkaloid concentration and nutrients (percent of
dry weight) in whitepoint locoweed are as follows [<a href="#29">29</a>]:

In a study in northwestern Utah. percent of loco heads (flowers and
pods) grazed was 26 percent after the first 2 weeks of the grazing
season and increased to 69 percent by the end of the 7-week grazing
season [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Energy value and protein value for whitepoint locoweed are poor [<a href="#3">3</a>].

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>

<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Locoweed poisoning of livestock is the most widespread poisonous plant
problem in the western United States [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Whitepoint locoweed
increases in abundance in response to excessive grazing [<a href="#16">16</a>].  When
there is a shortage of palatable, nonpoisonous forage, animals will
consume more locoweed [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Eradication of whitepoint locoweed over
large areas is seldom possible.  Vegetation manipulation should be
integrated with livestock management programs that minimize the intake
of whitepoint locoweed [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Aversive conditioning of livestock to
avoid whitepoint locoweed may be effective in reducing livestock losses
[<a href="#29">29</a>].  A three-herd, four-pasture rotation system that involves grazing
animals for 6 weeks to 2 months in July and August has reduced the risk
of whitepoint locoweed intoxication in the Raft River Mountains of Utah
[<a href="#31">31</a>].

Selective herbicide control may be necessary to reduce whitepoint
locoweed [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Picloram, dicamba, and 2,4-D are effective on whitepoint
locoweed if sprayed when plants are actively growing in early summer
before they reach the bud stage [<a href="#43">43</a>].  An ester of 2,4-D was sprayed on
whitepoint locoweed on a rangeland in northwest Utah in 1969.
Whitepoint locoweed established to pretreatment levels by 1978 [<a href="#26">26</a>].
When aerially sprayed with 2,4-D in 1981, all plants were killed on
deeper soils, but some remained on shallower soils [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Whitepoint locoweed fixes atmospheric nitrogen.  It has potential to add
significant amounts of nitrogen to forest sites in the Inland Northwest
because of its nitrogen-fixing ability [<a href="#13">13</a>].  However, whitepoint
locoweed seedlings compete with conifer tree seedlings on many sites
[<a href="#13">13</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Oxytropis sericea
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Whitepoint locoweed is a native, perennial, leguminous forb that grows
from 6 to 12 inches (15.2-30.4 cm) tall [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  Leaves are 1.6 to 8
inches (4-20 cm) long [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Legumes are erect, oblong, or ovoid-oblong
and are 0.4 to 1.0 inch (1-2.5 cm) long [<a href="#35">35</a>].  One plant may have many
flowering stalks, each with 6 to 27 flowers [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Each flower produces
many seeds.  Whitepoint locoweed has a long taproot [<a href="#30">30</a>].




<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Whitepoint locoweed reproduces sexually from kidney-shaped seed.  Seed
pods are hairy and leatherlike [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Seeds have hard, impermeable seed
coats and remain viable in the soil for many years.  A large, dormant
seed reserve is retained in the soil to permit exploitation of favorable
environmental conditions [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Whitepoint locoweed occurs on open, well-drained slopes of the western
plains, the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, and grassy subalpine
openings bordered by open wooded hillsides or coniferous forests
[<a href="#410">410</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  It is infrequent to common on prairie uplands, streambanks,
valleys, and alpine sites [<a href="#35">35</a>].

Whitepoint locoweed occurs on sandy, gravelly, or rocky soils but grows
best on sandy loams.  It is tolerant of moderately saline soils and low
nutrient conditions but does not tolerate water-saturated soils such as
heavy clay [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Whitepoint locoweed is drought tolerant but is not
tolerant of excessive shade.  It is tolerant to freezing temperatures
during the growing season and competes well on nutrient-rich, deep loam
on subalpine sites [<a href="#30">30</a>].

Whitepoint locoweed has adapted a stress-tolerant survival strategy
characteristic of plants in arctic and alpine habitats.  It has a large
seedbank that remains viable for many years.  Its principal stresses are
low temperatures, desiccating effects of strong winds on rocky slopes,
intense solar radiation, and mineral nutrient deficiencies [<a href="#30">30</a>].

Whitepoint locoweed thrives at medium elevations but grows at elevations
up to 11,000 feet (3,708 m) in Colorado [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Regional elevation
distributions are as follows [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>]:

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Whitepoint locoweed is an important colonizer following disturbance on
western rangelands [<a href="#26">26</a>].  It also occurs in climax meadow and sagebrush
steppe communities.
  


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Whitepoint locoweed is one of the first species to commence growth in
early spring on many western rangelands.  Growth begins in early April
and plants remain green and succulent throughout the summer [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].
First bloom for whitepoint locoweed occurs in mid-June to early July.
Seed dissemination begins in mid-July and lasts until mid-August [<a href="#22">22</a>].
The plant begins to dry in late September.  

Some reported dates for anthesis in some western states are as follows
[<a href="#3">3</a>]:

          Utah                    May-July
          Colorado                May-August

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
No specific fire information was available in the literature regarding
whitepoint locoweed.  The seeds of this species are hard and impermeable

the soil are often scarified by fire and released for germination [<a href="#8">8</a>].
