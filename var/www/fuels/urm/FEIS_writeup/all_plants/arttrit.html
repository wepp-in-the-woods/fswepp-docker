The scientific name of basin big sagebrush 
is <i>Artemisia tridentata</i> Nutt. ssp. <i>tridentata</i> 
(Asteraceae) [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  Genotypic and phenotypic variation is common in basin
big sagebrush.  Both diploid and tetraploid
plants occur, but diploids are most common [<a href="#4">4</a>]. At
least 4 or 5 subspecies of big sagebrush <i>(A. tridentata)</i> 
have been identified [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  Kartesz [<a href="#62">62</a>] recognizes the 
following subspecies:<br><br>

<i>A. tridentata</i> ssp. <i>tridentata</i> - basin big sagebrush<br>
<i>A. tridentata</i> ssp. <i>spiciformis</i>  (Osterhout) Kartesz & Gandhi - big sagebrush<br>
<i>A. tridentata</i> ssp. <i>vaseyana</i> (Rydb.) Beetle - mountain big sagebrush<br>
<i>A. tridentata</i> ssp. <i>wyomingensis</i> Beetle & Young - Wyoming big sagebrush<br>
<i>A. tridentata</i> ssp. <i>xericensis</i> Winward ex Rosentreter & R. Kelsey - big sagebrush<br>

Freeman and others [<a href="#39">39</a>] suggest
"each subspecies is distinct in pure stands, but at 
contact points introgression may blur the distinctions."  
Ecotypes occur in each subspecies [<a href="#73">73</a>].

</p>
<p>

Hybrids between basin big sagebrush and mountain
big sagebrush have been confirmed [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].  "Hybrid zones" exist 
between these 2 subspecies in parts of Utah [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>]. In 
southeastern Idaho, introgression between
the 2 subspecies is common [<a href="#94">94</a>].  
The "hybrid zone" which occurs across a narrow elevational 
band between the 2 parent taxa
is believed to be stable.  In Utah, it is generally less
than 0.6 miles (1 km) wide and in some locations, less than 330 feet (100 m) wide 
[<a href="#40">40</a>]. Hybrids between basin big sagebrush
and mountain big sagebrush are intermediate for all characters 
and exhibit considerable genetic variation 
[<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>].</p>

Big sagebrush is one of the most widespread and economically
important shrubs in 
western North America [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Basin big 
sagebrush is the most extensive in distribution and range
of variation in the Great Basin and Columbia Plateau [<a href="#108">108</a>].  
It is distributed from 
Washington east to the Dakotas and south to California, Arizona, 
and New Mexico [<a href="#114">114</a>].

Basin big sagebrush is found from the floor of the Great Basin
to upper timberline, although it is not abundant in all zones
[<a href="#108">108</a>].  It occurs in relatively small stands east of the 
Cascades in Oregon [<a href="#117">117</a>].</p>

Considerable quantities of big sagebrush are eaten by 
sage grouse, mule deer, and pronghorn [<a href="#92">92</a>].  
In southwestern Montana, basin big sagebrush is browsed by elk 
and mule deer from autumn through early spring [<a href="#104">104</a>].  In parts of Montana, mule deer use, 
but do not prefer basin big sagebrush [<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>].  
In Oregon, mule deer showed an 
intermediate preference for basin big sagebrush in winter feeding
trials.  In fall trials, mule deer used, but did 
not prefer basin big sagebrush.  Mule deer use of basin big sagebrush in
Oregon is, in general, described as "intermediate" [<a href="#93">93</a>].  
For mule deer in Utah, basin big sagebrush is 
the least preferred of all subspecies of big sagebrush [<a href="#111">111</a>].  
In some instances, mule deer preference of basin
big sagebrush varies greatly by local population [<a href="#112">112</a>].
<p>

Pygmy rabbits forage extensively on big sagebrush [<a href="#110">110</a>].  Pygmy rabbits feed on basin big sagebrush but
show preference for certain accessions [<a href="#112">112</a>].</p>
<p>

Basin big sagebrush generally is not preferred by 
sage grouse; however, the birds 
do exhibit preferences for certain individual plants.  
Sage grouse readily feed on basin big sagebrush
where mountain and Wyoming big sagebrush are absent [<a href="#112">112</a>].</p>
<p>

In fall, domestic sheep in Oregon fed on basin big sagebrush to 
a limited degree.  During the winter months,
the sheep exhibited a "moderate preference for basin big sagebrush."  In general, domestic sheep preference for
basin big sagebrush in Oregon is described as "low" [<a href="#93">93</a>].  
In Utah, some accessions (mostly tetraploid) 
of basin big sagebrush were preferred by 
domestic sheep [<a href="#111">111</a>].</p>
<p>

Basin big sagebrush may serve as emergency food 
during severe winter weather, but it is not 
usually sought out by livestock or wildlife [<a href="#7">7</a>].  
However, researchers emphasize that although basin 
big sagebrush is not preferred by 
wildlife, it is nevertheless, 
heavily used particularly during winter 
when preferred taxa are not available.  In southwestern Montana, winter leader use by
mule deer ranged from 4% to 71% [<a href="#105">105</a>].</p>

<p class="subframeText">

Basin big sagebrush shows high potential for range
restoration and soil stabilization [<a href="#66">66</a>].
Big sagebrush grows rapidly and spreads readily from seed.  Seed
can be broadcast or drilled [<a href="#92">92</a>].  It is important
to select basin big sagebrush seed adapted to the specific site
[<a href="#73">73</a>].  Studies indicate that seedling
survival is much higher for seed collections planted in a habitat
similar to that of the parent population 
[<a href="#75">75</a>].
<p>

Transplant
stock can also be used in rehabilitation projects [<a href="#92">92</a>].  
Seedlings are easily transplanted and may be used to stabilize gullies and 
eroded hillsides.  Transplants reproduce and begin to spread from 
seed in 3 to 7 years [<a href="#86">86</a>].</p>
<p>

Sagebrush species are associated with mycorrhizal fungus in the genus 
<i>Glomus</i>.  The presence of these fungi may be required 
for the successful establishment of seedlings.  Areas that lose 
their sagebrush cover due to frequent fire and are dominated 
subsequently by nonmycorrhizal cheatgrass may no longer have 
the fungi in the soil.  Sagebrush reestablishment may be 
inhibited on these sites [<a href="#88">88</a>].</p>

<p class="subframeText">
Management of sagebrush can include regulating animal numbers
to levels the plants can tolerate [<a href="#105">105</a>].  
Excessive fall use by domestic sheep can sometimes kill
big sagebrush [<a href="#82">82</a>].
<p>


The shelter basin big sagebrush provides livestock and 
wildlife can be evaluated when management options 
are considered.  Its usefulness as wind and sun protection may 
exceed any benefits gained by its removal.  When basin big sagebrush
is removed from drainages, soil erosion can become a problem
[<a href="#51">51</a>].</p>
<p>

Big sagebrush can be controlled by burning or with herbicides. Big 
sagebrush can be controlled with herbicides although variable 
results have been reported [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Tebuthiuron, 2,4-D,
and 2,4,5-T have been effective in killing big 
sagebrush [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>].  Success depends on such factors as rates of application, dates of
spraying, and types of carriers used [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].  In 
eastern Oregon, mid-season applications (late May-early June) were
most injurious to big sagebrush [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Similarly in California, best
control was obtained when plants were treated from late May through
mid-June [<a href="#27">27</a>].  In Wyoming, Hull and others [<a href="#53">53</a>] reported that
diesel oil carriers were more effective than applications with water.  Both
aerial and ground applications are effective in controlling big
sagebrush [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].</p>
<p>   

Length of big sagebrush control is highly variable.  In Wyoming,
Thilenius and Brown [<a href="#97">97</a>] observed some big sagebrush reinvasion within
10 years after herbicide applications.  Deferment from cattle
grazing for as long as 3 years after big sagebrush control had no effect
on herbage production.  However, Johnson [<a href="#61">61</a>] reported 
that it is important to manage grazing after sagebrush spraying.  Caution
should be used where big sagebrush provides habitat for sage grouse.  Klebenow [<a href="#63">63</a>]
found that herbicide application was detrimental to sage grouse 
populations.</p>

<br>
Basin big sagebrush is an erect, rounded or somewhat 
spreading evergreen shrub 
which normally grows 3 to 10 feet 
(1-2 m) in height [<a href="#110">110</a>].  It occasionally occurs as a dwarf shrub 
or can be treelike in 
appearance, reaching a height of 16 feet (5 m). Maximum 
stature is reached on deep, well-drained soils in
sheltered areas.  Variability in plant height occurs
along a moisture gradient, with larger plants occurring
on more mesic sites [<a href="#6">6</a>].  

<p>
Basin big sagebrush has a multistemmed form 
with a relatively thick trunk and an irregular crown.  It is
often characterized by a discernible main trunk [<a href="#44">44</a>]. It 
commonly reaches 40 to 50 years of age, and some plants may 
exceed 100 years.  Slow-growing individuals on unfavorable 
sites attain the greatest age.</p>

<p>
The root systems of all subspecies of big sagebrush are well 
adapted to extract moisture from both shallow and deep 
portions of the soil profile.  This makes them highly 
competitive with associated grasses and
forbs [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>].</p>

<p>
Basin big sagebrush exhibits greater plant height, crown cover,
production, and annual leader growth than Wyoming big sagebrush

Basin big sagebrush reproduces from seed.  None of the 
subspecies of big sagebrush resprout after fire or
other disturbance [<a href="#93">93</a>].  Flowers are self- or
wind-pollinated [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>].  Plants 2 to 3 years of 
age are capable of producing viable seed.  
Approximately 90% of big sagebrush seed is dispersed within 
30 feet (9 m) of the parent shrub [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Few seeds are carried more than 
100 feet (30 m) [<a href="#94">94</a>].  Density falls off rapidly away from 
the parent shrub, with maximum seed dispersal at 
approximately 108 feet (33 m) [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>].  
The rate of seed dispersal depends on wind and storm activity
after seeds reach maturity [<a href="#94">94</a>].  

<p>
Wind is the primary dispersal agent, although animal and
water dispersal can also occur.  Animals can serve as a minor dispersal
agent when seeds are dislodged as the animals brush against 
branches.  Seeds of big sagebrush
contain a small air space which permits floatation in water.  Rates of 
seed dispersal are slower in basin big sagebrush than in other
subspecies.  Seed dispersal takes approximately 8 weeks 
[<a href="#94">94</a>].  Seed of basin big sagebrush
is short-lived and lasts less than 5 years when stored in 
a warehouse [<a href="#77">77</a>].  Some seedbanking occurs in other subspecies
of big sagebrush [<a href="#74">74</a>], so seedbanking in basin big sagebrush
is probable. Some basin big sagebrush seeds remained viable
after prescribed burning in Utah. Emergence 
of basin big sagebrush seedlings on burned soil
was reduced, however, compared to emergence of Wyoming and mountain 
big sagebrush. It was also reduced compared to emergence of basin big sagebrush
on unburned control soil [<a href="#26">26</a>].</p>

<p>
Germination may occur during winter or even late fall at mild 
winter sites such as the Mojave Desert, but
at cold winter sites, it may be delayed until snowmelt [<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>].</p>

<p>  
Big sagebrush seeds germinate within a
wide range of temperature.  Rates of 
germination of unstratified seed vary according to 
temperature, with
basin big sagebrush requiring 2 to 3 days at all temperatures 
[<a href="#72">72</a>].   According to Meyer and others [<a href="#77">77</a>],
big basin sagebrush seed from cold winter populations germinate
much more slowly at near-freezing temperatures than do seeds from
warm winter populations and also exhibit dormancy under 
autumn temperature regimes.  Basin big
sagebrush also shows annual variation in germination [<a href="#48">48</a>].
Basin big 
sagebrush is a more prolific seed producer than is Wyoming
big sagebrush [<a href="#76">76</a>].  Studies suggest that sufficient basin big 
sagebrush seed was present for
adequate germination each year even at the lowest germination
rates observed [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Specific details
on germination rates are available [<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>].</p>

<p>
Seedlings emerge in early spring soon after snowmelt [<a href="#75">75</a>].
Seedling survival often depends on 
precipitation.  Seedlings under 
mature sagebrush plants
are more likely to survive [<a href="#83">83</a>].  Seedling
survival tends to be lower in grazed, unsheltered areas 
[<a href="#85">85</a>].</p>

<br>

Basin big sagebrush grows in relatively more mesic habitats than 
other subspecies of big sagebrush [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].  It commonly
grows on well-drained 
soils in valley bottoms, lower foothill areas or in areas
adjacent to drainages.  Basin big sagebrush
is associated with deep, seasonally dry, well-drained soils on
plains, valleys, and foothills [<a href="#5">5</a>].  It frequently
coincides with high water tables or deep moisture accumulations
[<a href="#96">96</a>].

<p>
Basin big sagebrush occurs on stratified
sandy loam soils on floodplains or on low stream terraces 
[<a href="#53">53</a>].  In southeastern Idaho, basin big sagebrush
is most abundant on sandy soils or at the sandy end of a 
soil texture gradient [<a href="#96">96</a>].</p>

<p>
Because it 
tends to grow in deep, fertile soils, basin big sagebrush 
is an indicator of productive sites.  Many sites once 
dominated by basin big sagebrush are now farmland [<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>].  
In farmlands, it is now
restricted primarily to field edges, swales, and along drainage
ways [<a href="#24">24</a>].</p>

<p> 
Precipitation on 
basin big sagebrush sites ranges from 10 to 18 inches
(250-460 mm) per year [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Basin big sagebrush is considered 
intolerant of alkaline conditions, but some ecotypes do 
grow in association with salt-tolerant plants such as 
shadscale (<i>Atriplex confertifolia</i>), black
greasewood (<i>Sarcobatus vermiculatus</i>), and saltgrass 
(<i>Distichlis</i> spp.) [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  In Utah sites occupied
by basin big sagebrush tend to be slightly alkaline whereas those
occupied by mountain big sagebrush tend to be slightly 
acidic [<a href="#108">108</a>].</p>

<p>
Elevational ranges are as follows [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>]:<br><br>

    
 4,800-5,800 feet (1463-1768 m) in Arizona <br>
 100-7,000 feet (30-2134 m) in Oregon<br> 
 2,001-7,019 feet (610-2140 m) in northeastern Utah</p>

Big sagebrush is the climax species on most of its present
day range [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Research suggests that invasion
into other vegetation types was uncommon 
[<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>].  Humphrey [<a href="#57">57</a>]
describes big sagebrush as a "late successional" species
in southeastern Idaho.

<p>
Basin big sagebrush may increase in disturbed pastures
which have been seeded to grasses such as crested
wheatgrass (<i>Agropyron cristatum</i>) [<a href="#85">85</a>].  In many
instances, basin big sagebrush shows only a moderate
increase in density on disturbed sites, but may exhibit
large increases in crown density [<a href="#118">118</a>].   
Seedling establishment 
may begin immediately following a disturbance, but it usually takes a 
decade or more before big sagebrush dominates the site.</p>

<p>
Many basin big sagebrush sites are now depleted of "normal" perennial
grasses and are now dominated by cheatgrass (<i>Bromus tectorum)</i> [<a href="#24">24</a>].</p>

Primary new leaves develop along the main stem in spring.  
As vegetative growth continues, new short
lateral branches form from the existing stem and support smaller
leaves which persist throughout the next winter, long after
the initial leaves are shed.  In Utah, 
accentuated stem
growth begins in early June, with maximum longitudinal stem growth 
occurring in early June.  By the end of June, vegetative stem
growth begins to decline as reproductive buds and shoots begin
expansion [<a href="#34">34</a>].  

<p>
The reproductive
shoots form, mature, and bear seed within the span of a single
growing season [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Basin big
sagebrush flowers from late August to October 
[<a href="#94">94</a>].  In Utah, reproductive shoots reach 
maximum size and flowerbuds first 
appear in late July [<a href="#34">34</a>].    
Basin big sagebrush tends to flower later than 
Wyoming big sagebrush [<a href="#6">6</a>].  High-elevation
ecotypes flower and set seed earlier than do
valley ecotypes [<a href="#77">77</a>].  The inflorescence 
may persist until the following season [<a href="#120">120</a>].</p>

<p>
Seed production occurs from October to December [<a href="#77">77</a>].  
Most seed is shed in the fall, although some may remain on the 
plant through the winter.  Seeds germinate in the spring as 
early as April.</p>

<p>
Seasonal development in the valley of Alpowa Creek near Clarkston,
Washington, was as follows [<a href="#32">32</a>]:</p>

Big sagebrush plants are killed by most fires.  Prolific 
seed production from nearby unburned plants coupled with 
high germination rates enables seedlings to establish rapidly 
following fire.  Wind-, water-, and animal-carried seed 
contribute to regeneration on a site
[<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>].
<p>

Few if any fire history studies have been conducted on basin big 
sagebrush.  Sapsis [<a href="#90">90</a>] suggests that fire return 
intervals in basin big sagebrush are intermediate between mountain big sagebrush
(5 to 15 years) and Wyoming big sagebrush (10 to 70 years) [<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>].  It is 
important to note that "given the
wide range of fuel situations and our understanding of yearly
climatic variation in the sagebrush ecosystem, a naturally wide
variation in fire frequency in this system should be expected" [<a href="#90">90</a>].</p>
<p>

In many basin big sagebrush communities, changes in fire occurrence 
have occurred along with fire suppression and livestock grazing.  Prior to the introduction of annuals, insufficient
fuels may have limited fire spread in big sagebrush communities.  Introduction of annuals has increased fuel
loads so that fire can easily carry.  Burning in some big sagebrush
communities can set the stage for repeated fires.
Fire frequency can be as little as 5 years, not sufficient time for
the establishment and reproduction of big sagebrush.  Repeated
fires have removed big sagebrush from extensive areas in the
Great Basin and Columbia River drainages [<a href="#20">20</a>].</p>
<p>

Fire severity in big sagebrush communities is described as "variable" 
depending on weather, fuels, and topography.  
However, fire in basin big sagebrush communities are typically 
stand replacing [<a href="#91">91</a>].</p>
<p>

communities, see the FEIS species summaries on dominant tree

Big sagebrush is readily killed when aboveground plant
parts are charred by fire [<a href="#55">55</a>].  If 
sagebrush foliage is exposed to temperatures above 195 degrees 
Fahrenheit (90<sup>o</sup>C) for longer than 30 seconds, the 
plant dies [<a href="#18">18</a>].  In some areas, scattered unburned 
basin big sagebrush may survive, 
particularly where the soil is thin and rocky and where 
sparse herbaceous biomass
limits the fire's spread [<a href="#22">22</a>].<p></p>

Site productivity affects the ease with which big sagebrush 
communities will burn.  Highly productive sites have greater plant 
density and more biomass which, in turn, are likely to provide 
more fuel to carry a fire.
<p>  

Among the three major subspecies of big sagebrush, 
basin big sagebrush is considered intermediate in 
flammability.  Mountain big sagebrush is most flammable, and 
Wyoming big sagebrush is least flammable [<a href="#18">18</a>].</p>

Basin big sagebrush does not resprout after
fire.  Because of the time needed to produce seed, it is 
eliminated by frequent fires [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Basin big sagebrush reinvades a site primarily 
by off-site seed or seed from plants that survive in unburned patches.  
The rate of stand recovery depends on the season of 
burn, as season affects the availability of seed, postfire 
precipitation patterns, and the amount of interference offered 
by other regenerating plant species
[<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>].  Establishment may be delayed until favorable moisture
conditions occur [<a href="#55">55</a>].  
<p>

Sagebrush seed is not disseminated for great distances 
so off-site sources are probably 
less important than on-site seed [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Shrubs surviving within 
the perimeter of a disturbed area provide a more important 
seed source than those on the perimeter
[<a href="#60">60</a>].  The vast majority of big sagebrush seed
produced during fall is gone by spring and very few
seeds persist.  Seed of some subspecies of big sagebrush may 
persist in a seed bank [<a href="#72">72</a>].  However, unlike many of the other
subspecies, emergence of basin big sagebrush seed
appears to be reduced by exposure to heat [<a href="#23">23</a>].</p>

<p class="subframeText">
Sapsis [<a href="#90">90</a>] reports "investigations of prescribed burning
as an ecological agent in basin big sagebrush dominated systems
are lacking."  However, a number of studies have focused on big 
sagebrush in general.  Fire as a management tool has primarily 
been used to reduce big
sagebrush.  Where sagebrush reduction is a desired goal, 
prescribed burns in basin big sagebrush communities tend to be 
more successful than those in Wyoming big sagebrush, but 
less successful than those in mountain big sagebrush [<a href="#19">19</a>].  
In Nevada where "range improvements" were desired, best 
results have been obtained after spring or late fall burns 
[<a href="#5">5</a>].  Summer burns in big sagebrush communities can
leave the soil bare and subject to erosion.  Favorable results
are often obtained after fire in basin big sagebrush is an adequate
understory is present prior to the burn [<a href="#21">21</a>].
<p> 

Britton and others [<a href="#19">19</a>] report that as a general rule for a successful
prescribed burn in big sagebrush at least 20% canopy cover of 
big sagebrush should be present, with at
least 200 to 300 lb. per acre of herbaceous fuel.  Beardall and
Sylvester [<a href="#5">5</a>] suggest that for prescribed burns to succeed in big
sagebrush communities in Nevada, the following conditions should be 
met:  600 to 700 lb./acre fine fuels; ignition should occur when 
relative humidity is 60% or less; soil must be wet, winds
must be 8 miles per hour or greater; and burning should stop when
spring growth of grasses reaches 2 inches.  Big sagebrush
should be at least 1/3rd of total plant cover [<a href="#84">84</a>].  The presence
of weedy annuals may prevent establishment of desirable 
perennial grasses and can increase future fire hazards
[<a href="#20">20</a>].</p>
<p>

Success of winter broadcast burning (n=5) in big sagebrush
communities in southern Idaho was as follows [<a href="#78">78</a>]:</p>

In Idaho, wildfires in basin big sagebrush-needle and thread
grass communities may create unstable soil conditions leading to
wind erosion and "difficulty in seedling
establishment" [<a href="#25">25</a>].
<p>

Removing 
sagebrush by fire or chemical treatment may release 
desirable undergrowth if the site is in good condition.  
However, many basin big sagebrush sites today are
limited in extent and do not have a high density of 
undergrowth to respond if the overstory is reduced.  Animals 
are attracted to burned areas and may damage 
low-vigor plants if the animals concentrate
in a small area.  In some cases, prescribed fire in
big sagebrush communities can create
mosaics that are beneficial to wildlife 
[<a href="#21">21</a>].</p>
<p>

Several studies have examined big sagebrush as a fuel.  Average 
fuel load for basin big sagebrush is reported as follows [<a href="#38">38</a>]:</p>

<pre> 
                     fuel load (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)
                     leaves   1 hr  10 hr  100 hr
basin big sagebrush  0.084    0.12  0.14   0.16     
</pre>

In general, burning in cheatgrass-infested big sagebrush types
is not recommended if cheatgrass cover exceeds 50% or if cover of 
fire-resistant native grasses is less than 20%.  Cheatgrass is 
more likely to invade after fire if the dominant native grass
is not a fire-resistant species (for example, Thurber
needlegrass or Idaho fescue) or if native grasses were in poor
condition prior to fire [<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>].  Artificial seeding with native
grasses is recommended after fire if cheatgrass was a major
component of the prefire community or if it was a minor component
and native grasses were in poor condition [<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>].  Communities
in good condition may at least partially recover from temporary
postfire increases in cheatgrass, especially when fire is followed

The frequency of basin big sagebrush increased in spring burns one
year after treatment.  No increases were noted 2 years after fire
in fall-burned units.  According to Sapsis [<a href="#90">90</a>], "factors
relating to the greater fire severity (e.g. consumption, total
energy) in the fall burns reduced the rate and degree of 
reinvasion in the fall burn plots."  Basin big sagebrush was completely 
eliminated by the fall burn.  Spring burning resulted in an 84%
decrease in density.
