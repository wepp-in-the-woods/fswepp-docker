<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
When the introduced Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius) tree invades
southern Florida slash pine stands in rockland pine forest of extreme
southeastern Florida, it shades out the herbaceous understory flora,
including firegrass.  Prescribed fire may be useful in controlling
Brazilian pepper [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Saw-palmetto (Serenoa repens) flatwoods in south-central Florida were
treated with herbicides in conjunction with burning to improve native
pastures, which included firegrass.  Burning and 2,4,5-T application
decreased saw-palmetto cover and increased total grass cover from 29.4
percent to 67.5 percent over a 2- year period [<a href="#5">5</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Andropogon cabanisii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Firegrass is a native, perennial, cespitose graminoid [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Culms are
erect, 31 to 59 inches (80-150 cm) tall, and occur in small tufts.  The
upper half of each culm bears long slender branches.  The inflorescence
has two racemes and is 1.6 to 2.8 inches (4-7 cm) long [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Rachis
hairs make the inflorescence villous [<a href="#14">14</a>].  The lemma awn is 0.6 inches
(1.5 cm) long and twisted.  The fruit is a caryopsis [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Firegrass sprouts from perennating buds at the base of the culms.  It
also reproduces by seed [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Firegrass occurs in dry pine woods of Florida [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].  It also occurs
occasionally on sandhills and in sand pine (Pinus clausa) scrub of
central Florida [<a href="#14">14</a>].  It sometimes occurs in moist sites as well [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Firegrass in south-central Florida occurs on fine sand.  Average annual
rainfall is about 55 inches (140 cm) a year, 75 percent of which falls
from May to October.  Average temperatures from May to October are
maximum/minimum 90/64 degrees Fahrenheit (31.6/17.8 deg C) [<a href="#5">5</a>].  In
extreme southeastern Florida firegrass occurs on rough limestone
substrate with crevices and solution holes but very little soil
development [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].  Firegrass in Liberty County occurs on limestone
bedrock with surface soils derived from sand.  It occurs on poorly
drained, somewhat poorly drained, and moderately to excessively
well-drained soils [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Firegrass in the Florida panhandle occurred in savanna vegetation, in
stands of thinned and unthinned longleaf pine forest, and in a natural
slash pine stand.  The longleaf pine stands had trees up to 78 years old
and canopy cover of 41 to 49 percent.  The slash pine stand had 58
percent canopy cover.  There was no midstory in either forest type [<a href="#12">12</a>].

In slash pine forests on limestone rockland in extreme southeastern
Florida, firegrass and other herbaceous, light-requiring understory flora
are eliminated when shaded by native tropical hardwood trees [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Firegrass flowers in the fall in central Florida [<a href="#14">14</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Andropogon cabanisii

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Firegrass sprouts from basal buds after aerial portions are burned [<a href="#10">10</a>].
If thick tufts form [<a href="#4">4</a>], they may protect the basal buds from fire
damage.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tussock graminoid

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Andropogon cabanisii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Firegrass culms are killed by fire [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Firegrass responds to fire with rapid growth and increased flowering [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].

Firegrass in the rockland pine vegetation of South Florida recovers in
place and has approximately the same number of individuals before and
after fire [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].  Firegrass in this habitat flowers very infrequently
except in recently burned pineland [<a href="#10">10</a>].  It flowers the first autumn
after fire provided the plant has had time to sprout [<a href="#9">9</a>].  About a year
after fire, burned sites have a stand of tall grasses, including
firegrass.  This grass stage is typically prominent for only one season.
After 2 or 3 years the shrub understory has largely recovered, and the
grasses are much less prominent [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Saw-palmetto flatwoods in south-central Florida were burned to improve
native pastures.  Average cover of all grasses, including firegrass,
increased from 30.5 percent to 42.2 percent after fire treatment [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Firegrass occurred in all measured longleaf pine and slash pine forests
in Liberty County that had been subject to prescribed fires designed to
retard development of a shrub component [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Limestone rockland slash pine forests of southeastern Florida require
fire to be maintained.  These forests have been invaded by Brazilian
pepper which shades out the herbaceous flora, including firegrass.
Prescribed burning at approximately 5-year intervals within Everglades
National Park has largely prevented establishment of Brazilian pepper.
Native tropical hardwood tree species will also shade out firegrass and
other herbaceous species and they, too, can be controlled by fire.  In
the absence of fire a layer of pine litter 8 to 28 inches (20-70 cm)
thick develops, and contributes to the elimination of the herbaceous
flora [<a href="#7">7</a>].  In the absence of fire for 15 to 25 years, pineland
vegetation develops into tropical hardwood hammocklike vegetation with
a 13- to 20-foot (4-6 m) canopy under the emergent pines.  In a pine
forest burned at intervals of about 5 years, hardwood shrubs rarely
exceed 10 feet (3 m) in height.

In 11 limestone rockland slash pine forest sites in Everglades National
Park subject to prescribed burning every 3 to 7 years, firegrass had a
mean frequency of 44 percent and a density of 280 plants per 100 square
meters.  Brazilian pepper was absent.  In another stand which had
escaped fire for about 35 years, but in which Brazilian pepper was also
absent, frequency and density of firegrass were zero [<a href="#7">7</a>].
