The currently accepted scientific name of eastern redcedar is <i>Juniperus 
virginiana</i> L. (Cupressaceae) [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>]. The two recognized varieties of this species are <i>J. virginiana</i> 
var.<i> virginiana</i> [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>] and southern redcedar (<i>J. virginiana </i>var. 
<i>silicicola</i> (Small) J. Silba) [<a href="#71">71</a>]. Adams [<a href="#3">3</a>] described southern redcedar 
as a variety of eastern redcedar based on similarity of morphological 
characteristics and volatile leaf oils. However, southern redcedar 
has previously been described and is still accepted by some authors as a 
distinct species, <i>J. silicicola</i> [<a href="#101">101</a>]. This species summary refers 
to both varieties of eastern redcedar; information specific to variety is noted.
</p>

<p>
Hybrid swarms of eastern redcedar and creeping juniper (<i>J. horizontalis</i>) 
occur on the coast of Maine and in the Driftless Area according to morphological, 
terpene, electrophoretic, and cytological data analysis [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>]. Based on 
morphological variation, hybrid swarms of eastern redcedar and Rocky Mountain juniper 
(<i>J. scopulorum</i>) occur in the Texas panhandle and the northern Great Plains 
[<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>]. Also based on studies of morphological characteristics, hybrid swarms 
of eastern redcedar and Ashe juniper (<i>J. ashei</i>) reportedly occur in Oklahoma, 
Texas, and Missouri [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>]. However, in a study of terpenoids, Adams and Turner [<a href="#2">2</a>] 
found no evidence of hybridization between eastern redcedar and Ashe juniper.

Eastern redcedar's range extends from Nova Scotia west to Ontario, south through 
the northern Great Plains to eastern Texas, and east to northern Florida and the 
Atlantic coast [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. <i>J.v.</i> var. <i>virginiana</i> occurs 
throughout eastern redcedar's range, with the exception of northern Florida [<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>]. 
<i> J.v.</i> var. <i>silicicola </i>is restricted to coastal dunes and

Eastern redcedar commonly occurs in mixed stands with shortleaf pine 
(<i>Pinus echinata</i>), Virginia pine (<i>P. virginiana</i>), northern 
red oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>), white oak (<i>Q. alba</i>), black oak 
(<i>Q. velutina</i>), blackjack oak (<i>Q. marilandica</i>), hickories 
(<i>Carya</i> spp.), and black walnut (<i>Juglans nigra</i>) [<a href="#132">132</a>]. In the 
northeastern United States, eastern redcedar frequently occurs on rocky 
ridgetops with shagbark hickory (<i>C. ovata</i>), eastern hophornbeam 
(<i>Ostrya virginiana</i>), downy serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier arborea</i>), 
little bluestem (<i>Schizachyrium scoparium</i>), bristleleaf sedge 
(<i>Carex eburnea</i>), and Parlin's pussytoes (<i>Antennaria parlinii</i>) [<a href="#104">104</a>].


<p>
Where eastern redcedar dominates, species diversity is commonly low [<a href="#24">24</a>]. Pure 
stands of eastern redcedar occur throughout its range, primarily on dry uplands or 
abandoned farmlands [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>], though hardwood species may also occur on these sites [<a href="#104">104</a>]. 
In southern Appalachian montane cedar-hardwood woodlands, eastern redcedar occurs 
with bluestems (<i>Andropogon</i> spp.), little bluestem, sedges (<i>Carex</i> spp.), 
panicgrass (<i>Dichanthelium</i> spp.), yellow honeysuckle (<i>Lonicera flava</i>), 
cliff stonecrop (<i>Sedum glaucophyllum</i>), white ash (<i>Fraxinus americana</i>), 
eastern redbud (<i>Cercis canadensis</i>), slippery elm (<i>Ulmus rubra</i>), 
honey-locust (<i>Gleditsia tricanthos</i>), chinkapin oak (<i>Q. muehlenbergii</i>), 
chestnut oak (<i>Q. prinus</i>), pignut hickory (<i>Carya glabra</i>), 
and mockernut hickory (<i>C. tomentosa</i>) [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>]. Pure stands are 
also common in the northern Great Plains, though the stands may eventually be invaded 
by other woody species [<a href="#93">93</a>].</p>


<p>
In the prairie ecosystem, common associates of eastern redcedar include 
little bluestem, big bluestem (<i>A. gerardii </i>var.<i> gerardii</i>), sideoats grama 
(<i>Bouteloua curtipendula</i>), blue grama (<i>B. gracilis</i>), western wheatgrass 
(<i>Pascopyrum smithii</i>), indiangrass (<i>Sorghastrum nutans</i>), switchgrass 
(<i>Panicum virgatum</i>), prairie dropseed (<i>Sporobolus heterolepsis</i>), gray goldenrod 
(<i>Solidago nemoralis</i>), sedges, flowering spurge (<i>Euphorbia corollata</i>), 
smooth sumac (<i>Rhus glabra</i>), leadplant (<i>Amorpha canescens</i>),  poison-ivy 
(<i>Toxicodendron radicans</i>), common snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos albus</i>), 
silver buffaloberry (<i>Shepherdia argentea</i>), chokecherry (<i>Prunus virginiana</i>), 
common juniper (<i>J. communis</i>), gray dogwood (<i>Cornus racemosa</i>), currants 
(<i>Ribes</i> spp.), and <i>Rubus</i> species [<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>]. </p>

<p>
Where stands of eastern redcedar are interspersed with grasslands, &quot;cedar 
glades&quot; may develop. Cedar glades are found in the Ozark region, north to 
Wisconsin, and east to Illinois and Kentucky. Though eastern redcedar dominates 
and may occur in almost pure stands in these glades [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>], common 
associates in midwestern glade communities include little bluestem, big bluestem, 
broomsedge bluestem (<i>Andropogon virginicus</i>), hairy grama (<i>B. hirsuta</i>), 
sideoats grama,  switchgrass,  prairie Junegrass (<i>Koeleria macrantha</i>), 
indiangrass,  dropseeds (<i>Sporobolus </i>spp.), blackjack oak, 
post oak (<i>Q. stellata</i>), white ash, winged elm (<i>U. alata</i>), 
fragrant sumac (<i>Rhus aromatica</i>), Carolina buckthorn (<i>Frangula caroliniana</i>), 
rusty blackhaw (<i>Viburnum rufidulum</i>), Alabama supplejack (<i>Berchemia scandens</i>), 
and common persimmon (<i>Diospyros virginiana</i>) [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>]. In Kentucky cedar 
glades, eastern redcedar commonly occurs with big bluestem, little bluestem, purple threeawn 
(<i>Aristida purpurea</i>), indiangrass, nodding onion (<i>Allium cernuum</i>), Carolina larkspur 
(<i>Delphinium carolinianum</i> ssp. <i>virescens</i>), blue wild indigo 
(<i>Baptisia australis</i>), roundhead lespedeza (<i>Lespedeza capitata</i>), flowering spurge, 
spotted sandmat (<i>Chamaesyce</i> <i>maculata</i>), slenderstalk beeblossom (<i>Gaura filipes</i>), 
necklace gladecress (<i>Leavenworthia torulosa</i>), Michaux's gladecress (<i>L. uniflora</i>), 
little hogweed (<i>Portulaca oleracea</i>), bearded flatsedge (<i>Cyperus squarrosus</i>), and 
widowscross (<i>Sedum pulchellum</i>) [<a href="#10">10</a>]. In Wisconsin cedar glades, common associates include 
little bluestem, big bluestem, flowering spurge, leadplant, hairy grama, Michaux's stitchwort 
(<i>Minuartia</i> <i>michauxii</i> var. <i>michauxii</i>), gray goldenrod, basswood 
(<i>Tilia americana</i>), gray birch (<i>Betula populifolia</i>), common juniper, and creeping 
juniper [<a href="#31">31</a>].</p>

The following description of eastern redcedar provides 
characteristics that may be relevant to fire ecology, and is not meant for 
identification. Keys for identification are available (e.g. [<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]).

<p>Eastern redcedar is a relatively long-lived evergreen that may reach 450+ 
years [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>]. It has 2 distinct growth forms. The most familiar form 
is narrowly conical with its branches growing up and out at a sharp angle to 
form a compact tree. The 2nd form is broadly conical with branches that spread 
widely. Both forms can be found throughout eastern redcedar's range [<a href="#124">124</a>]. Some 
authors describe the 2 forms in terms of age: young trees have the narrowly 
pyramidal or columnar shape with crowns becoming open and irregular as trees age 
[<a href="#68">68</a>]. Others suggest differences in crown 
form are attributed to variety, with <i>J.v</i>. var. <i>virginiana</i> 
displaying the columnar form and <i>J.v.</i> var.<i> silicicola</i> more broadly 
conical to rounded [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].</p>

<p>
Eastern redcedar has thin, fibrous bark [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>] that is 0.3 to 0.64 inch 
(0.75-1.6 cm) thick [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>]. Leaves of eastern redcedar are borne in 2 forms. 
On seedlings and new twigs, leaves are pointed and awl-shaped. On mature branches, 
closely overlapping scale-like leaves fit tightly against the twig in opposite 
pairs [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>].</p>

<p>
Eastern redcedar generally has a shallow, fibrous root system [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>], though 
roots of mature eastern redcedar trees may penetrate 25 feet (7.6 m) and lateral 
roots may reach 20 feet (6 m) [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>]. Eastern redcedar seedlings 
have penetrating taproots and may later develop a lateral taproot system [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>]. 
The deep, early taproot is usually replaced by an extensive, shallow root system 
with age [<a href="#132">132</a>]. Even 1st year seedlings begin developing a long fibrous root system, often 
at the expense of top growth [<a href="#79">79</a>]. The root system may be deep where soil permits [<a href="#68">68</a>], 
but on shallow and rocky soils eastern redcedar roots are very fibrous and tend to 
spread widely [<a href="#79">79</a>]. The development of a lateral taproot with age may also enable 
eastern redcedar to persist on  outcrops and shallow soils [<a href="#24">24</a>]. </p>

<p>
Eastern redcedar seeds are borne in small, fleshy, berrylike cones [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>], 
with 1 to 4&nbsp;seeds per cone [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>]. Eastern redcedar cones or fruits 
range from 0.12 to 0.33 inch (3-8 mm) long, with most 0.14 to 0.22 inch (3.5-5.5 mm) 
long [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. Within this range, <i>J.v. </i>var. <i>silicicola</i> 
generally has smaller cone sizes than <i>J.v.</i> var. <i>virginiana</i> [<a href="#36">36</a>]. 
Seeds are 0.08-0.16 inch (2-4 mm) long [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>].

<br />

Eastern redcedar reproduces solely by seed; there is no natural asexual 
regeneration. Eastern redcedar trees reach sexual maturity at approximately 
10 years [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>]. Reproductive activity may be influenced by tree size and site 
characteristics. A study in the Tennessee Valley found that in a managed 
parkland, 86% of eastern redcedar &gt;4 inches (10 cm) dbh were reproductively 
active and the sex ratio was 1:1. In mature xeric forests on the rocky 
mountainsides only 41% of eastern redcedar &gt;4 inches dbh were reproductively 
active, and the male:female sex ratio was 2.2:1. The likelihood of reproductive 
activity 1) was lower on the mountainside than in the parkland, 2) increased with 
tree diameter and height, 3) increased with diameter growth rate, and 4) decreased 
with shading by neighboring trees [<a href="#80">80</a>].

<p>
<b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Breeding system:</font></b> Eastern redcedar is 
<a href="../../../glossary.html#DIOECIOUS:">dioecious</a> [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>]. 
Though rare, <a href="../../../glossary.html#MONOECIOUS:">monoecious</a> eastern redcedars 
have been found [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>].  Male trees tend to be taller and have greater diameter 
growth than female trees, which may contribute to their success as pollen donors [<a href="#128">128</a>]. </p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Pollination:</b></font> 
Eastern redcedar pollen is wind-dispersed [<a href="#29">29</a>].</p>

<p>
<b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Seed production:</font> </b> 
Mature eastern redcedar trees produce some seeds nearly every year, but good 
crops occur only every 2 or 3 years [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>]. Eastern redcedar produces most 
seed between the ages of 25 and 75, though seed production can occur in trees as 
young as 10 years and as old as 100+ years [<a href="#46">46</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seed dispersal:</b></font> Eastern redcedar seed is 
dispersed by birds and small mammals [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>]. As a result, seedling 
density is generally greater near trees or along fencelines that provide perching 
sites [<a href="#29">29</a>]. Seeds pass through bird digestive tracts within 30 minutes of 
ingestion, suggesting many seeds will be deposited near their source trees 
rather than transported long distances. Seeds mature and are 
available to birds in winter and early spring when other food is scarce and 
populations of wintering birds are high [<a href="#93">93</a>].</p> 

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seed banking:</b></font> 
No information is available on this topic.</p>

<p>
<b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Germination:</font></b> 
Seeds that pass through animal digestive tracts and those that remain on 
the ground beneath the trees may germinate the 1st or 2nd spring after 
dispersal. Most germination of eastern redcedar seed occurs in early spring 
of the 2nd year after dispersal [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>]. Delayed germination is caused by 
embryo dormancy and possibly by an impermeable seedcoat. Passage through an 
animal's digestive tract speeds seed germination [<a href="#46">46</a>].</p> 

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seedling establishment/growth:</b></font> 
Most natural regeneration of eastern redcedar takes place on relatively poor 
hardwood or pine (<i>Pinus</i> spp.) sites, along fence rows, or in pastures 
that are not burned or mowed. Seedlings are commonly established in rather 
open hardwood stands, adjacent to older seed-bearing eastern redcedar trees [<a href="#79">79</a>]. 
Eastern redcedar seedlings are shade intolerant, so survival is better under open 
stand conditions [<a href="#46">46</a>]. If competition from an overstory is  severe, eastern redcedar 
seedlings may not survive. Once established, however, eastern redcedar survives 
for extended periods under severe competition [<a href="#79">79</a>]. Eastern redcedar seedling 
establishment may be improved following the removal of litter [<a href="#46">46</a>]. On very dry sites, 
most seedlings are found in crevices, between layers of limestone, and in other 
protected places where the microclimate is most favorable [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>]. Seedling development 
is relatively slow on these adverse sites, although eastern redcedar seedlings 
withstand drought well [<a href="#79">79</a>]. Established seedlings are drought tolerant 
due to their taproot and relatively small leaf surface [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>]. During the 1st year, 
seedlings do not produce much height growth but develop a long fibrous root system [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
Eastern redcedar growth is relatively slow [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>], though stem volume, sapwood, 
and heartwood growth rates of eastern redcedar increase when trees reach 15 to 20 
years [<a href="#4">4</a>]. Trees 20 to 30 years old are generally 18 to 26 feet (5.5-8 m) tall and 
2 to 3 inches (5-7.5 cm) in diameter [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>]. Mature trees typically reach 40-70 feet 
(12-21 m) tall, with a short bole 12 to 28 inches (30-71 cm) in diameter [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>]. 
Growth rates of eastern redcedar depend largely on stand density, competition 
from other species, and site quality. These factors probably reflect competition for 
available soil moisture on most sites [<a href="#79">79</a>]. On &quot;good&quot; sites [<a href="#46">46</a>], trees may reach 
120 feet (36 m) tall and 4 feet (1.2 m) in diameter [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. On dry sites in the prairie 
region, trees 110 years old are often less than 20 feet (6 m) tall [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. On thin soils where growth is particularly slow, eastern redcedar may have 
diameters &lt;2 inches (5 cm) after 50 years [<a href="#31">31</a>]. An example of aboveground biomass 
and productivity from 3 Kansas eastern redcedar stands is presented below [<a href="#90">90</a>]:</p>

<p>
Increased stand density generally results in taller eastern redcedar 
trees [<a href="#46">46</a>]. </p>


<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Asexual regeneration:</b></font> 
There is no natural asexual reproduction in eastern redcedar. It does not 
resprout after complete cutting or burning [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>].

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SITE CHARACTERISTICS">
SITE CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Elevation and aspect: Eastern redcedar occurs from sea level to 5,000 feet 
(1,524 m) in elevation [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>]. Although the most desirable elevation is not 
clearly delineated, eastern redcedar is found most often growing between 100 and 
3,500 feet (30-1,070 m). It is notably absent below the 100 foot elevation zone 
in the southern and eastern parts of its range [<a href="#79">79</a>]. 


<p>
Aspect influences the character of eastern redcedar stands. On north and east 
slopes, there may be fewer eastern redcedar trees because of hardwood 
competition. However, the eastern redcedar that does occur on north and east 
slopes may be taller than the trees found on south and west slopes [<a href="#46">46</a>]. Eastern 
redcedar is generally more prevalent on south and south-west facing slopes [<a href="#111">111</a>]. In 
the western part of its range, however, eastern redcedar may more likely be found on 
north-facing slopes and along streambanks where there is some protection from high 
temperatures and drought [<a href="#79">79</a>]. On exposed areas in the far northern portion of its 
range, eastern redcedar's growth habit may be reduced to a low shrub [<a href="#68">68</a>].</p>


<p>
Climate: Widespread distribution of eastern redcedar attests to its ability 
to grow under a range of climatic conditions. Precipitation averages 15 inches 
(380 mm) in the northwestern part of its range and 60 inches (1,520 mm) in the 
southeastern parts of its range [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>]. Average annual maximum 
temperature ranges from 90 to 115 degrees Fahrenheit (32-46 <sup>o</sup>C) and 
average minimum temperature ranges from -45 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit 
(-43 to -7 <sup>o</sup>C). The growing season varies from about 120 to 250 days 
[<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. </p>


<p>
Soils and topography: Throughout its range, eastern redcedar grows under diverse 
site conditions: in deep and shallow soils, on ridgetops, and in valleys 
[<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>]. Eastern redcedar grows in such varied habitats as thin, rocky soils and dry 
outcrops to finer textured, saturated soils of swamps [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>], though 
it is not tolerant of flooding [<a href="#63">63</a>]. Eastern redcedar is common on shallow soils (6 to 8 inches 
(15-20 cm) thick) on limestone or sandstone bedrock [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>]. Where soil averages less 
than 12 inches (30 cm) deep, eastern redcedar seldom grows taller than 20 to 30 feet (6-9 m). 
Where soil depth is 12 to 24 inches (30-60 cm), it reaches 35 feet (10.7 m) in approximately 
50 years [<a href="#8">8</a>]. Optimal site conditions for eastern redcedar are deep (&gt;24 inches), moist, well-drained 
alluvial soils, where it may reach heights of 55 to 60 feet (16.7-18.3 m) after 50 years [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. </p>


<p>
Eastern redcedar grows on alkaline or acidic soils where soil pH ranges from 
4.7 to 7.8 [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>]. High soil acidity does not deter eastern redcedar 
establishment [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>], though it may slow growth [<a href="#84">84</a>]. Combinations of low 
phosphorus, high calcium and pH&gt;7 in particular may favor eastern redcedar [<a href="#24">24</a>]. 
However, Lawson [<a href="#79">79</a>] reports that although eastern redcedar will grow on 
slightly alkaline soils, it is not particularly tolerant of higher pH levels. 
Eastern redcedar's occurrence on neutral to alkaline soils may be a result 
(rather than a cause) of the tree's presence [<a href="#46">46</a>]. Soils in eastern redcedar stands 
tend to become neutral or slightly alkaline because the high calcium content of 
the tree's foliage can change the pH of the surface soil in a relatively short time 
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>]. </p>


<p>
Eastern redcedar (primarily <i>J.v</i>. var. <i>virginiana</i>) is commonly 
found on rough upland topography, including moderate to steep slopes and eroded limestone 
slopes and knobs [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>]. It frequently forms dense stands on 
exposed bluffs and ridges [<a href="#18">18</a>]. Southern redcedar occurs predominantly 
on coastal dunes, swales, shell mounds, brackish flats, and floodplains [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>]. </p>



<p>
Tolerances: Southern redcedar is saline tolerant, growing on brackish marsh 
sites in southeastern U.S. [<a href="#49">49</a>], barrier island swales subject to saltwater 
flooding [<a href="#122">122</a>,<a href="#136">136</a>], and on coastal dunes subject to salt spray [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].</p>


<p>Eastern redcedar grows where water is near the surface or where 
soil moisture fluctuates from near saturation in  winter to extreme dryness 
in  summer [<a href="#29">29</a>]. It has high drought tolerance [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>], enhanced by 
the presence of rapidly produced taproots as well as an extensive fibrous root 
system [<a href="#29">29</a>]. The relative drought tolerance of eastern redcedar compared with 
some herbaceous species (e.g. big bluestem) may contribute to its successful 
invasion of tallgrass prairie in the absence of fire [<a href="#9">9</a>]. </p>



<p>
Eastern redcedar is frost hardy [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>], though newly established seedlings 
are subject to frost heaving and foliage may occasionally be damaged by winter injury [<a href="#79">79</a>]. </p>



<p>
Eastern redcedar is moderately shade intolerant/sun-adapted [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>], though 
seedlings may survive for several years under a sparse canopy [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>]. 

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">

<br />

Eastern redcedar is both a pioneer and an invader [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>]. It colonizes 
relatively open patches of eroded bare ground and is most competitive on exposed dry 
sites; disturbed areas including abandoned pastures and cultivated fields, 
eroded areas, and open woods thinned by timber harvest [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>,<a href="#140">140</a>]. 
Eastern redcedar does not establish well in  more competitive, denser vegetation cover that 
occurs with less erosion or later in succession [<a href="#140">140</a>]. However, in Texas savannas, eastern 
redcedar establishment may by facilitated by post oak trees, which are then overtopped and 
outcompeted by eastern redcedar [<a href="#27">27</a>].</p>



<p>
Eastern redcedar a well-known invader in the prairie region [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>]. 
Invasion into prairie grasslands is attributed primarily to  absence of fire 
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>], and may be exacerbated by certain grazing practices [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>]. 
A readily available seed source resulting from eastern redcedar plantings and 
ability to capitalize across a wide range of environmental conditions have also 
encouraged eastern redcedar establishment in grasslands [<a href="#93">93</a>]. Eastern redcedar is 
thus an early to mid-seral component in cedar glades that result from the invasion of 
grasslands [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>]. These glades eventually succeed to oak (<i>Quercus</i> spp.)
-hardwood forests [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Eastern redcedar glades may persist as subclimax vegetation 
where soil development is low and rock outcrops are abundant. The scarcity of soil 
precludes  establishment of other species [<a href="#99">99</a>]. </p>



<p>
Eastern redcedar forms persistent, stable communities in limestone outcrop areas of the 
Interior Low Plateaus and the Limestone Valleys and Uplands Soils Province. 
These communities have been regarded as climax, subclimax, and edaphic climax. In 
particular, eastern redcedar stands may persist as subclimax forest on eroded limestone 
slopes and knobs [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Persistent stands occurring on outcrops are subject to windthrow due to 
exposure and shallow soil. The result is a periodic opening of the stand 
favoring continued eastern redcedar establishment [<a href="#24">24</a>].</p>



<p>
On the Atlantic coast, eastern redcedar may promote recruitment of mid-successional 
woody seedlings (and impact their distribution) passively through distribution of 
seeds by perching birds. Recruitment may be actively promoted 
through increased seedling survival due to eastern redcedar alterations in 
microclimate and edaphic factors. In a Virginia study, fleshy-fruited seeds of 
woody species were more abundant in the seed bank beneath eastern redcedar than 
in exposed sites. Photosynthetically active radiation was reduced under eastern 
redcedar canopies, and soil temperature fluctuations were moderated during the 
growing season. Moisture content, organic matter, and chlorides were higher for 
soils under eastern redcedar than in exposed sites [<a href="#70">70</a>].


<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT">
SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Eastern redcedar has small, inconspicuous flowers that appear from early to 
late spring [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>]. Pollination occurs from February (south and east) to May 
(north and west), and fertilization occurs about a month later. Cones develop on 
male and female trees in the fall [<a href="#79">79</a>], and seeds mature in 1 season, from late July to 
mid-November depending on location [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>]. As the ovulate cone develops, 
greenish fruit-scales form the outer fleshy protective coat of the berrylike 
cone. Cones change color from green to greenish-white to whitish-blue and finally to bluish 
as the season progresses. The cones do not open and will remain on the tree until 
early spring [<a href="#79">79</a>].

Eastern redcedar does not survive on sites subject to frequent fire [<a href="#131">131</a>].

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font> 
Eastern redcedar frequently occurs on sites topographically and edaphically 
protected from fire, including bluffs, rocky hillsides, shale barrens of Virginia 
and West Virginia, limestone glades of Tennessee, Virginia, Missouri and Arkansas; 
serpentine barrens of Pennsylvania and Maryland; sandstone cliffs; granite outcrops; 
sand dunes; and estuarine swamps [<a href="#29">29</a>]. Sites where eastern redcedar 
occurs as a persistent dominant are unlikely to support frequent fire due to 
rocky, shallow soils and low fuel loads [<a href="#24">24</a>].  On shallow soils where litter accumulation 
is limited, the lack of fuel protects many eastern redcedar stands even where fire 
occurrence is high [<a href="#46">46</a>]. However, in the absence of fire on adjoining uplands, 
eastern redcedar has been able to spread from these clifftop areas and invade 
uplands where it occupies a successional role [<a href="#24">24</a>]. On deep soils, competing vegetation 
produces enough litter to support fire. Sufficient fuels to carry fire are 
usually available on grasslands and old agricultural fields, and a single fire 
may remove eastern redcedar from a site [<a href="#46">46</a>].</p>

<p>
Fire suppression has resulted in the invasion of eastern redcedar into grasslands 
and savannas [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>]. In areas that once burned periodically, eastern redcedar 
was protected from fire on dry or rocky sites lacking sufficient herbaceous fuel 
to carry fire. As fire frequency decreased, eastern redcedar invaded adjacent and 
apparently stable plant communities. Subsequently, individual eastern redcedars have 
increased in size and coverage, and stand density has increased. Large trees and dense 
stands shade or otherwise inhibit growth of desired herbaceous vegetation [<a href="#29">29</a>]. 
In as little as 30 years after a fire, a treeless pasture can be converted to a 
closed canopy eastern redcedar forest [<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>]. </p>

<p>
A study of a cedar glade in southern Missouri found that fires occurred every 
3.2 years during the presettlement period (1630-1870). After 1870, fire 
frequency decreased to 22 years [<a href="#58">58</a>]. In a post oak savanna in southern Missouri, 
a study of fire scars on post oak, shortleaf pine, and 
eastern redcedar indicated a mean fire free interval of 4.3 years between 1700 
and 1810. The period between 1785 and 1810 showed the most extensive evidence of 
fire, and fire frequency declined after 1860 (coincident with European 
settlement) [<a href="#57">57</a>]. </p>

Fire regimes for plant communities and ecosystems where eastern redcedar is a 
common associate are summarized below.</p>

Eastern redcedar is susceptible to fire kill because of its short bole, 
thin bark, shallow roots, inability to resprout, and highly combustible 
evergreen foliage, which extends to the ground, particularly in young open-grown 
trees [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>].

Eastern redcedar seedlings and saplings are very susceptible to fire; they may 
be eliminated from a site following winter or spring prescribed burning [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>]. 
Eastern redcedar mortality decreases as tree size increases, due to relatively 
thicker bark, sparse fine fuels beneath the canopy, and greater vertical distance 
of the upper foliage from lethal temperatures [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].

In Leavenworth Barrens Nature Preserve, Indiana, low-severity spring prescribed 
burns, exhibiting irregular burn patterns, were only effective in killing small 
diameter eastern redcedar (1.5 inches (4 cm) basal diameter), while larger trees were 
unaffected [<a href="#1">1</a>]. A study of prescribed fire in a Missouri eastern redcedar glade 
found that spring burning killed all trees up to 1.5 feet (0.5 m) tall but only 
7% of the trees taller than 6.5 feet (2 m) [<a href="#85">85</a>].

In the absence of fire, eastern redcedar thrives and may eventually dominate 
prairie or forest vegetation [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>]. Prescribed fire is generally 
effective at controlling eastern redcedar invasion in grasslands [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>]. 
Spring burning is appropriate for eastern redcedar treatment because leaf water 
content is relatively low in late spring [<a href="#38">38</a>]. Spring burns usually kill eastern 
redcedar up to 3.3 feet (1 m) tall [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>], though larger trees up to 
20 feet (6 m) are occasionally  killed [<a href="#95">95</a>]. In an Illinois barren community, 
eastern redcedar seedlings and saplings were eliminated for at least 20 years 
following a spring prescribed fire [<a href="#5">5</a>]. In a Tennessee study over 20 years, 
eastern redcedar establishment was prevented using late winter prescribed 
surface fires annually and at 5-year intervals. On sites without fire treatment, 
eastern redcedar was recruited [<a href="#32">32</a>]. On a Texas site, prescribed burning reduced 
eastern redcedar from an average preburn density of 19 stems/acre (0-49 stems/ha) 
to 0 stems/acre (measured 4 months after the burn), with the unburned control 
averaging 21 stems/acre (54 stems/ha) [<a href="#123">123</a>].


<p>
Though widely used, broadcast burning disadvantages include incomplete control, 
a narrow annual treatment window, and integrated prefire (to accumulate fine fuel) and 
postfire (to allow recovery of grasses) grazing management required to improve 
results [<a href="#93">93</a>]. Degree of control depends on tree height, amount and distribution 
of herbaceous material that serves as fuel, backfire or headfire, and weather 
conditions favoring ignition of tree crowns [<a href="#77">77</a>]. </p>


<p>
Eastern redcedar trees &lt;6 feet (1.8 m) tall are easily killed by prescribed 
burns with adequate grass fuel (~2,000 lbs/acre (2,268 kg/ha)) [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>].  A 
Missouri study found that eastern redcedar mortality depended chiefly on the 
ratio of the amount of surface fuel to the amount of eastern redcedar foliage 
to be consumed (higher ratio = greater mortality). The ratio was affected both by 
size of the tree and  density of the crown. Mortalities for eastern redcedar with 
very low, low, moderate, and high density crowns were 90%, 82%, 66%, and 35% 
respectively [<a href="#85">85</a>]. Eastern redcedar is somewhat less susceptible to fire as tree 
size increases, so fire intensity must increase to scorch the crown of taller trees 
[<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>]. Larger trees may escape fire due to thicker bark, higher canopies [<a href="#93">93</a>], 
and a low fuel to foliage ratio [<a href="#85">85</a>]. Headfires running with a 5- to 20-mph 
wind may be necessary to create flames that engulf the lower parts of large 
trees [<a href="#77">77</a>]. Controlling trees &gt;6 feet tall often requires more fuel than 
the range's potential production [<a href="#17">17</a>]. </p>


<p>
Fire intensity and tree mortality are reduced further in dense stands of 
large trees because junipers reduce production of fine fuels [<a href="#37">37</a>]. The 
susceptibility of small eastern redcedar trees is enhanced because canopies 
of smaller trees do not have a large effect on surrounding herbaceous vegetation 
and stems are in close proximity to fine fuel [<a href="#93">93</a>]. In a Missouri burn, large 
tree mortality depended on amount of herbaceous fuel and density of crowns. 
Trees having crowns with sparse foliage exhibited 90% mortality. Trees having 
larger crowns with dense foliage showed 35% mortality. Light crowned trees had 
more foliage beneath them than did densely crowned trees. Temperatures the day 
of the burn ranged from 28 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit (-2 to 15 <sup>o</sup>C), the 
lowest relative humidity was 26%, and winds averaged 4.7 mph [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].</p>


<p>
Two prescribed fires conducted 1 week apart on  tallgrass prairie in 
Missouri had varying results. The 1st fire occurred with higher humidity and 
wetter fuels, resulting in a less severe burn that allowed even eastern redcedar 
stems 0.6 inches (1.5 cm) in diameter to survive. Drier fuel conditions and lower 
humidity during the 2nd burn resulted in relatively greater fire severity that 
killed 93 to 100% of eastern redcedar up to 3.5 inches in diameter [<a href="#73">73</a>].</p>


<p>
Because eastern redcedar growth rate and resistance to prescribed fire 
treatments increases at 15 to 20 years, control of invading trees is most 
effective at less than 10 years of age and 6.6 feet (2 m) tall [<a href="#4">4</a>]. Eastern 
redcedar stands are often a mixture of tree sizes, and fuel 
loadings vary, so it is difficult to predict the extent of mortality following 
prescribed fire. In an Oklahoma study, eastern redcedar 
mortality for small (2 to 5 feet (0.6-1.5 m)), medium (5 to 8 feet (1.5-2.4 m)), 
and large (8 to 16 feet (2.4-4.9 m)) trees was 82, 54, and 39%, respectively. 
Fuel loads ranged from 1,300 to 6,100 lbs/acre (1,474-6,917 kg/ha), and tree 
mortality increased with increasing fuel load [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Studies at Leavenworth Barrens 
Nature Preserve found  spring prescribed burning was ineffective at 
controlling eastern redcedar greater than 1.6 inches (4 cm) in diameter; however, 
tree girdling in the fall followed by prescribed burning in the spring resulted in 
&gt;50% immediate reduction of eastern redcedar with most of the remaining trees 
dying during the 1st growing season after treatment. Subsequent burning 
virtually removed eastern redcedar from the site [<a href="#1">1</a>]. Use of 
defoliating herbicides prior to prescribed burning increases the leaf litter and 
may improve the effectiveness of fire treatments by increasing fire intensity 
[<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>]. Desiccation of eastern redcedar foliage increases crown scorch and 
mortality due to prescribed fire by promoting crown fire [<a href="#37">37</a>]. Individual 
tree ignition following prescribed burning may be effective 
for removing any surviving eastern redcedar [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>]. Picloram and/or cutting 
treatments may also be effective in removing larger eastern redcedar not killed 
by prescribed burning [<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>].

Site vegetation was mixed-grass prairie. Dominant herbaceous species were 
little bluestem (<i>Schizachyrium scoparium</i>), sideoats grama 
(<i>Bouteloua curtipendula</i>), blue grama (<i>B. gracilis</i>), and 
western wheatgrass (<i>Pascopyrum smithii</i>). Other herbaceous species 
included big bluestem (<i>Andropogon gerardii </i>var.<i> gerardii</i>), 
sand bluestem (<i>A.g. </i>var. <i>paucipilus</i>), indiangrass 
(<i>Sorghastrum nutans</i>), and switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>). Shrubs 
present included leadplant (<i>Amorpha canescens</i>), common snowberry 
(<i>Symphoricarpos alba</i>), silver buffaloberry (<i>Shepherdia argentea</i>), 
chokecherry (<i>Prunus virginiana</i>), poison-ivy (<i>Toxicodendron radicans</i>), 
smooth sumac (<i>Rhus glabra</i>), currants (<i>Ribes</i> spp.), and <i>Rubus</i> species. 
Occasional deciduous trees were found in study plots, including eastern cottonwood 
(<i>Populus deltoides</i>), green ash (<i>Fraxinus pennsylvanica</i> var. 
<i>subintegerrima</i>), and Russian-olive (<i>Elaeagnus angustifolia</i>). 
Eastern redcedar (<i>Juniperus virginiana</i>) stands were generally open with varying 
densities of smaller, younger age classes. Stands near the foot of slopes were almost 
&quot;closed,&quot; while density diminished with elevation. Trees were largely absent 
from ridge tops.

Weather conditions in 1993 were more favorable for eastern redcedar control than 
in 1994. Conditions in 1993 were within recommended burning prescriptions with 
the exception of windspeed, which was above prescription. Relative humidity was 
above prescription in 1994. Fine fuels were also significantly greater 
(p=0.0003) in 1993 than in 1994.

Broadcast burning was followed by a variety of treatments to remove 
individual eastern redcedars that survived the fire. These treatments included 
burned/herbicide (picloram soil application), burned/mechanical removal, 
burned/individual ignition, and burned/control (no follow-up). Unburned controls 
were also subject to the follow-up treatments: unburned/herbicide, 
unburned/mechanical, and unburned/control.

Mean eastern redcedar mortality increased from 77 to 92% 1 year after the 
1993 burn and increased from 66 to 69% 1 year after the 1994 burn (based on 
burned/control treatments - see above). Delayed 
mortality may be the result of damage to the bark and cambium of eastern 
redcedar that is not immediately fatal. Foliage remaining on burned trees may be 
insufficient to support the root system, also contributing to delayed mortality.</p>



<p>
Follow-up treatment effects: Mechanical treatments on both burned and 
unburned plots provided consistently high levels of control across all 4 height 
classes. Effectiveness of other follow-up treatments decreased with increasing 
height. Mean eastern redcedar mortality (%) 1 year after the burns and follow-up treatments is 
presented below:</p>

FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS:</a>

<br />

This study was conducted to evaluate  efficacy and cost efficiency of broadcast prescribed 
fire alone and in conjunction with supplemental control measures for trees 
escaping prescribed fire. The burned/control treatment was the least expensive. 
Costs for burned/herbicide and burned/mechanical were not significantly 
different (p&lt;0.1). Broadcast burning combined with other treatments was more 
effective and cost efficient than unburned treatments.



<p>
A fire-return interval for effective eastern redcedar control was estimated. 
Because broadcast burning can be expected to kill nearly 90% of trees &lt;1 m tall 
and mortality diminishes with increasing height, the fire-return interval should 
be short enough to capture trees recruited since the last fire. Excessively 
short intervals, however, increase cost and management complications. This study 
suggests that 8 years may be the optimum fire return interval for eastern 
redcedar control in the Nebraska Loess Hills when follow-up treatments are used 
on trees &gt;3 m tall that survive fire.

Many birds and small mammals eat the berrylike cones of eastern redcedar, 
especially in winter [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>]. Wildlife species that eat eastern redcedar

opossums, and coyotes [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>]. Deer may browse the abundant foliage of 
eastern redcedar when no other food is available [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>], and

<b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Cover value:</font></b> 
As an evergreen, eastern redcedar provides good nesting and roosting 
cover for many birds [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>]. These include nest sites for Cooper's hawks 
[<a href="#135">135</a>] and roosting sites for eastern screech-owls [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>], short-eared owls [<a href="#19">19</a>], 
and saw-whet owls [<a href="#120">120</a>]. Dense thickets of eastern redcedar provide good

<span class="subframeName">
<a name="VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES">
VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES:</a>
</span>
<br />

Eastern redcedar establishes well on abandoned surface mines, agricultural fields, 
and logging sites [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>] and is used to recover highly eroded, nutrient-poor soils 
[<a href="#124">124</a>]. Use of eastern redcedar for rehabilitating strip-mines is most effective 
in calcareous spoils due to its slow growth on acid banks [<a href="#84">84</a>]. 
Many cultivars of eastern redcedar are available, with variations primarily 
based on overall tree shape and the color of female cones [<a href="#124">124</a>]. Greater planting 
success is likely with seed sources of geographic proximity [<a href="#108">108</a>]. Planting 
recommendations include storing seed in fruit for 1 year, then 
cleaning, scarifying and sowing in the fall. Alternatively, seed can be stored 
in fruit for 1 year then cleaned and stratified in peat for 100 days at 41 
degrees Fahrenheit (5 <sup>o</sup>C) and sown in the spring or stratified outdoors 
in the shade from May until sown in the fall [<a href="#63">63</a>].

<p>
Seeds of junipers (<i>Juniperus</i> spp.) have both seed coat and embryo 
dormancy [<a href="#81">81</a>]. Maximum germination of eastern redcedar in minimum time may be 
achieved by treatment to increase seedcoat permeability and stratification [<a href="#46">46</a>]. 
Eastern redcedar germination is improved by a combination of warm and cold 
stratification. Either 45 days of warm stratification followed by 60 days of 
cold stratification, or 60 days warm followed by 45 days of cold stratification 
yield best results. In lab tests, germination without stratification did not occur at 
temperatures above 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 <sup>o</sup>C) [<a href="#14">14</a>]. For storage, 
cleaned eastern redcedar seeds should be dried to 7% moisture content and stored 
at 20 degrees Fahrenheit (-7 <sup>o</sup>C) [<a href="#46">46</a>].</p>


<p>
Commercial nurseries use propagation by rooted cuttings and grafting for 
vegetative reproduction of eastern redcedar [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>].

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="OTHER USES">
OTHER USES:</a>
</span>
<br />

The aromatic oils found in eastern redcedar heartwood repel clothing moths and 
are widely used in perfumes [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>]. Aromatic oils are toxic to some ant species 
(Argentine ant and odorous house ant), and eastern redcedar mulch is effective in 
discouraging ant colonization [<a href="#87">87</a>]. Eastern redcedar oils are also effective 
in repelling Formosan subterranean termites [<a href="#142">142</a>]. Heartwood extractives may inhibit growth 
of fungi and bacteria [<a href="#83">83</a>]. Eastern redcedar heartwood has approximately 10 times 
the oil extractives of sapwood [<a href="#137">137</a>]. Due to a higher proportion of heartwood to sapwood 
in closed-canopy stands of eastern redcedar, trees grown under closed stand conditions 
may contain 4 to 5 times as much oil in the bolewood as open-grown trees of the same diameter 
[<a href="#137">137</a>]. </p>


<p>
Eastern redcedar is commonly planted in shelterbelts, windbreaks, and snow 
fences [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>]. It also used for Christmas trees [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>] 
and ornamental plantings [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Wood Products:</b></font> 
Eastern redcedar heartwood is resistant to attack by termites and has greater 
commercial value than sapwood [<a href="#4">4</a>]. The principal product of 
eastern redcedar is fenceposts [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>], though it is also used for lumber [<a href="#17">17</a>], 
poles, boats, paneling, closets, chests, and pencils [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>]. 
The aromatic heartwood is commonly used for chests or closet lining [<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>]. 
On most sites, eastern redcedar grows slowly, and long rotations are 
required to produce conventional sawlogs. However, because the wood is used for 
small items and there is wide latitude in acceptable defects, shortening of 
rotations and intermediate harvesting of merchantable wood are possible. About 
20 to 30 years are required for posts and 40 to 60 years for sawtimber [<a href="#79">79</a>].

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Thinning eastern redcedar windbreaks results in increased diameter and height 
growth of remaining trees, proportional to the amount of release [<a href="#20">20</a>]. 
Thinning is also useful in maintaining eastern redcedar glades where the 
hardwood understory is not well established. Harvest opens the stand and exposes 
seedlings to higher light intensity and potentially eliminates the 
shade-tolerant successional species. However, where successional species are 
well established, thinning may hasten succession [<a href="#99">99</a>].

<p>
Eastern redcedar severely limits forage beneath its canopy but has little effect on 
forage production outside the canopy [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>]. At high tree densities, canopy closure 
is rapid and results in low plant diversity [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>]. The Flint Hills area in 
eastern Kansas consists of tallgrass prairie invaded by eastern redcedar. One 
study found a significant negative relationship between species richness and 
tree density (p&lt;0.0001), as well as significantly fewer herbaceous species 
(p&lt;0.0001) under the eastern redcedar canopy than outside the canopy. Eastern 
redcedar forests had a 99% decrease in herbaceous production compared to the 
tallgrass prairie [<a href="#22">22</a>]. In Nebraska, many plant community dominants of the bluestem 
prairie are reduced under eastern redcedar cover [<a href="#51">51</a>]. At 2 tallgrass 
prairie sites in Nebraska, studies estimated that herbaceous biomass production 
under eastern redcedar canopies averaged 83% less than in the interstitial 
spaces, possibly due to an 85% reduction in light and 11.5% reduction in soil 
moisture [<a href="#113">113</a>]. In tallgrass prairies, it is realistic to expect yields of 4,000 
pounds forage per acre  per year. With 200 eastern redcedar seedlings per acre 
(500 seedlings/ha), yield will decrease to 2,200 pounds per acre per year. Five 
hundred seedlings per acre (1,250 seedlings/ha) reduce annual forage production 
to 600 pounds per acre [<a href="#117">117</a>]. Analysis of aerial photos from the Flint Hills of 
eastern Kansas indicated that eastern redcedar can expand and convert tallgrass 
prairie to a closed-canopy forest in as little as 40 years [<a href="#22">22</a>]. Loss of forage 
may contribute to soil erosion and decreased water infiltration [<a href="#17">17</a>]. </p>


<p>
Eastern redcedar may produce allelochemicals that affect establishment of at 
least some prairie species. In a Nebraska study, establishment of finger 
coreopsis (<i>Coreopsis palmata</i>) from seed collected beneath eastern 
redcedar trees was significantly lower (95% confidence interval) than 
establishment from seed collected adjacent to the trees (84% germination v. 0%) 
[<a href="#116">116</a>].</p>


<p>
Mechanical treatments that sever or dig up eastern redcedar provide effective 
control due to eastern redcedar's inability to sprout [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>].</p>


<p>
Eastern redcedar is resistant to most foliar herbicides, though soil-applied 
herbicides may provide effective control on small acreages [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>]. Eastern 
redcedar is relatively insensitive to foliar application of 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D 
[<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>]. Indiscriminate spraying of these herbicides to reduce woody species 
and convert areas to grassland may eliminate hardwood associates from stands while 
releasing eastern redcedar and promoting eastern redcedar's dominance [<a href="#46">46</a>]. In 
studies at Leavenworth Barrens Nature Preserve, Indiana, eastern redcedar 
survived girdling combined with glyphosate application [<a href="#1">1</a>]. In an 
Oklahoma study, paraquat foliar herbicide killed up to 90% of the crown of small 
trees (2.5 to 5 feet (0.8-1.5 m) tall) but as little as 30% of the crown of 
large trees (8-16 feet (2.5-5.0 m) tall) [<a href="#42">42</a>]. Other studies have found that 
foliar-stem treatments with picloram alone or in combination with 2,4,5-T or 2,4-D were 
effective in controlling eastern redcedar [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>]. Soil applied herbicides, 
particularly picloram, may be more effective for eastern redcedar control [<a href="#95">95</a>]. 
In 1 study, soil spot applications of undiluted picloram achieved 
48 to 100% mortality of eastern redcedar by 18 months posttreatment. However, 
the use of liquid picloram may be ineffective where trees are taller than 15 
feet (5 m) or where excessive litter could prevent root zone penetration of the 
chemical [<a href="#56">56</a>]. A Nebraska study demonstrated variable control of 
eastern redcedar using soil applications of hexazinone (68-90% mortality), picloram 
(70-94% mortality), and tebuthiuron (71-90% mortality), based on application 
rate and tree height [<a href="#112">112</a>]. Soil-applied herbicides may be more effective when 
used as follow-up treatments to broadcast burning [<a href="#93">93</a>].</p>


<p>
Eastern redcedar is particularly suited to conditions coincident with heavy 
grazing [<a href="#126">126</a>]. Grazing of the tallgrass prairie into late summer or early fall 
leaves little standing vegetation to support fires with sufficient intensity to 
kill eastern redcedar the following spring. This management practice promotes the 
continued establishment and growth of eastern redcedar in the grasslands, even 
in areas that are frequently burned [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>]. However, eastern redcedar roots 
are damaged by the hooves of grazing animals and browsing may severely limit 
seedling and sapling height growth [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>]. Some authors note that increased 
stocking rates of cattle may decrease eastern redcedar invasion. Mice, rabbits, 
and deer may also damage seedlings [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>].</p>


<p>
Several insects damage eastern redcedar but rarely cause serious permanent 
damage. Roots of seedlings are very susceptible to attack by nematodes and 
grubs. Bagworms and spruce spider mites can completely defoliate eastern 
redcedar, and it is susceptible to some bark beetles and several 
boring insects and root weevils. Eastern redcedar, especially when weakened by 
stress or insects, is very susceptible to damage by root rot fungi as well as 
cedar rust fungi that attack the stem and foliage [<a href="#79">79</a>]. The most 
commonly known and widely spread species for which eastern redcedar is an 
alternate host is cedar-apple rust, which produces conspicuous 
gall-like growths on the plant and is a serious pathogen of cultivated apples 
[<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>]. Specific insect pests and diseases are identified 
by Lawson [<a href="#79">79</a>].
