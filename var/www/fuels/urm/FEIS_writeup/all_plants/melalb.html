<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The scientific name of white sweetclover is variously reported
as:

     Melilotus alba Ders. [<a href="#32">32</a>]
     Melilotus alba Medicus [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>]
     Melilotus alba Medikus [<a href="#1">1</a>]    
     Melilotus albus Ders. ex Lam. [<a href="#39">39</a>]

Without regard to authority, Melilotus alba is the most commonly
used binomial.

European and Asian material exhibits much variation and may be divided
into several subspecies.  Plants in North America, however, probably
descended from relatively few introductions and exhibit much less
variation.  There are no recognized subspecies or varieties in North
America.

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Melilotus alba
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
White sweetclover is native to Europe and western Asia.  It was probably
introduced into North America by early settlers and was first recorded
in the United States in 1739 [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Its widespread use as bee pasture,
in agriculture, and for soil stabilization hastened its spread across
North America.  Today it is found in Alaska, Hawaii, every Canadian
province and territory, and in all of the contiguous United States [<a href="#34">34</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
White sweetclover is eaten by all classes of livestock.  It is grown for
hay, used as pasture, and is seeded with other legumes to improve
western rangelands [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  The hay is palatable and nutritious but
must be thoroughly cured.  Partially cured hay can produce a hemorrhagic
syndrome when ingested by cattle.  The toxic substance, dicoumarol,
which occurs only in moldy hay, results from the conversion of nontoxic
coumarin by fungi in moist plants [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Sheep and horses are less
susceptible than cattle to the disease.  Bloat can occur in livestock
pastured on white sweetclover, but it occurs less frequently than
animals pastured on alfalfa (Medicago sativa) or true clovers (Trifolium
spp.) [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Big game animals, including elk, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, mule deer,
and white-tailed deer consume this plant when it is available
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  The seeds are eaten by numerous species of birds and
small mammals, and are especially common in the diets of quail and
partridge [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  Muskrats feed on the roots when other preferred
foods are scarce.  Rabbits eat the leaves and stems [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
White sweetclover palatability to livestock and big game animals is
moderately high to high during spring and early summer [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].
As plants mature, however, they become less palatable because they
become woody and the amount of "bitter tasting" coumarin increases [<a href="#35">35</a>].
When in bloom in the summer, wildlife and livestock "relish" the flowers
[<a href="#13">13</a>].

Palatability of white sweetclover in several western states is rated as
follows [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>]:

                     CO    KS      MT         ND    UT    WY

Waterfowl           ----  ----    ----       good  good  good


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
White sweetclover has a well-balanced complement of nutrients during
early growth stages, and when cut and cured properly, makes a nutritious
and palatable hay.  On a dry matter basis, white sweetclover hay
resembles alfalfa hay in metabolizable energy and most digestible
nutrients, but is slightly higher in digestible crude protein [<a href="#31">31</a>].
Crude protein content of hay often exceeds 15 percent on a dry matter
basis [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Protein content and digestible protein of dry white
sweetclover aerial parts were reported as follows by the National
Academy of Sciences [<a href="#22">22</a>]:

crude protein                   15.0 %
digestible protein for cattle    9.9 %
digestible protein for goats    10.6 %
digestible protein for horses   10.3 %
digestible protein for rabbits  10.3 %
digestible protein for sheep    10.8 %


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
White sweetclover provides good cover for small mammals, waterfowl,
quail, and ring-necked pheasant [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].

Wildlife cover values for several western states are as follows [<a href="#6">6</a>]:

                       MT    ND    UT    WY

Pronghorn             ----  good  fair  poor

Waterfowl             ----  good  fair  good


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Seeded white sweetclover generally makes rapid growth, quickly providing
vegetative cover on disturbed areas.  Its chief rehabilitation use is
for erosion control and revegetation of mined lands [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  It grows
well on calcareous and alkaline mine spoils but is not recommended for
use on acidic spoils [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  It is especially important as a
preparatory crop on mined lands because it incorporates large amounts of
nitrogen and organic matter into the soil, which is made available to
succeeding plants [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Scarified seed is generally sown in the fall
in southern latitudes and in the early spring in northern latitudes.
White sweetclover planting information has been reported in detail
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
White sweetclover makes valuable bee pasture and has long been
recognized as one of the most important of all plants for honey
production [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].

Besides its use for hay or pasture, white sweetclover is also used in
agriculture as a soil improvement crop.  Because of its symbiotic
relationship with Rhizobium bacteria, pure stands may add up to 70
pounds of nitrogen per acre (78 kg/ha) to the soil [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Control:  First-year white sweetclover plants have a "special growth
period" at the end of summer, when rapid root growth and food storage
take place [<a href="#21">21</a>].  This begins about September 1 in the Midwest.  Plants
mowed just prior to the start of this special growth period experience
high rates of winter mortality.  In Ohio, winter kill resulting from
top-growth removal at different times of the year was as follows [<a href="#31">31</a>]:

    Mortality                      Cutting Date

75% winter kill         Sept 9 (beginning of root growth period)
53% winter kill         Sept 26 (middle of root growth period)
12% winter kill         Nov 3 (end of root growth period)
 5% winter kill         plants not cut

Additionally, clipped plants that survived the winter showed poor vigor
the following spring, and many died during the summer of their second
year.  

White sweetclover is easily killed with phenoxy herbicides such as 2,4-D
or dicamba, but soil-stored seed is unaffected [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Grazing:  For best use of pasture, first year plants can be lightly
grazed in the spring when 10 to 12 inches (25-30 cm) high, but should
not be grazed heavily until after late September.  Pastures dominated by
second year plants should be grazed in the spring and maintained at a
height of about 12 inches (30 cm), which prevents plants from becoming
woody and unpalatable [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].

Insects and Disease:  The sweetclover weevil is the most damaging insect
affecting white sweetclover.  In Montana, severe infestations have
resulted in complete failure of new seedlings [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Second-year plants
are susceptible to root rot [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Melilotus alba
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Annual forms of white sweetclover exist, but the plant is primarily
biennial.  First-year plants are comprised entirely of vegetative growth
(usually a single stem) and overwinter as buds on the caudex.
Second-year plants have a strongly developed taproot which may exceed 50
inches (120 cm) in depth, and 1 to 10 upright or ascending flowering
stems from 3 to 8.5 feet in height [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  The inflorescence is a
raceme with 40 to 80 white flowers.  The fruit is a one-seeded pod.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte (biennial form)
   Therophyte (annual form)


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
White sweetclover is a good seed producer.  Seed production estimates of
14,000 to 350,000 seeds per plant have been reported.  Large plants
growing in the open in Ontario produced between 200,000 and 350,000
seeds each.  The fruits are shed in the fall, and are dispersed by
gravity, strong winds, and water.  The seeds float, and thus rain wash
and stream flow may be an important means of dispersal [<a href="#34">34</a>].  A large
percentage of the seeds have a hard seed coat and can remain viable in
the soil for more than 20 years [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Natural scarification occurs
through fluctuating freezing and thawing temperatures or by heat from a
fire [<a href="#15">15</a>].  New seedlings are found almost any month during the growing
season, but only spring-emerged seedlings survive the winter [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Vegetative reproduction does not occur
naturally.  If second-year plants are cut, new growth must come from
buds on the stems rather than the caudex [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
White sweetclover is shade intolerant and grows in a wide variety of
open habitats but is most common along roads and railways, and in
prairies, arid rangelands, fields, and waste places [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Its
associates are too numerous to list, but it often grows with yellow
sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis) in the West [<a href="#1">1</a>].  It is not tolerant
of continuous flooding but occasionally grows on open, gravelly
riverbanks that experience brief spring flooding.  White sweetclover
grows on a wide range of soil types and textures from clay to dune sand
and river gravels [<a href="#34">34</a>].  It is most commonly found on calcareous soils.
It grows poorly on acid soils [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  It requires sufficient moisture
for establishment but is thereafter very drought tolerant [<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

White sweetclover is an early colonizer of disturbed sites.  It is
common on strip-mined lands in the central and eastern United States
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Turkington [<a href="#34">34</a>] reported that it may be eliminated from an area
within 2 years if the ground surface is covered by perennial species
because seedlings cannot survive in a perennial sward.  Other
researchers have detailed its persistence in many native and established
tallgrass prairies; however, its abundance in these communities was
probably due to periodic disturbance (fire) [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  It was found in
oldfields in Ohio but disappeared from sites when tree cover became
continuous [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
First-year plants:  Nearly all energy in the early part of the growing
season is put into top-growth.  In late summer, however, the tops grow
very little, while the roots grow dramatically.  This is the "critical
growth period" when plants allocate most energy to root growth.  Root
weight of first-year plants grown near Ames, Iowa, was as follows [<a href="#21">21</a>]:

     Date      Root Weight (grams)

     June 4           24.5
     July 3          118
     August 4        430
     September 3     448
     October 3      1609
     November 6     2388

Second-year flowering shoots become noticeable as root crown buds about
the time rapid root growth begins.  First-year shoots are killed by
freezing temperatures in the fall or winter.

Second-year plants:  In the spring of the second year, several shoots
arise from the root crown and elongate rapidly.  By midsummer, each
shoot bears many flowers, and flowering may continue until early fall.
Flowering for several locations has been reported as follows [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].

       Location          Flowering time

     Colorado            June through September
     Montana             July through August 
     North Dakota        June through September
     Utah                May through July
     Wyoming             June through September
     New England         June 9 to September 25  

Blooming usually occurs earlier during hot, dry years [<a href="#40">40</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Melilotus alba
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
White sweetclover seeds have hard, impermeable seed coats, and may
remain dormant in soil seed banks for years.  The heat from a fire
breaks the seed coat, allowing the seed to germinate.  Where soil-stored
seed is present, burning is stimulatory, resulting in abundant seed
germination and seedling establishment [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

Second-year plants present as buds on the caudex may survive
dormant-season burns, as they are located about 2 inches (5 cm) below
the ground surface [<a href="#34">34</a>].  On the Curtis Prairie in Wisconsin,
second-year white sweetclover was abundant in the spring following
dormant season fall burns [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Actively growing second-year plants,
however, are easily killed by fire.

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Melilotus alba
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Once the crown buds of second-year plants have expanded, growth
originates from branch tips or branch axils.  Thus once shoot growth has
begun, fire kills second-year plants simply by removing or scorching the
growing points, or on large individuals by charring the stem base
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Numerous studies have shown that spring or summer burning in
prairies and old fields effectively kills most second-year plants.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
Burning of a remnant tallgrass prairie in Minnesota on May 1, when
second-year white sweetclover plants were 2 to 6 inches (5-15 cm) tall,
resulted in the virtual elimination of second-year plants from the site.
July burning on another portion of the same prairie similarly resulted
in killing all first- and second-year plants.  Although some large
second-year plants were not completely consumed by fire, none sprouted
by early September [<a href="#15">15</a>].

In the summer following early or mid-May burning on the Curtis Prairie
in Wisconsin, frequency of second-year plants ranged from 5 to 26
percent on burned plots and 93 to 100 percent on unburned plots [<a href="#18">18</a>].

In grass-dominated old fields in eastern North Dakota, late June burning
"completely eradicated" second-year white sweetclover [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Numerous studies have documented that fire stimulates germination of
white sweetclover seed [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Seedling establishment
generally occurs as follows after burning at different times of the
year:

Spring burning - rapid seed germination and abundant seedling
establishment occur shortly after burning.  Additional seeds germinate
in the summer of the first postburn growing season, but few
late-germinating seedlings survive the winter.

Summer burning - poor to fair seed germination can occur after summer
burning, but few of these late-germinating seedlings survive the winter.
Additional seeds germinate in postfire year 2.

Fall burning - abundant germination occurs in the spring following fall
burning. 

Following spring burning of grasslands, frequency and cover of
first-year white sweetclover is much higher on burned than unburned
areas during the first postfire growing season.  During postfire year 2,
first-year plants are rare, while second-year plants are abundant.
White sweetclover frequency declines after postfire year 3.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
White sweetclover thrives under a management program of periodic spring
burning on a 2-year or longer cycle, which has been a common practice in
many managed grasslands.  Under this regime, soil-stored white
sweetclover seed is scarified, resulting in abundant seedling
establishment.  The plants then overwinter, produce abundant seed in
their second year, and replenish the soil seed bank.  Because of these
life history attributes, the use of fire to suppress white sweetclover
is possible, but several successive annual or biennial burns are
probably required to exhaust the seed supply.  Dormant-season burns,
whether early spring or late fall, are not recommended because they do
not kill overwintering second-year plants.

Heitlinger [<a href="#15">15</a>] recommended the following strategies to suppress white
sweetclover and reduce seed supplies in tallgrass prairie: (1) burn
annually about early May (for Minnesota) when second-year shoots are
clearly visible, (2) burn every second year in early July before seed of
second-year plants ripens, or (3) burn annually in early September near
the beginning of the critical growth period [see Management
Considerations and Seasonal Development for more information on the
critical growth period].

In Wisconsin, a combination of an April burn followed the next year by a
May burn was more successful in reducing white sweetclover than other
burning combinations.  Heavily infested paririe stands where this
burning combination was conducted twice, separated by 2 years without
burning, became almost completly free of white sweet clover [<a href="#18">18</a>].
