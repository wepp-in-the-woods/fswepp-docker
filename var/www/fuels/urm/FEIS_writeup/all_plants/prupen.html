Pin cherry occurs from Newfoundland and southern Labrador west across Canada to 
British Columbia and southern Northwest Territories. It is widespread in New 
England and the Lake States; south of Pennsylvania it occurs only in the 
Appalachian Mountains to northern Georgia and eastern Tennessee. Scattered 
stands are also found in the Rocky Mountains, south to Colorado and southeast to 
the Black Hills of South Dakota [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. <i>Prunus p.</i> var. <i>pensylvanica</i> 
occurs throughout this range, while<i> P. p.</i> var. <i>saximontana</i> is 
restricted to British Columbia, Alberta, Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado [<a href="#72">72</a>].
<a href="https://climchange.cr.usgs.gov/data/atlas/little/">The U.S. Geological Survey</a>
provides a distributional map of pin cherry.

In the northern part of its range, pin cherry occurs in virtually every forest 
type. It is characteristically a short-lived, successional tree 
in eastern hemlock (<i>Tsuga 
canadensis</i>), northern hardwood, and spruce (<i>Picea </i>spp.)-fir (<i>Abies</i> 
spp.) forests [<a href="#53">53</a>]. Pin cherry may also occur in pure stands, or more commonly, represent a majority of 
stocking [<a href="#55">55</a>].

<p>Pin cherry is found in the boreal forest region with white spruce (<i>P. glauca</i>), 
black spruce (<i>P. mariana</i>), balsam fir (<i>A. balsamea</i>), paper 
birch (<i>Betula papyrifera</i>), quaking aspen (<i>Populus tremuloides</i>), 
chokecherry (<i>Prunus virginiana</i>), mountain maple (<i>Acer spicatum</i>), 
speckled alder (<i>Alnus rugosa</i>), American green alder (<i>A. crispa</i> ssp. <i>
crispa</i>), oblongfruit serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier bartramiana</i>), roundleaf 
serviceberry (<i>A. sanguinea</i>), California hazel (<i>Corylus cornuta </i>
var.<i> californica</i>), Bebb willow (<i>Salix bebbiana</i>), northern mountain-ash (<i>Sorbus 
decora</i>), red raspberry (<i>Rubus idaeus</i>), skunk currant (<i>Ribes glandulosum</i>), wild sarsaparilla 
(<i>Aralia nudicaulis</i>), fireweed (<i>Epilobium angustifolium</i>), whorled 
wood aster (<i>Oclemena</i> <i>acuminata</i>), 
bunchberry (<i>Cornus canadensis</i>), red-osier dogwood (<i>C. sericea</i>), 
highbush cranberry (<i>Viburnum edule</i>), starflower (<i>Trientalis borealis</i>), and goldthread (<i>Coptis 
groenlandica</i>) [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>].</p>

<p>In the northern hardwoods region, frequent associates of pin cherry include quaking and bigtooth aspen 
(<i>Populus grandidentata</i>); paper and 
yellow birch (<i>B. alleghaniensis</i>); striped, red, and sugar maple (<i>Acer 
pensylvanicum</i>, <i>A. rubrum</i>, and <i>A. saccharum</i>); American beech (<i>Fagus 
grandifolia</i>), basswood (<i>Tilia americana</i>), eastern hemlock, northern red oak 
(<i>Quercus rubra</i>), balsam 
fir, and red spruce (<i>Picea rubens</i>) [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. Prior to crown closure, raspberries (<i>Rubus</i> 
spp.) and red elderberry (<i>Sambucus racemosa </i>ssp. <i>pubens</i>) are also abundant. Following stand closure, 
these species are replaced by 
shade-tolerant shrubs such as hobblebush (<i>V.</i> <i>lantanoides</i>) and Canada yew 
(<i>Taxus canadensis</i>). Other common understory 
plants include dwarf raspberry (<i>R.</i> <i>arcticus</i> ssp. <i>acaulis</i>), wild sarsaparilla, whorled wood 
 aster,  bracken fern (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>), spinulose woodfern (<i>Dryopteris</i>
<i>carthusiana</i>), and shining clubmoss (<i>Huperzia</i> <i>lucidula</i>) [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. In the Central and Lake States, 
chokecherry (<i>Prunus virginiana</i>) and black 
cherry (<i>Prunus serotina</i>) are particularly common associates [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>].</p>

<p>In the southern and mid-Appalachian mountains, common pin cherry associates 
are eastern hemlock; red spruce; Fraser fir (<i>Abies fraseri</i>); yellow and sweet birch (<i>B. lenta</i>); 
American beech; pignut hickory (<i>Carya glabra</i>); sugar, red, mountain, and 
striped maple; black cherry; American mountain-ash 
(<i>Sorbus americana</i>); and northern red oak. Understory associates include 
downy serviceberry (<i>A. arborea</i>), Allegheny serviceberry (<i>A. laevis</i>), Canadian serviceberry 
(<i>A. canadensis</i>), flowering and alternate-leaf dogwood (<i>Cornus florida</i> and <i>C. alternifolia</i>), 
red elderberry, southern bush honeysuckle (<i>Diervilla 
sessilifolia</i>),  mountain 
holly (<i>Ilex montana</i>), mountain-laurel (<i>Kalmia latifolia</i>), 
hobblebush, huckleberry (<i>Vaccinium</i> spp.), thornless blackberry (<i>R. canadensis</i>), 
red raspberry, and Appalachian gooseberry (<i>Ribes 
rotundifolium</i>) [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>].</p>

<p>Pin cherry is also common in 
heath balds adjacent to southern spruce-fir forests, occurring in thickets with 
American mountain-ash, hawthorn (<i>Crataegus</i> spp.), mountain maple, 
treefern (<i>Dicksonia </i>spp.), currants (<i>Ribes</i> spp.), raspberries (<i>Rubus</i> 
spp.), sedges (<i>Carex </i>spp.), Catawba rosebay (<i>Rhododendron catawbiense</i>), 
rosebay (<i>R. maximum</i>), minniebush (<i>Menziesia pilosa</i>), and 
mountain-laurel [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>].</p>

The following description of pin cherry provides 
characteristics that may be relevant to fire ecology, and is not meant for 
identification. Keys for identification are available (e.g. [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>]).

<p>Pin cherry is a shrub or small tree [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>]. It generally has a straight trunk and a narrow, round-topped crown 
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>], though it may form thickets [<a href="#109">109</a>]. Branches, at first 
ascending, become more or less horizontal and spreading with age. Pin cherry 
generally grows 15 to 50 feet (5-15 m) tall and 4 to 20 inches (10-51 cm) in 
diameter [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>]. However, trees up to 100 feet tall (30 m) 
have been found in the southern Appalachians [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>], with the largest size 
attained on western slopes of the Great Smoky Mountains [<a href="#53">53</a>]. In 
western North America, pin cherry (<i>P. p</i>. var. <i>saximontana</i>) may be 
generally smaller with an arching shrub form, growing 5 to 15 feet (1.5-4.5 m) tall and spreading 5 
to10 feet (1.5-3 m) [<a href="#23">23</a>].</p>

<p>Pin cherry has thin foliage [<a href="#63">63</a>], with leaves 1.5 to 4.3 inches (4-11 cm) 
long [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>] and 0.5 to 1.75 inches (1-4.5 cm) wide [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>]. Flowers 
grow in small clusters of 5 to 7 with individual flowers 0.4 inch (1 cm) across. 
Fruit are drupes 0.15 to 0.3 inch (4-8 mm) across with 1 large seed 
[<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. Seeds are 0.15 to 0.24 inch (4-6 mm) in 
diameter with a thick seed coat. There are 13,600 to 22,700 seeds per pound 
(30,000-50,000 seeds/kg) [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. </p>

<p>Pin cherry has a shallow root system [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. In New 
England, root systems in 4- to 14-year-old stands were less than 14 inches (36 
cm) deep and had many lateral branches. In West Virginia, root systems of wind-thrown trees 25 years old were  
confined to the upper 24 inches 
(61 cm) of soil. Once a seedling reaches a height of about 3 feet (1 m), lateral 
roots begin rapid growth. [<a href="#143">143</a>]. Though <i>Prunus</i> spp. have been reported to be ectomycorrhizal, studies by 
Malloch and Malloch [<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>] in Ontario found 
no evidence of ectomycorrhizae in pin cherry roots. Endomycorrhizae were 
generally scarce in pin cherry roots, and most often absent altogether [<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].</p>

<p>Pin cherry is short lived [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>], 
maturing rapidly and dying off at 20 to 40 years [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>]. Stands 
may begin to have a pulse of dead pin cherry wood deposition 15 years after 
disturbance. Pin cherry allocates relatively less carbon to 
structural stem issues and to fine roots than do other hardwoods, contributing 
to the common occurrence of stem snap at the root crown. Possible low 
production of defense compounds may encourage damage by insects and pathogens [<a href="#68">68</a>].</p>

Pin cherry regenerates by both seed and sprouts. However, in a 25-year-old Maine 
hardwood forest 1 year after clearcutting, pin cherry was represented primarily 
by seedlings, not sprouts [<a href="#144">144</a>].

<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Breeding system:</font></b> 
The flowers of nearly all <i>Prunus</i> species are bisexual [<a href="#57">57</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Pollination:</b></font> <i>Prunus</i> 
species are insect-pollinated [<a href="#57">57</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Seed production: </font></b>
Pin cherry produces abundant seed at early ages [<a href="#63">63</a>]. Sexual maturity may be reached as 
early as 2 years [<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>], though large quantities of fruit are generally 
not produced for several years later [<a href="#143">143</a>]. Fruit is produced annually with large 
crops occurring every 2 to 3 years [<a href="#87">87</a>]. By the time pin cherry dies off (20 to 
40 years), sufficient numbers of seeds have been produced and disseminated in a 
dormant condition for the reestablishment of pin cherry following disturbance 
[<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>]. Despite its short life span, fruit production of pin cherry is high. 
In New Hampshire, annual fruit production of 15-year-old, open-grown trees in 
pure stands was estimated at 1,118,000 
fruits/acre (2,762,500/ha). For 25-year-old pin cherry stands in the same area, annual seed production was 
940,700 seeds/acre (2,324,500/ha) [<a href="#143">143</a>]. Seed production peaks between 10 and 25 years, declining thereafter [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seed dispersal:</b></font> 
Pin cherry seeds are dispersed by birds, small mammals [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>], 
and gravity [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seed banking:</b></font> 
As part of its reproductive strategy, pin cherry maintains a bank of seeds in the soil&nbsp;that 
remain viable for many years [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>]. Seeds  accumulate over prolonged periods (e.g. 50 years) [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>], 
and most pin cherry seeds available for establishment following disturbance in 
mature stands (~100 years) are the result of seed banking rather than recently 
dispersed seed [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>]. In a clearcut 
Maine hardwood forest, pin cherry seedlings were numerous although occurrence in surrounding stands and 
presumably in the preharvest stand was low [<a href="#144">144</a>]. Estimates of pin cherry seed contained in the duff of 
middle-aged northeastern deciduous forests range from 100,000 to &gt;1.8 million 
per acre (250,000-4.5 million/ha) [<a href="#11">11</a>]. In 2 areas in New Hampshire, the average number 
of viable pin cherry seeds in the forest floor ranged from 139,676/acre 
(345,000/ha) to 200,000/acre (494,000/ha). In other New Hampshire stands, 
depending on stand age, the number of viable seeds in the forest floor ranged 
from 4,050 to 450,000/acre (10,000-1,110,500/ha) [<a href="#143">143</a>]. The distribution of pin cherry seeds in the forest 
floor is influenced by prior 
colonization of the site by pin cherry; dissemination of fruits by birds; and 
small mammal caches that tend to shift the distribution of seeds toward more or less 
discrete aggregations [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>]. Longevity of buried pin cherry seeds has been estimated at 50 to 
100 years [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>]; pin cherry establishment after the 
removal of older stands relies primarily on seed dispersal into disturbed areas [<a href="#55">55</a>].&nbsp; Seeds lose viability 
over time, so the pin cherry seed 
bank is eventually depleted in the absence of large-scale disturbance. The seed 
bank may persist at least 30 years after production ceases with little depletion, 
but is depleted gradually thereafter [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>]. 
Seed bank losses are the result of  seed rot and consumption by small 
mammals [<a href="#32">32</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Germination:</font></b> 
Pin cherry germination requires 1) the aging of the endocarp, either to break down an 
inhibitor or to increase permeability; and 2) an altered microclimate conducive 
to germination [<a href="#87">87</a>]. Dormancy of pin cherry seeds is caused by an initial physiological inhibition 
for several years followed by a secondary dormancy that remains until 
germination is stimulated by disturbance [<a href="#133">133</a>]. Because pin 
cherry seeds require open conditions for germination, there is often a prolonged 
delay between seed dispersal and germination [<a href="#32">32</a>]. Pin cherry seed 
banks may germinate in response to changes in soil temperature, light, or other 
triggering factors associated with the formation of a large gap due to 
disturbance [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>]. 
However, the specific aspect of the changed environment that triggers 
germination is not known [<a href="#32">32</a>]. A study of stand development in 
Nova Scotia found higher incidence of pin cherry regeneration on soil disturbed 
by logging machinery than on undisturbed soil [<a href="#139">139</a>]. Laboratory 
experiments indicate that germination in open areas may be related to more 
extreme temperature 
fluctuations [<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>].  Germination may also be promoted by increased 
soluble nitrogen concentrations in the soil, based on increases in pin cherry 
germination following nitrogen (especially nitrate) fertilization [<a href="#11">11</a>].</p> 

<p>The presence of occasional pin cherry seedlings beneath the canopy of 
undisturbed forest suggests that at least some germination occurs on a regular 
or annual basis [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]; however, seedlings 
have been reported to survive only in large openings where light and moisture 
were more available [<a href="#143">143</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seedling establishment/growth:</b></font> 
Pin cherry establishment is directly related to open stand conditions. In 
a study of spruce-balsam fir forest canopy disturbance (spruce 
budworm outbreak), pin cherry established in greater abundance with 100% canopy 
removal than with partial canopy removal [<a href="#99">99</a>]. When established in high 
density, pin cherry grows quickly with early attainment of canopy closure [<a href="#87">87</a>]. When pin cherry occurs in high density (more 
than one 5-foot stem/43 ft<sup>2</sup> (1.5-m/4 m)), it may live longer than when occurring at lower density (less 
than one 5-foot stem/43 ft<sup>2</sup>), because high pin cherry density early in stand 
development delays the time when shade-tolerant species reach a stable 
proportion of the total basal area. Pin cherry develops an early 
height advantage over other species, and as pin cherry density increases, growth 
and survival of other hardwood (black cherry, red maple, sugar maple) 
seedlings decreases. A study of an Allegheny hardwood stand 
found that survival of black cherry, red maple, and sugar maple at age 15 
decreased as the density of pin cherry &gt;5 feet (1.5 m) tall at age 3 increased. 
The height of black cherry and white ash (<i>Fraxinus americana</i>) also decreased [<a href="#110">110</a>]. In dense 
stands, the pin cherry canopy closes in about 3 years, shading out many of the 
other early intolerant species. After 25-30 years, sugar maple, beech and balsam 
fir are the seral species. At intermediate densities, pin cherry may codominate with yellow birch, paper birch, 
and quaking aspen. At low densities, 
dominance is shared by many species including blackberries, striped maple, paper 
and yellow birch, quaking aspen, and stump sprouts of cut trees [<a href="#143">143</a>].</p>

<p>Pin cherry exhibits a strong self-thinning tendency. On a jack pine 
(<i>Pinus banksiana</i>) plantation in Ontario, pin cherry density (sprouting) was 1,440 stems/acre (3,600 stems/ha) 4 years 
after harvest and fell to 488 stems/acre (1,220 stems/ha) 6 years after harvest [<a href="#82">82</a>]. In a study of Allegheny hardwoods, 
pin cherry seedlings ranged from 1,400 
to 78,000 stems/acre (3,500-195,000 stems/ha) 1 year after overstory removal. 
First-year seedlings were less than 5 feet 
(1.5 m) tall. By year 3, stands averaged 6,800 stems/acre (17,000 stems/ha), and trees 
were more than 5 
feet tall. After year 
5, the number of pin cherry stems declined rapidly and only 1,600 stems/acre (4,000 stems/ha) remained 
at year 15. The 15-year-old stems exceeded 39 feet (12 m) in height [<a href="#110">110</a>].</p>

<p>Pin cherry seedlings grow rapidly, especially when young [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>]. It is not uncommon for pin cherry growing on good sites 
in the central Appalachians to reach 8 to 10 inches (20-25 cm) in diameter in 25 
years. Rapid growth is directly related to the amount of light 
received [<a href="#143">143</a>]. In preliminary results, Roberts [<a href="#112">112</a>] found height growth of pin 
cherry seedlings was significantly greater (p&lt;0.05) under partial-canopy (4.4 feet 
(1.3 m) tall) 
and open-canopy (9.8 feet (3 m) tall) conditions than under closed-canopy conditions (1.2 
feet (0.4 m) tall).</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Asexual regeneration:</b></font> 
Once established, pin cherry seedlings may reproduce by sprouting and may form 
thickets [<a href="#53">53</a>]. Pin cherry has a high potential for stem sprouting and root 
suckering after cutting [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. In a Quebec study most of the suckers forming a 
clone emerged 1 to 2 years after the parent stem was cut, with the number of 
suckers per clone ranging from 11 to 32. The largest clone studied covered 153 
square feet (14.25 
m<sup>2</sup>) [<a href="#71">71</a>].</p>

Pin cherry has an elevational range from nearly sea level to over 9,000 feet 
(2,740 m) [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. In the northeastern part of its range, pin cherry is found 
from 100 to 4,080 feet (30-1,240 m) [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>]. In the 
southern Appalachians it generally occurs between 2,500 and 4,500 feet 
(762-1,370 m) [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. 
In the western states, pin cherry is found between 5,000 and 9,300 feet 
(1,520-2,830 m) [<a href="#42">42</a>].

<p>Throughout pin cherry's range, the number of days of 
snow cover ranges from 1 to 10 days in the South to 120+ days in the North [<a href="#53">53</a>]. Mean annual total 
snowfall ranges from 24 inches 
(610 mm) in the southern Appalachians to 100 inches (2,540 mm) in the northern part 
of the range. Average annual precipitation ranges from 16 inches 
(410 mm) in the West to 30 inches (760 mm) in Canada and 80 inches (2,030 mm) in 
the Great Smoky Mountains; average growing seasons vary from 100-210 days [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. 
In the southern Appalachians, the average number of days with minimum temperatures below 
freezing is 90; in the northern and western part of pin cherry's range the 
number of days is more than 180 [<a href="#143">143</a>]. In Colorado, pin cherry is cold 
hardy to -50 <sup>o</sup>F (-45 <sup>o</sup>C) [<a href="#23">23</a>]. As demonstrated 
below, normal daily temperatures vary widely throughout the range of pin cherry 
(data are in <sup>o</sup>F/<sup>o</sup>C) [<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]:</p>

<p>Pin cherry grows on a wide range of soils and drainage classes [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. Generally found on moderately 
coarse to coarse soils [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>], pin cherry grows on 
sites varying from rocky ledges and sandy plains to moist loamy soils [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. Pin cherry sites can be 
characterized as water-shedding 
(rocky ridges, cliffs, dry woods, clearings) or water-receiving (sandy and 
gravelly banks, shores of rivers and lakes) [<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>]. Pin cherry grows well on somewhat dry sites and shallow organic 
layers relatively low in nutrients [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. Soils very low in moisture may result in a shrub 
form of pin cherry [<a href="#66">66</a>]. Though commonly found on mesic sites with nutrient-rich 
soil [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>], pin cherry is generally absent from wet sites [<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. Optimum pH for 
pin cherry is 5.0 to 6.0 [<a href="#53">53</a>], though is also 
grows on more acidic soils [<a href="#67">67</a>].</p>

<p>Pin cherry is shade intolerant [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>]. 
A study of shelterwood harvest in the northern hardwood forest of Vermont found that pin 
cherry increased in abundance with &lt;60% canopy cover [<a href="#60">60</a>]. Pin 
cherry establishes in canopy gaps and 
proliferates with removal of overstory, increasing in density and cover [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>]. 
It is frequent in burned areas, clearings, disturbed areas, roadsides, 
fencerows, and along forest margins [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>]. A New Hampshire study found that pin cherry was 
relatively more abundant in recently created (24 years) gaps, large gaps 
(1,052-2,428 m<sup>2</sup>), and gap centers. Pin cherry abundance increased with gap size [<a href="#91">91</a>]. 
In a New England hardwoods forest, pin cherry growth exceeded 
that of other pioneer species near the center of clearcut openings, while other 
species sometimes grew faster near the side-shade zone at the edges of openings 
[<a href="#126">126</a>].</p>

Pin cherry is an early to mid-seral species, important in both primary and 
secondary succession after fire or harvest [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>]. Pin cherry is common in 
rock- and soil-slide succession, but is usually far more numerous after 
windthrow, logging, or light fires because its presence is highly dependent on 
seed buried in the forest floor [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. Pin cherry does, 
however, colonize through &quot;seeding in&quot; [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>]. It is 
generally restricted to&nbsp;sites that supported forest vegetation prior to 
disturbance; it is not common in abandoned pastures or old fields. 
Pin cherry is further restricted to colonization of open areas larger than about 
0.25 acre (0.1 ha) [<a href="#87">87</a>].

<p>Pin cherry is a particularly common successional species in  northern 
hardwood and spruce-fir 
forest ecosystems, dying out relatively quickly as seral stands develop [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>]. For example, pin cherry 
that established following a landslide in the northeastern 
spruce-fir zone was no longer present in the stand after 40 years [<a href="#50">50</a>]. In northern hardwood forests, 
pin cherry grows quickly after stands 
are cut and is often the tallest species from the 2nd to the 6th year of stand regrowth [<a href="#27">27</a>]. Pin cherry can 
be an effective competitor on disturbed sites [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>] because it employs a vertical competition strategy, 
competing with other species for light by overtopping them due to rapid height 
growth [<a href="#82">82</a>].&nbsp; Pin cherry often dominates regenerating northern hardwood or 
spruce stands (up to 70% of stems) for 15-20 years after disturbance [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>], 
though it may die out sooner [<a href="#48">48</a>]. Pin cherry may also codominate with aspen, 
black cherry, red maple, and white or gray birch [<a href="#53">53</a>].</p>

<p>The pin cherry forest type develops rapidly, forming a closed canopy in 3 to 
7 years and reaching maturity in 20 to 30 years [<a href="#55">55</a>]. Dominance shifts to mature forest species 
after approximately 30 years, and pin cherry rarely persists in stands after 40 
years due to a combination of nutrient limitation, shade 
intolerance, and the relatively short life span of pin cherry [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>]. A 
study in New England hardwoods found pin cherry was 
initially prominent following clearcutting, especially near the center of 
openings, but had died or become moribund after 20 years [<a href="#126">126</a>]. The 
initial density of pin cherry stands, determined by available buried 
seed, is an important determinant of succession. Where pin cherry is very dense, 
canopy closure limits the establishment and growth of other early successional 
species. Succession occurs in 2 distinct phases: the 1st is characterized by an 
almost pure pin cherry overstory and sparse understory; the 2nd phase involves 
the relatively abrupt dominance by shade tolerant species like sugar maple, 
beech, and balsam fir. At intermediate densities, pin cherry may codominate 
with other fast-growing species (e.g. yellow birch, paper birch, quaking aspen, bigtooth aspen), 
with shade-tolerant species gaining dominance gradually because shade-intolerant 
species die and are replaced at different times [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>]. Successional patterns in low-density stands 
of pin cherry are quite variable, primarily because the rate of 
canopy closure is slower [<a href="#87">87</a>]. Repeated disturbance may result in 
persistent dominance of pin cherry or codominance of pin cherry and aspens 
[<a href="#80">80</a>]. </p>

<p>At lower elevations in New England, pin cherry succeeds to aspens, white 
pine, or white pine-northern red oak-red maple. In the southern Appalachians, 
succession is to red spruce, red spruce-Fraser fir, or northern hardwoods [<a href="#55">55</a>]. 
Twenty-five years after a fire in the Southern 
Appalachian spruce-fir forest, pin cherry density was 182 trees per acre (455 
trees/ha), comprising 12.2% 
of total basal area, while Fraser fir had reached 531 stems per acre (1,327 stems/ha) and comprised 
63.8% of total basal area [<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>]. This seral 
community was still several decades from a mature, closed-canopy spruce-fir 
forest. Pin cherry may persist longer on sites where 
severe fire, steep slopes, and shallow soil combine to slow development of 
mature stands [<a href="#117">117</a>].</p>

<p>Pin cherry sequesters nutrients that might otherwise be lost from the 
ecosystem during early stages of succession [<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>]. Rapid establishment 
and growth of pin cherry minimizes nutrient loss by 1) channeling water from 
runoff to evapotranspiration, reducing erosion and nutrient loss; 2) reduction 
in rates of decomposition through moderation of the microclimate during the 
growing season so that the supply of soluble ions available for loss in drainage 
water is reduced; and 3) incorporation into the rapidly developing biomass of 
nutrients that do become available and that may otherwise might be lost from the 
system [<a href="#88">88</a>].</p>

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font> 
Pin cherry has adapted to fire by establishing a soil seed bank that germinates rapidly following fire and 
other disturbance [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>]. Pin cherry seed 
survives most forest fires, and seeds which may be dormant for many years are 
stimulated to germination by the altered  conditions after fire 
[<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>]. Combined with the rapid initial growth of pin cherry seedlings [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>], this 
characteristic enables pin cherry to dominate many burned-over areas, 
particularly in the northern hardwood forest [<a href="#48">48</a>]. For more information on pin cherry establishment 
and seedling growth see 
<a href="all.html#GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS">Botanical and Ecological Characteristics</a>. 
Pin cherry sprouts after cutting [<a href="#71">71</a>], and though not documented, it may also sprout after 
fire. Further research is needed on postfire regeneration of pin cherry.

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font> 
Pin cherry occurs in plant communities and ecosystems that historically 
experienced a range of fire regimes. In oak-hickory communities, for example, 
fires were typically frequent (&lt;35-year mean), low-severity surface fires. 
Conversely, northern maple-beech-birch communities experienced long intervals 
between fire, and fire was usually stand-replacing [<a href="#138">138</a>]. White-red-jack pine 
communities experienced a mixed-severity regime with low to moderate severity 
at frequent intervals (20-40 years) and stand-replacing fires over longer 
intervals (100-300 years) [<a href="#45">45</a>]. Fire regimes for plant communities and ecosystems in which pin cherry occurs 
are summarized below. For further information regarding fire regimes and fire 
ecology of communities and ecosystems where pin cherry is found, see the 
'Fire Ecology and Adaptations' section of the FEIS species summary for the plant 
community or ecosystem dominants listed below.</p>

Pin cherry establishes and reproduces abundantly and at an early age after fire [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>]. 
Burning provides a good seed bed for pin cherry germination [<a href="#2">2</a>]; as a result, pin cherry is often more frequent 
on burned than unburned sites [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>]. Dormant seeds 
germinate in response to disturbance by fire. This response, combined with the 
rapid initial growth of seedlings, enables pin cherry to dominate recently 
burned over sites [<a href="#48">48</a>]. For more information on germination and seedling growth, see 
<a href="all.html#REGENERATION PROCESSES">Regeneration Processes</a>.

Pin cherry seeds generally survive fire in the moist lower level of organic soil, 
which seldom burns completely. Numerous seedlings are often found the 1st 
growing season after fire. Seedling mortality is high, but some plants establish as part of the 
high shrub or low tree canopy in the developing 
forest [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>]. Though pin cherry often dominates 
initial postfire vegetation [<a href="#48">48</a>], a study of a southern Appalachians 
spruce-Fraser fir forest found that by postfire year 25, pin cherry density was 
182 stems/acre (455 stems/ha), comprising 12.2% of the total 
basal area [<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>]. Within 3 weeks of 
prescribed burning a harvested pine (<i>Pinus </i>spp.)-white spruce-hardwoods 
stand, pin cherry seedlings were abundant. By the next growing season, 
however, 
many of the pin cherry seedlings had died [<a href="#124">124</a>].

Pin cherry is  important winter moose browse in the Great Lake states and boreal 
forest region [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>]. Deer browse it moderately, especially 
in late winter and spring [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>]. Pin cherry foliage and bark are important winter 
foods for snowshoe hares and cottontail rabbits&nbsp; [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>], and the bark is 
preferred fall and winter food for porcupines [<a href="#132">132</a>].
<p>Pin cherries are important to wildlife; they are eaten in summer and fall by 
at least 25 nongame birds (e.g. American robins, bluebirds), several upland game birds 
(e.g. ruffed grouse), large and small mammals (e.g. black bears, raccoons), and 
game animals [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#136">136</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>].When birds eat the cherries, they disgorge 
the stones after the pulp is ingested [<a href="#17">17</a>]. Upland game birds, especially sharp-tailed 
and ruffed grouse, eat pin cherry buds [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>].

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Palatability/nutritional value:</b></font> 
Pin cherry is characterized as preferred moose browse in Newfoundland [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>]. Pin cherry palatability for white-tailed 
deer is low in fall and winter months, but improves from April to

<p>Though deer browse pin cherry, its calcium:phosphorus 
ratio may be too high for  deer nutrition [<a href="#53">53</a>]. Pin cherry has nutritional value similar to that of 
chokecherry [<a href="#96">96</a>]. The foliage of pin cherry contains hydrocyanic acid, and 
livestock browsing the leaves may be 
poisoned [<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]; however, the toxicity of 
pin cherry leaves is lower than that of most other cherry species [<a href="#143">143</a>].</p>
<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Cover value:</font></b> Pin cherry generally 
provides fair to good cover for mule deer, white-tailed deer, and pronghorn, but 
provides poor cover for elk [<a href="#42">42</a>]. It offers good hiding cover 
for small mammals and fair to good nesting cover for nongame birds [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]</p>

<b><font size="4" face="Bell MT">Propagation:</font></b> 
Soaking the seeds is helpful 
for pin cherry propagation, but scarification is unnecessary [<a href="#53">53</a>]. Seed germination rate can be improved by drastic temperature 
fluctuation treatments. Effective treatment involves a 24-hour soak followed by 
30 days of stratification with 5 days at 41 <sup>o</sup>F (5<sup> o</sup>C) alternating with 5 days at 
86 <sup>o</sup>F (30 <sup>o</sup>C). The next step is 60 to 90 days of 
stratification at 41 <sup>o</sup>F, followed by a 10-day 
germination period with 12 hours at 41 <sup>o</sup>F alternating with 12 hours 
at 86 <sup>o</sup>F. This procedure can be expected to achieve at least 75% germination [<a href="#76">76</a>]. 
Belcher [<a href="#19">19</a>] recommends prechilling 60 to 90 days at 37 to 41
<sup>o</sup>F (3-5 <sup>o</sup>C) and encouraging germination with temperatures 
from 68 to 86 <sup>o</sup>F (20-30 <sup>o</sup>C). Air-dried seeds can be stored at 37 to 41 <sup>o</sup>F 
for 3-5 years [<a href="#19">19</a>]. Pin cherry seeds have retained viability for up to 
10 years when stored in sealed containers at 34 to 38 <sup>o</sup>F (1-3 <sup>o</sup>C) 
[<a href="#53">53</a>].<p>Pin cherry suckers readily and is assumed by some authors 
to grow well from root cuttings [<a href="#143">143</a>]. However, propagation of pin 
cherry from cuttings has proved difficult with little success  reported [<a href="#23">23</a>]. 
Pin cherry is used as grafting stock for sour cherry (<i>Prunus cerasus</i>) [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>].

Pin cherry currently has little commercial value [<a href="#63">63</a>], though recent interest in 
commercial production of pin cherry fruit has emerged [<a href="#122">122</a>]. The fruit 
is edible and can be used in jams and preserves [<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>]. 

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Wood Products:</b></font> 
Pin cherry wood is light, 
moderately soft, porous, and low in strength [<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>] giving it 
little commercial value. In general, pin cherry is not used for 
lumber and is considered a noncommercial species. It occurs in abundance, 
however, over a wide range of sites and produces large quantities of biomass in 
a relatively short time. The species has been described as well adapted to 
intensive management and chip harvesting on short rotations for fiber and fuel [<a href="#143">143</a>]</p>

<a name="OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Due to its short life span and thin foliage, pin cherry is not usually considered 
a serious competitor to commercially valuable hardwoods. However, high 
densities of pin cherry may reduce the establishment and growth of commercial 
hardwoods (e.g. black cherry, white ash, and sugar maple) [<a href="#63">63</a>]. Following clearcutting, 
control plots in a northern hardwood forest study 
demonstrated pin cherry dominance in stands aged 6 to 23 years. Basal area and 
leaf area of pin cherry peaked at about year 17, followed by a steady decline in 
pin cherry dominance. Fertilization treatments (combined N, P, K, Ca, Mg) 
increased and prolonged pin cherry dominance, indicating that nutrient 
limitation may accelerate the demise of pin cherry during the 2nd and 3rd 
decades of stand development. In response to fertilization, 
pin cherry had more leaf area pre unit stem basal area, and proportionally more 
of this leaf area was in the upper canopy [<a href="#14">14</a>]. Demchik and Sharpe 
[<a href="#40">40</a>], however, found little response of pin cherry to N-P-K 
fertilizer following cutting. Frequency of pin cherry tends to increase after 
stand harvest because seed stores well in the seed bank and is stimulated to 
germinate when the canopy is opened [<a href="#40">40</a>]. Following cutting in a Massachusetts northern 
hardwood forest, initial pin cherry density was approximately 40,000 stems/acre 
(100,000 stems/ha). 
Within 20 years, density decreased to 720 stems/acre (1,800 stems/ha), and 
dropped to 5.6 stems/acre (14 stems/ha) after 40 years. Prior to cutting no pin cherry was documented 
in the stand, illustrating the volume of seeds that may be buried in the seed 
bank [<a href="#5">5</a>]. Due to the prolonged viability of pin cherry seeds 
in the soil, harvest rotations of 120 years are recommended to allow sufficient 
depletion of the pin cherry seed bank and stabilize population size. A study of 
northern hardwood stands in New Hampshire found seed bank depletion to be 
negligible in stands aged 40-60 years, and moderate (30% over 20 years) in 
stands aged 95-115 years. Short harvest rotations (e.g. 60 years) may triple the 
size of the pin cherry seed bank, resulting in greater proliferation 
post-harvest [<a href="#133">133</a>]. Shading from slash cover may prevent pin 
cherry germination and/or survival of new germinants [<a href="#111">111</a>]. 

<p>Pin cherry responds well to clipping and/or browsing [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>]; a study in the Lake States region found 
annual growth increased by 88 to 121% following 4 years of&nbsp; &quot;heavy&quot; 
clipping [<a href="#3">3</a>]. A study in western Ontario found cutting of pin cherry stems 
initially decreased density by 25% after 1 year. However, stem density in the 
2nd and 3rd years exceeded precut levels by 5 and 8%, respectively. Stem thinning by 
natural mortality in the untreated control plots was 41% to 69% over 4 years [<a href="#84">84</a>]. A New England study found that moose and 
white-tailed deer preferred browsing taller pin cherry plants. Browsed plants 
had higher relative 
height growth following browsing (compensatory growth) than unbrowsed plants at 
&quot;low&quot; and &quot;intermediate&quot; densities. Compensatory growth decreased with increased 
density. Despite browser preference for taller plants, there was a clear 
net growth advantage for pin cherry of initial large size, when the effects 
of competition, browsing and compensatory growth were combined [<a href="#121">121</a>]. Though it 
generally does well under moderate to heavy browsing [<a href="#53">53</a>], heavy browsing of pin cherry can nearly eliminate it from a site [<a href="#126">126</a>]. 
A Pennsylvania study found that white-tailed deer browsing significantly reduced (p&lt;0.05) pin 
cherry density [<a href="#90">90</a>]. Heavy barking of stems by snowshoe hares can cause pin 
cherry mortality [<a href="#39">39</a>].</p>

<p>Pin cherry is easily controlled by 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, and triclopyr 
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>], and moderately controlled by hexazinone 
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#146">146</a>] and glyphosate [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>]. 
Yarborough and Bhowmik [<a href="#146">146</a>] found hexazinone significantly 
reduced (p&lt;0.05) cover and frequency of pin cherry. Raymond and others [<a href="#107">107</a>] 
report a single application of glyphosate resulted in an 82% reduction 
in pin cherry browse by posttreatment year 2. Mallik and others [<a href="#84">84</a>] found 
that both single and multiple applications of glyphosate significantly reduced 
(p=0.035) pin cherry stem density, achieving 90% mortality by the 3rd year 
following treatment. </p>

Pin cherry is susceptible to many diseases and parasitic insects [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. Several leaf spot 
pathogens infect pin cherry; the most 
common is cherry leaf spot, <i>Coccomyces hiemalis</i>. Repeated attacks reduce 
tree vigor. Additional pin cherry diseases are powdery mildew, rust, and leaf 
curler. Pin cherry is also susceptible to extensive trunk rot (caused by <i>
Fomes pomaceus</i>) which delignifies the wood and leaves it soft, stringy, and 
discolored with brown flecks. The most widespread and commonly observed disease 
of pin cherry is black knot disease [<a href="#143">143</a>]. This disease (caused by <i>Apiosporina morbosa</i>) 
may provide effective biological control of pin cherry, particularly if 
introduced&nbsp;in the 1st 2 years of stand development. Establishment of the 
pathogen occurs earlier and with more intensity in harvested than burned areas [<a href="#140">140</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>].
A Nova Scotia study found that introducing 
black knot disease 3 years after disturbance ended site dominance by pin cherry 
during the subsequent 5 years [<a href="#140">140</a>]. Following cutting, pin cherry stump 
treatments with fungal isolates of <i>Chondrostereum purpureum</i> may be 
effective in controlling sprouting [<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>]. Insect attacks on 
pin cherry primarily consist of leaf feeders [<a href="#143">143</a>].
