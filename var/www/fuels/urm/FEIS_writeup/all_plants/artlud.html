<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Louisiana sagewort is a minor seral species within a wide variety of
nonforested and forested communities throughout the western United
States.  Mueggler and Stewart [<a href="#18">18</a>] report its presence in a number of
grassland and shrubland habitat types in Montana, including those within
the rough fescue (Festuca scabrella), Idaho fescue (F. idahoensis),
bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata), big sagebrush (Artemisia
tridentata), and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruiticosa) series.  In
forested habitat types, it occurs as an understory species within the
limber pine (Pinus flexilis), ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa), Douglas-fir
(Pseudotsuga menziesii), and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) series
[<a href="#20">20</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Louisiana sagewort has limited value as a forage species.  It may be of
seasonal importance to domestic sheep, mule deer, elk, and other game
animals [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>] and is reported to be one of the most frequently
utilized forbs by mule deer in the Rocky Mountains [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Plants probably
receive select utilization during late fall and winter due to their
location on exposed ridges and snow-free sites.  Louisiana sagewort
increases in response to grazing on rough fescue (Festuca scabrella)
grassland habitat types in Montana [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability of Louisiana sagewort generally decreases from north to
south.  In portions of Idaho and Utah it is an important domestic sheep
browse during the fall and winter [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Large mammal utilization of
Louisiana sagewort is primarily confined to green tissue [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Some
forms produce large basal rosettes that remain green throughout most of
the winter, but most of the stems and leaves typically die back to the
ground following persistent frost, and this material does not cure well.

The relish and degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife species for
Louisiana sagewort in several western states is rated as follows [<a href="#5">5</a>]:

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Louisiana sagewort establishes and persists on severely disturbed sites
throughout a wide range of plant communities.  Plants spread rapidly by
rhizomes, providing excellent soil cover and stabilization.  Louisiana
sagewort produced dense masses of rhizomes and fibrous roots the year
following planting on sites in the Intermountain region [<a href="#24">24</a>].  It is
able to tolerate moderate erosion.  Once established, Lousiana sagewort
serves as a nurse shrub [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Stranathan and Monsen [<a href="#26">26</a>] reported a cultivar, 'Summit' Louisiana
sagewort, that is recommended for use on high-elevation disturbed sites.
This cultivar has successfully established on sandy, blowout mine spoils
at elevations above 7,500 feet (2,300 m).  It can spread 78 inches (200
cm) within 5 years after planting on unstable, steep slopes.  Further
cultivar development is expected within the Louisiana sagewort complex.

Louisiana sagewort is adapted for use in basin big sagebrush (A.
tridentata ssp. tridentata), mountain big sagebrush (A. tridentata ssp.
vaseyana), pinyon-juniper, mountain brush, aspen, and subalpine herbland
communities [<a href="#24">24</a>].  It is also useful for riparian plantings in forested,
mountain brush, and sagebrush-desert types [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Although it can be
established via transplanting, direct seeding is the most practical
method of plant establishment on large projects.  Seeds are planted
in the fall separately or in mixtures by drill, aerial, or broadcast
seeding.  Small seed size requires that special precautions be taken
when using a standard drill operation.  Stranathan and Mosen [<a href="#26">26</a>]
recommend shallow planting depths at a rate of 0.25 pounds or less of
seed per acre (280 g/ha); broadcast seeding should be followed by a
light harrowing.


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
American Indians used Lousisana sagewort for ceremonial and purification
purposes.  Other historical uses include treating headaches, coughs,
hemorrhoids, stomach disorders, and wounded horses.  These highly
aromatic plants were also made into pillows and saddlepads [<a href="#27">27</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Artemisia ludoviciana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Louisiana sagewort is a long-lived, fast growing, native, aromatic,
suffruticose, perennial forb typically ranging in height from 11.7 to 39
inches (3 to 10 dm) [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Plants spread by rhizomes; stems are
usually solitary or loosely clustered.  This species exhibits wide
ecotypic variation in stem height, leaf color and shape, seed
production, and degree of rhizomatous spread [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Generally, alpine
forms are somewhat more decumbent than the more erect, low elevation
forms.  Louisiana sagewort is extremely drought and cold tolerant.
Although most plants die back to woody stem bases following frost, some
forms are able to maintain green, basal rosettes until late winter,
while other forms produce an abundance of fall sprouts [<a href="#26">26</a>].  The root
system is quite extensive and consists of a coarse root mass located 1
to 4 inches (3 to 10 cm) below the soil surface.  Nitrogen-fixing root
nodules have been reported for this species; however, nodulation is
somewhat inconsistent [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Stranathan and Mosen [<a href="#26">26</a>] indicate that
Louisiana sagewort improves soil fertility and tilth.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Louisiana sagewort employs both sexual and vegetative reproductive
strategies.  Numerous, wind-dispersed fruits (<a href="../../../glossary.html#CYPSELA:">cypsela</a>) are produced in the fall.
Although seed production varies widely among ecotypes, most plants
produce abundant seed from flowers which are either open or
self-pollinated.  Seeds are very small (approximately 3,800,000 per
pound [8,360,000/kg]).  Germination rate is often only 30 to 40 percent
at purities of over 90 percent [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Most seed is dispersed within the
first 7 days of seed maturity [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Seed heads mature quickly and
shatter easily.  Viability declines after more than 2 to 3 years in
storage.  Harvey [<a href="#9">9</a>] reported optimum germination temperatures of 70 to
73 degrees Fahrenheit (20-23 deg C), the highest optimum range of four
Artemisia species compared.  He suggested that this range may be an
ecological adaptation to protect newly emerged seedlings from frost
damage on lowland sites in Montana.  Seedling mortality is quite high in
nature, despite relatively rapid root elongation.  Mean survival of
seedlings on Montana study sites was approximately 1.2 percent.  Data
indicate that survival per 1,000 seedlings was only 0.07 percent.
Plants produce seed within 3 years following establishment.  Stranathan
and Monsen [<a href="#26">26</a>] reported that plants produced seed within two growing
seasons on irrigated seed plantations in Colorado.

Louisiana sagewort regenerates vegetatively via rhizomes.  The extensive
root system is generally a dense, coarse root mass located from 1 to 4
inches (3 to 10 cm) below the soil surface.  Harvey [<a href="#6">6</a>] reports sagewort
colonies reaching diameters of 50 feet (15 m) on lowland sites in
Montana, with annual radial increases averaging approximately 1.2 inches
(3 cm).  Efforts at age determination on these sites suggested larger
colonies approaching 200 years of age or more.  Research involving
cultivar development in Louisiana sagewort indicates that rhizome
expression is highly variable among ecotypes; some accessions are highly
rhizomatous while others exhibit almost no evidence of rhizome
initiation [<a href="#9">9</a>].  An accession selected for cultivar release spread
approximately 78 inches (200 cm) within 5 years following planting on
steep, unstble slopes in Colorado.  On disturbed sites in Idaho,
sprigged plants produced abundant rhizomes and fibrous roots during the
1st year [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Louisiana sagewort has a wide ecological amplitude and is able to occupy
a diversity of sites throughout the western United States.  Plants
typically occur scattered on dry, open sites within grassland,
shrubland, and forested communities.  Although populations inhabit sites
ranging in elevation from less than 3,000 feet (900 m) to more than
10,000 feet (3,000 m), subspecies gererally occupy rather distinct
elevational regions.  Artemisia ludoviciana ssp. ludoviciana is the most
abundant and widespread; A. l. spp. incompta is restricted to alpine
areas.  Louisiana sagewort is adapted to a wide range of soil conditions
including heavy clays, sterile sands, and granitics.  Productive sites
in Montana are often along lowland, cold air drainages; colonal
increases appear to be more rapid on mesic sites [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Elevational ranges for several western states are as follows [<a href="#5">5</a>].

	     3,500 to 11,300 ft (1,067 to 3,455 m) in CO
	     2,300 to 9,200 ft (701 to 2,805 m) in MT
	     4,000 to 11,500 ft (1,220 to 3,506 m) in UT
             3,600 to 10,900 ft (1,098 to 3,323 m) in WY


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Louisiana sagewort is a pioneer species that rapidly invades disturbed
sites in a variety of plant communities.  These long-lived plants
establish during early seral conditions and coexist with later arriving
species, often persisting through a wide range of successional stages.
Although frequencies are typically low on most sites, densities increase
where disturbance results in reduced species competition.  Louisiana
sagewort serves as a nurse shrub; grasses invaded plantings within 2 to
5 years on sites in Colorado [<a href="#26">26</a>].  As succession proceeds, sagewort
densities gradually diminish; however, remnant plants will reemerge to
occupy vegetative openings.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Phenological development in Louisiana sagewort has not been well
documented.  Detailed data from Montana for sites below 5,900 feet
(1,800 m) are presented below.  In general, plants above this
elevation developed 2 to 3 weeks later [<a href="#9">9</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
The effects of fire on Louisiana sagewort is not well documented.
Although plants are readily top-killed by all fire intensities, these
suffrutescent perennials appear moderately resistent to fire mortality
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>].  Generalized information indicates that plants are able to
reestablish rapidly via rhizomes and perhaps through basal sprouting.
Postfire regeneration also involves the germination of numerous
wind-dispersed seeds [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Louisiana sagewort is apparently easily top-killed by low intensity
fires.  The presence of underground rhizomes and suffrutescent stem
bases suggests that the majority of plants are somewhat resistant to
fire mortality [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Limited fire response data for Louisiana sagewort indicates that
densities are rapidly regained and usually enhanced following burning.
Plants spread rapidly via surviving rhizomes.  Plant establishment also
occurs from off-site seed sources.  Studies in Alberta indicated that
this species is well adapted to repeated, annual spring burning [<a href="#1">1</a>].
