<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of tailcup lupine is Lupinus
caudatus Kellogg [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  Lupinus is a taxonomically complex
genus and there is much confusion regarding nomenclature.  Species
within the genus are extremely variable and freely intergrade, making
morphological characteristics used to separate taxa few and
inconsistent.  There is much disagreement among authorities concerning
recognized subspecies, varieties, and forms [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Tailcup lupine is found in a variety of habitats including grassland,
sagebrush, desert and mountain shrub, and coniferous forest
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].  The following publications list tailcup lupine as a

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lupinus caudatus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Tailcup lupine is readily to moderately available within its range and
is consumed to a moderate to high degree by elk, mule deer, whitetail
deer, antelope, upland game birds, small nongame birds, and small
mammals [<a href="#8">8</a>].  On the Columbia Plateau in north-central Oregon, tailcup
lupine comprised 70.9 percent of all forb shoots consumed by pocket
gophers in June.  Leaves were also heavily utilized [<a href="#7">7</a>].
 
Tailcup lupine is also utilized by sheep, cattle, and horses [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability of tailcup lupine is rated as poor to fair for cattle and
horses and fair for sheep [<a href="#8">8</a>].  The early vegetative foliage and
immature pods are more palatable to sheep than mature vegetation,
probably corresponding to a relatively low alkaloid content early in the
growing season [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Nutritional values of stems and leaves of tailcup lupine at different
developmental stages have been reported [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Tailcup lupine provides fair to good cover for small nongame birds and
small mammals [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Tailcup lupine's ability to fix nitrogen allows it to colonize soils of
low fertility.  At high-altitude sites in Utah and Montana, it had the
highest average acetylene reduction activity per plant compared to other
nitrogen-fixing species [<a href="#17">17</a>].  

In the Boise River Watershed in Idaho, tailcup lupine was not useful in
controlling erosion because it does not have a mat-forming root system.
The areas dominated by invader species, including tailcup lupine, were
those most susceptible to erosion due to high utilization by livestock
[<a href="#36">36</a>].  Overall, tailcup lupine has been given a medium to low rating for
erosion control, and a high to low rating for its use in long-term
revegetation in Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana [<a href="#8">8</a>].  The lupine
genus as a whole has possiblities for use in management, but more
information is needed on the response of the genus to withstand
disturbance in a wide range of habitats [<a href="#18">18</a>].
 


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
A drug has been extracted from tailcup lupine for use in controlling
cardiac arrhythmia [<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Tailcup lupine is highly toxic to livestock, especially to sheep
[<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  It is less toxic to cattle and horses [<a href="#20">20</a>], but causes
calf deformities if ingested by cows between 40 to 70 days gestation
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  It produces quinolizidine alkaloids which affect the
nervous system [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  The alkaloid content of aboveground vegetative
parts peaks in mid-June at 0.9 percent and decreases to 0.2 percent in
August, during the pod stage.  Alkaloid content of seeds ranges from 2.3
to 9.5 percent, making them highly toxic [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Lupines (Lupinus spp.)
are responsible for more losses of sheep in Montana, Idaho, and Utah
than any other plant genus [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Tailcup lupine is one of the most
poisonous of the lupine species.  In the seed stage it is probably the
most toxic member of the genus [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Plants are toxic from ay least
the beginning of spring growth until they dry in late summer [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].
Dry plants are probably poisonous as well [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Sheep are poisoned by
ingesting 0.13 to 0.25 pound (0.06-0.11 kg) daily for 3 to 4 days.
Cattle usually graze tailcup lupine only when other forage is not
available.  Ingestion of 1 to 1.5 pounds of tailcup lupine (0.45-0.68
kg) daily will poison cattle.  The symptoms associated with tailcup
lupine poisoning have been described in detail [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  It is
apparently not toxic to wildlife [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].

Tailcup lupine increases under intensive grazing and is most abundant
under poor to fair range conditions [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  It often forms nearly
pure stands in overgrazed areas [<a href="#47">47</a>].  Poisoning of livestock occurs
when poor range management has resulted in overgrazing and depletion of
preferred rangeland species [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Tailcup lupine is unlikely to be
dangerous under normal range conditions [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Where lupine species are
common, rangeland should be utilized when other forage is abundant, and
especially when lupines are not in fruit [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Tailcup lupine has
been controlled with the application of various esters of 2,4-D and
2,4,5-T [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Plants should be sprayed after they are
approximately 5 inches (12.7 cm) tall, but before they bloom [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].
After spraying, grazing should be deferred to let desirable species
occupy the range [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Tailcup lupine is common in pine types (Pinus jeffreyi and P.
ponderosa) in northeastern California.  Frequency of tailcup lupine on
40-year-old units given various silvicultural methods was as
follows [<a href="#50">50</a>]:

      Silvicultural Method          Frequency (%)

     sanitation salvage                  20
     moderate selection cut              24
     heavy selection cut                 10
     clearcut                            <1            

Lupines (L. caudatus and L. sericeus) responded with minor changes in
canopy cover to different management regimes in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
menziesii)/pinegrass (Calamagrostis rubescens) habitat types in central
Idaho.  Plants decreased slightly in cover, but seedlings established
when stands were selectively cut or clearcut followed by mechanical
scarification.  There was a slight vegetative increase in stands that
were clearcut with no site preparation.  Seedling establishment and
increased cover were evident in stands destroyed by wildfire and in
stands that were clearcut followed by broadcast burning [<a href="#39">39</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lupinus caudatus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Tailcup lupine is a native, perennial, cool-season forb [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].
Simple or branched stems arise from a woody caudex and are generally 8
to 16 inches (20-40 cm) tall.  Leaves are basal and have 5 to 9
leaflets.  The inflorescence is a terminal raceme and flowers have a
conspicuous spur.  Pods contain four to six seeds [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].
Tailcup lupine has a stout, deep taproot [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Tailcup lupine most often reproduces by seed [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  The seeds are
heavy and are not widely dispersed.  They will germinate in full sun or
partial shade.  Tailcup lupine is not rhizomatous but will sprout from
the caudex [<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Tailcup lupine is found on dry sites on gentle to steep slopes and in
open woods [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  It grows best in dry, well-drained gravelly,
sandy, sandy-loam, and clayey-loam soils.  It does not grow well in clay
or other organic, sodic-saline, or acid soils.  Tailcup lupine has been
found to 10,400 feet (3,150 m) elevation in Colorado [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Species commonly associated with tailcup lupine in sagebrush or
grassland habitats include Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), mountain
snowberry (Symphoricarpos oreophilus), Wood's rose (Rosa woodsii),
curlleaf mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius), manzanita
(Arctostaphylos spp.), Utah serviceberry (Amelanchier utahensis),
rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus spp.), broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia
sarothrae), wyethia (Wyethia spp.), arrowleaf balsamroot (Balsamorhiza
sagittata), knotweed (Polygonum spp.), buckwheat (Eriogonum spp.),
penstemon (Penstemon spp.), phlox (Phlox spp.), bluebunch wheatgrass
(Pseudoroegneria spicata), Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda),
needle-and-thread grass (Stipa comata), Idaho fescue (Festuca
idahoensis), Indian ricegrass (Oryzopsis hymenoides), buffalograss
(Buchloe dactyloides), and cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Tailcup lupine persists under partial shade, but it's cover increases
with more sunlight and less competition [<a href="#39">39</a>].  It occurs in seral to
climax sagebrush habitats in Nevada and Idaho [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>], and in seral to
climax lodgepole forests in Oregon [<a href="#49">49</a>].  It is also a component of
climax pinyon-juniper habitats in Colorado [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Tailcup lupine is a cool-season species with maximum growth occurring in
the spring [<a href="#47">47</a>].  Flowering begins in May in Utah and Colorado, and in
June in Wyoming and Montana [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Fruits are generally mature by July or
August [<a href="#41">41</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Aboveground parts of tailcup lupine are generally consumed by fire [<a href="#55">55</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Some lupines are fire survivors and are present in the initial stages of
postfire plant succession [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Tailcup lupine is favored or relatively
unaffected by fire in sagebrush or pinyon-juniper habitats.  It also
germinates from buried seed after fire [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  Pechanec [<a href="#29">29</a>] stated
that top-killed plants may make a ready recovery and rapid increase in
vigor, but an increase in plant numbers must await seed production,
usually in the second growing season after burning.

In sagebrush-grassland habitats of the Upper Snake River Plains, Idaho,
intense fire resulted in lower postfire forb production, most likely due
to the destruction of buried seeds.  Lupines (Lupinus caudatus and L.
leucophyllus), however, were favored by burning.  Biomass production of
the two species at postfire year 12 years is as follows [<a href="#4">4</a>]:

                           lbs/acre               kg/ha
           _____________________________________________________
           Unburned          2.3                   2.6
           Light burn        3.6                   4.1
           Moderate burn     5.4                   6.1
           Heavy burn       54.4                  61.2

In sagebrush habitats in the Great Basin Rate of Spread Study, done in
Nevada, there was a flush of forb growth, including tailcup lupine,
following fire.  This growth was attributed to heat breaking seed
dormancy, increased available nutrients, and possibly the removal of
inhibitory compounds in shrub litter [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Following the Red Rock Fire
in Nevada, tailcup lupine increased steadily in density in the first 4
postfire years [<a href="#54">54</a>].

Tailcup lupine was present 4 years after severe natural fires in
pinyon-juniper stands in Colorado, with a postfire frequency of 8
percent.  Its frequency on sites burned 29 years earlier was 2 percent,
but it was not present in a 90-year-old burn in the same area [<a href="#10">10</a>].
Tailcup lupine was present in all stages of postfire succession in
pinyon-juniper habitats in Nevada and California.  Occurence and cover
percentages follow [<a href="#21">21</a>]:

Successional stage    Years since fire         Occurence              Cover

Some authors report that tailcup lupine is slightly to moderately damaged
by fire [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].
