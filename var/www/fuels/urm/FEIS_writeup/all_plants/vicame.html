<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
American vetch provides excellent forage for livestock and wildlife.
Mule deer, black bear, and grizzly bear browse the leaves and flowers.
American vetch also provides forage for game birds and small mammals

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
American vetch may be useful revegetating open or depleted trembling
aspen game rangelands in Utah including burned over or thinned conifer
areas.  It is also useful for revegetating coal-mined lands, roadsides,
and in critical-site stabilization and beautification [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  American
vetch has been successfully planted in disturbed alpine rangelands in
the western United States [<a href="#10">10</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vicia americana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
American vetch is a native rhizomatous, single-stemmed ascending or
climbing perennial forb up to 30 inches (75 cm) tall [<a href="#35">35</a>].  The
inflorescence is a raceme with up to 10 flowers that are 0.5 to 1.5
inches (1.25-3.75 cm) long, each producing a pod 1 to 1.5 inches
(2.5-3.75 cm) long and containing two to several pealike seeds
[<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  American vetch has a moderate to deeply branched taproot
which reaches a maximum depth of about 40 inches (100 cm) [<a href="#37">37</a>].  It has
strong drought tolerance [<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
American vetch reproduces from seed and creeping rhizomes [<a href="#1">1</a>]. 


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
American vetch grows in a wide variety of habitats.  It is found in
moist to dry areas, swampy woods and borders, mixed forests, and
clearings.  It is common in moist or sheltered foothill canyons and
meadows [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  It grows on sandy, clayey, medium-textured soils.
In western mountains it is usually more abundant in deep porous loams
that are rich in organic matter.  Soils vary from acidic to moderately
basic and are sometimes moderately saline [<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

American vetch occurs in all stages of succession.  It grows in open
sunny sites and invades fire-disturbed areas [<a href="#17">17</a>].  It is also shade
tolerant.  It is found in the understories of quaking aspen communities
of the upper Great Lakes region [<a href="#3">3</a>] and in Englemann spruce (Picea
engelmannii) communities of the Rocky Mountains [<a href="#4">4</a>].

 


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
American vetch new growth begins in early spring to early summer,
varying with environment.  It flowers from May to August and the seeds
mature about 1 month after flowering [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vicia americana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
American vetch is rated as moderately resistant to fire [<a href="#22">22</a>].  It
typicall increases following fire [<a href="#24">24</a>].  The fibrous roots and rhizomes
are 0.6 (1.5 cm) to 2 inches (5 cm) below the soil surface and sprout
following light- to moderate-severity fires [<a href="#22">22</a>].  American vetch also
revegetates burned sites via soil-stored seed [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>]


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vicia americana

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire probably top-kills American vetch [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
American vetch typically increases after low- to moderate-severity fires
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  In a study of plant succession in the Gambel oak (Quercus
gambelli) brush zone in Utah, American vetch showed a higher average
number of plants on burned areas than on unburned areas, even after 9
years [<a href="#22">22</a>].  In northeastern North Dakota American vetch canopy cover
was greater on some sites burned 1-3 years before the plant survey than
on unburned sites [<a href="#24">24</a>].  In a Douglas-fir habitat type in Idaho,
American vetch cover and frequency on sites burned by low-severity fires
were greater than on unburned or severely burned sites.  This effect was
greatest in post-fire year 2 [<a href="#6">6</a>].

On a prescribed burn in northeastern Minnesota, the frequency of
American vetch increased greatly on the burned areas during postfire
year 1 [<a href="#1">1</a>].
