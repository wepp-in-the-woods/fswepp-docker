According to several reviews [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>], rush skeletonweed is thought to 
have originated in the submontane region surrounding the Caspian Sea, 
where the genus <i>Chondrilla</i> is most diverse. From there it spread to the 
Mediterranean region and central Europe. Its &quot;native range&quot; extends 
from western Europe and north Africa to central Asia [<a href="#58">58</a>]. 

<p>
Rush skeletonweed was first reported in Australia in 1918. The heaviest 
infestations were initially in the cereal growing area of New South Wales 
and Victoria, and later spread into western Australia [<a href="#67">67</a>]. </p>

<p>
Rush skeletonweed was apparently introduced to North America in contaminated 
plant material, contaminated seed, or with animal fodder or bedding 
[<a href="#71">71</a>]. Rush skeletonweed established in eastern North America around 1872. 
It occurs in Ontario, Michigan, Indiana, and from New York to Virginia [<a href="#48">48</a>]. It 
is reported from 1 county in Georgia [<a href="#94">94</a>]. Rush skeletonweed was first reported in 
Washington in 1938, but may have established as long as 30 years prior to that 
report [<a href="#63">63</a>]. It was first reported in California in 1965 [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>]. Over time it has 
become widespread and locally dense in rangelands, wheat growing areas, 
and along transportation corridors, in parts of California, Oregon, 
Washington, Idaho, Montana, and British Columbia [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. Estimates of the 
extent of rush skeletonweed infestation in North America range from 6.2 million acres (2.5 
million ha) of rangeland in the Pacific Northwest and California [<a href="#53">53</a>], to around 
8.4 million acres (3.4 million ha) of crop and rangeland in the U.S. [<a href="#40">40</a>]. State 
distribution of rush skeletonweed in the United States can also be viewed at


<a href="https://plants.usda.gov/">Plants database</a>.</p>

<p>
The following lists include North American ecosystems, habitats, and forest 
and range cover types in which rush skeletonweed is known or thought to be 
invasive, as well as some that may be invaded by rush skeletonweed following 
disturbances in which vegetation is killed and/or removed and/or soil disturbed 
(e.g. cultivation, logging, fire, grazing, herbicide application, flooding). These 
lists are not necessarily exhaustive. More information is needed regarding incidents 
and examples of particular ecosystems and plant communities where rush skeletonweed 
is invasive.

A review by McVean [<a href="#58">58</a>] reports several plant associations in which 
rush skeletonweed occurs in Eurasia. Rush skeletonweed is characteristic 
of needlegrass-sagebrush (<i>Achnatherum/Stipa</i>-<i>Artemisia</i>) 
steppe in Russia, Iraq, Anatolia and eastern Europe. It occurs in a variety of 
open, &quot;semi-natural&quot; communities in the Mediterranean region and 
in the upper oak scrubs of Kurdistan and Khalifan in Iraq. It is recorded as 
a constituent of &quot;thin pine forests&quot; on sandy soils in part of Russia. 
Rush skeletonweed is recorded on Mt. Ararat along with gray rockcress 
(<i>Arabis</i> <i>caucasica</i>), <i>Juniperus oxycedrus</i>, and puncturevine 
(<i>Tribulus terrestris</i>); and occurs in <i>Stipa szovitsiana</i> steppe 
in the same region ([<a href="#58">58</a>] and references therein). Plants associated with rush 
skeletonweed in Greece include Bermuda grass (<i>Cynodon dactylon</i>), 
wheat (<i>Triticum</i> spp.), corn chamomile (<i>Anthemis arvensis</i>), and 
corn poppy (<i>Papaver rhoeas</i>), with field eryngo (<i>Eryngium campestre</i>), and 
yellow starthistle (<i>Centaurea solstitialis</i>) among the most frequently encountered 
associates [<a href="#98">98</a>]. The most common plants co-occurring with rush skeletonweed 
on degraded coastal dune sites in southern France were Bermuda grass, thinleaf 
false brome (<i>Brachypodium</i> <i>phoenicoides</i>), leafybract dwarf rush 
(<i>Juncus capitatus</i>), onionweed (<i>Asphodelus fistulosus</i>), and strawflower 
(<i>Helichrysum stoechas</i>) [<a href="#99">99</a>].

<p>
In Australia, rush skeletonweed is essentially a weed of cultivation and 
of open areas with disturbed soils. In general the plants most frequently 
associated with rush skeletonweed in Australia are the numerous weeds and 
other plants found in cereal crops and pastures. In pastures, there is often 
an inverse relationship between density of rush skeletonweed and that of 
legumes such as subterranean clover (<i>Trifolium subterraneum</i>), annual medics 
(<i>Medicago</i> spp.), and alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i>). 
Hellroot (<i>Orobanche minor</i>)  often occurs as a parasite on rush 
skeletonweed in subterranean clover stands ([<a href="#67">67</a>] and references therein). 
Rush skeletonweed has seldom succeeded in invading native vegetation in Australia 
except where native vegetation has been weakened by drought and/or overgrazing. 
Rush skeletonweed has been recorded as a constituent of eucalyptus 
(<i>Eucalyptus</i> spp.) savanna woodland and  of &quot;rough 
pasture&quot; derived from eucalyptus communities, along with 
several other plants including Russian-thistle (<i>Salsola kali</i>). It is also 
considered &quot;naturalized&quot; in some needlegrass  grasslands 
([<a href="#58">58</a>] and references therein). McVean [<a href="#58">58</a>] provides additional lists of native and 
nonnative plants that occur in areas where rush skeletonweed may be found in Australia.</p>


<p>
Descriptions of North American habitats in which rush skeletonweed occurs are 
limited. Old [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>] provides a detailed account of habitat types and plant 
associations with which rush skeletonweed is associated in Washington, although 
he qualifies his information by pointing out that these classifications are of little 
predictive value due to massive disturbances. Rush skeletonweed occurs in bluebunch 
wheatgrass-Sandberg bluegrass (<i>Pseudoroegneria spicata-Poa secunda</i>) 
and stiff sagebrush (<i>Artemisia rigida</i>)-Sandberg bluegrass habitat types 
that occur on the channeled scablands of eastern Washington. Rush skeletonweed is also common on 
the sandy to gravelly soils of the glacial lobes (see <a href="botanical_and_ecological_characteristics.html#SITE CHARACTERISTICS">Site Characteristics</a>), which are 
characterized by an association&nbsp;of ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus 
ponderosa</i>) and common snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos albus</i>) which shifts 
to Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> var. <i>glauca</i>) at 
higher elevations. Grazing, trampling, cultivation, logging, and burning have modified 
these environments such that nonnative plants are often better indicators of site 
potential than are native plants. Dalmatian toadflax (<i>Linaria dalmatica</i>) is a prime indicator of 
rush skeletonweed sites in the glacial lobes, and wavyleaf thistle (<i>Cirsium undulatum</i>) 
is a key indictor of rush skeletonweed habitats in the channeled scablands [<a href="#62">62</a>].  </p>

<p>
The  plant species recorded in association with rush skeletonweed in Washington can be 
divided into 4 categories as follows [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>]:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Species known to have an extremely wide ecologic amplitude, such as cheatgrass (<i>Bromus 
tectorum</i>), goatsbeard (<i>Tragopogon</i> spp.), western yarrow (<i>Achillea millefolium</i>), 
prickly lettuce (<i>Lactuca</i> <i>serriola</i>), tumblemustard (<i>Sisymbrium altissimum</i>), 
alfalfa, sweetclover (<i>Melilotus</i> spp.), and quackgrass (<i>Elytrigia repens</i>). 
</li> <li>Species generally found on sites of low effective precipitation but not uncommon 
on other sites, such as velvet lupine (<i>Lupinus leucophyllus</i>), tall annual willowherb 
(<i>Epilobium brachycarpum</i>), tarweed (<i>Madia</i> spp.), Canadian horseweed (<i>Conyza canadensis</i>), 
common St. Johnswort (<i>Hypericum perforatum</i>), winter vetch (<i>Vicia villosa</i>), 
trefoil (<i>Lotus </i>spp.), sheep sorrel (<i>Rumex acetosella</i>), soft chess 
(<i>Bromus hordeaceus</i>), common mullein (<i>Verbascum thapsus</i>), and fleabane 
(<i>Erigeron</i> spp.). </li>
  <li>Species restricted to sites of low effective precipitation such as bottlebrush squirreltail 
(<i>Elymus elymoides</i>), snow buckwheat (<i>Eriogonum niveum</i>), woolly plantain 
(<i>Plantago patagonica</i>), field cottonrose (<i>Logfia arvensis</i>), varileaf phacelia 
(<i>Phacelia heterophylla</i>), large knotweed (<i>Polygonum</i> <i>douglasii</i> ssp. <i>majus</i>), 
and bluebunch wheatgrass.</li>
  <li>Species restricted to sites of low effective precipitation and 
generally restricted to a specific habitat (e.g. channeled scablands and Spokane 
glacial lobe), such as cutleaf daisy (<i>Erigeron compositus</i>), Nevada bird's-foot trefoil 
(<i>Lotus nevadensis</i>), wavyleaf thistle, and Dalmatian toadflax. </li>
</ol>

<p>In Canada, rush skeletonweed occurs, and could potentially spread widely, in 
disturbed and open-canopied sites in the interior Douglas-fir ecozone of 
British Columbia [<a href="#40">40</a>]. The predicted distribution in Canada includes the rough 
fescue (<i>Festuca altaica</i>) and montane ecozones in Alberta, the drier 
parts of the interior cedar-hemlock (<i>Thuja-Tsuga</i>) ecozone in the interior 
of British Columbia, the Douglas-fir-shore pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i> var. <i>
contorta</i>)-madrone (<i>Arbutus</i> spp.) site association in southwestern 
British Columbia, and parts of southern Vancouver Island [<a href="#40">40</a>]. At Vernon, British Columbia, 
rush skeletonweed occurs on a degraded grassland site where sulphur 
cinquefoil (<i>Potentilla recta</i>) dominates [<a href="#56">56</a>].

Correct identification of rush skeletonweed is important, especially if control strategies are 
planned. Identification can be difficult, especially in the vegetative 
state, as rush skeletonweed rosettes resemble a number of other plants that possess rosettes of 
lobed or dentate leaves, such as catsear (<i>Hypochaeris </i>spp.), 
distaff thistle (<i>Carthamus</i> spp.), hawksbeard (<i>Crepis </i>spp.), hawkbit 
(<i>Leontodon </i>spp.), dandelion (<i>Taraxacum </i>spp.), lettuce (<i>Lactuca
</i>spp.), agoseris (<i>Agoseris</i> spp.), and various mustards (Brassicaceae) 
([<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>] and references therein). Rush skeletonweed can be distinguished from most of these 
by considering in combination the following: a) rush skeletonweed leaves are glabrous, b) rush 
skeletonweed leaf lobes project backward, as a barbed spear, and c) rush 
skeletonweed exudes latex from cut or broken surfaces [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. Additionally, the long thin 
taproot of rush skeletonweed is distinctive. A rush skeletonweed seedling of only a few inches 
width may have a root up to 14 inches (36 cm) long, while most other easily confused genera 
have a short, stout taproot. Leaf color may also be used as a 
discriminating character. Rush skeletonweed leaves on at least some plants show tinges of 
reddish-brown and are in general darker than other genera [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>]. 
Flowering rush skeletonweed plants are distinctive with their tall, usually leafless, 
highly branched flowering stems that produce flat capitula with yellow flowers in summer 
and autumn, and dark brown bristles near the base of the stem [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]. 

<p>
Rush skeletonweed should also not be confused with rush skeletonplant (<i>Lygodesmia juncea</i>), 
which is native in many parts of North America. Rush skeletonplant does have latex, 
but lacks a winter rosette, grows only 4 to 16 inches (10-40 cm) tall, and has pink 
(rarely white) flowers [<a href="#40">40</a>].</p>

<p>
The following description of rush skeletonweed provides 
characteristics that may be relevant to fire ecology, and is not meant for 
identification. Keys for identification are available (e.g. [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>]). </p>

<p>
<b>Morphology:</b> 
Rush skeletonweed is a deep-rooted forb, mostly 16 to 60 inches (40-150 cm) tall, 
somewhat rush-like in appearance. Rush skeletonweed basal leaves are well developed, 
2 to 5 inches (4-13 cm) long and 0.6 to 1.8 inches (15-45 mm) wide, forming a rosette 
that is often deciduous at flowering. Each rush skeletonweed rosette produces 1 flowering 
stem, with multiple spreading or ascending branches. Stem leaves are lacking in some 
plants and when present are reduced, linear, 0.8 to 4 inches (2-10 cm) 
long and 0.04 to 0.3 inches (1-8 mm) wide. Stem leaves are also often deciduous, 
and upper leaves are often reduced to scale-like bracts. Flowerheads are produced along or at 
the ends of stems, either individually or in groups of 2 to 5, each with 9 to 12 flowers. 
The involucre is 0.4 to 0.5 inch (9-12 mm) high. Rush skeletonweed fruits are achenes (referred to 
subsequently as seeds), about 0.1 inch (3 mm) long, with a slender beak at the top, bearing 
a copious pappus of numerous capillary bristles, 0.2 inch (5-6 mm) long. The leaf, stem, and roots 
of rush skeletonweed exude a milky latex when cut or broken [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>]. </p>

<p>
<b>Root system:</b> 
Rush skeletonweed has a slender, simple taproot, that can reach over 6.5 feet (2 m) deep 
and branch at depth into C-horizon soil and fissures in bedrock. This root system provides 
rush skeletonweed with access to a large volume of soil and to potentially large reserves 
of soil-stored water [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]. In Central Europe, a rush skeletonweed plant was found with 
a well-developed taproot penetrating to a depth of almost 8 feet (2.3 m). This root forked 
repeatedly in its lower half, but had little lateral extension (Kutchera 
1960 as cited by [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]). In very sandy or gravelly soils, and in waterlogged soils, 
lateral roots are often formed [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>]. On the upper part of the primary root or on larger 
lateral roots near the soil surface, buds may be formed which produce daughter rosettes in 
undisturbed plants [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. All parts of the root system, especially deeper parts, are 
brittle and easily broken (Kutchera 1960 as cited by [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]), and new plants can arise 
from root fragments (see <a href="#Asexual regeneration">Asexual regeneration</a>). 
Roots of rush skeletonweed may be colonized by vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi [<a href="#39">39</a>].</p>


<p>
<b>Variation:</b> 
Rush skeletonweed is an apomict, reproducing without pollination or genetic recombination 
(see <a href="#Breeding system">Breeding system</a>). Therefore a particular 
gene combination can be expected to be maintained in the short term, as 
seedlings and daughter plants are genetically identical to their parent (clones) 
([<a href="#67">67</a>] and references therein). Over long periods, new variants may arise through autosegregation 
and/or random mutation as is evidenced by the high amount of clonal variation in 
rush skeletonweed in its native range [<a href="#16">16</a>]. Populations are typically composed of more 
than 1 genotype, although the level of diversity is usually substantially less than that 
in the western part of Turkey where sexual diploid populations can also occur ([<a href="#16">16</a>] and 
references therein).</p>

<p>
In Australia, 3 morphologically distinct &quot;forms&quot; (A, B, and C) or types of 
rush skeletonweed have been identified and can be distinguished by shape of rosette 
leaves, inflorescence morphology, fruit characters and regenerative potential from root 
fragments ([<a href="#67">67</a>] and references therein). Later work revealed that these types can be 
differentiated by isozyme patterns of 5 enzyme systems [<a href="#12">12</a>]. Chaboudez [<a href="#16">16</a>] found no 
match between clones in Australia (3 clones from 23 populations) and clones in Turkey 
(91 clones from 123 sites) using isozyme analysis.</p>

<p>
Accounts of variation in North American populations are unclear and 
inconsistent. In Washington, Rosenthal and others [<a href="#80">80</a>] identified 2 distinct 
types of rush skeletonweed. One type is an upright branching plant that grows to 
a maximum height of 33 inches (85 cm), and the other is more flatly branched and 
attains a maximum height of 16 inches (40 cm). The shorter type begins flowering 
from mid-June to July, and the taller type begins flowering 15 to 30 days later [<a href="#80">80</a>]. 
According to Piper [<a href="#72">72</a>], the early-flowering  type can grow to 24 inches (60 cm) tall, 
and is bushier and more compact in appearance than the late-flowering type. The 
late-flowering type has stems that are thicker, more erect and may grow as tall 
as 47 inches (120 cm). Both types frequently inhabit the same areas, although 
the late-flowering type is more numerous and widely distributed [<a href="#72">72</a>]. According to 
Harris [<a href="#40">40</a>] 3 distinct types of rush skeletonweed occur in the Pacific Northwest. Two of 
these grow to 51 inches (130 cm) tall and differ by flowering start (July or 
August). The 3rd type grows 26 to 35 inches (65-90 cm) tall, is highly branched, 
and begins flowering mid-July [<a href="#40">40</a>]. These 3 types have distinct and stable isozyme 
patterns [<a href="#41">41</a>]. Chaboudez [<a href="#16">16</a>] also states that 3 triploid clones have been identified 
in the U.S. No attempt has been made to name and publish any of these types as separate 
taxa at the subspecific level [<a href="#63">63</a>]. Old [<a href="#63">63</a>] suggests the possibility that many 
unrecognized varieties of rush skeletonweed may exist in North America.  </p>


<p>
<b>Life span:</b> 
Little information is available on the longevity of either disturbed or undisturbed 
rush skeletonweed plants [<a href="#58">58</a>]. The life span of individual plants varies, being determined 
by the interactive effects of such factors as drought, mechanical and chemical treatments, 
competition from other species and, for at least 1 type, attack by biological control agents 
[<a href="#67">67</a>]. Often described as a biennial or short-lived perennial in its native range, rush 
skeletonweed is described as a relatively long-lived perennial in Australia, especially 
where it is subjected to repeated disturbance and damage [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>]. According to Harris [<a href="#40">40</a>] 
rush skeletonweed plants live 3-4 years in Eurasia, but over 20 years in Australia.  </p>


<p>
<b>Stand structure:</b> 
Under favorable conditions, rush skeletonweed populations may develop extremely 
high densities. Rosette densities of up to 500 rush skeletonweed plants per m<sup>2</sup> were 
recorded on sandy soils in Victoria, Australia (Wells 1969, as cited by [<a href="#67">67</a>]). Rush 
skeletonweed stem densities of up to 20 to 60 stems per m<sup>2</sup> are recorded 
in summer-dry montane and Mediterranean habitats on crop and rangeland sites in 
the western U.S. [<a href="#40">40</a>].

Rush skeletonweed reproduces by seed, by root fragments, and by vegetative spread from 
vertical and lateral roots.

<p>
<b><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><a name="Breeding system">Breeding system</a>:</font></b> 
Rush skeletonweed is triploid and exhibits obligate apomyxis 
([<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>] and references therein), although sexual diploid 
populations can occur in the western part of Turkey ([<a href="#16">16</a>] and 
references therein). This breeding system may be beneficial to an invasive 
species in that it promotes genetic stability and also enables plants to 
reproduce in areas where environmental factors or pollinators may be 
limiting (Duke 1985, as cited by [<a href="#54">54</a>]). </p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Pollination:</b></font> 
Experimental evidence presented by McVean [<a href="#58">58</a>] and Cuthbertson [<a href="#24">24</a>] indicates that 
viable seed production in rush skeletonweed is completely independent of pollination. 
Flowers are visited by a wide variety of insects, and bees are known to collect the pollen; 
however, these insects serve no function for the plant [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].</p>

<p>
<b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Seed production: </font></b>
Rush skeletonweed seed production is extremely variable [<a href="#19">19</a>]. Rush skeletonweed plants can 
produce large amounts of seed over a relatively long period. Potential seed production has 
been estimated in the order of 70,000seeds per m<sup>2</sup> in a dense infestation in Australia 
(Cuthbertson 1967, as cited by [<a href="#67">67</a>]). Seed production and viability are determined primarily by the vigor 
of the plant up to the point of seed maturity [<a href="#19">19</a>], and may depend 
on plant age, plant genotype, moisture availability, summer air temperatures, infection with 
biological control insects, interactions with other control methods, and other site management 
factors. </p>

<p>
Rush skeletonweed flowerheads develop singly or in clusters of 2 to 5. Each head produces 
9 to 12 florets, each floret forms a seed, and viability is generally high [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>]. Most 
Australian first-year rush skeletonweed plants grown in a greenhouse produced between 59 and 150 
flowerheads, with 10 to 12 flowers per head, and total seed production between 500 and 1,500 
seeds per plant [<a href="#58">58</a>]. McVean [<a href="#58">58</a>] predicted that older, multiple-stemmed plants growing under 
field conditions could produce 10 times as many seeds.</p>

<p>
In western Australia, rush skeletonweed plants (types A and C) grown in a greenhouse 
produced between 3,000 and 13,070 seeds per plant, with 82% viability on 
average. Total number of seeds in rush skeletonweed plants grown in agricultural fields 
ranged from 13,730 to 27,550 and averaged 19,926 seeds per plant, with 75% viability. 
Some plants less than 1 year old  produced more than 10,000 seeds in the field [<a href="#67">67</a>].</p>

<p>
Seed production characteristics also differed between the 2 types tested. At one 
site, type C plants produced significantly (p&lt;0.001) more seed (14,120 vs. 8,430 
seeds per plant), of greater viability (79.4% vs. 73.9%), and with lower primary seed 
dormancy (3.5% vs. 11%), with less variation between harvest dates than type A plants [<a href="#28">28</a>].</p>

<p>
According to Cuthbertson [<a href="#24">24</a>] and McVean [<a href="#58">58</a>], moisture availability during flowering and 
seed maturation is a major factor in determining reproductive capacity in rush skeletonweed. 
McVean [<a href="#58">58</a>] found that well-watered plants produced seeds containing greater than 90% fully 
developed embryos, whereas droughted plants produced fewer than 10% viable seed. Under the most 
severe drought, flowering failed altogether. Similarly, Dodd and Panetta [<a href="#28">28</a>] found that simulated 
drought reduced seed numbers, viability, primary dormancy and seed weight in greenhouse-grown rush 
skeletonweed plants, although the 2 types, A and C, responded differently. Type A control plants 
averaged 7,570 seeds per plant one year and 8,290 seeds per plant the following year when type C 
control plants produced 2,750 seeds per plant. Drought reduced total seed numbers by 75% in 
type A plants, and by 46% in type C plants [<a href="#28">28</a>].</p>

<p>
Conversely, in field experiments in western Australia, most field-grown plants (types A and C) 
produced abundant viable seed, even without substantial summer rainfall. Summer rain did not increase 
seed output or affect viability in established plants, and there were no relationships in either type 
between the various seed characteristics and cumulative rainfall for different 2-week periods prior 
to seed harvest. According to Panetta and Dodd [<a href="#67">67</a>], rush skeletonweed's extensive root system allows it 
to &quot;become largely independent of&quot; summer rainfall for flower and seed production. However, 
long-term drought retards growth and development of rush skeletonweed, and limits production of 
viable seeds [<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].</p>

<p>
Rush skeletonweed seed production and viability appear to be sensitive to high summer 
temperatures (daytime maxima exceeding 91 �F (33 <font face="Times New Roman">�</font>C)) 
with low air humidity and low soil moisture [<a href="#58">58</a>]. Exceptionally high air temperatures appeared 
to depress seed numbers and/or viability at several sites [<a href="#28">28</a>]. </p>

<p>
Activity of biological control agents can also affect viable seed production in rush skeletonweed 
(see <a href="management_considerations.html#Biological:">Biological control</a>). A large difference 
in rush skeletonweed seed production was observed between 2 sites near Canberra, Australia, with seed 
output at one site at 4 seeds per m<sup>2</sup> compared with 1,642 seeds per m<sup>2</sup> at another 
site. The only difference between the 2 areas was the presence of 3 biological control organisms (the rust, 
the mite, and the midge) at the former site [<a href="#19">19</a>]. Stem colonization by gall mites (<i>Eriophyes chondrillae</i>) 
reduces the number of flowers and  seeds produced. In greenhouse experiments, rush skeletonweed plants 
without gall mites averaged 57 floral stems per plant, and the number of floral stems per plant decreased 
with increasing mite density. Plants averaging 180 mites per plant had 27 flowering stems; plants averaging 890 
mites per plant had 18 flowering stems; and plants averaging 1600 mites per plant had 15 flowering stems [<a href="#73">73</a>]. 
In Washington, McLellan [<a href="#57">57</a>] observed reduced seed production in gall mite-infested rush skeletonweed 
plants compared with uninfested plants; and Cullen and others [<a href="#20">20</a>] demonstrated up to 96% reduction in 
flower production in rush skeletonweed plants infected by gall mites. </p> 

<p>
Mowing rush skeletonweed before flowering, once or twice in a season, resulted in significantly 
(p&lt;0.05) lower seed production [<a href="#57">57</a>].</p> 

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seed dispersal:</b></font> 
Rush skeletonweed seeds are readily dispersed. Seeds are small and possess both a pappus, which 
facilitates wind dispersal, and a rough seed coat  with small teeth, which increases the chances of 
attachment to animals and other vectors. Rush skeletonweed seed may also be dispersed by a variety of 
human vectors, including rush skeletonweed contamination of agricultural products, especially hay. 
Transportation corridors are a common location for rush skeletonweed seed dispersal [<a href="#67">67</a>].</p> 

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b><a name="Seed banking:">Seed banking:</a></b></font>
According to several researchers, rush skeletonweed seeds remain viable for several years in the 
laboratory. Cuthbertson [<a href="#22">22</a>] found that germination rates remain high (93.6% to 98.7%) for rush 
skeletonweed seed stored in open containers in the laboratory for 1 to 2 years. Germination rates 
decreased rapidly after that, with some germination after 3 years, 0% to 2.6% germination after 4 
years, and no germination after 5 years of storage. Storage temperature and other conditions are not 
given [<a href="#22">22</a>]. According to Old [<a href="#62">62</a>] rush skeletonweed seeds refrigerated at 37 �F 
(3 <font face="Times New Roman">�</font>C) maintained a high degree of viability for up to 8 years 
and showed a low degree of viability after as long as 16 years. In most cases length of time to germinate 
increased with length of storage. Liao and others [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>] found that up to 60% of rush skeletonweed 
seeds collected in Idaho remained viable after 1 year of storage, with viability decreasing over time. 
Stored seeds generally exhibited higher germination rates (90% average) than fresh seeds (67% average), 
indicating possible dormancy and afterripening effects [<a href="#53">53</a>]. 
</p>

<p>
Several authors suggest that most rush skeletonweed seeds exhibit little or no dormancy (estimates 
between 0 and 40% dormancy) [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>], although this attribute appears to vary between rush 
skeletonweed  types [<a href="#67">67</a>]. Because mature rush skeletonweed seeds typically germinate readily, regardless 
of collection date, over a wide range of temperatures, and independent of light availability [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>], 
they may not form a long-lived seed bank. Further evidence to support this comes from studies 
indicating that rush skeletonweed seeds are short-lived under field conditions and generally 
survive for less than 6 to 18 months [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. Liao and others [<a href="#53">53</a>] found up to 60% of non-germinating 
rush skeletonweed seeds were viable, suggesting that nongerminating seeds may persist in the seedbank 
under some conditions.</p>

<p>
Panetta [<a href="#64">64</a>] found that buried rush skeletonweed seeds germinated readily following summer 
rainfall events of less than 0.4 inch (10 mm) in Australia. Seedlings did not survive due to 
inadequate moisture availability following germination. Seeds lying on the surface were 
less likely to germinate in response to small rainfall events, but were prone to predation by 
seed-harvesting ants. These conditions lead to considerable  losses of rush skeletonweed seed. 
Panetta [<a href="#64">64</a>] also found that only &quot;a few&quot; rush skeletonweed seeds survived after 4 months 
burial at 2 inches (4 cm). According to Cullen and Groves [<a href="#19">19</a>], fire and breakdown by pathogens may 
also lead to rush skeletonweed seed losses, although no details are given.</p>

<p>
There is little to no rush skeletonweed seed accumulation between years under field 
conditions [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>]. Panetta [<a href="#65">65</a>] measured a maximum of 3.1% of a rush skeletonweed 
seed crop surviving between years, during a year with a particularly dry summer. In Washington, 
attempts to recover rush skeletonweed seeds from soil under dense infestations have been 
unsuccessful, a factor which gives some support to the Australian conclusion that few rush 
skeletonweed seeds remain viable in the field from one year to the next [<a href="#82">82</a>].</p>

<p>
<b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Germination:</font></b> 
In general, rush skeletonweed seeds have high viability and high germination rates. Viability 
is not dependent on pollinators [<a href="#24">24</a>] and does not appear to be affected by moisture 
availability during the growing season [<a href="#54">54</a>], although it does appear to decrease during storage 
[<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>]. Germination of rush skeletonweed seeds does not require light [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>] and 
occurs over a wide range of temperatures [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>]. Germination is sensitive to moisture 
availability and depth of seed burial [<a href="#22">22</a>].</p> 

<p>
Cuthbertson [<a href="#24">24</a>] found 95.8% seed viability from unstressed rush skeletonweed 
plants, while McVean [<a href="#58">58</a>] found that, even under ideal germination conditions, 
up to 20% of ripe embryos may &quot;remain dormant or die.&quot; Normally dispersed rush 
skeletonweed seeds collected in Washington gave no indication of innate dormancy. Immediately after collection, samples gave 95% germination 
on blotters [<a href="#82">82</a>]. Storage tests indicate viability may be lost over time (see
<a href="#Seed banking:">Seed banking</a>).</p> 

<p>
Rush skeletonweed seeds from 2 populations of rush skeletonweed in southwestern 
Idaho were capable of immediate germination without scarification or wet prechilling. 
Total germination generally ranged from 60 to 100% throughout the entire seed 
production period (July through October). Germination percentages were lower for rush 
skeletonweed seeds harvested late in the season. Germination was rapid, reaching 50% of 
total in less than 12 days. Germination differed among harvest dates, rearing sites, and 
between years of collection. Rush skeletonweed seed from the lower elevation site tended 
to have higher viability, especially early in the season. Seeds formed in the dry year 
(4%-33% below average precipitation) were 
as viable and had higher and faster germination than those from the wet year 
(12%-43% above average precipitation) [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].</p> 

<p>
Rush skeletonweed seed germination occurs over a wide range of temperatures 
between 45 and 104 �F (7-40<font face="Times New Roman">�</font>C) 
[<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>]. Germination is extremely rapid at the optimum temperature (around 
77 �F (25 <font face="Times New Roman">�</font>C)), 
beginning within 6 to 8 hours and reaching 60% to 90% of its maximum within 24 
hours [<a href="#58">58</a>]. Germination of rush skeletonweed seed was higher at an 
incubation temperature regime of 68/50 �F (20/10 
<font face="Times New Roman">�</font>C) (50% germination in 6 days) as compared 
with 68/86 �F (20/30 <font face="Times New Roman">�</font>C) 
(50% germination in 9.5 days) (dark/light, respectively) [<a href="#53">53</a>].</p> 

<p>
Germination of rush skeletonweed seed is sensitive to moisture availability. Cuthbertson 
[<a href="#22">22</a>] found that rates and final percentages of germination were reduced 
progressively at osmotic tensions below -0.2 MPa, until germination ceased at 
-1.6 MPa. According to Schirman and Robocker [<a href="#82">82</a>], water held by the pappus of a 
group of rush skeletonweed seeds following a summer shower in Washington is sufficient 
to support radicle elongation. They found complete germination inhibition only at tensions 
exceeding -1.5 MPa [<a href="#82">82</a>]. Similarly, buried rush skeletonweed seeds germinated readily following summer 
rainfall events of less than 0.4 inch (10 mm) in Australia [<a href="#64">64</a>]. </p> 

<p>
Moisture loss may be rapid when fully or partially imbibed rush skeletonweed seeds are 
exposed to drying influences, so germination may be promoted by slight burial [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]. 
In Australian studies, rush skeletonweed seeds lying on the surface were much less likely 
to germinate in response to small rainfall events [<a href="#64">64</a>]. Seedlings emerged successfully 
from rush skeletonweed seeds buried up to about 2 inches (5 cm) in sandy soil, but did not 
emerge from seeds at this depth in soils of finer texture [<a href="#58">58</a>]. Maximum depth of seed 
burial resulting in rush skeletonweed seedling emergence was 1 inch (2.5 cm) in a 
medium-textured soil, and no emergence was observed from seeds buried below 
0.75 inch (2 cm) in clay soils ([<a href="#60">60</a>] and references therein). Rush skeletonweed 
seeds are sensitive to reduced oxygen and fail to germinate below the surface of waterlogged 
soil [<a href="#58">58</a>]. </p> 

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seedling establishment/growth:</b></font> 
Rush skeletonweed seedling establishment is highly variable from year to year and 
from site to site [<a href="#19">19</a>], and depends on moisture 
supply, soil texture and nutrient status, and depth of seed burial.</p>

<p>
Rush skeletonweed seedlings require a continuous supply of moisture for 3 to 6 weeks 
in order to establish a viable root system and to avoid death by desiccation [<a href="#19">19</a>]. 
Depletion of seed pools may follow isolated rainfall during summer months, when there 
is enough moisture to allow germination, but not enough to support seedling establishment 
[<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>]. During experiments in Australia, only 0.03% of viable rush skeletonweed seeds established 
seedlings following 1.5 inches (38 mm) of simulated rainfall during January (summer), 
whereas 50% establishment occurred under similar conditions in autumn [<a href="#58">58</a>]. Panetta 
[<a href="#64">64</a>] observed virtually no establishment from summer germination.</p>

<p>
Rush skeletonweed seedling establishment is also dependent on soil conditions. 
Experimental evidence presented by McVean [<a href="#58">58</a>] indicates that soil disturbance is 
extremely favorable to seedling establishment and must be a factor of 
considerable importance in the field. Cuthbertson [<a href="#22">22</a>] presents data on 
rush skeletonweed seed germination and seedling establishment in different soil 
types at varying burial depths. Emergence was reduced and delayed with increased 
burial depth in all soil types, with little emergence from rush skeletonweed seeds 
buried deeper than 1 inch (2.5 cm), and no emergence from seeds buried 2 inches 
(5 cm) deep in any soil type. Optimum emergence was from a depth of 0.2 inch (6 mm) 
in all soils except sand. Hypocotyl extension by rush skeletonweed was restricted in 
clays relative to other soils. Cracking and heaving in clay soils may also impede rush skeletonweed establishment [<a href="#22">22</a>].</p>

<p>
Survivorship of 1st-year rush skeletonweed plants was higher on a deep sand 
than on a loamy sand overlaying a sandy clay (duplex soil) in Australia. Mortality 
on the latter was associated with drying of the A horizon during early summer. No rush 
skeletonweed plants produced seeds in their 1st year of growth on the duplex soil. 
Both rush skeletonweed plant types tested produced viable seeds when growing 
on the deep sand in both years of the study. The author suggests that while large 
areas of the Australian wheatbelt may be climatically suitable for rush 
skeletonweed, its invasive potential may be limited by edaphic characteristics over 
large areas [<a href="#66">66</a>].</p>

<p>
Experimental evidence presented by McVean [<a href="#58">58</a>] indicates fairly high levels of readily 
available calcium and phosphorus are both important for initial establishment of rush 
skeletonweed seedlings. Low levels of nitrogen (0.062%) do not preclude rush skeletonweed 
establishment, although seedlings do better with higher levels. Rush skeletonweed seedlings 
are also sensitive to competition and shading from other plants [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b><a name="Asexual regeneration">Asexual regeneration</a>:</b></font> 
The primary means of local population increase of rush skeletonweed is through vegetative 
regeneration rather than by seedling establishment [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>], although this may vary among 
years. Rush skeletonweed has an extensive and persistent root system and can reproduce 
vegetatively by adventitious buds on vertical and lateral roots in undisturbed plants, 
and in response to injury [<a href="#23">23</a>].  </p>


<p>
The taproot of rush skeletonweed may reach several meters into soil and 
branch at depth. Lateral root production in rush skeletonweed may vary with soil 
type, plant density, and plant biotype. Lateral roots occur most commonly on 
rush skeletonweed plants in sandy soils [<a href="#19">19</a>], and in sparse stands of rush 
skeletonweed rather than in dense stands. In Washington, the early-flowering 
 
type had more lateral roots than the late-flowering type [<a href="#80">80</a>]. Many laterals 
are short (&lt;3 inches (8 cm) long) and ephemeral, lasting 1 season at most, 
while some laterals near the soil surface show taproot characteristics and 
grow horizontally for 6 to 20 inches (15-50 cm) before turning downward [<a href="#67">67</a>].</p>


<p>
In established, undisturbed rush skeletonweed plants, daughter rosettes can develop from 
adventitious buds near the top of the tap root, giving rise to a root crown that 
bears several rosettes with a common root system [<a href="#23">23</a>]. These stem buds usually occur in 
the upper 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm) of the main taproot [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. Rosettes may also form from 
buds along the main lateral roots, 3 to 6 inches (8-15 cm) below the 
soil surface, and about 8 to 18 inches (20-45 cm) away from the parent plant. 
These rosettes may form their own roots to become satellite plants when the 
original lateral root connection with the parent plant breaks down [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. 
Rush skeletonweed infestations may spread by as much as 2 feet (0.6 m) per year by 
formation of satellite plants along lateral roots [<a href="#62">62</a>].</p>


<p>
It appears that the asexual regenerative capacity of rush skeletonweed plants during 
bolting, flowering and seed production is lower than that of vegetative plants. Rush 
skeletonweed plants observed in Washington ceased bud production after flower stem initiation 
in mid-April, and started again after seeds were dispersed in mid-September to 
early October [<a href="#80">80</a>]. </p>


<p>
When established rush skeletonweed plants are subjected to cutting, grazing, 
herbicide or insect damage, or any severe injury to rosettes or taproots, 
adventitious root buds may be produced almost anywhere on the remaining root 
system and give rise new rosettes  [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>]. New stems can reputedly 
reach the surface from buds over 3 feet (1 m) deep [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>], although most regeneration 
occurs from depths of less than 18 inches (45cm) ([<a href="#67">67</a>] and references therein).</p>


<p>
A critical factor in rush skeletonweed regeneration after injury is the energy 
balance of the root [<a href="#19">19</a>]. The relatively thick and fleshy taproot and main 
branch roots are usually rich in carbohydrate reserves ([<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>] and references 
therein). The level of carbohydrate reserves is relative to the age of the plant, 
time between successive injuries, and the rate of recovery as influenced by vigor 
of the resulting top growth [<a href="#19">19</a>]. Regeneration was observed from 5-week-old plants 
after removal of the rosette at ground level (Groves and Hull 1966, as cited by 
[<a href="#23">23</a>]). Under field conditions, however, the small roots of such young plants would 
be extremely susceptible to desiccation and therefore unlikely to regenerate [<a href="#23">23</a>].</p>


<p>
Rush skeletonweed roots are extremely fragile [<a href="#60">60</a>] and when severed, 
new rush skeletonweed shoots can form from detached root fragments 
[<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. Cultivation or other soil disturbance can greatly 
increase rush skeletonweed rosette density since the roots become 
fragmented and each tiny fragment may give rise to a new plant [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>]. 
The regenerative capacity of rush skeletonweed by root fragments is influenced by 
moisture availability, fragment size, depth of burial, soil type, and time of 
year; as well as plant characteristics such as plant size, depth of origin of 
the root fragment, and plant age, reproductive status, biotype and vigor [<a href="#67">67</a>].</p>


<p>
In general the capacity of rush skeletonweed to regenerate from root 
fragments increases with the size of the fragment [<a href="#23">23</a>]. Rush 
skeletonweed root segments as small as 1 inch (2.5 cm) produced 3 buds 
(Kefford 1964, as cited by [<a href="#60">60</a>]). In a laboratory experiment, Cuthbertson [<a href="#23">23</a>] 
observed little to no shoot production from 0.4 inch (1 cm) rush skeletonweed 
root cuttings at all burial depths and soil types, while shoots from fragments 
0.8 to 1.5 inches (2-4 cm) long emerged from up to 16 inches (40 cm) deep in sand. 
Fragments this small would likely die of desiccation in the field.  </p>


<p>
In general, the capacity of rush skeletonweed to regenerate from root 
fragments decreases as the depth of burial increases, but this also varies with 
soil type. Shoot growth and emergence from taproot cuttings are generally greater 
in sandy soils than in clays. Fragments 1.5 inches (4 cm) long were unable to emerge from 
4 inches (10 cm) deep in heavy clay soil, and were able to emerge from all burial depths 
up to 16 inches (40 cm) deep in sand [<a href="#23">23</a>]. </p>


<p>
Root fragments had different sprouting capacities at different times of year 
in eastern Washington. Root sections formed buds from October to March, while 
bud formation was nearly zero during June, and increased in August and thereafter, 
decreasing in November. Decline in shoot production coincides with increased day length and 
flower stem initiation [<a href="#80">80</a>].</p>


<p>
Rush skeletonweed plants attain the capacity to reproduce vegetatively at a 
very early age. Under laboratory conditions, shoots were produced by about 40% 
of cuttings taken from taproots of 2- to 4-week-old seedlings, and by 95% to 
100% of cuttings from 5- to 7-week-old plants [<a href="#23">23</a>]. Excised roots averaging 7 
inches (18 cm) long, from 36-day-old seedlings, produced an average of 5.8 buds 
per root after 21 days at 77 �F (25 <font face="Times New Roman">�</font>C) 
in darkness. Under the same conditions, 17-day-old rootlets averaging 6 inches (16 cm) 
in length failed to produce stem buds (Kefford 1964, as cited by [<a href="#60">60</a>]).</p>


<p>
All parts of the taproot appear to be capable of producing new shoot 
initials, although the number of shoots produced per fragment decreased as depth 
of origin increased [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. Distance from the root apex had no effect on the 
regeneration of 1.5-inch (4 cm) sections excised from 50 day old roots. All sections 
regenerated and produced approximately 3 buds per section (Kefford 1964, as cited by [<a href="#60">60</a>]).</p>


<p>
In Australia, different types of rush skeletonweed differ in their regenerative 
capacity. Root cuttings from type C plants produced greater numbers of shoot buds 
than those of types A and B, regardless of the root diameter, plant age or depth 
of origin of the cutting. Bud production increased with age in types A and C, but 
decreased in Type B plants (Hull and Groves 1973, as cited by [<a href="#67">67</a>]). Similarly, 
Rosenthal and others [<a href="#80">80</a>] observed differences in root production between the early- 
and late-flowering biotypes in Washington. After 6 months growth in buried 
cans, the early-flowering type averaged 6.7 major roots per plant and the 
late-flowering type averaged 10.7 major roots per plant.  After 18 months, 
the early-flowering plant showed no further increase in root numbers, while 
the late-flowering plants averaged 16 major roots per plant [<a href="#80">80</a>]. </p>


<p>
Regeneration from root fragments may also depend on the reproductive status 
of the plant from which the fragment originates. Regeneration occurred on 7% of 
cuttings from the top 16 inches (40 cm) of taproot from reproductive plants, 
compared with 15% for vegetative plants [<a href="#23">23</a>].

It seems that a particular combination of climate, soil type and disturbance is 
most favorable to dense infestations of rush skeletonweed. According to Wapshere 
and others [<a href="#99">99</a>], dense stands of rush skeletonweed are rare in western Europe because 
areas of optimal climate are limited and widely scattered, only small areas of suitable 
sandy soil are available, and the type of cultivation (wheat/fallow) most associated with 
dense stands of rush skeletonweed is rarely practiced in the western Mediterranean. The 
possibility of such a combination of circumstances co-occurring together 
for a sufficiently long time for population build-up to occur to dense levels in the 
western Mediterranean is slight

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>General climate:</b></font> 
Rush skeletonweed occurs over a wide range of climatic conditions. The greater part 
of its native range lies in Mediterranean and steppe climates. Rush skeletonweed does 
not occur in the cool, maritime climates of extreme western Europe nor in arid, desert 
climates of central Algeria, southern Iraq or central Australia. Humid, subtropical climates 
are apparently suitable for rush skeletonweed, provided the winters are cool. Optimum 
conditions for rush skeletonweed in Australia include cool winters, warm summers without 
severe summer drought, a distinct increase in precipitation at the onset of the cool season, 
and additional spring rainfall [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]. Bioclimatic prediction techniques indicate virtually 
all of the western Australian wheatbelt is climatically suitable for rush skeletonweed ([<a href="#67">67</a>] 
and references therein). Summer-dry montane and Mediterranean habitats are favored by rush 
skeletonweed in the western U.S. [<a href="#40">40</a>]. </p>

<p>
Induction of bolting and flowering in rush skeletonweed is somewhat dependent on 
the extent of cold temperature exposure (vernalization) [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>]. Rush skeletonweed 
has no absolute requirement for vernalization although this process accelerates both 
bolting and flowering [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]. The distribution limits in southeastern Australia 
almost coincide with the isotherm for a mean minimum temperature of 41 �F 
(5 <font face="Times New Roman">�</font>C) over the months of April to July or with that 
for a mean monthly temperature of 50 �F (10 <font face="Times New Roman">�</font>C) 
from June to August. The southern limit of rush skeletonweed in the eastern Mediterranean also 
correlates rather well with the incidence of low winter temperatures. There have 
been no records of frost damage in rush skeletonweed from any part of its range, 
and even newly established seedlings appear to be frost resistant [<a href="#58">58</a>].</p>

<p>
A comparison of altitudinal limits in both hemispheres and the latitudinal limit of 
rush skeletonweed in northern Europe indicates that summer temperatures of at least 
59 �F (15  <font face="Times New Roman">�</font>C) are required for 
flowering and seed formation [<a href="#58">58</a>]. Rush skeletonweed requires a photoperiod of 12 to 
14 hours to induce bolting and flowering [<a href="#15">15</a>]. </p>

<p>
Panetta and Mitchell [<a href="#68">68</a>] present the following averages for rush skeletonweed's 
Australian temperature profile:</p>

</p>

<p>
Temperature requirements are less likely to limit rush skeletonweed 
distribution than are summer storms that result in premature germination 
of rush skeletonweed seeds [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>]. </p>



<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Soil characteristics, soil moisture:</b></font> 
Where rush skeletonweed is native, it appears to favor coarse-textured, 
well-drained soils such as sand dunes, granite outcrops, and other coarse 
soils (Iljin 1930, as cited by [<a href="#58">58</a>]). In all parts of its native range 
the soils on which rush skeletonweed grows appear to be calcareous or only 
mildly acid [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].</p>



<p>
In general, the soils on which dense infestations of rush skeletonweed 
were found in Mediterranean Europe had a relatively high 
percentage of sand and were low in nutrients [<font face="Times New Roman">91,</font>92]. 
Rush skeletonweed occurred where soils had 72.6 to 81.5% sand, 0.75 to 1.61% organic N, and 0.43 to 
0.24% assimilable phosphate (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>). Sites with dense 
populations of rush skeletonweed had 2 main soil types: little disturbed, 
degraded dunes with 92.6% sand, 41.2% Ca, 0.64� organic N, 0.11� assimilable 
P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>; and disturbed sites (cultivated sites or roadsides) 
with 81.2% sand, 6.1% Ca,  1.29� organic N, and 0.32� assimilable P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> 
[<a href="#99">99</a>]. According to Wapshere and others [<a href="#99">99</a>], the optimal nutrient level 
for rush skeletonweed is relatively low, and competition (promoted by high 
nutrient levels) is of much greater relative importance to rush skeletonweed 
survival than is nutrient availability.</p>


<p>
In Australia, rush skeletonweed occurs on all but heavy clay soils 
and develops best and is most abundant on deep sands, sandy loams, 
and sandy-clay loams [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]. Rush skeletonweed plants generally 
do not establish on undisturbed, fine-textured soils [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]. In a 
review article, Panetta and Dodd [<a href="#67">67</a>] provide evidence of rush skeletonweed 
occurrence on sandy soils with pH values in the range of 5.3 to 8.9, 
and its absence on adjacent, heavier textured soils. Similarly, Moore [<a href="#60">60</a>] 
indicates rush skeletonweed occurrence on soils with pH ranges from 4.5 
to 8.0 in Australia. </p>



<p>
In Washington state, rush skeletonweed occurs most commonly on 
sites characterized by one of 2 distinct soil types. One is 
extremely shallow soil over bedrock, the majority of which occurs in the 
channeled scablands and is typified by the presence of wavyleaf thistle. The other consists of sandy to gravelly soils 
primarily of glacial origin, and often indicated by the presence of 
Dalmatian toadflax (see<a href="distribution_and_occurrence.html#HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES">
Habitat types and plant communities</a>). These 2 soil types correspond well to 
soils favored by rush skeletonweed in its native range where rush skeletonweed 
occurs primarily on either sandy steppes or stony habitats (Ilgin 1930 as cited by [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>]). 
Observations in southwestern Idaho also indicate that rush skeletonweed is most 
common on coarse-textured, deep, well-drained soils. Fine-textured soils 
appear to impede rush skeletonweed root development and regeneration by buds 
on lateral roots [<a href="#54">54</a>].</p>



<p>
Soil types that favor establishment and persistence of rush skeletonweed support mesic-xeric to xeric plant communities. These communities naturally 
display very low density plant cover which provides rush skeletonweed seedlings 
a favorable environment  for establishment. The coarse textured soils also allows 
for  lateral root growth and horizontal spread of rush skeletonweed [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>]. Rush 
skeletonweed also occasionally occurs in deeper and/or finer textured soils when 
spread by root fragments [<a href="#63">63</a>]. Because of the high degree of conformity of 
rush skeletonweed infestation to shallow or sandy-gravelly soil types, Old [<a href="#63">63</a>] 
predicts that the rush skeletonweed infestation in extreme eastern Washington will 
remain primarily one of rangeland. Sites with an artificial gravel substrate 
(e.g. road fill, railroad fill, gravel pits) are also known to be susceptible to 
rush skeletonweed establishment [<a href="#63">63</a>].</p>



<p>
<b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Precipitation:</b></font>
In the western Mediterranean, maximum densities of rush skeletonweed occur 
in areas with a relatively hot, dry summer without a heavy drought, with an 
average rainfall of 16 to 28 inches (400-700 mm), relatively evenly distributed 
throughout the year. In this region, a wetter climate may inhibit rush 
skeletonweed by promoting competition  [<a href="#99">99</a>]. Sites in Greece where rush 
skeletonweed was observed had average annual rainfall ranging from 15 to 25 
inches (384-642 mm) [<a href="#98">98</a>]. In Australia rush skeletonweed has been recorded 
from districts with mean annual rainfalls ranging from 9 to 60 inches (230-1520 mm) 
[<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>]. </p>



<p>
According to a review by Liao [<a href="#54">54</a>], rush skeletonweed occurs in areas ranging 
from sites in eastern Washington where the average annual precipitation is less 
than 10 inches (250 mm), to sites in western Oregon where the average annual precipitation 
exceeds 40 inches (1000 mm).</p>



<p>
Timing of precipitation is important for establishment and spread of rush 
skeletonweed. In areas where summer showers followed by severe drying are 
common, the rush skeletonweed seed bank is likely to be depleted since seedlings 
are likely to die of desiccation, thus limiting its spread by seed [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].</p>



<p>
<b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Elevation/</b></font>
<b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">aspect</font></b>
The elevational range of rush skeletonweed is from close to sea level in 
Australia and Europe up to 5,100 feet (1,550 m) in Central Europe, Cyprus 
and the Southern Highlands of New South Wales, and up to 5,900 feet (1,800 m) 
in Armenia. Between the Caspian Sea and Mongolia rush skeletonweed is 
found only on  areas of elevated land and not in the surrounding low-lying steppe 
(Iljin 1930, as cited by [<a href="#58">58</a>]).</p>



<p>
In Australia, infestations along roadsides and sheep tracks are common at 
4,000 to 4,900 feet (1,200-1,500 m), but these plants do not flower until 
the end of March, by which time the flowering season below an altitude of 
2,000 feet (600 m) has been completed. It has been observed that plants growing 
at elevations near 5,400 feet (1,650 m) in Australia may not flower until just 
before the onset of winter, so that little or no seed is set [<a href="#58">58</a>].</p>


<p>
Rush skeletonweed occurs from sea level to 2,000 feet (0-600 m) in California 
[<a href="#45">45</a>], and up to  3,000 feet (950 m) in British Columbia [<a href="#40">40</a>]. </p>



<p>
No rush skeletonweed populations were found on north facing slopes in eastern 
Washington [<a href="#62">62</a>].</p>



<p>
<b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Latitude/longitude: </b></font>
In its native range, rush skeletonweed is found between 35<font face="Times New Roman">�</font> 
and 55<font face="Times New Roman">�</font> N latitude, and Australian 
infestations occur between 26<font face="Times New Roman">�</font> to 38
<font face="Times New Roman">�</font> S latitude. In North America, rush skeletonweed 
is most common in the wheat-growing plains of the Palouse 
between 38<font face="Times New Roman">�</font> and 48<font face="Times New Roman">�</font> 
N latitude [<a href="#58">58</a>].</p>



<p>
Induction of bolting and flowering in rush skeletonweed is somewhat dependent 
on day length [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>], requiring between 8 and 14.5 hours of daylight [<a href="#8">8</a>]. 
Delays in flowering may be anticipated in low latitudes, but are 
unlikely to affect the distribution of rush skeletonweed in northern 
Australia, where day length varies from 12 to 13 hours [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>]. Rush skeletonweed 
requires a photoperiod of 12 hours at low temperatures (50 to 59 �F 
(10-15 <font face="Times New Roman">�</font>C)) and 14 hours at higher temperatures 
(72 to 81 �F (22-27 <font face="Times New Roman">�</font>C)) to 
induce bolting and flowering [<a href="#15">15</a>]. </p>



<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Evidence of disturbance:</b></font> 
Rush skeletonweed is able to thrive where soil disturbance occurs. Removal of natural 
vegetation and/or cultivation may provide opportunities for rush skeletonweed to 
establish. These disturbances create a favorable seedbed for rush skeletonweed 
germination and seedling establishment and remove competition [<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].</p>

<p>
Throughout Europe and the Mediterranean islands, rush skeletonweed is 
primarily a species of disturbed roadsides although it is also found on 
river banks, dry river beds, degraded coastal dunes, and eroded ground. 
It may be extremely abundant on &quot;waste land&quot; and in fallow and 
abandoned fields but is seldom reported as a troublesome weed in crops [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>]. 
Soil disturbance is extremely favorable to rush skeletonweed seedling establishment. 
Disturbance by cultivation, soil erosion, and road grading and the weakening of the 
original vegetation cover by overgrazing and/or drought, have provided rush 
skeletonweed with ample opportunity to colonize and spread in Europe, Asia, 
North America, and Australia [<a href="#58">58</a>].</p>



<p>
Frequency of disturbance may be important to rush skeletonweed densities. In Greece, 
rush skeletonweed was rare (&lt;1 plant/100m<sup>2</sup>) in continuously cultivated 
situations, more common in  cereal cultivation (2-7 plants/m<sup>2</sup>), and 
most abundant on recently abandoned fields (30-60 plants/m<sup>2</sup>). Population 
densities were lower in long abandoned and rough pasture situations (2-20 
plants/m<sup>2</sup>) [<a href="#98">98</a>].</p>



<p>
In Australia, rush skeletonweed occurs at highest densities on cultivated 
land under a wheat/fallow system, and in volunteer annual pastures that follow 
crops [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]. The inland distribution of rush skeletonweed in Australia 
often coincides with the limit of wheat cropping [<a href="#58">58</a>]. It forms tall, dense, 
almost continuous thickets on roadsides and other places subject to repeated 
disturbance, such as pastures [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]. Rush skeletonweed does not usually 
invade native or improved pasture [<a href="#68">68</a>], but may establish dense stands in native 
pasture weakened by drought and overgrazing [<a href="#58">58</a>].</p>



<p>
In North America, rush skeletonweed is found along railroads, roadsides 
[<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>], fields [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>], &quot;waste places&quot; [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>], 
and disturbed ground [<a href="#45">45</a>]. Areas of road and rail fill and other areas of 
artificial gravel substrate are particularly susceptible to infestation by 
rush skeletonweed. In Oregon&nbsp;the use of gravel from an 80 acre (32 ha) 
gravel pit which was heavily infested with rush skeletonweed was the major means of 
distribution of rush skeletonweed for that state [<a href="#62">62</a>]. </p>



<p>
According to Harris [<a href="#40">40</a>], in Canada, rough fescue range in good condition is 
resistant to rush skeletonweed invasion. Rush skeletonweed may occur in elk 
yards and around salt licks, but not in adjacent areas with vigorous native 
vegetation. Rush skeletonweed rosette leaves are palatable to cattle and 
wildlife, so small amounts in rangeland are not considered problematic. The 
more serious problem occurs on overgrazed sites, and those disturbed by 
off-road vehicles or other means. On these sites, rush skeletonweed is likely 
to become the dominant herbaceous species. Rush skeletonweed invades disturbed 
open-canopied forest and logged areas [<a href="#40">40</a>].

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SUCCESSIONAL STATUS">
SUCCESSIONAL STATUS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Rush skeletonweed appears to be an early seral species that establishes well 
on disturbed soil. It is not known how long a rush skeletonweed population 
will persist on a site in the absence of disturbance. There are no studies of 
rush skeletonweed competition with native species in areas where it is invasive. 
Competition studies with subterranean clover in Australia indicate that rush 
skeletonweed is somewhat tolerant of shade [<a href="#58">58</a>], and a study in Washington state 
indicates that rush skeletonweed can occur under a ponderosa pine canopy, although 
the disturbance history of that site is not described [<a href="#62">62</a>]. On some sites, a 
decline in density of rush skeletonweed may lead to dominance by other nonnative 
invasive species [<a href="#61">61</a>].


<p>
Reduction in numbers of established rosettes of rush skeletonweed as a result 
of competition from subterranean clover has been demonstrated (Moore and 
Robertson 1964, as cited by [<a href="#58">58</a>]). A reduction in illumination to 10% to 20% 
of full daylight did not prevent rush skeletonweed seedling establishment, 
but plants did not flower and had slight to marked etiolation. A reduction 
to 50% of full daylight reduced but did not prevent some flowering and seed 
setting in rush skeletonweed. A reduction in light to below 1% of full daylight 
at soil level completely prevented seedling establishment [<a href="#58">58</a>]. These results 
suggest that cover crops producing shade of this order for several months 
during the winter rosette stage of first-year plants may reduce infestations 
of rush skeletonweed. The major part of competition appears to be for light, 
but root competition for water and nutrients may also arise [<a href="#58">58</a>].</p>



<p>
Due to limited shade tolerance of both rush skeletonweed seedlings and 
mature plants, it is seldom found under trees. This is consistent for 
data from north and central Idaho, Oregon and most of Washington. However, 
rush skeletonweed plants were found beneath ponderosa pine trees at a site 
in Stevens county, Washington, and seemed to prefer that location at that 
site. The author suggests that genetic modification of characteristics 
such as shade tolerance could in the long run cause shifts in ecologic 
amplitude of rush skeletonweed [<a href="#62">62</a>].</p>



<p>
A decline in rush skeletonweed, presumably due to  the establishment and 
spread of biological control agents, was observed in Spokane County, 
Washington. The vacant lots once &quot;noticeably infested&quot; with rush 
skeletonweed became dominated, instead, by spotted and/or diffuse knapweed 
over a period of 5 to 10 years [<a href="#61">61</a>]. 

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT">
SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Seasonal development in rush skeletonweed populations may vary with geographic 
location, elevation, precipitation, and plant biotype.



<p>
In Europe, rush skeletonweed is described as  biennial. However, 
in Australia and North America it is described as perennial, although 
some confusion has arisen due to its unusual habit of flowering in its 
1st year [<a href="#62">62</a>].</p>



<p>
The life cycle of rush skeletonweed in Australia is described by several 
authors (e.g. [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>]). The annual growth cycle of established 
plants begins with  rosette formation in early autumn, usually in April or 
May. One to several new rosettes form on the root of the parent plant 
and grow throughout winter and spring. Peak seedling emergence is in June, 
although seedlings may establish as early as April [<a href="#65">65</a>]. There 
is no evidence for a spring seedling crop from seeds overwintered 
in the soil, although if viable seeds are present in spring they may germinate if 
moisture is sufficient. Spring germinated plants did not flower in the same 
summer in the field or in the greenhouse at Canberra [<a href="#58">58</a>].</p>



<p>
Seedlings remain in the cotyledon stage for several weeks during which time 
the radicle elongates rapidly to initiate a deep taproot system. Seedling 
rosette growth proceeds slowly during winter months, whereas the 
taproot grows rapidly, about 0.4 inch (1 cm) per day. The ratio of 
root to top growth depends on air and soil temperatures [<a href="#58">58</a>]. Rush 
skeletonweed plants usually produce a flowering stem  the 1st year of 
growth, although crowded plants on poor soil may fail to flower 
the 1st season. In this case, the flowering stem may persist for 
the greater part of winter [<a href="#58">58</a>], although this is uncommon [<a href="#67">67</a>].</p>



<p>
Aerial flowering stems are initiated in spring from the central growing 
points of rush skeletonweed rosettes and begin to elongate in spring 
(September and October in Australia) [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]. While the flowering 
stem elongates and branches, the rosette leaves usually die, leaving 
the plant virtually leafless over summer [<a href="#67">67</a>]. Under greenhouse conditions, 
the period of inflorescence development (i.e. time taken from the 
start of stem elongation to the opening of the first flower) ranged 
from about 84 to 104 days, depending on the geographic origin of 
seed material (Hull and Groves 1973, as cited by [<a href="#67">67</a>]).  </p>



<p>
In western Australia, rush skeletonweed flowering generally 
begins in mid- to late December (slightly earlier at lower 
latitudes and at lower elevations), and ceases around April. 
Flowering and seed production reach a peak in mid-summer 
(January and February) and continue at low rates in some 
plants until late May [<a href="#28">28</a>]. Rush skeletonweed flowers open 
early one morning, close again before sunset and do not open again 
the following day. In hot, dry weather, flowers may remain 
open for only a few hours [<a href="#58">58</a>]. Within 4 days the achene is 
fully grown and the pappus extruded beyond the tip of the 
involucre [<a href="#24">24</a>]. As rush skeletonweed seeds mature any remaining 
basal rosette  leaves senesce, but flower stalks remain green 
until autumn [<a href="#60">60</a>]. </p>



<p>
Between 10 and 20 days after flowering, rush skeletonweed 
plants begin to shed seed, and  seeds are carried away by the 
wind [<a href="#58">58</a>]. Under greenhouse conditions, developed seeds were 
shed 13 to 15 days after flowering, and rates of seed maturation 
increased under higher temperatures. Small numbers of germinable 
seeds were obtained as early as 3 days following flowering ([<a href="#67">67</a>] 
and references therein). The period of rush skeletonweed seed 
production varies from a few weeks to 24 weeks [<a href="#28">28</a>], but usually 
occurs over a relatively long period. Germination may 
take place immediately if the seed arrives at a spot where soil 
moisture is adequate, but the main germination period begins with 
the onset of the 1st effective autumn rains [<a href="#58">58</a>].  </p>



<p>
The flowering stem begins senescence during early autumn and 
eventually dies completely, breaking off easily when dead. New 
rosettes appear at ground level during stem senescence, thereby 
restarting the annual growth cycle. Seedlings may appear at any 
time from summer to winter, but are most common in autumn and 
early winter [<a href="#19">19</a>]. New rosettes are formed in response to cultivation 
at any time of the year [<a href="#60">60</a>]. The timing of death and regeneration of 
above-ground parts varies in any population of rush skeletonweed, 
causing some overlap of stages at the beginning and end of the 
growing season [<a href="#19">19</a>]. </p>



<p>
Accounts of seasonal development of rush skeletonweed in the northern 
hemisphere are limited, but it appears to follow the same pattern as 
that observed in Australia. Liao [<a href="#54">54</a>] observed the phenology of rush 
skeletonweed at 2 sites in Idaho over 2 years. Most rush skeletonweed 
seeds germinate with fall precipitation, overwinter as rosettes, and bolt 
in spring. Flowering and seed production begin in mid-summer 
and continue as late as October. Rush skeletonweed leaves wither and die during 
flowering. The following table presents recorded phenological events in Idaho [<a href="#54">54</a>]:</p>

Bud formation, anthesis, and seed set at one site occurred earlier that at 
the other site by about 1 week, probably due to elevational lag response (256 
feet (78 m) elevation difference). Plants began budding, flowering, and 
setting seed earlier in the dry year (1994). Precipitation at these 2 sites 
was 8 to 10 inches (200-250 mm) in 1994, and 13 to 17 inches (320-420 mm) in 
1995 (Orchard and Shrub Garden, respectively). Even in the drier year, rush 
skeletonweed produced seed throughout the summer. Rush skeletonweed flowers 
at a time in this region that is between the flowering times of native plants, 
most of which flower in late spring or early summer [<a href="#54">54</a>].</p>

In Canada, rush skeletonweed rosettes die-back in winter and regrow in 
April, initially without latex. Bolting starts in early May, with each 
rosette producing a single upright stem. Preflowering stems have numerous 
green branches and inconspicuous linear leaves, but the rosette and 
stem leaves die as flowering starts. A succession of flowers is formed from 
early August until the stems die in the fall. In Canada, October frost may 
curtail flowering and induce rosette formation [<a href="#40">40</a>]. </p>

FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font> 
Information regarding fire adaptations of rush skeletonweed is not available 
in the literature. Established rush skeletonweed plants have deep, extensive 
perennial root systems and are known to sprout following injury (e.g. cutting, 
grazing, herbicide or insect damage) to rosettes or taproots (see
<a href="botanical_and_ecological_characteristics.html#Asexual regeneration">
Asexual regeneration</a>). Sprouting can occur almost anywhere on the remaining 
root system [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>], reputedly from buds as deep as 3 feet (1 m) [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]. 
This adaptation would allow rush skeletonweed to survive even severe fire, 
depending on site conditions.

<p>
Rush skeletonweed is also capable of establishing from seed. Rush skeletonweed 
seeds are considered short-lived under field conditions and generally survive 
for less than 6 to 18 months [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. The tolerance of rush skeletonweed seeds 
to heating is unknown. Rush skeletonweed seeds can also be dispersed by wind over 
long distances [<a href="#67">67</a>], although it is not known whether rush skeletonweed is more 
or less likely to establish from seed after fire. According to anecdotal evidence 
presented by Asher and others [<a href="#5">5</a>], rush skeletonweed established and spread 
after 2 successive wildfires in Idaho (see
<a href="fire_effects.html#Postfire colonization potential:">Postfire 
colonization potential</a> for more details).</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font> 
Rush skeletonweed occurs primarily in agricultural and rangeland communities 
in the western U.S. and southwestern Canada, where historic fire regimes have 
been dramatically altered due to massive disturbances associated with human 
settlement (e.g. [<a href="#62">62</a>]). Rush skeletonweed is associated with cheatgrass in 
some areas. Cheatgrass expansion has dramatically changed fire regimes and plant 
communities over vast areas of western rangelands by creating an environment 
where fires are easily ignited, spread rapidly, cover large areas, and occur 
frequently [<a href="#105">105</a>]. Short fire return intervals in cheatgrass-dominated communities 
(&lt;10 years [<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>]) may favor rush skeletonweed, with its large root reserves 
and the ability to sprout after injury. More research and field observations are 
needed to understand how rush skeletonweed responds to the current fire ecology 
of these areas.</p>

<p>
The historic fire regimes of  native communities in which rush skeletonweed 
sometimes occurs are of varied frequency and severity. Rush skeletonweed did not 
occur in these communities at the time in which historic fire regimes were functioning, 
but has established since fire exclusion began. It is unclear how historic fire regimes 
might affect rush skeletonweed populations. It is also unclear how the presence of 
rush skeletonweed might affect these fire regimes. In general, in ecosystems where rush 
skeletonweed replaces plants similar to itself (in terms of fuel characteristics), it 
may alter fire intensity or slightly modify an existing fire regime. However, if rush 
skeletonweed is qualitatively unique to the invaded ecosystem, it has the potential to 
completely alter the fire regime [<a href="#25">25</a>]. No examples of fire regimes altered by rush 
skeletonweed invasion are described in the available literature.</p>

<p>
The following table provides fire return intervals for plant communities and 
ecosystems in which rush skeletonweed may be found. If you are interested in 
the fire regime of a plant community that is not listed here, please consult the complete

<br />

Established rush skeletonweed plants are likely to survive even severe 
fire because they have deep, extensive perennial root systems that are 
known to sprout following injury to rosettes or taproots (see
<a href="botanical_and_ecological_characteristics.html#Asexual regeneration">
Asexual regeneration</a>). Sprouting can occur almost anywhere on the surviving 
root system [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>], reputedly from buds as deep as 3 feet (1 m) [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]. </p>

<p>
Rush skeletonweed produces abundant, wind-dispersed seeds under favorable 
site conditions [<a href="#67">67</a>] and may, therefore, establish from seed from offsite 
sources following fire. It is not known whether rush skeletonweed is more 
or less likely to establish from seed in a postfire environment.

FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

<b>Fire as a control agent:</b> 
No information is available regarding the use of fire as a control agent for 
rush skeletonweed. Rush skeletonweed is very difficult to kill due to its 
extensive root system. It is, therefore, unlikely that rush skeletonweed populations 
can be controlled by prescribed fire. Young plants may be susceptible to heat 
kill from hand-held burners, as has been observed with other invasive species 
with similar root systems (e.g. [<a href="#79">79</a>]).</p>

<p>
Although it is unlikely that rush skeletonweed can be controlled with fire, 
using prescribed fire in fire-adapted ecosystems may discourage rush skeletonweed 
by encouraging the growth and vigor of native species. Caution is advised in this 
regard. Season of burning and other management activities (e.g. herbicide treatments, 
livestock and wildlife use) are important factors to consider when prescribing fire 
treatments for natural area restoration where nonnative invasive plants are present [<a href="#52">52</a>]. 
Additionally, land managers should always be cautious when using fire to control 
invasives because it may promote the establishment of other fire-tolerant invasive 
species [<a href="#10">10</a>]. More research is needed in fire adapted areas with rush skeletonweed 
populations.</p>


<p>
<b><a name="Postfire colonization potential:">Postfire colonization potential:</a></b> 
No experimental evidence is available regarding rush skeletonweed's potential to establish 
after fire. Rush skeletonweed produces abundant, wind-dispersed seeds under favorable site 
conditions [<a href="#67">67</a>], and may, therefore establish from seed from offsite sources following fire. 
It is not known whether rush skeletonweed is more or less likely to establish from seed in 
a postfire environment.</p>

<p>
According to anecdotal evidence presented by Asher and others [<a href="#5">5</a>], a 200,000 
acre (81,000 ha) wildfire burned over a BLM wilderness study area in Idaho in 
1992. Rush skeletonweed was not known to occur at this site until a few rush 
skeletonweed plants were found and controlled in 1995. In 1996 another wildfire 
burned the entire area again. A 1997 survey found &quot;serious rush skeletonweed 
infestations widely scattered within a 60,000 acre (24,000 ha) area of the burn [<a href="#5">5</a>]. </p>

<p>
<b>Preventing postfire establishment and spread: </b>
The USDA Forest Service's &quot;Guide to Noxious Weed Prevention Practices&quot; 
[<a href="#93">93</a>] provides several fire management considerations for weed prevention in 
general that apply to rush skeletonweed.</p>



<p>
When planning a prescribed burn, managers should preinventory the project area 
to evaluate the extent, cover, and phenology of any rush skeletonweed or other invasive 
plants present on or adjacent to the site, and avoid ignition and burning in areas at 
high risk for rush skeletonweed establishment or spread due to fire effects. Managers 
should also avoid creating soil conditions that promote rush skeletonweed germination 
and establishment. Areas of soil disturbance (e.g. those brought about by fire suppression 
activities) are especially susceptible to invasive plant establishment. Invasive 
plant status and risks must be discussed in burn rehabilitation plans. Also, wildfire 
managers might consider including weed prevention education and providing weed 
identification aids during fire training; avoiding known weed infestations when 
locating fire lines, monitoring camps, staging areas, helibases, etc., to be sure 
they are kept weed free; taking care that equipment is weed free; incorporating weed 
prevention into fire rehabilitation plans; and acquiring restoration funding. Additional 
guidelines and specific recommendations and requirements are available [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>].</p>



<p>
Preventing invasive plants from establishing in weed-free burned areas is 
the most effective and least costly management method. This can be 
accomplished through early detection and eradication, careful monitoring, 
and by limiting invasive plant seed dispersal into burned areas by 
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>]:</p>

</ul>

<p>
In general, early detection is critical for preventing establishment of large 
populations of invasive plants. Monitoring in spring, summer, and fall is imperative. 
Managers should eradicate established rush skeletonweed plants and small patches 
adjacent to burned areas to prevent or limit seed dispersal into the site [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>].</p>

<p>
The need for revegetation after fire can be assessed on the basis of the degree 
of desirable vegetation displaced by invasive plants prior to burning, and on postfire 
survival of desirable vegetation. Revegetation necessity can also be related to invasive 
plant survival as viable seeds, root crowns, or rhizomes capable of reproduction. In 
general, postfire revegetation should be considered when desirable vegetation cover is 
less than about 30% [<a href="#36">36</a>].</p>

<p>
Goodwin and others [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>] provide guidelines for determining burn severity, 
revegetation necessity, and establishing and managing competitive plants. The 
following paragraphs provide some general guidelines for invasive species management 
after fire. See <a href="https://www.montana.edu/wwwpb/pubs/eb160.html">Integrated 
Noxious Weed Management after Wildfires</a> for a more detailed source of 
this information. More research is needed specific to fire tolerance and response 
of rush skeletonweed to fire in specific sites and ecosystems in which it occurs. </p>

<p>
When prefire cover of rush skeletonweed is absent to low, and prefire cover of desirable 
vegetation is high, revegetation is may not be necessary after low- and medium-severity burns. 
After a high-severity burn on a site in this condition, revegetation may be necessary 
(depending on postfire survival of desirable species), and intensive monitoring for invasive 
plant establishment is critical to detect and eradicate newly established invasives before they spread [<a href="#36">36</a>]. </p>

<p>
When prefire cover of rush skeletonweed is moderate (20-79%) to high (80-100%), 
revegetation may be necessary after fire of any severity, especially if cover of 
desired vegetation is less than about 30%. Intensive weed management is also recommended, 
especially after fires of moderate to high severity [<a href="#36">36</a>].</p>

<p>
Fall dormant broadcast seeding into  ash will cover and retain seeds. If there is 
insufficient ash, seedbed preparation may be necessary. A seed mix should contain 
quick-establishing grasses and forbs (exclude forbs if broadleaf herbicides are anticipated) 
that can effectively occupy available niches. Managers can enhance the 
success of revegetation (natural or artificial) by excluding livestock until 
vegetation is well established (at least 2 growing seasons) [<a href="#36">36</a>].

IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Evidence presented in Australian and Canadian literature indicates that rush 
skeletonweed is consumed during particular growth phases by domestic sheep, 
goats, horses, and cattle, and by some  wildlife species [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]. Rosette 
leaves and stems prior to flowering are more palatable to domestic sheep and other 
domestic animals while domestic goats and wild herbivores will consume the older, more fibrous 
stems as well [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>]. The fibrous flowering stem may cause choking and loss of 
condition when eaten by dairy cattle [<a href="#67">67</a>].

<p>
Plants may be prevented from flowering where animal browsing is constant, and this 
may be one of the reasons for the species' lack of importance as a weed in  Mediterranean 
countries [<a href="#58">58</a>]. Similarly, Harris [<a href="#40">40</a>] notes that small amounts of rush skeletonweed 
in North American rangeland are not serious because rosette leaves are palatable to 
cattle and wildlife. Continuous grazing keeps plants in the rosette stage during the 
summer months when little other green forage is available, and flowering stems form 
quickly if there is any interruption to grazing [<a href="#67">67</a>].</p>

<p>
A review by Panetta and Dodd [<a href="#67">67</a>] describes sheep management programs  developed on 
infested properties in Australia to utilize fodder produced by rush skeletonweed. It 
is claimed that some of the best fat lambs in Australia come from areas heavily infested 
with rush skeletonweed [<a href="#67">67</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Palatability/nutritional value:</b></font> 
Rush skeletonweed is palatable and nutritious in the rosette stage and during flowering until 
the stem becomes lignified (Cuthbertson 1967, as cited by [<a href="#67">67</a>]).</p>

When rainfall is favorable, rush skeletonweed can be a major source of pollen 
and a small surplus of golden honey can be produced from its nectar [<a href="#67">67</a>].

<p>
In Russia, stem-boring insects produce knots of callus and solidified latex 
which have been investigated as a possible source of rubber (Iljin 1930, as

<span class="subframeName">
<a name="IMPACTS AND CONTROL">
IMPACTS AND CONTROL:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Impacts:</b></font> 
Rush skeletonweed apparently has most serious impacts in areas already 
impacted by agriculture, roads, and livestock grazing. In Australia, 
rush skeletonweed primarily infests cropland [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>], while in 
North America, rush skeletonweed is found primarily in California and 
the Pacific Northwest on &quot;abused&quot; rangelands and roadsides, 
although some encroachment of cropland has occurred and may be increasing 
[<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. </p>

<p>
According to a review by Panetta and Dodd [<a href="#67">67</a>], rush skeletonweed is widely 
recognized as the most serious weed of the Australian wheat growing regions. 
The tall, wiry stems of rush skeletonweed interfere with harvesting equipment, 
and the plants reduce yields and cause economic losses through competition for 
moisture, nitrogen, and other nutrients ([<a href="#67">67</a>] and references therein).
Rush skeletonweed was first reported in Australia in 1918, and over the next 42 
years it spread at an average of 15 to 20 miles (24-32 km) per year to cover 
an area of almost a half million square miles (130 million ha) [<a href="#58">58</a>]. Rush 
skeletonweed was so destructive to wheat production that much of the land that 
had historically produced wheat was shifted to pasture. In one area alone the 
amount of land sown to pasture increased from 46,000 acres (19,000 ha) in 1946 to 
150,000 acres (61,000 ha) in 1955 (Tindale 1956, as cited by [<a href="#63">63</a>]).</p>

<p>
Reviews by Sheley and others [<a href="#84">84</a>] and by Liao [<a href="#54">54</a>] suggest that rush skeletonweed 
can form dense monocultures on rangeland, displace native plants, reduce 
forage production (&quot;dramatically&quot;), and &quot;threaten the cattle industry&quot;. Observations 
by Quinney [<a href="#75">75</a>] suggest that rush skeletonweed is one of the most serious of 
the nonnative invasive species in the Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation 
Area. It initially appeared along a road there, and within 7 years was appearing 
around livestock watering sites within the area. Markin [<a href="#55">55</a>] also states that rush 
skeletonweed is a particularly aggressive invader of rangelands and forestlands in 
southern Idaho, particularly those managed as U.S. National Forests.</p>

<p>
Harris suggests that rush skeletonweed could potentially increase on cropland and 
disclimax rangeland within the ecozones in which it occurs in Canada (see
<a href="distribution_and_occurrence.html#HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES">
Habitat types and plant communities</a>) and cause economic loss [<a href="#40">40</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Control:</b></font> 
Rush skeletonweed is difficult to control in some situations. Prevention is 
the most cost-effective and least labor-intensive approach to control nonnative 
invasive species [<a href="#85">85</a>]. Small infestations can be eradicated with diligent efforts 
using physical and/or chemical treatments. Large, dense populations are more 
difficult to control and require a long-term, integrated approach that employs 
various management techniques to reduce frequency and density of rush skeletonweed 
to manageable levels [<a href="#84">84</a>].</p>

<p>
Although agricultural practices are unlikely to be of practical importance for 
controlling invasive species in rangeland and natural areas, some mention of 
them is included in the following discussion as they may add to further understanding 
of rush skeletonweed physiology and sensitivity.</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><font size="4">Prevention:</font> </font>
To prevent establishment and spread of rush skeletonweed, dispersal of seeds 
and root fragments must be prevented, as well as vegetative 
spread from infested sites, such as from road shoulders, into 
uninfested areas [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>]. Seeds are dispersed  by wind, water, 
vehicles, and machinery. A review by Sheley and others [<a href="#84">84</a>] 
suggests avoiding driving vehicles and machinery through 
rush skeletonweed-infested areas during the seeding period, and washing the 
undercarriage of vehicles and machinery before leaving infested areas. Livestock 
should not graze rush skeletonweed-infested areas during seed formation. 
Livestock grazing infested ranges should be transported to a holding area for 10 
to 14 days before moving to uninfested range [<a href="#84">84</a>].</p>

<p>
Sheley and others [<a href="#84">84</a>] also recommend proper livestock grazing as essential to 
maintain competitive grass cover, which will help limit rush skeletonweed 
encroachment. A grazing management plan should be developed for pasture and 
range sites involved in rush skeletonweed prevention programs. Grazing systems 
should include altering season of use and stocking rates, rotating livestock 
to allow plants to recover before being regrazed, and promoting plant litter 
accumulation [<a href="#84">84</a>].</p>

<p>
An integral part of any weed prevention program is to contain infestations 
neighboring uninfested areas, and to contain rush skeletonweed along highways, 
railways, and waterways [<a href="#84">84</a>]. In Adams County, Washington, a policy was adopted 
that all rush skeletonweed infestations west of a line that demarcated densely infested 
rangeland from the remainder of the county were to be controlled using chemical 
and biological controls. Buffer strips, 300 feet (90 m) in width, were established 
where large infestations bordered cultivated land. Complete control was maintained 
along rights-of-way. The purpose of the boundary line and buffer zones was to place 
a containment line around the worst infestations and slowly shrink those areas over 
the next several years [<a href="#83">83</a>]. No results or follow-up publications are available.</p>

<p>
Monitoring, detecting new infestations, and implementing eradication programs 
are important parts of preventing spread of rush skeletonweed. Detect weed 
infestations early with systematic surveys along weed dispersal corridors. Once 
an infestation is found, an eradication plan should be designed and implemented, 
including an outline of the infestation boundaries, control treatments, 
control schedule, revegetation plans, follow-up monitoring, and costs [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT" size="4">Integrated management:</font> 
A review by Sheley and others [<a href="#84">84</a>] suggests that no single treatment provides 
long-term control of rush skeletonweed, so an integrated strategy must be adopted. 
The first line of defense is to prevent introductions of rush skeletonweed with 
systematic surveys, early detection, and implementation of an eradication program 
on small infestations. Once rush skeletonweed becomes established, integrating various 
combinations of competitive plantings, crop-pasture rotations, domestic sheep grazing, 
biological control agents, and herbicides may reduce rush skeletonweed to manageable 
levels [<a href="#84">84</a>].</p>

<p>
Examples of integrated control strategies are given within the following 
sections where applicable and available.</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><font size="4">Physical/mechanical:</font></font> 
Physical and mechanical control methods used for rush skeletonweed control 
include hand-pulling or digging, cutting or mowing, and plowing or cultivation. </p> 

<p>
According to Sheley and others [<a href="#84">84</a>], hand-pulling can provide effective control 
for very small rush skeletonweed infestations. Successful hand-pulling requires 
removal of plant growth 2 or 3 times per year for 6 to 10 years because new 
plants will emerge from severed roots and possibly from buried seeds. Removing 
rush skeletonweed plants is easier when the soil is wet. Pulled plants should be 
destroyed by burning in a very hot fire to ensure seed and root destruction [<a href="#84">84</a>].</p>

<p>
Mowing rush skeletonweed infestations regularly may reduce aerial biomass, 
root biomass, root carbohydrate, and seed crop. McLellan [<a href="#57">57</a>] found that 
rush skeletonweed root biomass and regenerative capacity decreased with 
increased mowing frequency as did basal rosette production. Shoot regenerative 
capacity decreased with increased mowing frequency in the 1st year of study, 
but not in the 2nd. Mowing may reduce rush skeletonweed ability to spread vegetatively. 
There was a general reduction in seed production although seed viability was 
not affected [<a href="#57">57</a>].  </p>

<p>
Cutting plants close to the surface produces large multiple-stemmed 
plants without much increase in rosette numbers. Severing the roots at 
greater depth without soil mixing leads to some increase in rosette numbers 
through the appearance of fresh growth from lateral roots as well as from 
the taproot [<a href="#58">58</a>].</p>

<p>
Rush skeletonweed response to cultivation depends upon frequency of 
cultivation, management of fields during the fallow phase, and age 
of rush skeletonweed plants [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>]. Cultivation in the wheat-fallow 
system of cereal farming in Australia initially favored rush skeletonweed 
survival and spread. In this system cultivation is frequent enough to 
increase rush skeletonweed density due to the plant's ability to 
regenerate from severed root pieces (see <a href="botanical_and_ecological_characteristics.html#Asexual regeneration">Asexual regeneration</a>), 
but not frequent enough to decrease their survival [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]. Surviving 
rush skeletonweed plants thrived because they had little competition in 
the fallow phase. Population growth rates tend to increase with the 
frequency of cultivation until the interval between successive cultivations 
is reduced to approximately 8 weeks, when plant survival is adversely 
affected [<a href="#19">19</a>]. Daughter rosettes are easier to kill since they have 
smaller carbohydrate reserves than those arising from taproots. Decreases 
in rosette densities are greatest following cultivation in dry soil, 
as root fragments are highly prone to desiccation [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]. </p>

<p>
Rush skeletonweed seedlings may be more easily controlled by pulling or 
cultivation than older plants ([<a href="#62">62</a>] and references therein). However, 
rush skeletonweed seedlings may form shoot buds from root fragments as 
young as 2 weeks old, and 95% to 100% of 5- to 7- week-old seedlings 
can regenerate from root fragments [<a href="#23">23</a>].</p>

<p>
Weeding (e.g. hoeing or pulling of other plants) around established 
rush skeletonweed plants may result in a crop of satellite rosettes 
if lateral roots close to the surface become severed. Rosettes develop 
at the severed end of detached root [<a href="#58">58</a>].</p>

Biological control of invasive species has a long history, and there 
are many important considerations to be made before the implementation
of a biological control program. The reader is referred to other 
sources [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>] and the <a href="https://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/handbook.html">
Weed Control Methods Handbook</a> [<a href="#91">91</a>]for background information on 
biological control. Additionally,
<a href="https://www.nysaes.cornell.edu/ent/biocontrol/">Cornell University</a>,
<a href="https://bc4weeds.tamu.edu/index.html">Texas A &amp; M University</a>, and
<a href="https://ceris.purdue.edu/napis/index.html">NAPIS</a> websites offer 
information on biological control.</p>

<p>
Several organisms including insects, viral particles, and fungi, 
have been intensively studied as potential biological control 
agents for rush skeletonweed, and an abundance of literature is 
available on the effects of introduced agents on rush skeletonweed 
in Australia (e.g. [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>]) and North America 
(e.g. [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>]). The following information on biological 
control of rush skeletonweed is based primarily on literature 
reviews, as a thorough treatment of this literature is beyond the 
scope of this review. </p>

<p>
The effectiveness of biological control agents on rush skeletonweed 
is limited primarily by the genetic variability of rush skeletonweed 
populations [<a href="#16">16</a>], and also by the level of interspecific and 
intraspecific competition between plants in the particular situations 
where they occur [<a href="#99">99</a>], including the effects of other control treatments 
(e.g. [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>]).</p>

<p>
The first effective biological control program for rush skeletonweed, 
involving several control agents, was established in Australia in 
the 1960s. These agents include the gall mite (<i>Eriophyes chondrillae</i>), 
the gall midge (<i>Cystiphora schmidti</i>), and the rust fungus 
(<i>Puccinia chondrillina</i>); the latter being the most effective [<a href="#38">38</a>]. 
Effectiveness of the rust fungus is, however, limited by the genetic variability 
of rush skeletonweed populations in Australia [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Successful control of the 
most widespread type was achieved by the 1971 release of the rust; however, the 
reduction in populations of that genotype resulted in the spread of the rust-resistant types, previously suppressed by 
the competitive dominance of the rust-susceptible type [<a href="#38">38</a>]. </p>

<p>
Subsequently, these 3 biological control agents have been released for 
control of rush skeletonweed in North America, as follows [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>].</p>

<p>
Despite reports of impacts on rush skeletonweed by biological control agents 
(e.g. [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>]), Prather [<a href="#73">73</a>] reports that rush skeletonweed continues 
to dominate large areas in the Pacific Northwest. </p>

<p>
The success of biological control agents is linked to climatic differences 
between their place of origin and place of introduction [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>], to different 
rush skeletonweed biotypes [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>], and to native parasites and predators that 
attack introduced biological control agents [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].  </p>

<p>
Martin [<a href="#56">56</a>] provides observations of phenological development of rush skeletonweed 
in southern British Columbia and notes that no overwintering rosettes were found. 
Rosettes are particularly important as the overwintering locus for both the gall 
mite and the rust [<a href="#56">56</a>]. Markin [<a href="#55">55</a>] reports that while biological control agents have 
given acceptable control in California, they are less effective in the Pacific 
Northwest. He suggests that these agents are not adapted to the climatic conditions 
in the Pacific Northwest. Efforts are being made to find new biological control agents 
from Eurasia, in the Republic of Georgia. Two agromyzid flies, some leaf-feeding 
caterpillars, and a small moth, <i>Bradyrrhoa gilveolella</i>, have shown some potential 
and are the subject of further study [<a href="#55">55</a>]. </p>

<p>
Emge and others [<a href="#30">30</a>] report differential reactions to infection by the rust in 
populations from California, Oregon, Washington and Idaho. It is evident that 3 
distinct types of rush skeletonweed occur in North America, and that these  types are different from those found in Australia [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>], contrary to 
information presented by Sheley and others [<a href="#84">84</a>]. Isozyme screening 
is being employed as an attempt to match rust strains from Europe with rush 
skeletonweed type [<a href="#31">31</a>]. </p>

<p>
Integrating the use of biological control agents with plant competition 
[<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>], herbicides [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>], mowing [<a href="#57">57</a>], or other appropriate suppressive 
measures, may affect control of rush skeletonweed. For example, combined stresses 
from plant competition (from intermediate wheatgrass (<i>Thinopyrum</i> <i>
intermedium</i>) and small burnet (<i>Sanguisorba</i> <i>minor</i> ssp. <i>
muricata</i>)) and herbivory by gall mites reduced biomass of rush skeletonweed 
more than either stress separately. Rush skeletonweed may dominate the sparsely 
vegetated rangeland communities because they do not offer sufficient 
competition to restrict resources. These conditions may allow rush skeletonweed 
to overcome the growth restrictions imposed by  gall mites by floral stem initiation 
from adventitious buds. If rush skeletonweed has abundant resources available, 
those new buds may grow more quickly than the gall mites can colonize them. Under 
these conditions, gall mites alone will not control rush skeletonweed [<a href="#73">73</a>].  </p>

<p>
Cheney [<a href="#17">17</a>] found that rush skeletonweed is most effectively reduced by utilizing 
either herbicides (picloram, dicamba, 2,4-D) or the rust organisms, exclusive of 
one another. </p>

<p>
Mowing rush skeletonweed plants infested with biological control insects had no 
synergistic effects, but could have  additive effects on rush skeletonweed spread. 
Both types of control reduced rush skeletonweed's ability to spread [<a href="#57">57</a>].</p>

<p>
Grazing by domestic sheep can reduce or prevent seed production in rush skeletonweed. 
The lowest densities of rush skeletonweed were obtained under continuous, as compared 
with rotational, grazing. Increasing the stocking rate from 5 to 15 sheep/ha had no 
effect upon final weed numbers ([<a href="#67">67</a>] and references therein). Moderate grazing 
is as effective as heavy grazing in controlling rush skeletonweed because heavy grazing 
decreases the competitive ability of desired plant species [<a href="#84">84</a>]. In the northwestern 
U.S. some ranchers found that while heavy, dense populations of rush skeletonweed required 
intensive control efforts, scattered rush skeletonweed plants across well-managed pastures 
posed no serious decrease in livestock carrying capacity and even supplied a late 
season forage [<a href="#61">61</a>].</p>

<font face="Bell MT" size="4">Chemical:</font>  
Herbicides are effective in gaining initial control of a new or severe infestation 
of invasive plants, but are rarely a complete or long-term solution to invasive species 
management [<a href="#14">14</a>]. Herbicides are more effective on large infestations when incorporated 
into long-term management plans that include replacement of weeds with desirable species, 
careful land use management, and prevention of new infestations. Control with herbicides 
is temporary, as it does not change conditions that allow infestations to occur [<a href="#107">107</a>].
See the <a href="https://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/handbook.html">Weed Control Methods
Handbook</a> for considerations on the use of herbicides in natural areas and
detailed information on specific chemicals. </p>

<p>
Once established, rush skeletonweed is extremely difficult to control using herbicides, 
primarily due to the difficulty of translocating herbicides into  its extensive root 
system [<a href="#58">58</a>]. Degree of translocation of herbicides depends on environmental conditions, 
type of herbicide used, and physiological status of the plant ([<a href="#67">67</a>] and references therein). 
Since 1944, trials have been conducted on rush skeletonweed with practically every new 
herbicide to come on the market. In general, any chemical that eliminated rush skeletonweed 
also killed all other vegetation and &quot;sterilized&quot; soil [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>]. Successful 
chemical control of rush skeletonweed usually requires an aggressive re-application program [<a href="#84">84</a>]. </p>

<p>
Applications of 2,4-D at the first signs of bolting inhibits inflorescence development 
but has no long-term effects on plant densities  [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. Repeated applications of 2,4-D 
may reduce rush skeletonweed densities, as would repeated mechanical removal of the rosette. 
Control in this manner may benefit crop production, but would need to be repeated frequently 
to have a long-term effect on rush skeletonweed populations [<a href="#37">37</a>].</p>

<p>
Heap [<a href="#42">42</a>] found that rush skeletonweed can be controlled in Australia with some herbicides, 
and successive yearly applications are more effective than single treatments. 
Clopyralid alone and in mixtures with 2,4-D-amine, dicamba, or MCPA-amine, were 
the most effective treatments. Metsulfuron and 2,4-D-amine also were effective 
if applied at high rates for several years. The broadleaf type (C) appears to be 
less susceptible to clopyralid than other types [<a href="#42">42</a>].</p>

<p>
Of several herbicides tested for rush skeletonweed control in Washington in 1964, only 
picloram and dicamba were &quot;acceptably effective.&quot; These herbicides provided 
most consistent results when applied in fall. Due to limited rainfall in this region, 
picloram movement and dilution through the soil profile to a non-lethal level requires 
several years. Therefore production of a broadleaf crop is not likely feasible for at 
least 3 years after treatment [<a href="#82">82</a>]. Picloram may be considered &quot;ecologically 
undesirable&quot; unless restricted to spot control [<a href="#40">40</a>], and is said to be incompatible 
with legumes [<a href="#67">67</a>]. Picloram remains active in the soil for up to 3 years under some 
conditions, and it can be highly mobile in the soil profile [<a href="#91">91</a>]. Picloram is often used 
to eradicate rush skeletonweed on road shoulders [<a href="#62">62</a>].</p>

<p>
<font face="Bell MT"><font size="4">Cultural:</font> </font>
Seedlings of rush skeletonweed are poor competitors with most crop species. In greenhouse 
trials, when crop plants (e.g. oats (<i>Avena sativa</i>) and alfalfa) emerge 
first, rush 
skeletonweed does not survive [<a href="#82">82</a>]. Subterranean clover can be an effective competitor 
 with established rush skeletonweed, reducing  rush skeletonweed rosette density by 
60% within 2 years under field conditions on the central slopes of New South Wales 
([<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>] and references therein).</p>

<p>
Dense growth of cool season annuals shades rosettes of  rush skeletonweed to the 
extent that both densities and dry weights of rush skeletonweed are reduced considerably. 
A deep-rooted, perennial legume would have the added advantage of competition for soil 
moisture  over the summer months  [<a href="#67">67</a>].</p>

<p>
Results presented by Prather [<a href="#73">73</a>] suggest that plant competition alone will not control 
rush skeletonweed, and that integration of plant competition with other 
management strategies (herbicide or biocontrol) is more tenable. Competitive 
effects of intermediate wheatgrass and small burnet increased with herbivory by 
gall mites [<a href="#73">73</a>].
