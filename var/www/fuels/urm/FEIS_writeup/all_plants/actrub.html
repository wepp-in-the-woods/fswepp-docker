<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of red baneberry is Actaea rubra
(Aiton) Willd. [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].  In the past there has been
disagreement over how the closely related members of this genus should
be recognized.  Within the species, two subspecies, ssp. arguta and ssp.
rubra, are sometimes defined [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Many authors do not consider
subspecies designation necessary [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].  Subspecies will not be
considered separately here.

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Actaea rubra
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Red baneberry is found in moist woods in the Northern Temperate Zone of
North America and Eurasia [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  Its range in western North America
extends from Alaska south through the Coast Ranges and the Sierra Nevada
in California through the Rocky Mountains to Arizona and New Mexico.  It
is distributed transcontinentally across northern North America from the
West Coast to New England and Labrador.  In the East and Midwest, it
reaches its southern limits in New Jersey, Indiana, Iowa, and Kansas
[<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Presence of red baneberry frequently indicates moist sites [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>].  In
British Columbia's subboreal spruce (Picea glauca x engelmannii) zone,
its presence may differentiate seral stages of the spruce/devil's club
(Oplopanax horridus) ecosystem from other seral, mesic spruce ecosystems
[<a href="#33">33</a>].  Publications listing red baneberry as an indicator or dominant
part of vegetation in community types (cts), habitat types (hts), plant
associations (pas), forest ecosystem associations (eas), or riparian
site types (rst) are listed below:

Coniferous forest habitat types of northern Utah [<a href="#51">51</a>].
Forest habitat types of eastern Idaho-western Wyoming [<a href="#70">70</a>].
Forest habitat types of Montana [<a href="#60">60</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Actaea rubra
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>



<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Red baneberry's overall importance to livestock and wildlife is low,
since it is not normally abundant.  In Montana, elk utilize red
baneberry foliage in the fall because it remains green after early
frosts.  Elk use in summer is more limited [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].  In Utah mule deer
use of red baneberry was moderate; it was eaten most frequently in the
fall [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  White-tailed deer consume a moderate amount of red
baneberry.  Its value to pronghorn is poor [<a href="#35">35</a>].

Livestock use of red baneberry is low [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].  There are reports of
horses eating it in Montana and sheep eating it in Idaho.  However, it
is not normally grazed unless other forage is scarce [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Red baneberry fruit is consumed by several bird species including the
yellow-bellied sapsucker, American robin, wood thrush, gray-cheeked
thrush, brown thrasher, gray catbird, and grouse [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>].  Some small
mammals also eat the berries including deer mice, white-footed mice, red
squirrel, eastern chipmunks, and redbacked voles [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>].  Several
species of birds that use baneberry eat the fruit but void the seeds,
while some of the small mammals remove and eat the seeds leaving the the
pulp [<a href="#81">81</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability to elk in Montana and to mule deer in Utah is highest in
the fall [<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].  Red baneberry has low palatability to domestic sheep
and cattle [<a href="#71">71</a>].  The relish and degree of use shown by livestock and
wildlife species for red baneberry in two western states is rated as
follows [<a href="#21">21</a>]:
                        CO         UT
      
Cattle                 poor       poor     
Sheep                  poor       fair     
Horses                 poor       poor     
Pronghorn              ----       poor     
Elk                    ----       fair     
Mule deer              ----       fair     
Small mammals          ----       fair     
Small nongame birds    ----       good     
Upland game birds      ----       fair     
Waterfowl              ----       poor     


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Red baneberry's energy and protein value are rated as poor [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Red
baneberry's name comes from a poisonous essential oil or glycoside
(protoanemonin) found in all parts of the plant but most concentrated in
the berries and root [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].  Symptoms of poisoning include
gastroenteritis, stomach cramps, headache, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhea
and circulatory failure [<a href="#72">72</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Red baneberry provides fair cover for small nongame birds and mammals in
Utah but poor cover for upland game birds and big game mammals [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
In some western states red baneberry is listed as having low to moderate
value for erosion control and revegetation potential, with moderate
biomass production [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Growth is listed as good on gentle slopes and
fair on moderate and steep slopes [<a href="#21">21</a>].  The plant is easily grown from
seed [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Stratification and a very moist seeding mixture are
necessary for germination [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].  The rootstock or caudex is easy to
transplant in the fall or spring when the plant is dormant [<a href="#87">87</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Red baneberry has attractive foliage and brilliantly beautiful berries.
The berries are unpalatable and can cause illness to people eating them
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  With due caution for its poisonous attributes, red baneberry is
easily grown in woodland gardens and very attractive when interspersed
with ferns [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].

Native Americans in Alberta and British Columbia used a weak decoction
made from the roots as a stimulant in treating colds, arthritis,
syphilis, rheumatism, and emaciation.  They also chewed leaves and put
them on boils and wounds to stimulate blood flow into the area [<a href="#88">88</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Red baneberry does not appear to compete seriously with young conifers
[<a href="#62">62</a>].  Following various logging treatments in northwestern Montana, red
baneberry's presence decreased, but it maintained or very slightly
increased its cover [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  The limited information on the effects of
various treatments seems to indicate that mechanical site preparation
may uproot plants and decrease the cover of red baneberry [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Actaea rubra
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Red baneberry is a deciduous, perennial herb, usually from 1 to 3 feet
(4-10 dm) tall with one to several branched stems [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  Perennating
tissue appears to be a vertical caudex just under the soil surface
[Stickney, P., pers. comm. 1990] but has also been described as a
rootstock [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>] or a rhizome [<a href="#72">72</a>].  The leaves are alternate, two to
three times compound, sharply toothed and lobed.

The flowers have small white petals, showy stamens, and a roselike
fragrance [<a href="#59">59</a>].  Flowers are borne in a terminal or axillary raceme and
pollinated by a variety of insects [<a href="#59">59</a>].  These flowers can be
self-fertile, although they are not capable of apomixis [<a href="#59">59</a>].  In
Michigan the most common pollinator is an introduced beetle (Phyllobius
oblongus), which uses the inflorescences as mating sites and does not
ingest the pollen.  Fruit set is normally close to 100 percent [<a href="#59">59</a>].
The fruits are showy, poisonous, red or occasionally white berries
[<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  Each berry contains 9 to 16 red-brown, sector-shaped seeds 0.1
to 1.5 inches (3-4 mm) long [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
The seed of red baneberry requires a dormant period and usually takes 2
years to germinate [<a href="#86">86</a>].  During a laboratory study of seed collected in
the fall, germination began 243 days following sowing.  Only 8.8 percent
of the seeds germinated; survival was 50 percent in the sun and 64.3
percent in the shade [<a href="#61">61</a>].  Seedling growth was good in both sun and
shade.  While survival was better in the shade, seedlings in the sun
were slightly larger and had more biomass allocated to roots [<a href="#61">61</a>].
Seedlings begin to bloom in their third year [<a href="#86">86</a>].

The fruit appears to be adapted to bird dispersal, although in the only
recent study of fruit use, insect and small mammal predation of seeds
was higher than use of the pulp by birds.  Fruit color did not seem to
be related to the amount of insect predation, fruit weight, number of
fruits per stem, or seeds per fruit; however, nocturnal use of white
fruit was higher [<a href="#81">81</a>].  Chipmunks may bury the seed [<a href="#87">87</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Red baneberry grows best on cool, moist, nutrient-rich sites
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  Along the West Coast, these sites are moister and
richer than mesic and mesotrophic [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>].  In the dense forest areas of
southeastern Alaska red baneberry grows on open streambanks and in
meadows [<a href="#74">74</a>].  In British Columbia it grows under spruce, spruce and
black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), or spruce, subalpine fir, and
aspen (Populus tremuloides) forests with black twinberry (Lonicera
involucrata), thimbleberry (Rubus parviflorus), bluejoint reedgrass
(Calamagrostis canadensis), and horsetails (Equisetum spp.) [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  On
the west slope of the Rocky Mountains in Washington, it grows with
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)
in river canyons extending out into the grasslands [<a href="#78">78</a>].  In Oregon it
is identified as an indicator of moist sites with cold soil temperatures
[<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  In the South Umpqua River Basin of southwestern Oregon, it is
found only on such sites [<a href="#52">52</a>].  In Oregon it may also be found in
seepage, marshy, and other moist areas with red alder (Alnus rubra),
bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), vine maple (A. circinatum), and
sedges (Carex spp.) [<a href="#4">4</a>].  In the Siskiyou Mountains of Oregon and
California, it occurs at middle elevations, from 3,950 to 5,950 feet
(1,200-1,800 m) on diorite soils under relatively open stands dominated
by Douglas-fir and white fir (Abies concolor) [<a href="#80">80</a>].  It also extends to
high-elevation sites dominated by red fir (A. magnifica) [<a href="#6">6</a>].  It is
tolerant of low light intensity in the coastal redwood (Sequoia
sempervirens) region [<a href="#77">77</a>].

In the northern Rocky Mountains it is an understory species in moist and
very moist subalpine forests and riparian areas [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>].
It appears to grow equally well on north and south exposures [<a href="#55">55</a>].  In
the Rocky Mountain subalpine fir forests of eastern Washington and Idaho
it is only found with the moist-site shrubs and herbs that Daubenmire
and Daubenmire [<a href="#19">19</a>] called the "Pachistima union" [<a href="#28">28</a>].  In Alberta it
grows under climax white spruce (Picea glauca) in valleys and lower
slopes [<a href="#53">53</a>].  Red baneberry is a dominant herb in very moist aspen
stands in the Black Hills [<a href="#66">66</a>].  In Utah it can be found in mountain
brush, willow-birch (Betula spp.), aspen, Douglas-fir, limber pine
(Pinus flexilis), subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce (Picea
engelmannii) communities [<a href="#79">79</a>].  In the southern Rocky Mountains of New
Mexico, red baneberry grows in corkbark fir (A. lasiocarpa var
arizonica) and Engelmann spruce forests with Senecio sanguisorboides,
twinberry, wolf currant (Ribes wolfii), and gooseberry currant (R.
montigenum) [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Other plants frequently associated with it in the
Rocky Mountains include pachistima (Pachistima myrsinites), baldhip rose
(Rosa gymnocarpa), woods rose (R. woodsii), narrowleaf cottonwood
(Populus angustifolia), aspen, blue spruce (Picea pungens), grand fir
(Abies grandis), blue huckleberry (Vaccinium globulare), thinleaf alder
(Alnus incana ssp. tenuifolia), willows (Salix spp.), redosier dogwood
(Cornus sericea), black twinberry, Drummond willow (Salix drummondiana),
sweetscented bedstraw (Galium triflorum), western meadowrue (Thalictrum
occidentale), starry solomon plume (Smilacina stellata), and mountain
bluebells (Mertensia ciliata).

In Minnesota baneberry (Actaea spp.) grows on a wide range of sites but
prefers partial to full shade and moderately moist, nutrient-rich soils
[<a href="#9">9</a>].  Red baneberry is not one of the most important herbs, but it is
scattered throughout red and white pine (Pinus resinosa and P. strobus)
forests and forests dominated by sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and other
hardwoods from Minnesota to New England [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].  In Wisconsin
where its range overlaps that of white baneberry (Actaea pachypoda), red
baneberry's presence is highest in boreal forest, while white baneberry
is more common in mesic, northern Wisconsin, mixed-hardwood forests
[<a href="#15">15</a>].  In the Saint Lawrence Valley it is normally restricted to climax
or near climax forest [<a href="#16">16</a>].  In northeastern Saskatchewan it is found
near lake and stream margins with willows, sedges, and reedgrass
(Calamagrostis spp.) [<a href="#5">5</a>].

In Colorado and Utah red baneberry's growth is fair to good on sandy
loam, loam and clay loam soils and poor to fair on gravel, sand, clay,
and dense clay [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Its growth is best on organic and acidic soils
that are at least 20 inches (51 cm) deep and poor on saline or sodic
soils [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Elevational ranges in some western regions are [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>]:

                     Minimum                   Maximum

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Throughout its range, red baneberry is found in both early seral and
mature forests [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>].  Results of a study in
southwestern Oregon indicated that red baneberry cover was similar at
light levels ranging from full sunlight to less than 3.5 percent of full
sunlight [<a href="#23">23</a>].  In northern Idaho the amount of tree cover does not
appear to affect the frequency of red baneberry [<a href="#55">55</a>].  Red baneberry
plants generally are scattered so that changes in population size over
time are difficult to measure.  Results of a north-central Idaho study
in a grand fir/pachistima habitat type indicated that red baneberry had
higher cover values in early succession, although it was still present
in near-climax stands [<a href="#85">85</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
In Minnesota forests, the leaves and flowers of red baneberry appear in
the first 3 weeks of the growing season, and the leaves begin to wither
and die by midsummer [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Across its range, red baneberry blooms from
May to July and fruits from August to October [<a href="#27">27</a>].  In Michigan,
flowering began between the May 20 and 30 and lasted 10 to 20 days.
Where red baneberry grows with white baneberry (A. pachypoda), it always
begins blooming 3 to 5 days earlier [<a href="#59">59</a>].  In New England flowering is
from May 9 to June 10 [<a href="#67">67</a>].  In northern Idaho flowering is from May to
July [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>].  In Utah and North Dakota flowering begins in May and ends
by late June or early July, while in Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming,
bloom begins in June and ends in August [<a href="#21">21</a>].

appears to survive many fires, although information on the effects of
differing fire severities is lacking.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
During a study of early postfire recovery using the same plots over
time, red baneberry sprouted, grew vigorously, and produced fruit the
first year after fire.  However, no seedlings were observed during the
next 5 years [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Permanent plots were used to follow recovery
after the Sundance fire in northern Idaho [<a href="#73">73</a>]; here seedlings of red
baneberry were found in the fifteenth postfire growing season [Peter
Stickney, pers. comm. 1990].  In British Columbia's subboreal spruce
zone, cover of red baneberry increased in first year plots following
either fire or mechanical site preparation [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Following clearcutting
and burning in north-central Idaho, red baneberry had higher cover
values in first and third year plots [<a href="#85">85</a>].  A northern Idaho study found
little difference between red baneberry cover on undisturbed sites,
piled and burned sites, and sites with single or multiple broadcast
burns [<a href="#56">56</a>].
