Rough fescue is a circumboreal species [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].
In North America, it is widely distributed from Alaska southward to Oregon
and Colorado [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>]. Rough fescue is a major prairie type of the northern
Great Plains of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and North Dakota. It has a scattered distribution
in the East, where it is most common in Michigan and the northeastern provinces
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>].

Rough fescue is a dominant understory species in a number of
nonforested and forested communities throughout its range. On grassland
sites it often occurs as the climax dominant and has been used
as a series indicator. Commonly described grassland types include rough
fescue-Idaho fescue <i>(F. altaica-F. idahoensis)</i> and rough fescue-bluebunch
wheatgrass (<i>Pseudoroegneria spicata)</i>. Shrubland series where rough
fescue is named as an understory indicator include big sagebrush <i>(Artemisia
tridentata)</i>, bitterbrush <i>(Purshia tridentata)</i>, and shrubby cinquefoil
(<i>Dasiphora floribunda</i>). Habitat
types where rough fescue dominates the understory have been
identified within limber pine <i>(Pinus flexilis)</i>, ponderosa pine <i>(Pinus
ponderosa)</i>, and Douglas-fir <i>(Pseudotsuga menziesii)</i>  series
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].<p>Common associates of rough fescue in prairie communities include timber
oatgrass (<i>Danthonia intermedia),</i> Idaho fescue (<i>Festuca idahoensis),</i>
prairie junegrass (<i>Koeleria macrantha</i>), bluegrass (<i>Poa</i> spp.),
lupine (<i>Lupinus</i> spp.), and shrubby cinquefoil
[<a href="#19">19</a>]. Plains rough fescue commonly occurs with blue grama (<i>Bouteloua
gracilis)</i> [<a href="#74">74</a>]. On the steppes of Washington, rough fescue is often associated with
Idaho fescue/sulphur flower <i>(Eriogonum heracleoides)</i>
and Idaho fescue/common snowberry <i>(Symphoricarpos albus)</i> habitat
types [<a href="#27">27</a>]. In central Alberta and Manitoba, rough fescue commonly
grows in association with porcupine grass (<i>Stipa spartea</i> var. <i>curtiseta),</i>
western snowberry <i>(Symphoricarpos occidentalis)</i>, prairie junegrass,
timber oatgrass, and quaking aspen (<i>Populus tremuloides</i>) [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].</p>

<p>  Northern rough 
fescue grows in tundra meadows in Alaska with downy ryegrass (<i>Elymus 
innovatus)</i> and bluegrass (<i>Poa</i> spp.) [<a href="#113">113</a>].  In 
Alaskan taiga communities, northern rough fescue grows on windy foothill sites with bluejoint 
(<i>Calamagrostis canadensis</i>) [<a href="#114">114</a>].  It also grows in
boreal lodgepole pine forests [<a href="#87">87</a>].</p>

<p>Plains rough fescue originally occupied quaking aspen parklands and benches along the Rocky Mountain 
foothills [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>].  It also grew in parts of the northern 
Great Plains [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Grazing and 
agriculture have largely eliminated plains rough fescue from 
many of the highly productive, low- elevation sites it once occupied 
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>].  Griltz and Romo [<a href="#45">45</a>] estimate that less than 5% of 
prairie once dominated by this subspecies remains, primarily as 
small, isolated remnants.  Plains rough fescue overlaps with 
mountain rough fescue in parts of the Rocky Mountains [<a href="#87">87</a>].</p>

<p>Mountain rough fescue is a dominant component of several grassland 
associations of southern Alberta and British Columbia 
[<a href="#1">1</a>].  It also occurs in open ponderosa pine forests, in forests within the subalpine zone, and 
in grassy balds within forested areas [<a href="#87">87</a>].</p>

follows:</p>

Rough fescue is important livestock forage throughout 
its range.  Plants are 
very productive and highly palatable to 
livestock and wildlife.  Many grasslands in southern Canada 
are dominated by this species, and all 
3 subspecies are important native forage grasses in 
Canada [<a href="#1">1</a>].

<p>Plants are used throughout the growing season by 
a number of big game species including bighorn sheep, mule deer, 
elk, and bison.  Rough fescue is the primary food for bison 
herds wintering in the quaking aspen 
parklands of southern Canada [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>], and bison also utilize rough fescue heavily
in fall.  Summer bison use of rough fescue is described as "moderate" in
Alberta [<a href="#61">61</a>].</p>

<p>Rough fescue is heavily use by elk on winter ranges in Montana. It is 1of the preferred winter
range grasses in west-central Montana 
[<a href="#33">33</a>].  Jourdonnais and 
Bedunah [<a href="#63">63</a>] report that it is the most preferred forage for wintering elk on the Sun River Game Range of Montana.
Elk consumption of rough fescue may also be 
fairly heavy in both spring and fall (20 and 27% "aggregated 
frequency") [<a href="#97">97</a>].   In northern Idaho, elk feed on rough fescue in 
mid-summer and fall, with higher use noted in late summer 
[<a href="#68">68</a>]. Rough 
fescue is also important late fall elk food in subalpine grasslands of
British Columbia [<a href="#89">89</a>].  In Alberta, elk and cattle favor mountain rough 
fescue grasslands as feeding 
areas [<a href="#11">11</a>], and mountain rough fescue grasslands are important winter rangelands 
[<a href="#121">121</a>]. Seasonal elk use of rough fescue was as follows in west-central Alberta [<a href="#84">84</a>]:</p>

<p>Winter use of rough fescue by 
Rocky Mountain mule deer in the United States and in Alberta 
is described as "light" [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>].  In Montana, white-tailed 
deer use rough fescue during winter
in trace amounts [<a href="#97">97</a>] and in northern Idaho 
it is used in early summer [<a href="#68">68</a>].  Bighorn sheep make at least 
"moderate" use of rough fescue on winter ranges of Alberta.  During July, rough fescue was the largest component of bighorn sheep diets [<a href="#101">101</a>].
Winter-ranging mountain goats 
feed on rough fescue on lower slopes,
ridges, high ridges, and rock outcrops [<a href="#51">51</a>].  Snowshoe 
hares feed on rough fescue in summer 
[<a href="#55">55</a>].</p>

<p class="subframeContent">
<span class="subframeName">
<a name="PALATABILITY">
PALATABILITY:</a>
</span>
<br />

Rough fescue is highly palatable forage. It is prime winter forage: plants cure well on the stalk and retain high 
nutrient levels during dormancy [<a href="#111">111</a>]. A number of wild ungulate species including bighorn sheep, mule deer, elk, and
bison use rough fescue throughout the growing season by. Horses and cattle on summer
ranges prefer the leaves and 
stalks. Removal of litter buildup through the 
use of fire or grazing generally increases 
winter palatability [<a href="#64">64</a>].  Elk avoid plants with large amounts
of old litter [<a href="#63">63</a>].

<p>Palatability of rough fescue is rated

The nutritional quality of rough fescue is moderately high.  This 
grass is considered excellent winter
forage because it retains nutrients during 
dormancy [<a href="#111">111</a>].

<p>In-vitro digestibility studies indicate that rough fescue ranks 
slightly above average in relative nutritive value among 
associated species on a rough fescue-dominated grassland 
in southwestern Alberta [<a href="#17">17</a>]. Rough fescue makes good-quality hay in southern Canada [<a href="#22">22</a>], with crude
protein levels of 7% and total digestible nutrients ranging
between 44 and 57%.  Nutritional value by

Rough fescue generally provides poor cover for small mammals,

Rough fescue is useful in rehabilitation projects 
because of its ability to 
form an extensive, fibrous root system [<a href="#102">102</a>]. Rough fescue has proven useful for roadside plantings [<a href="#80">80</a>].Rough fescue 
exhibited good survival when planted on alpine sites in 
Denali National Park, Alaska. Ninety-three percent of rough fescue plants survived
1 growing season without water
or fertilization [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Fertilizer applications 
increased rough fescue survival in the Yukon [<a href="#56">56</a>].&nbsp;

OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

The dense, tufted habit of the rough fescue makes it resistant
to moderate grazing [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Heavy grazing 
can result in severely decreased rough fescue root depth and biomass 
[<a href="#6">6</a>]. As grazing pressure increased on rough fescue in Alberta, its basal area and number of viable
soil-stored seeds declined 
[<a href="#61">61</a>].

<p>Rough fescue
is tolerant of winter grazing [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>].  Approximately 80% 
utilization can occur during dormancy without any appreciable 
loss in summer vigor [<a href="#64">64</a>].  Dormant-season grazing may actually 
enhance plant vigor by stimulating tillering [<a href="#119">119</a>].  However, 
Campbell and others [<a href="#22">22</a>] suggest that maintenance 
of excellent or climax conditions is not possible on rough 
fescue ranges subjected to grazing.</p>

<p>Plains and mountain rough fescue are described as "sensitive" to 
summer grazing [<a href="#67">67</a>].  Plains rough fescue may be reduced by light 
to moderate grazing during the growing season in Alberta [<a href="#123">123</a>]; however, overall plant vigor
may be unimpaired following light grazing [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>]. In Alberta,
rough fescue was not eliminated despite 80% utilization with 
light cattle stocking over 
a 32-year period in which seed was not produced and plants were 
described as "inconspicuous" [<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>].  A "modest increase" 
in cattle stocking led to a marked decline in range condition 
[<a href="#120">120</a>].</p>

<p>Numerous clipping 
studies have focused on rough fescue, and detailed information is 
available [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>].  In Alberta, production 
potential was not affected by a single harvest at the end 
of August in 3 consecutive years.  A single 
defoliation stimulated tillering, but additional cutting 
reduced tiller numbers [<a href="#123">123</a>]. Plants can be adversely 
affected by defoliation in September [<a href="#79">79</a>]. Clipping studies suggest that greatest mortality occurs when 
plants are clipped weekly to 2 inches (5 cm) from mid-May to 
late-June and then once in early September to remove 
regrowth [<a href="#79">79</a>].  Mortality also occurs following weekly, 
season-long defoliation [<a href="#79">79</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p>Grazing can cause a general decline in rough fescue coverage. In western Montana, rough 
fescue is one of the 1st species to decline after 
grazing [<a href="#23">23</a>]. Common increasers with grazing include Idaho fescue, Parry's oatgrass <i>
(Danthonia parryi)</i>, needlegrass <i>(Stipa</i> spp.), 
prairie junegrass, and thread-leaved 
sedge <i>(Carex filifolia)</i>.  Heavy grazing in rough fescue 
prairie of Alberta led to decreases in rough fescue and 
increases in Parry oatgrass, Idaho fescue, and wheatgrass <i>(Agropyron</i> 
spp.) [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Prolonged heavy grazing 
leads to replacement by weedy species such as fringed sagebrush 
(<i>Artemisia frigida),</i> locoweed (<i>Oxtropis campestris),</i> 
pussytoes (<i>Antennaria</i> spp.), dandelion (<i>Taraxacum 
officinale), </i> and rubber rabbitbrush (<i>Chrysothamnus nauseosus)</i> 
[<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].&nbsp;</p> 

<p>Basal area is a good indicator of 
grazing history on most sites.  Following heavy grazing, 
large, robust bunches are typically reduced to small, 
inconspicuous shoots.  On sites in southern Alberta 
receiving 17 years of continuous summer cattle grazing, mean percent basal area of rough fescue
differed as follows [<a href="#59">59</a>]:</p>

<p>It may be helpful to monitor grazing intensities 
on cattle and horse summer ranges receiving
concentrated use throughout the growing 
season. To maintain plant vigor of rough fescue grasslands of Alberta, Campbell 
and others [<a href="#22">22</a>] recommend grazing intensities that retain 40 to 50% of the current year's growth and
20% of the seedstalks.  Deferred-rotation 
and rest-rotation systems of grazing are recommended
for rough fescue-dominated grasslands in Montana.  On 
low elevation spring and fall ranges, grazing should not 
begin until late spring; early grazing of many sites 
results in exclusive utilization of rough fescue until 
other forage species become available [<a href="#86">86</a>].  Two to three summers 
of heavy grazing can effectively eliminate plants from 
sites in Alberta [<a href="#60">60</a>].  In Alberta, plants were nearly eliminated 
after 5 years of heavy grazing [<a href="#122">122</a>].  An 
erect growth habit permits easy removal of 
large portions of photosynthetic material.  Continued close 
grazing greatly lowers vigor and eventually results in
the death of the plant.  Recovery from overgrazing is 
slow due to erratic seed production and limited tillering 
abilities.  "Susceptibility to damage from heavy grazing may
result from a limited ability of the species to produce lateral
tillers from axillary meristems.  Our observations suggest 
that tillering in rough fescue, especially when grazed, is not
as vigorous as the data indicated&quot; [<a href="#60">60</a>].</p>

<p>In interior British Columbia, rough fescue
comprises up to 10% of the dry-matter yield of the middle 
grassland zone, and up to 50% of the dry-matter yield of the 
upper grassland zone [<a href="#108">108</a>].  Such attributes suggest that 
rough fescue can be managed as a key forage species on sites where 
it comprises more than 15% of the total plant
composition [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>].</p>

<p>Rough fescue grasslands are susceptible to weed invasion.  In Montana, 
the low montane zone is particularly susceptible [<a href="#38">38</a>].  In 
parts of Montana, large areas of grasslands 
have been invaded by Douglas-fir, causing reductions in rough 
fescue [<a href="#10">10</a>]. Leafy 
spurge has invaded some rough fescue communities in 
the Bob Marshall Wilderness and in Glacier National Park 
[<a href="#15">15</a>].  Montana rough fescue communities are 
described as "fairly resistant" to invasion by spotted knapweed 
(<i>Centaurea stoebe ssp. micranthos</i>).  Smooth brome (<i>Bromus inermis</i>) is 
invading many rough fescue sites in Saskatchewan [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Griltz 
and Romo [<a href="#45">45</a>] recommend monitoring ranges regularly for 
smooth brome invasion.  "Brush" has invaded rough fescue 
grasslands in central Alberta [<a href="#13">13</a>].</p>

Rough fescue is an erect, native, cool 
season, perennial bunchgrass that produces thick 
mats of persistent sheath and stem bases [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Culms 
range from 2 to 3.5 
feet (6-10 dm) in height, although plant heights to
5 feet (1.5 m) have been recorded. Leaves
are mostly basal with tuft heights generally ranging from 
12 to 16 inches (30-40 cm).  Rough fescue derives its name 
from the rough feel of the leaf blade, 
rachis, and lemma [<a href="#102">102</a>].

<p class="subframeContent">
Individual rough fescue plants often form large-diameter
bunches.  Moss and Campbell [<a href="#85">85</a>] reported crown diameters of 
10 to 20 inches (25-50 cm) on undisturbed sites in Alberta.  
In quaking aspen parklands of Saskatchewan, plant 
diameters rarely exceed 5 to 6 inches (13-15 cm).  Plants have 
an extensive fibrous root system that can reach more than 4 feet
(120 cm) in depth on sites in the black soil zone in Saskatchewan.  
Approximately 73% of the root system is concentrated in the top 6
inches (15 cm) of soil.  On these sites, average yield of
underground fescue parts to a depth of 4 feet (1.2 m) is 
estimated at approximately 11.11 tons/acre [<a href="#24">24</a>].  

<p>Culm height, color, and other characteristics
differ by subspecies [<a href="#87">87</a>].  Subspecies 
of rough fescue are distinguished primarily by growth habit and 
other morphological characteristics, and there is overlap among 
the subspecies. Botanical characteristics of the subspecies follow.</p>

<p>  Northern rough fescue tends to 
have yellowish- to dark-green foliage. Plants are densely caespitose with short, inconspicuous
to infrequently present rhizomes [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>]. Plants produce 5 to 10 
culms that are 16 to 24 inches (40-60 cm) in height, and have 3 to 5 florets 
per spikelet [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p>  Mountain rough fescue is bluish gray-green, densely caespitose, and rarely has rhizomes
[<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>]. It is relatively tall and forms large clumps consisting of up to 25 culms 
[<a href="#87">87</a>]. Culms generally range from 16 to 36 inches (40-90 cm) in height, with 4 to 6 florets per
spikelet [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Mountain rough fescue has double the chromosome number of the other 2 subspecies
[<a href="#87">87</a>].</p>

<p>  Plains rough fescue is somewhat rhizomatous 
and mat forming in habit. Plants are bluish or gray-green
bunchgrasses with short rhizomes.  Plants produce 3 to 5 culms that range from 8
to 26 inches (20-65 cm) in height. There are 2 to 3 florets per spikelet. Plants are relatively short, less strongly tufted 
than the other subspecies and produce short, creeping rhizomes 
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].  Dead sheaths persist 
at the base of plants [<a href="#1">1</a>].</p>

<br />

Rough fescue regenerates from seed, tillers, and sometimes from rhizomes.  Rough fescue is either rhizomatous or
caespitose in habit [<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>].

<p>As is the case with the majority of cool season grasses, the seed crop of any year
is initiated and partially develops during the fall.  
Final seedhead maturation occurs the next summer.  Vegetative 
buds are maintained throughout the year at approximately 0.09 
inch (2.3 mm) above the root-stem transition.  Floral initiation 
occurs primarily during late August and early September.  Reproductive 
apices are gradually elevated to 0.6 inch (15.2 mm) during the 
winter months.  Rapid culm elongation occurs during May and 
early June [<a href="#104">104</a>].</p>

<p>Variation in year-to-year germination and seed production
has been reported.  Seed production is not related to 
basal area or the number of tillers per plant.  Although factors responsible for erratic 
seed production in rough fescue are unknown, Stout and others 
[<a href="#104">104</a>] suggest that environmental factors can have a significant 
impact when seed development occurs over a prolonged period.  
Their studies indicate that low temperatures enhance seed 
development.</p>

<p>Griltz and others [<a href="#46">46</a>] report that "persistence of viable rough
fescue seed in the soil is low."  In Alberta, the number of 
viable seed per m<sup>2</sup> of rough fescue decreased with 
grazing [<a href="#61">61</a>]. According to Griltz and others [<a href="#46">46</a>] germination in rough fescue is primarily 
controlled by water stress and not temperature.  For example, 
plains rough fescue is known to germinate over a wide range of
temperature.  Germination was found to be
highest at constant temperatures of 59 and 68 <sup>o</sup>F (15 and 20 <sup>o</sup>C) [<a href="#94">94</a>].  
Germination of rough fescue is reduced by exposure to moist 
conditions at low temperatures [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Johnston and MacDonald 
[<a href="#60">60</a>] reported germination rates of 86 to 96.5% during field 
trials in southern Alberta.  Details on germination characteristics 
of rough fescue by temperature, light, and osmotic potential are 
available [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].</p>

<p>Stands typically take from 3 to 4 years to fully develop.  Initial 
establishment is enhanced on sites that receive protection from 
grazing. The establishment of plains rough fescue is likely to 
be highest where plants have died or where competition is reduced 
at some distance from established plants [<a href="#46">46</a>].</p>


<p class="subframeContent">
Plains rough fescue, which grows along the foothills and in mountain 
grasslands of the Rocky Mountains, is rhizomatous. In Alberta, bunches are 
connected by short rhizomes to form a large, loosely consolidated 
crown.  Rhizomes emerge either laterally or from underneath the 
crown and radiate in all directions.  Sprouts are then produced 
within approximately 0.8 inch (2 cm) of the parent plant. Maximum root depth is 6 inches (15 cm).  Maximum rhizome lengths
are approximately 23 inches (60 cm).  Vegetative regeneration 
in plains rough fescue may be reduced by heavy grazing.  Plains rough fescue produces seed only 
infrequently [<a href="#94">94</a>].

<p>Northern rough fescue has short inconspicuous rhizomes [<a href="#1">1</a>].&nbsp;</p>
  
<p>  
Mountain rough fescue is a bunchgrass and rarely produces 
rhizomes [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>]. Mountain rough fescue tillers appear to survive "several" 
years and become larger with age [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Most tillers 
are vegetative and lack culms [<a href="#118">118</a>].  Seed production 
is erratic.  Several years may elapse without any appreciable 
seed set.  Important seed years in southern Alberta were 1902, 1952, 
1964, and 1966 [<a href="#60">60</a>].</p>
  

<p class="subframeText">

<br />

Rough fescue grows in grasslands, open 
forests, montane and subalpine grasslands, and in alpine, tundra, and arctic communities [<a href="#87">87</a>].
It is most prominent in a belt along the northern 
edge of the Great Plains, where it is the principal climax 
dominant within the black-soil zone of Alberta, western 
Saskatchewan, and northwestern Montana [<a href="#25">25</a>].  It is generally 
associated with mesic grassland sites having annual 
precipitation of more than 14 inches (350 mm) and a
short, cool growing season [<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>].  In Alberta and Saskatchewan, rough 
fescue grasslands are characterized by a subhumid climate and
annual precipitation of approximately 22 inches (560 mm), of which 
65% occurs between May and September [<a href="#124">124</a>].

<p>Rough fescue grows on a number of soil types including loam and
silty loams [<a href="#69">69</a>]. In eastern North America, northern rough fescue 
populations are often localized.  Populations
are found on sand plains, serpentine barrens, limestone plains and
basaltic slopes.  In western North 
American, northern rough fescue grows in subalpine, alpine, taiga, and tundra zones in
open forests, meadows, and grasslands, or in timber, rocky slopes, and plateaus [<a href="#1">1</a>].</p>

<p>
Site preferences of rough fescue vary by subspecies. Mountain rough fescue is a dominant component of foothill 
grasslands. This subspecies occurs on more mesic and 
cooler sites than the other subspecies [<a href="#1">1</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p>Topography supporting plains rough fescue ranges from level to gently rolling.
Plains and mountain rough fescue are separated by elevation in 
southern Alberta.  Plains rough fescue occupies prairie sites 
in central Alberta and Saskatchewan at elevations from 1,200 to 
2,000 feet (366-610 m) [<a href="#1">1</a>].</p>

<p>  Elevational ranges of rough fescue 
vary as follows [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>]:</p>

Rough fescue occurs in early, seral, and climax communities. It is characteristic of many climax and late-successional mountain grassland and fescue prairie communities
[33,93.  In rough fescue prairie foothill communities 
of Alberta, succession to a "near climax state" requires more 
than 20 years following heavy grazing [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Complete recovery 
following light grazing in southwestern Alberta took approximately 
14 years [<a href="#120">120</a>]. Rough fescue is a component of early seral 
communities following fire because of residual plant survival [<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].

<p>
Northern rough fescue is common soon after fire in quaking aspen
woodlands of Alaska [<a href="#74">74</a>].  It is also prevalent on some 
black spruce (<i>Picea mariana</i>) sites 40 to 100 years after fire in British Columbia
[<a href="#89">89</a>]. It occurs in early stages of succession 
in tundra communities of the Alaska Range [<a href="#113">113</a>].  It 
is present into the early shrub stage, but does not reproduce 
sexually.  By the late shrub stage, rough fescue is no 
longer present.  Generalized succession in these tundra 
communities is as follows [<a href="#113">113</a>]:</p>

pioneer stage 25-30 years<br>
meadow stage 100 years<br>
early shrub stage 150-200 years<br>
late shrub stage 200-300 years<br>
climax tundra 5,000-9,000 years

<p>Plains rough fescue is considered a climax species in grassland 
communities of Manitoba [<a href="#6">6</a>].&nbsp;</p>

SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Rough fescue is a cool-season grass that is well adapted to a 
short growing season. It typically initiates growth 
immediately following snowmelt and completes growth before the 
onset of summer drought.  On most sites, plants cure by early 
October [<a href="#60">60</a>]. Reserve carbohydrate levels are at low levels in April or May
[<a href="#63">63</a>], when growth resumes.  On montane grassland sites in interior
British Columbia, rough fescue initiates growth in early spring 
(usually by mid-April) and ceases growth by late June 
[<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>]. In British Columbia, culm growth 
begins in late May and ceases by the time leaf growth has ended 
[<a href="#105">105</a>].  Soil temperatures at depths of 
4 inches (10 cm) ranged from 36.7 to 37.2 <sup>o</sup> Fahrenheit 
(2.6-2.9 <sup>o</sup>C). Growth initiation may be more closely 
related to soil temperature than to soil water content or to air 
temperature.  In Alberta, Johnston and McDonald [<a href="#60">60</a>] observed that
growth began in mid-May when soil temperatures were 
35.6 <sup>o</sup> Fahrenheit (2 <sup>o</sup> C) at 8 inches 
(20 cm). 

<p>
In British Columbia, flowering typically occurs from 
mid-May to mid-June, with seed dispersal from mid- to late July. Maximum plant weights were not attained until late 
June, after culm and blade elongation had ceased [<a href="#104">104</a>]. Summer growth cessation is controlled primarily by 
available water [<a href="#105">105</a>].  Fall regrowth occasionally occurs in plains rough fescue in 
Manitoba [<a href="#109">109</a>].  In British Columbia, fall regrowth occurred 
in 2 out of 3 years in September or October.  Lack 
of regrowth was attributed to effects of defoliation [<a href="#104">104</a>].</p>

<p>Phenological development of rough fescue over a 3-year 
period on 2 sites in British Columbia is presented below

<p>In Manitoba, plains rough fescue begins growth from mid-April 
to early May. Plants reach full seedhead
development from late May through mid-June, depending on environmental
conditions [<a href="#109">109</a>].  Although plains rough fescue 
flowers 2 to 3 weeks earlier than mountain rough fescue, the 
seed matures at a later date.  Mass flowering of plains 
rough fescue has been reported at irregular intervals.  Mass flowering may be due to a combination of warm spring temperatures, few killing
frosts, and early heat penetration of the soil [<a href="#1">1</a>].</p>

Fire adaptations: Rough fescue appears to be well adapted to periodic burning.  The dense, 
tufted habit of rough fescue makes it resistant to "light" 
fire [<a href="#1">1</a>]. The primary postfire survival strategy of rough fescue is 
through the resprouting of surviving residual plants and from 
off-site wind-dispersed seed [<a href="#107">107</a>].  Although 
plants are initially top-killed, recovery of prefire coverages and 
herbage production is usually attained in 2 to 3 years 
[<a href="#106">106</a>].&nbsp;

<p class="subframeContent">
  Susceptibility to fire is related 
to fire severity, frequency, and season [<a href="#107">107</a>]. Crowns are characterized 
by coarse stems that tend to persist from year to year.
During burning, densely packed stubble accumulations insulate 
perennating buds located near the ground surface 
[<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].  Reductions in plant vigor are more long lasting 
following growing-season burns than dormant-season burns.  Postburn recovery 
rates decline the further into the growing season plants 
are burned [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>].  Where reduced fire frequencies have
produced large-diameter bunches with heavy litter 
build-ups, survival may be severely inhibited, as crowns tend to 
continue burning long after passage of the flame 
front [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>].  Antos and others [<a href="#6">6</a>] suggest that fire frequencies 
in the range of 5 to 10 years may best maintain
rough fescue.

<p class="subframeContent">
Fire regimes: In parts of Saskatchewan, 
presettlement fire intervals in plains rough fescue communities were estimated 
at 2-6 or 5-10 years [<a href="#92">92</a>]. Barrett [<a href="#14">14</a>] estimates presettlement
fire free intervals of 10 to 18 years in ponderosa pine rough 
fescue communities in Idaho.  Late summer or autumn lightning
fires may have encouraged the growth of rough fescue in Oregon 
[<a href="#4">4</a>].  Grazed areas generally hamper fire 
spread, and intense use by livestock may have greatly restricted 
fire spread in rough fescue grasslands [<a href="#10">10</a>].

<p>The following table provides fire return intervals for plant communities in
which rough fescue is common. To learn more about the fire regimes in specific communities

Rough fescue is initially top-killed by fire [<a href="#107">107</a>]; however, rough fescue is moderately resistant to fire.
Rough fescue crowns are made up 
of coarse culm bases that persist from year to year.  These crown 
characteristics make rough fescue less susceptible to prolonged burning 
than a fine-leaved bunchgrass such as Idaho fescue 
[<a href="#126">126</a>].  Coarse stubble accumulations presumably insulate 
perennating buds located near the ground surface [<a href="#82">82</a>]. Most plants survive fires
that occur during dormancy or under the high-moisture conditions often associated with spring 
and fall burning [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].<p>Although 
densely packed stubble accumulations help to insulate the perennating 
buds when fire severity is low, with very dry burning conditions the dense stubble accumulations can generate
high-severity fires [<a href="#107">107</a>].  Fires that penetrate the duff layer and burn into the
root crowns increase belowground temperatures that can damage belowground
tissues [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>]. Fire damage can be particularly severe and mortality can 
occur&nbsp; on sites where reduced fire frequencies have
produced heavy litter buildups within large-diameter rough fescue crowns [<a href="#6">6</a>].</p>


<p class="subframeText">
<span class="subframeName">
<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT">
DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Rough fescue can be severely damaged by hot, 
mid-summer wildfires.  Rough fescue cover was 
significantly reduced by spring burning on rough fescue-dominated foothills 
grassland in western Montana. At postfire year 1, 
rough fescue cover was 8.1% on burned areas and
24.6% on unburned areas.  The site had been protected from
fire for 32 years and had been ungrazed for almost 80 years.  
Rough fescue plants were characterized by large-diameter bunches with substantial accumulations of old culm stubble.  Mortality 
occurred where crown diameters exceeded 
7.8 inches (20 cm), and many of these plants had burned to 
below the soil surface.  Complete consumption of some bunches 
produced holes in the ground from 1 to 2 inches (3-5 cm) 
in depth that were filled with as much as 1 inch (3 cm) 
of ash [<a href="#6">6</a>].

<p></p>


<p class="subframeText">
<span class="subframeName">
<a name="PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE">
PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Rough fescue recovers from fire by tillering, sprouting from the root crown, and regenerating from seed [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>]. It is initially reduced by fire regardless of the 
season of burning.  Although preburn cover is typically 
regained within 2 to 3 years on most sites [<a href="#107">107</a>], 
burning season and fire severity can influence the rate 
of recovery.  Despite burning at high temperatures, rough fescue 
can sometimes initiate conspicuous green shoots within a week after the 
fire.  Rough fescue is unharmed by burning if the plant is dormant [<a href="#4">4</a>].  

<p>Spring burns can adversely affect flower development, and 
seed production can be reduced.  Spring burns
may be more detrimental due to elevated growing points that increase susceptibility; however, in a southeastern British Columbia study, spring burns
had no significant effect on rough fescue cover [<a href="#107">107</a>].</p>

<p>Fall burns appear to have no effect on seed production 
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>].  Elevated soil moistures which are associated 
with fall burns may also reduce damage. Early spring growth and flower development were reported
following the fall burn in British Columbia.  
Earlier growth was attributed to increased soil temperatures resulting 
from greater heat absorption from the blackened surface 
[<a href="#107">107</a>].</p>
 
<p>Nonrhizomatous northern and mountain rough fescue appear more 
susceptible to fire damage than plains rough fescue. Plants are particularly prone to fire 
damage on sites where reduced fire frequencies have produced 
large diameter bunches with heavy stubble 
accumulations.  Antos and others [<a href="#6">6</a>] observed decreased
resprouting response with increasing bunch size following 
a hot, mid-season wildfire in Montana.  Crowns less than 
4 inches (10 cm) in diameter resprouted completely, whereas 
resprouting was inhibited in crowns greater than 7.8 inches 
(20 cm) in diameter.  Three years after the fire, average 
coverage of rough fescue on burned sites was 11.1%
versus 29.9% in unburned areas.  Herbage production can remain below 
unburned levels for 2 to 3 years when mid-season burning 
generates high severity fires [<a href="#20">20</a>].</p>

<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE">
DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Rough fescue cover can be severely reduced when burning 
occurs during the growing season.  On quaking aspen parkland of 
southern Alberta, Bailey and Anderson [<a href="#12">12</a>] reported a 26% decline 
1 year after a spring burn compared to a 6% decline 
after a fall burn.  Rough fescue cover was reduced for at least 
3 years: herbage 
production on&nbsp; burned sites remained below production on unburned areas.
New rough fescue growth on burned sites was approximately 4 inches (10 cm) in
height at postfire year 3.  In contrast, burning on similar sites immediately 
after snowmelt, when leaf growth was approximately 1.5 inches 
(4 cm), slightly reduced rough fescue cover but maintained prefire annual production 
during postfire year 1.

<p>Generally, plains rough fescue responds 
to fire by increased tiller production.  Burned swards are 
shorter and denser than unburned swards.  Apparently the 
further into the growing season the burning occurs, the greater 
the detrimental effect.  Grilz and Romo 
[<a href="#44">44</a>] reported reduced tillering of plains rough fescue 
following spring or fall burns in communities with patchy 
smooth brome.  Sinton 
[<a href="#98">98</a>] observed a nearly linear relationship between
herbage production, leaf blade length, and tiller density 
following burning 1 week, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after snowmelt.</p>

<p>Drastic reductions in seed production can occur after spring 
burns.  Bailey and Anderson [<a href="#12">12</a>] reported a 92% reduction 
in seedstalk production 3 months after a spring burn 
in southern Alberta.  Following a spring burn in Saskatchewan, 
biomass in grasslands dominated by plains rough fescue was 
reduced by 72 to 84% [<a href="#92">92</a>].  Like many cool-season 
grasses, rough fescue initiates floral development in the fall.  
Studies of rough fescue indicate that growing points are 
gradually elevated during the winter from 0.4 inches (12.6 mm) 
above the root crown transition in 
October to 1.5 inches (40 cm) in May [<a href="#60">60</a>].  Bailey and 
Anderson [<a href="#12">12</a>] suggest that floral
initiation is not affected by spring burns; but by May, the greater height of reproductive 
growing points leaves them them&nbsp; susceptible to 
fire damage.  Seed 
development on burn sites approximated that on unburned stands 
within 2 growing seasons.  Fall burns had no 
effect on subsequent seed head development.</p>

<p>In Montana, rough fescue decreased 17.5% in the 1st season 
after fire.  During the 2nd growing season after fire, 
a 5% reduction was noted when compared to preburn levels [<a href="#21">21</a>].  
The following densities (stems/m<sup>2</sup>) were reported for rough fescue following 
spring and fall burning in Saskatchewan [<a href="#44">44</a>]:</p>

FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Annual spring burning studies on quaking aspen parkland 
sites in Alberta indicate that short fire cycles impede 
rough fescue reestablishment , while long fire return intervals 
produce high mortality due to excessive
fuel buildup.

In plains rough fescue prairie communities, large concentrations
of dead plant material develop in the absence of fire and/or 
grazing [<a href="#46">46</a>]. Prescribed fire frequencies of 5 to 10 years are
recommended for mountain grassland sites where management objectives are
aimed at rough fescue maintenance [<a href="#5">5</a>].

<p>Spring burns should be conducted as soon after snowmelt as 
possible to minimize fire damage [<a href="#12">12</a>].  The degree to which 
plants recover typically declines as the growing season 
progresses [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>].  In northwestern Montana, fall burns can 
increase the chances of soil erosion by wind or water, leaving rough fescue more susceptible to frost damage.  Fall burns may also reduce important elk forage, including rough fescue, during the
1st winter after burning 
[<a href="#63">63</a>].</p>

<p>Protein content (%) of rough fescue may be increased by burning. In central Montana,
protein content ranged from 6.0 to 8.9% on unburned control sites, and from 8.1
to 14.6% on burned sites [<a href="#66">66</a>].</p>

The prefire community was an "almost pure" stand of plains rough 
fescue (<i>Festuca altaica</i> ssp. <i>hallii</i>) that had been
ungrazed for 13 years.   Porcupine grass (<i>Hesperostipa curtiseta</i>) occurred 
on drier sites with minor bearded wheatgrass (<i>Elymus trachycaulus</i>), goldenrod (<i>Solidago</i> spp.), cerastium (<i>Cerastium</i> spp.),
thickspike wheatgrass (<i>E. lanceolatus</i>), and sedges (<i>Carex</i> spp.) 
including blunt sedge (<i>C. obtusata</i>).

All prescribed burns were conducted in late afternoon using a
headfire.  Wind speeds ranged up to 5 miles per hour (8 km/hour) with gusts to 14 miles per hour (22 km/hour).  Total 
herbaceous fuel ranged from 9,360 to 11,540 kg/ha.  Two defoliation 
treatments (burning and mowing) were examined on 5 dates in a factorial 
experiment arranged in a split-plot design with 8 replicates. Site fuel and weather
conditions at times of burning were:

<p>Burn 1) April 8th - high moisture content of fallen litter resulted
in mostly standing fuel burning and only 43% consumption</p>

<p>Burn 2) April 27th - moisture content of litter was 29% when
the fire temperatures were highest</p>

Burn 3) June 1st - no additional information

<p>Burn 4) July 31st - conditions were driest on July 31st, but
precipitation at the time of burning increased moisture of the
standing fuel</p>

<p>Burn 5) October 19th - greatest percentage of fuel burned on this date</p>

were arranged on a asbestos card, covered with mica and positioned
4 inches (10 cm) above ground level.  This was the height at which maximum temperature occurred in this

Tiller density increased after burning or mowing (with harvester and 
lawn mower) in each treatment.   The standing crop of plains rough
fescue produced in the first growing season after treatment was decreased.  
Defoliation in early spring had little effect on the standing crop 
of plains rough fescue, however.  The inflorescence density 
increased after burning or mowing on April 8th and June 1st.  Plains
rough fescue recovered to prefire levels by the 2nd year after 
burning following 1 spring or 1 fall burn. Details
are as given below.

FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Plains rough fescue grasslands are tolerant of fire and can be
maintained with fire.  Spring burns may, in some instances, be
more beneficial than fall burns.  (Spring burns reduced standing
herbage and tiller length the least, but increased inflorescence 
density the most).  Annual burning in plains rough fescue grasslands stopped invasion 
of quaking aspen (<i>Populus tremuloides)</i>.
