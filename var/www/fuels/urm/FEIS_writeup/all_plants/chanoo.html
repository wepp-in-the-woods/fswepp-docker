<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Chamaecyparis nootkatensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Alaska-cedar commands a high price for stumpage due to its fine texture,
straight grain, durability, freedom from splitting and checking,
resistance to acid, and excellent milling qualities [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  The
wood is used in window frames, doors, boat building, utility poles,
marine pilings, cabinets [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>], carving, and greenhouse construction
[<a href="#33">33</a>].

Most of the harvested wood is exported to Japan where, because of its
similar bright yellow color, it is used as a substitute for the rare
hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtusa) [<a href="#6">6</a>].

The wood has an unusual and distinct "potato-like" odor [<a href="#48">48</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Alaska-cedar is of minor importance to livestock and wildlife as browse.
When densities of black-tailed deer are high, Alaska-cedar is browsed
[<a href="#51">51</a>].  The Alaskan brown bear girdles the upslope side of the tree in
the spring to feed on the phloem, which is high in sucrose [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Alaska-cedar browse is unpalatable to blue grouse [<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Alaska-cedar as a component of old-growth forests can provide critical
thermal and hiding cover for large ungulates [<a href="#22">22</a>] and small mammals
[<a href="#58">58</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Alaska-cedar seedlings can be planted in the subalpine environment where
disturbance is recurrent, for it is the only conifer capable of
surviving on sites with frequent avalanches [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Native Americans used Alaska-cedar wood to produce bows [<a href="#52">52</a>], masks,
bowls, and dishes.  The roots were split and used for the framework of
baskets and hats [<a href="#48">48</a>].

Alaska-cedar is grown as an ornamental in North America and Europe
[<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In southeast Alaska, Alaska-cedar is suffering from dieback that started
around the turn of the century [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Most of the mortality has
occurred in bog and semibog sites [<a href="#28">28</a>].  The search for a pathogen has
been exhaustive with little results.  It now seems likely the cause is
abiotic [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  The most plausible hypothesis offered thus far is
that of a warming trend that started in Alaska in the late 1800's which
has decreased the snow pack [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Because Alaska-cedar has low frost
resistance [<a href="#40">40</a>], the decreased snow pack renders the fine roots
susceptible to frost damage.  This is the first sign of Alaska-cedar
decline [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Alaska-cedar is relatively free of damaging agents due to chemical
compostion of the wood [<a href="#24">24</a>].  It is virtually rot-free, and the snags
can persist for 100+ years [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Hennon [<a href="#26">26</a>] lists the 77 known fungi
associated with Alaska-cedar.

Clearcutting changes the species compostion of second-growth forests in
the Western Hemlock Zone, increasing Alaska-cedar's percent composition
[<a href="#23">23</a>].  The recommended silvicultural practice of cutting old-growth
Alaska-cedar is clearcut with planting [<a href="#60">60</a>].

Plantation-grown Alaska-cedar has a growth rate comparable to that of
Douglas-fir; this is much greater than natural regeneraton of
Alaska-cedar within its range [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Equations have been developed for Alaska-cedar based on growth percent
as an estimation of future productivity on different soil types [<a href="#54">54</a>].

Hamilton [<a href="#21">21</a>] explored the response of Alaska-cedar to single-tree
selection method, and he determined that Alaska-cedar will respond
favorably to the method.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Chamaecyparis nootkatensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Alaska-cedar is a native, evergreen, long-lived (as long as 3,500 years
[<a href="#16">16</a>]), monecious tree [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  It is slow growing with a narrow crown;
the twigs are four-angled [<a href="#56">56</a>].  The boles of mature trees have
buttressed and fluted bases, and the bark is shreddy [<a href="#33">33</a>].

Alaska-cedar is a medium-sized tree, although at treeline it is reduced
to a shrub.  It can obtain heights of 100 to 125 feet (30-38 m) with a
d.b.h. as great as 12 feet (3.7 m) [<a href="#24">24</a>].  The root system is shallow
with complex layering [<a href="#24">24</a>].  The leaves are scalelike and roughly 0.125
inch (0.32 cm) in length [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  The stroboli are borne on the tips of
branchlets.  The male strobili are yellow.  The female strobili are
green, spherical, and 0.5 inch (1 cm) in diameter [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Ligneous Chamaephyte
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  The frequency of good seed crops is irregular (4 or more years)
[<a href="#59">59</a>], and germination rates are low [<a href="#35">35</a>].  A germination rate of around
12 percent can be obtained with a warm stratification (30 days at 68 to
86 degrees Fahrenheit [20-30 deg C]) followed by a moist stratification
(30 days at 40 degrees Fahrenheit [4 deg C]).  A tetrazolium stain has
been recommended for a test of seed viability [<a href="#23">23</a>].  The seed are quite
small with an average of 108,000 seeds per pound (240,000 seeds/kg)
[<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  The seed can be stored dry at 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 deg C)
for 3 to 5 years [<a href="#59">59</a>].  Bower and others [<a href="#5">5</a>] recommend foliar
application of gibberellin A3 to increase flowering and filled seed.
From the parent tree the mean dissemination distance is about 400 feet
(120 m) [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Germination is epigeal [<a href="#24">24</a>], and mineral soil or well
decomposed organic matter are the preferred germination substrates [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Vegetative:  Alaska-cedar reproduces asexually by layering.  It layers
readily under the deep, heavy coastal snowpacks [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Vegetative
reproduction is the method of choice to meet the demands for
containerized stock, due to the low germination rate and infrequent good
seed crops [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Cuttings, treated with indolebutyric acid and potted
in the greenhouse, were ready for planting in 1 year [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Clones have
advantages over seedlings such as fewer multiple leaders and uniformity
in size [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Karlsson [<a href="#34">34</a>] and Karlsson and Russell [<a href="#35">35</a>] provide
in-depth information on age of the donor, clone survival, establishment,
and planting guidelines.

Preliminary results indicate that there is genetic variation between
provenances for shoot growth; however, further testing is needed to
establish transfer zones [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Alaska-cedar occurs in hypermaritime to submaritime, subalpine, boreal,
and summer-wet, cool mesothermal climates [<a href="#39">39</a>].  It occurs from
shoreline to treeline in the northern portion of its range but is
restricted to higher elevations in the southern portion [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Elevation:  Elevational ranges for Alaska-cedar in several western
states are as follows [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>]:

                        Feet                    Meters
Alaska                  0 to 3,000              0 - 910 
Washinton and Oregon    2,000 to 7,500          600 - 2300 
California              4,950 to 7,260          1,500 - 2,200

Soil:  Alaska-cedar has a strong affinity for deep, well-drained soils
rich in calcium and magnesium, and derived from parent materials of
andesite, diorite, gabbro, or basalt (Histosol and Spodosol soil orders)
[<a href="#24">24</a>].  It also can be found on the poor, rocky soils of the alpine
environment far above the limits of other conifers [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Associates:  In addition to those previously listed under Distribution
and Occurrence, Alaska-cedar's overstory associates include California
red fir (Abies magnifica), subalpine fir (A. lasiocarpa), Pacific silver
fir (A. anabilis), noble fir (A. procera), Brewer spruce (Picea
breweriana), whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), shore pine (P.
contorta), incense-cedar (Libocedrus decurrens), and Pacific yew (Taxus
brevifolia) [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Understory associates include big huckleberry (Vaccinium membranaceum),
Alaska blueberry (V. alaskaense), fool's huckleberry (Menziesia
ferruginea), and copperbush (Cladathamnus pyroliflorus) [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Oblgate Initial Community Species
Facultative Seral Species
Obligate Climax Species

Depending on the site, Alaska-cedar can be a long-lived seral species or
a climax species [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  In the subalpine environment it is the first
tree species to become established, later forming large krummholz stands
from layering [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Alaska-cedar is classified as shade tolerant; it
will respond to 10 percent of full light and reach photosynthetic
saturation at 60 percent [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Flowering of Alaska-cedar occurs progressively earlier in the spring as
elevation decreases, suggesting that bud developement is based on heat
sums [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Alaska-cedar flowers from April to June depending on latitude
and elevation [<a href="#24">24</a>].  The cones of trees in the southern portion of its
range mature from September to October, and dispersal begins in October
and lasts through spring.  In the northern portion of its range and in
alpine environments, maturation of the cones is also based on heat sums,
with 2- and 3-year reproductive cycles, respectively, being the norm
[<a href="#10">10</a>].  In the northern portion of its range pollination of cones
initiated the previous summer occurs from mid-April to late May; cones
mature the following year [<a href="#24">24</a>].  The mature cones can be identified by
their yellow-brown color [<a href="#23">23</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fire is not an important factor in Alaska-cedar's cool, wet habitats.
Alaska-cedar's bark is thin and offers little protection from fire [<a href="#1">1</a>].
The fire regime of Alaska-cedar's habitats is one of long-interval (150
to 350+ years) severe crown or suface fires resulting in stand
replacement [<a href="#44">44</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
The immediate effect of a cool to hot fire on Alaska-cedar is damage to
the cambium layer, usually resulting in the death of the tree [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
Fire resistance is rated as low for Alaska-cedar [<a href="#49">49</a>], although a few
individuals will survive a cool fire [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Alaska-cedar will invade a burned site via wind-dispersed seed from
adjacent unburned forests [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
The burning of slash is controversial.  Fyles and others [<a href="#18">18</a>] recommend
the burning of slash to improve access for planters, increase plantable
sites, reduce brush competition, and reduce fire hazard; however, there
is little information about the effects of slash burning on Alaska-cedar
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  Feller [<a href="#13">13</a>] gives information on the effects of slashburning
on nutrient loss (see Fire Case Study).

After fire in the subalpine environment Alaska-cedar is slow to
regenerate in the krummholz zone [<a href="#8">8</a>].

<b>CASE NAME : </b>
Fuel properties and slash-burning-induced nutrient losses


<b>REFERENCE : </b>
Feller, M. C. 1988 [<a href="#13">13</a>]

<b>SEASON/SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION : </b>
The plots were burned on 10 different days in July, August, and
September 1984 to incorporate a range of fuel moisture conditions.


<b>STUDY LOCATION : </b>
The prescribed fire took place on a clearcut area of the University of
British Columbia's Research forest which is located appoximately 24
miles (40 km) east of Vancouver, British Columbia.  The cordinates are
49 degrees 17 minutes N latitude, 122 degrees 35 minutes W longitude.


<b>PREFIRE VEGETATIVE COMMUNITY : </b>
The preburn community was a productive coastal western hemlock forest
composed of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), western redcedar
(Thuja plicata), Alaska-cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis), and
Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) that had been clearcut.


<b>TARGET SPECIES PHENOLOGICAL STATE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>SITE DESCRIPTION : </b>
The study site was on a gentle, easterly slope at an elevation of 500 m
(1,650 ft).  The climate of the area is marine, warm-temperate, rainy.
The mean annual precipitation is from 87 to 138 inches (220-350 cm),
which is received mainly in the form of rain.  The soil over most of the
area was a Typic Haplorthod with a mor forest floor with a mean depth of
10 inches (26 cm).

The area had been logged during a snow-free period using a high lead
harvesting system.  After clearcutting the slash was sorted by species*
into five diameter classes:

                (1)  < 1 cm
                (2)  1.1-3.0 cm
                (3)  3.1-5.0 cm
                (4)  5.1-7.0 cm
                (5)  > 7 cm

*Alaska-cedar and western redcedar were combined and shall be henceforth
referred to as cedar.

The area was then divided into 50 2.25-square-meter plots that were
greater than 0.5 meter apart.  These were slpit into 10 groups of 5
plots; within each group the plots were randomly assigned a species.
Western hemlock slash had three fuel loadings (4.4, 9.9, 17.7 kg/m2)
while cedar and Douglas-fir had one fuel loading (9.9 kg/m2).  Each plot
received all size classes of slash.  Ten samples of slash were oven
dried and used to determine prefire chemical and percent composition.


<b>FIRE DESCRIPTION : </b>
The fire was ignited on each plot using a strip of gasoline around the
perimeter of the plot.  The five plots within a group were ignited
separatly, but within minutes of each other.

Atmospheric conditions and fuel moisture at the time of ignition of each
fire were as follows:

                Temp.   Relative        Wind speed      Fine fuel
                 C      Humidity        (km/hr)         moisture (%)

Depth of burn into the forest floor (L, F, H layers combined) averaged
1.9 cm on the cedar plots, 1.6 cm on Douglas fir plots, and 1.8 on the
western hemlock.  The total mean slash consumption per species in
kilograms per square meter was 4.2, 3.3, and 3.6 for cedar, Douglas-fir,
and western hemlock, respectively.


<b>FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES : </b>
Cedar slash had the greatest depth of burn, which in turn ment greater
losses of nutrients to the atmosphere.  The mean nutrient loss (grams
per square meter) for seven elements from the three types of slash were
as follows:

                N       P       S       K       Na      Mg      Ca

Cedar           26.3    1.3     2.7     3.7     0.1     2.0     19.5
Douglas-fir     19.5    1.2     2.2     2.3     0.1     1.1     11.0
Western hemlock 20.9    0.2     2.3     1.0     0.1     0.9      3.8


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS : </b>
This study revealed that western hemlock/western redcedar/Alaska-cedar
forests produce greater nutrient losses to the atmosphere when the slash
composition has a greater proportion of Alaska-cedar and western
redcedar.  One can expect smaller nutrient losses when western hemlock
makes up the majority of the slash.

Nutrient losses can be limited if the the forest floor and larger fuels
are moist when burned.  This limits fuel consumption.  Also nutrient
loss can be reduced by more complete utilization during harvest, thus
reducing the slash load.
