<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
California brome grows in open woods and forests, shrublands,
grasslands, meadows, and waste places [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].

Publications describing plant communities in which California brome is a
dominant component of the vegetation include:

Coastal prairie and northern coastal scrub [<a href="#33">33</a>]
Sagebrush-grass habitat types of southern Idaho [<a href="#36">36</a>]
A sagebrush community type classification for mountainous northeastern
  Nevada rangelands [<a href="#41">41</a>]

  succession and management [<a href="#76">76</a>]
Sagebrush steppe [<a href="#90">90</a>]

In mountain meadow grasslands, some species are associated with
California brome across several biotic provinces.  Associates of
California brome common to Rocky Mountain, Sierra Nevada, and Sierra
Madre mountain meadows include bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum), corn
lily (Veratrum californicum), dwarf purple monkeyflower (Mimulus
nasutus), mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia montana), and Rocky Mountain iris
(Iris missouriensis).  Pine dropseed (Blepharoneuron tricholepis) is a
common associate of California brome in the Rocky Mountains [<a href="#7">7</a>].

The quaking aspen/California brome community type occurs in all National
Forests of the Intermountain Region.  Plants common in this community
type include blue wildrye (Elymus glaucus), slender wheatgrass (E.
trachycaulus), mountain snowberry (Symphoricarpos oreophilus), western
yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and Hood's sedge (Carex hoodii) [<a href="#58">58</a>].

In western Montana, California brome is a component of grassy balds
within the subalpine fir-Engelmann spruce (Abies lasiocarps-Picea
engelmannii) zone and above timberline.  Associates in grassy balds of
the Bitterroot Mountains include chamisso sedge (Carex pachystachya),
bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata), Idaho fescue (Festuca
idahoensis), ballhead sandwort (Arenaria congesta), and western yarrow
[<a href="#66">66</a>].

Associates in high-elevation sedge (Carex spp.) meadows of west-central
Idaho include elk sedge (C. geyeri) and other sedges, Idaho fescue,
timber oatgrass (Danthonia intermedia), Wheeler bluegrass (Poa nervosa),
pearly pussytoes (Antennaria anaphaloides), and yellow eriogonum
(Eriogonum flavum) [<a href="#82">82</a>].

In shrub steppe of Teton County, Wyoming, Califonia brome was most
common in mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana)
communities above the bluebunch wheatgrass zone.  Associates included
slender wheatgrass, Hood's sedge, smallwing sedge (C. microptera),
valley sedge (C. vallicola), Idaho fescue, purple oniongrass (Melica
spectabilis), and needle-and-thread grass (Stipa comata) [<a href="#4">4</a>].

In California and Oregon, California brome was a component of pristine
prairies [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  It also occurred, and still does, in the understory
of oak (Quercus spp.) and other woodlands and savannas [<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>] including
valley oak (Q. lobata), California bay (Umbellularia californica), and
California black walnut (Juglans californica) [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>], which are not
included in SAF cover types [<a href="#23">23</a>] listed.  California brome was probably
dominant on some pristine sites [<a href="#65">65</a>].  Associates on contemporary
California annual grasslands include slender oat (Avena barbata), wild
oat (A. fatua), Pacific hairgrass (Deschampsia caespitosa ssp.
holciformis), sheep sorrel (Rumex acetosella), and ripgut brome (Bromus
diandrus) [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Associates in remnant prairie in the Willamette Valley
of Oregon include red fescue (Festuce rubra), wild strawberry (Fragaria
virginiana), English plantain (Plantago lanceolata), oxeye daisy
(Chrysanthemum leucanthemum), and wild carrot (Daucus carota) [<a href="#40">40</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Livestock:  California brome provides high-quality forage [<a href="#32">32</a>] and is
sometimes planted as a pasture grass.  The Colorado State University
Extension Service described it as "one of the best forage grasses" in
Colorado.  On rangelands of the Intermountain West, livestock graze
California brome from early spring until seed dispersal.  All
aboveground parts of the plant are used; the seedheads are palatable and
nutritious [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Herbage volume is rated fair [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].

Wildlife:  Elk prefer California brome [<a href="#79">79</a>].  It is listed as an
important summer forage species for Rocky Mountain elk in northern Idaho
[<a href="#51">51</a>].  Roosevelt elk on Boyes Prairie of northwestern California grazed
California brome more than its percentage cover would predict.
California brome was not plentiful, however, and was not listed as a
leading forage species for the elk [<a href="#30">30</a>].
  
Grizzly bear consume California brome [<a href="#88">88</a>].

Various small animals including rodents and geese graze California brome
foliage, and the seeds furnish food for many bird and rodent species
[<a href="#79">79</a>].

Although California brome coverage was minor (1.2%), Columbian ground
squirrel on subalpine sites on the Payette National Forest of Idaho
comsumed four times more California brome than any other graminoid [<a href="#50">50</a>].

California brome and cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) provided from 3 to 38
percent (average 17.3%) of the summer and fall diets of western pocket
gopher in south-central Oregon.  The bromes comprised less than 1
percent of total vegetation cover [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
California brome is palatable to all classes of livestock throughout the
growing season.  Plants become fibrous at maturity but livestock readily
graze the ripe seedheads.  Domestic sheep have shown rapid weight gain
on ranges with an abundance of ripe California brome seedheads [<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].

Sampson [<a href="#67">67</a>] rated California brome's overall palatability as "high."
Stubbendieck and others [<a href="#79">79</a>] rated its patalability as excellent for
cattle, horses, and elk and good for deer and domestic sheep.
Palatability in several western states has been rated as follows [<a href="#20">20</a>]:

Waterfowl             ----    poor     poor   


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
California brome is useful for revegetating disturbed sites due to rapid
establishment and good soil stabilizing capability [<a href="#73">73</a>].  It has proved
effective for stabilizing watersheds [<a href="#77">77</a>].  In the Intermountain West,
it is recommended for revegetating mid- to high-elevation sites [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].

California brome seed is available commercially [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>].  `Bromar'
is a fast-growing, palatable cultivar recommended for revegetating
high-elevation sites [<a href="#27">27</a>].  `Cucamonga brome' is a cultivar from
California grassland stock. It was one of several native California
prairie grasses that established well on annual grassland [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Seeding
rate recommendations for western rangelands are available [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].

In Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, seeded California brome showed
differential establishment on abandoned roads with various site
treatments.  Seedling establishment was best with addition of topsoil
followed by fertilizing, ripping, seeding, and mulching.  Establishment
was worst with seeding only.  With each treatment, sowing with native
seed resulted in better California brome coverage than sowing with
commercial seed [<a href="#15">15</a>].

California brome and seaside brome have been successfully established on
waterfront sites of the San Franscisco Bay Area [<a href="#43">43</a>].  


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
California brome does not respond to most herbicides.  Trifluralin has
shown fair control [<a href="#11">11</a>].

California brome is reduced by heavy grazing [<a href="#79">79</a>].  It may be favored by
light to moderate grazing.  In a dry mountain meadow in north-central
Idaho, it was less abundant inside an exclosure than outside the
exclosure, where continuous light cattle grazing occurred [l53].
Mueggler [<a href="#57">57</a>] found that California brome on the Gallatin Game Preserve
of Montana showed better herbage and flowerstalk production on clipped
plots than on unclipped control plots for the first 2 years of monthly
clipping during the growing season.  Production on clipped plots dropped
below production on control plots, however, in the third year.  Mueggler
attributed increased productivity of California brome in the first 2
years of clipping to release from competition from forbs, which
responded poorly to clipping.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Bromus carinatus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
California brome is a cool-season perennial bunchgrass.  It is a mid- to
tall grass; the erect culms are 1 to 4 feet (0.3-1.2 m) high at maturity
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>].  The inflorescence is an open panicle, 4 to 12 inches
(10-30.5 cm) long, with erect to spreading branches.  Lemmas have short
awns, about 0.2 to 0.3 inch (5-7 mm) in length [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>].  Roots are deep
and wide-spreading.  California brome seedlings grown on gravelly clay
with a subsoil of clay had a horizontal root spread of 28 inches (70 cm)
and a vertical root spread of 28 inches (70 cm) at the end of the first
growing season [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Life span of California brome is about 3 to 5 years [<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
California brome reproduces by seed and by tillering [<a href="#79">79</a>].  It is both
self-pollinating and outcrossing [<a href="#55">55</a>]; self-pollination is more common
than outcrossing [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Harlan [<a href="#29">29</a>] found that California brome
collected from various locations in California was facultatively
cleistogamous.  In the greenhouse, both open-pollinating and
cleistogamous florets were produced on the same plant when soil was dry
during flower development.  Plants produced only open-pollinating
florets when soil was moist during flower development.  Both
open-pollinating and cleistogamous florets are commonly found on the
same plant in California fields [<a href="#35">35</a>].

Germinative capacity of fresh California brome seed is 85 to 90 percent
under laboratory conditions.  It is widely reported that seeds require
fluctuating temperatures and light to germinate [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>].  Plummer,
however, [<a href="#63">63</a>] found that either constant temperature of 85 degrees
Fahrenheit (30 deg C) or room temperature resulted in germination rates
comparable to those obtained with fluctuating temperatures.

It is unclear whether long-term seedbanking is an important regeneration
strategy for California brome.  Steele [<a href="#75">75</a>] stated that most California
brome seedlings in northern Idaho establish from seed shattered the
previous fall.  Fulbright [<a href="#24">24</a>] reported that California brome seed is
viable for only 3 to 4 years.  Viability may be longer, however.  On a
remnant valley grassland-coastal prairie mosaic in San Francisco,
California, native species were planted and exotics were controlled by
clipping.  Although California brome was not among the native species
planted, California brome seedlings appeared after the restoration
treatment.  Since California brome had been absent from the site for at
least 15 years, Pitschel [<a href="#62">62</a>] thought it most likely established from
soil-stored seed.

Seedlings attain height and root biomass rapidly [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>].
Twenty-eight days after emergence in the greenhouse, California brome
seedlings averaged 61 roots each with an average total root length of
11.2 inches (28 cm).  Shoot length 28 days after emergence averaged 2.8
inches (7 cm) [<a href="#63">63</a>].  California brome often produces seed in its first
growing season [<a href="#86">86</a>], although it may not reproduce until 2 or 3 years of
age on some sites [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
California brome occurs on mountain slopes, ridgetops, valleys, meadows,
and waste places.  It is adapted to moderately moist to dry soils [<a href="#79">79</a>],
and is most common in areas receiving 16 to 30 inches (410-760 mm) of
annual precipitation [<a href="#73">73</a>].  In the West, it is more common in dry
cordilleran regions than in the Pacific Northwest.  In British Columbia,
occurrence increases with increasing temperature and continentality and
decreases with increasing precipitation [<a href="#46">46</a>].  California brome is
reported from a broad spectrum of moisture regimes, however.  In
Redwoods National Park, California, California brome occurs on sites
varying from dry slopes and rock outcrops to stream channels [<a href="#80">80</a>].  In
Arizona, it occurs on moist mountain meadows but also occurs on dry
hills [<a href="#45">45</a>].

California brome grows in all soil textures.  Best growth is attained on
medium-textured or loamy soils [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>].  California brome tolerates
soils in the pH range of 5.5 to 8.0 [<a href="#73">73</a>].

Elevational ranges of California brome are as follows:

Arizona - 5,500 to 9,500 feet (1,650-2,850 m) [<a href="#45">45</a>]
California - sea level to 10,000 feet (3,000 m) [<a href="#67">67</a>]
Colorado - 5,000 to 11,000 feet (1,500-3,300 m) [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>]
Utah - 3,036 to 10,560 feet (920-3,200 m) [<a href="#86">86</a>]


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
California brome occurs in early seres in forested communities
[<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>] and in all stages of succession in shrub steppe and grassland
communities [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  It requires nearly full to full sunlight
[<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>].

California brome pioneered on mud flows on the slope of Mount St. Helens
in the first 4 years after the 1980 eruption [<a href="#19">19</a>].

Numerous studies report California brome in secondary succession.  It
was a component of the initial postfire community following
stand-replacing fire in twoneedle pinyon-Utah juniper (Pinus
edulis-Juniperus osteosperma) in Mese Verde National Park, Colorado
[<a href="#22">22</a>].  Hann [<a href="#28">28</a>] listed California brome as a component of the pinegrass
(Calamagrostis rubescens) early phase of the Douglas-fir/twinflower
(Pseudotsuga menziesii/Linnaea borealis) habitat type of western
Montana.  In mountain big sagebrush/elk sedge habitat types of southern
Idaho, California brome replaces elk sedge on disturbed soils or when
elk sedge fails to regenerate [<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Growth begins in early spring [<a href="#79">79</a>], with most growth occurring in early
summer [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Fruits mature in mid- to late summer [<a href="#24">24</a>].  In California,
seeds ripen in May and June at low elevations; at high elevations, seeds
ripen and are cast by late August [<a href="#67">67</a>].

Phenological development of California brome in the Wasatch Mountains of
northern Utah ranged as follows from 1925 to 1934 [<a href="#14">14</a>].

</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Information regarding the fire ecology of California brome is scant.
Based upon the few data available, fire appears to have little long-term
effect on California brome.  Coverage of California brome is slightly
reduced from prefire levels for several years after fire, then returns
to approximate prefire levels [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Bromus carinatus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
California brome is top-killed by fire.  In the Pacific Northwest, it
routinely survives fall burning of pastureland and sprouts from
surviving root crowns the next growing season [<a href="#89">89</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
California brome appears to recover from fire within a few years.  It
was one of three grasses to establish in the first 2 years after
stand-replacing wildfire in twoneedle pinyon-Utah juniper woodland in
Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Recovery of California brome seems to be similar after both early- and
late-season burning.  Data on effects of summer burning are not
available.  Neither spring nor fall prescibed fire after logging had
much effect on California brome cover in northern Idaho.  After
shelterwood cutting in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest on the
Priest River Experimental Forest, two prescribed fires were set to
reduce fuels:  a June 1, 1989, fire on moist duff (moist burn), and a
September 13 and 14, 1989, fire on dry duff (dry burn).  California
brome percentage cover a year before logging and at postfire year 1 was
as follows [<a href="#71">71</a>]:

Control (no burn)         Moist Burn             Dry Burn
------------------    ------------------     ------------------
prefire | postfire    prefire | postfire     prefire | postfire
--------|---------    --------|---------     --------|---------
  0.7   |   1.4         0.4   |   1.6          0.3   |   0.3

Similarly, early fall prescribed burning in pure quaking aspen and mixed
quaking aspen-conifer forests had little effect on California brome.  In
mixed forests on the Caribou National Forest of Idaho and the
Bridger-Teton National Forest of Wyoming, California brome was
categorized as providing 5 percent or less cover on both burned and
unburned plots at postfire years 1 and 2.  In pure quaking aspen on the
Caribou and Bridger-Teton National Forests, California brome was
categorized as providing from 6 to 25 percent cover on burned and
control plots at postfire years 1 and 2 [<a href="#9">9</a>].

California brome was significantly reduced (p = 0.05) for at least 1
year by spring prescribed fire in southwestern Montana.  Average basal
cover of California brome in the first postfire growing season was 0.55
sq dm/sq dm on burned plots and 0.72 sq dm/sq dm on unburned plots [<a href="#60">60</a>].
                         
Season of burning affected California brome dominance on the Helena
National Forest of Montana.  A year after fall prescribed fire in a
mountain big sagebrush/Kentucky bluegrass community, California brome
was codominant with Kentucky bluegrass.  After spring prescribed fire
in the same community, dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) was codominant
with Kentucky bluegrass [<a href="#69">69</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Postfire seeding:  California brome is sometimes seeded in after fire
and often establishes good cover.  It can help stabilize soil after fire
but may preclude establishment of other species including conifers
[<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>].  Steele and Geier-Hayes [<a href="#75">75</a>] stated that seeding was not
necessary on conifer/pinegrass types where good pinegrass cover was
present before fire.

California brome developed good coverage following postfire seeding on
two Douglas-fir/ninebark (Physocarpus malvaceus) habitat types in
central Idaho.  In northern Idaho, California brome coverage on several
seeded burn sites varied from "vigorous" to "poor."  Fall seedings
resulted in better grass coverage than spring seedings [<a href="#72">72</a>].  Fall
seeding on prescribed burned ponderosa pine sites in north-central
Washington resulted in good California brome coverage [<a href="#85">85</a>].

Prescribed fire in quaking aspen/California brome:  Bradley and others
[<a href="#6">6</a>] describe a quaking aspen/California brome community type that
appears to be maintained by long-term grazing.  Fire is difficult to
sustain in this type due to discontinuity of fuels.  Rate of spread may
be one-tenth that of ungrazed stands.  Quaking aspen/grass types will
not sustain fire spread unless flame lengths are 1 to 1.5 feet (0.3-0.5
m), which requires at least 50 percent cured herbaceous vegetation [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Brown and others [<a href="#8">8</a>] found that time of year was a simple, reliable
indicator of moisture content of herbaceous fuels, including California
brome, in quaking aspen understories.  In a quaking aspen/western
coneflower (Rudbeckia occidentalis) community type on the Bridger-Teton
National Forest, Wyoming, perennial grasses in the understory cured at a
slow, steady rate beginning early in the growing season.  Dominant
understory grasses measured for seasonal change in moisture content
included California brome, blue wildrye (Elymus glaucus), and slender
wheatgrass.  Gradual curing of perennial grasses occured in both 1981, a
dry summer, and 1982, a wet summer.  Moisture content of grasses
corresponded "reasonably well" to the National Fire Danger Rating System
(NFDRS) [<a href="#18">18</a>] during mid- to late summer.  In contrast, forb moisture
content decreased slowly in early summer, then accelerated rapidly.
Forb moisture content related poorly to the NFDRS, fluctuating through a
much greater range of moisture contents than allowed by the NFDRS model
[<a href="#8">8</a>].

Prescribed fire in sagebrush/California brome:  Fire spread may be
difficult to obtain in mountain big sagebrush/California brome or other
mountain big sagebrush/grass types due to wide spacing of shrubs and
mesic conditions [<a href="#36">36</a>].
