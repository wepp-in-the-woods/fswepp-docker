<b>ABBREVIATION : </b>
RHOMAC

<b>SYNONYMS : </b>
   Rhododendron californicum
   Hymenanthes macrophyllum


<b>SCS PLANT CODE : </b>
   RHMA3


<b>COMMON NAMES : </b>
   Pacific rhododendron

   California rosebay
   Pacific rhodendron


<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of Pacific rhododendron is
Rhododendron macrophyllum D. Don ex G. Don [<a href="#32">32</a>].  There is a
white-flowered form, album, in addition to the more typical
pink-flowered form, macrophyllum [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

Since the genus has close to 1,000 species, it has been subdivided.  The
first subdivision is into two large groups: Lepidote with scales on
branchlets, leaves and flowers, and Elepidote without scales.  These
groups do not hybridize naturally and most attempts to create hybrids
have been unsuccessful [<a href="#35">35</a>].  These groups are divided into 23 Lepidote
series and 20 Elepidote series, each named by a representative species.
Pacific rhododendron is an Elepidote rhododendron and a member of the
Ponticum series and subseries [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rhododendron macrophyllum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Pacific rhododendron is one of the shrubs eaten by mountain beaver in
the Coast Range [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Common rhododendron (Rhododendron ponticum), a
closely related species, is poisonous to sheep [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Pacific
rhododendron may also be poisonous to sheep [<a href="#52">52</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Pacific rhododendron may provide good thermal and hiding cover for big
game animals [<a href="#28">28</a>].  However, thickets can be difficult for the animals
to enter [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Presumably, Pacific rhododendron provides cover for
smaller animals also.


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Pacific rhododendron offers erosion protection on steep watersheds [<a href="#42">42</a>].
It is propagated by cuttings, by layering, and from seed [<a href="#21">21</a>].
Air-dried seeds will remain viable for 30 months when stored at 20
degrees F (-7 deg C) [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Germination and early growth are good in
shaded, moist mineral soil [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Detailed information on cultivation of
Pacific rhododendron is available [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Pacific rhododendron is the state flower of Washington.  Kitsap
Peninsula residents host an annual weeklong Rhododendron Festival during
spring bloom [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Pacific rhododendron is not as widely cultivated as
the showier Rhododendron hybrids, but it is used as an ornamental in
backgrounds or native gardens and naturalized woodlands [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Native
plants like Pacific rhododendron have potential value for low-water-use
landscaping [<a href="#60">60</a>].  Both white and pink forms are commercially available
[<a href="#35">35</a>].  Growing Pacific rhododendron in partial shade to full sun and
debudding or pruning encourage compact growth and bloom [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Wild
plants are legally protected from digging [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Pacific rhododendron often indicates low soil nitrogen content.  On
sites where it is dominant, care should be taken to protect the soil
from damage from heavy equipment or fire during logging [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].
Conifer planting can be difficult on sites that had dense Pacific
rhododendron cover before treatment because of the residual roots.
Removing the overstory may stimulate the growth of Pacific rhododendron
and other shrubs [<a href="#22">22</a>].  If the soil is undisturbed during treatment, it
resprouts rapidly [<a href="#19">19</a>].

If control is necessary, spraying the foliage in spring with triclopyr
ester gives fair to good control [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rhododendron macrophyllum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Pacific rhododendron is an evergreen shrub, normally 6 to 12 feet
(1.8-3.7 m) tall at maturity with leaves 3 to 6 inches (7-15 cm) long
and 1.2 to 2.7 inches (3-7 cm) wide [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  The flowers are light to
rose pink and borne in terminal clusters (racemes) of 20 or more [<a href="#50">50</a>].
Shaded plants have elongated branches and may resemble small trees,
while plants growing in the open form compact, dense bushes [<a href="#33">33</a>].
Pacific rhododendron's mature leaves, like leaves of other rhododendrons
in the Ponticum series, have a soft leathery texture and no hairs,
trichomes, or other covering [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Pacific rhododendron is not as
cold-hardy as other members of the series [<a href="#46">46</a>].

Pacific rhododendron has shallow roots [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Good aeration is important
for rhododendron roots which often will grow deep into loamy soils [<a href="#35">35</a>].
Two studies of Pacific rhododendron in northwestern Washington and
northern California describe a large, tuberlike rootcrown growing just
under the soil surface with fine, fibrous roots extending into the soil
[<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  Most rhododendrons have a characteristic type of mycorrhiza
that promotes nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor environments and may
provide resistance to heavy metal damage [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Since Pacific
rhododendron grows well on nutrient-poor sites [<a href="#28">28</a>], this mycorrhizal
relationship seems probable.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
The flowers are pollinated by bees and plants begin to bear seed when
they are 5 years old [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  The fruit is a dry, rusty-brown,
pubescent capsule that divides into five parts by splitting lengthwise
to release the numerous, minute seeds [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  The seeds, including the
wing, are less than 0.1 inch (3 mm) long [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Pacific rhododendron
seeds germinate without stratification and are viable for up to 2 years.
The seeds require light for germination [<a href="#42">42</a>].
 
If aboveground portions are killed, Pacific rhododendron can regenerate
vegetatively by sprouting from stem bases and from the rootcrown [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Pacific rhododendron is found in coastal to low montane conifer forests
on soils that are moist but well drained and frequently shallow
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  Many western Oregon sites with Pacific rhododendron as a
dominant have soils with low levels of available nitrogen [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].
Pacific rhododendron grows in several Pacific Northwest forest zones
[<a href="#15">15</a>].
   
The Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) zone forms a narrow band along the
coast.  In this uniformly wet and frequently foggy area, Pacific
rhododendron is often found on less favorable sites [<a href="#15">15</a>].  On old sand
dunes and steep slopes facing the ocean Pacific rhododendron forms
thickets with salal (Gaultheria shallon) and evergreen huckleberry
(Vaccinium ovatum) [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  At the southern end of this zone and
extending into northern California, Pacific rhododendron is a dominant
under coastal redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) and tanoak (Lithocarpus
densiflorus) on soils formed from sandy coastal plain deposits
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  It is part of the understory of northern California's pygmy
conifer forests on severely podzolized soils formed from similar
deposits [<a href="#55">55</a>].
 
While the western hemlock zone is wet and mild, summer drought and
temperature extremes are more common than in the Sitka spruce zone.
Pacific rhododendron is found on intermediate mesic sites in this zone
along the coast [<a href="#15">15</a>].  In this zone in the northern Cascades Pacific
rhododendron is most dominant on cooler, dry to mesic sites [<a href="#22">22</a>].  In
the central Cascades it can be found on most types of sites within the
western hemlock zone, although it dominates on warmer and drier sites
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  In this zone in the southern Siuslaw National Forest of the
Coast ranges, Pacific rhododendron is often a dominant on south-facing
slopes and lower elevation ridges with thin soils [<a href="#27">27</a>].  In the western
hemlock subzone where Port-Orford-cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana) is a
dominant, communities containing Pacific rhododendron are typically on
better drained soils [<a href="#24">24</a>].  It is often found under mesic
Port-Orford-cedar - Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests on the
west slope of the Siskiyou Mountains at low to middle elevations on
diorite parent materials [<a href="#56">56</a>].

In the higher, wetter and cooler mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana)
and silver fir (Abies amabilis) zones, Pacific rhododendron is an
understory dominant on relatively warm, dry soils at lower elevations
within the type [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].

In the mixed-conifer zone Pacific rhododendron is found on the moistest
sites at mid-elevations in the southern Cascade and eastern Siskiyou
Mountains.  Average temperatures in this zone are similar to those in
the western hemlock zone but the summers are warmer and drier [<a href="#15">15</a>].  In
the South Umpqua Basin of the southern Cascades in Oregon, Pacific
rhododendron is a good indicator of high soil moisture [<a href="#37">37</a>].  It occurs
on cool, moist sites with soils averaging 40 inches (101.6 cm) deep in
the Siskiyou Mountains [<a href="#1">1</a>].  On the east side of the Siskiyous, it grows
with Douglas-fir where site conditions are most similar to coastal
conditions.  It is at its environmental limit on these sites and does
not extend to drier sites [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Elevational ranges in some western regions are [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>]:

                     Minimum                   Maximum

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>

<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Throughout its range, Pacific rhododendron blooms between April and July
[<a href="#30">30</a>].  In southern, coastal Oregon, Pacific rhododendron blooms from
April to May [<a href="#42">42</a>].  The fruit ripens in August and September and is
dispersed during the late summer and fall [<a href="#42">42</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Pacific rhododendron grows in moist Pacific Coast forests where,
historically, major fires were infrequent and more frequent surface
fires burned small areas [<a href="#57">57</a>].  The main fire adaptation of Pacific
rhododendron is its ability to resprout from a shallow, tuberlike
rootcrown [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rhododendron macrophyllum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Pacific rhododendron appears to be top-killed by most fires.  The
shallow rootcrown could be heat-killed during severe fires, thus killing
the entire plant.  Low severity fires may allow the survival of basal
stem buds, accounting for observations of its increased survival
following such fires [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Following fire, Pacific rhododendron sprouts from stem bases or
rootcrowns and new seedlings may establish [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].  There is a marked
decrease in cover and frequency immediately after fire followed by a
slow, gradual increase [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  In the western Cascade Mountains
of Oregon, Pacific rhododendron is a residual species following light
fires but very scarce after more severe fires [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Nevertheless in
this area, evidence of past fires is shown by brushfields that include
Pacific rhododendron [<a href="#53">53</a>].  In Asia rhododendron seedlings rapidly
colonize open areas after fire [<a href="#35">35</a>] and Pacific rhododendron's tiny,
winged seeds might allow expansion from surviving plants.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Several studies that have used permanent plots to follow vegatation
changes after logging and burning in Oregon and Washington demonstrate
that Pacific rhododendron is fire-sensitive.  Two studies following
slash burning compared burned and unburned plots.  In the first study,
most plots were burned lightly or moderately by fall fires.  Samples
taken during the first 16 years after slash burning show Pacific
rhododendron to be dominant on twice as many unburned plots as burned
plots.  Where it did attain significant cover on burned plots, Pacific
rhododendron had resprouted by the second season after fire [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  A
second study found cover of Pacific rhododendron to be 30.5 percent on
unburned plots and 4.9 percent on burned plots 11 to 16 years following
fire [<a href="#49">49</a>].

Results of another postfire study demonstrated a slow increase in
frequency of Pacific rhododendron from the first to the fifth and sixth
growing seasons [<a href="#58">58</a>].  A comparison of old-growth western hemlock -
Douglas-fir stands with 2- to 40-year-old stands found mean cover values
of Pacific rhododendron decreased from 13 percent to 0.4 percent 2 years
after broadcast burning and gradually increased to 6.8 percent at 40
years [<a href="#48">48</a>].  Early recovery of Pacific rhododendron on three clearcuts
that were treated with medium-intensity fall fires was as follows [<a href="#11">11</a>]:

                                  Cover (%)      Frequency (%)

Before logging:                   8.5            29.5
Year 1 after logging:             1.0            18.0
Year 1 after slash fire:          0.2            13.1
Year 2 after slash fire:          0.8            11.5
Year 5 after slash fire:          1.8            14.8


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Since Pacific rhododendron is reduced by fire [<a href="#20">20</a>], burning after
logging results in better conifer stocking [<a href="#57">57</a>].  However, communities
with Pacific rhododendron as a dominant are frequently on infertile
soils that are sensitive to the effects of fire [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Moderate to
hot slash fires can cause damage to these soils and loss of nutrients,
especially nitrogen [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].
