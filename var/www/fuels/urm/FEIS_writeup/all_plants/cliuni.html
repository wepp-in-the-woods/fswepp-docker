<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Queencup beadlily occurs within many habitat type series.  In Montana
and Idaho, these include the spruce (Picea), grand fir (Abies grandis),
subalpine fir (A. lasiocarpa), mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), and
western red cedar (Thuja plicata) series.  Typical phases associated
with queencup beadlily habitat types include menziesia (Menziesia
ferruginea), beargrass (Xerophyllum tenax), and queencup beadlily.  In
Montana, queencup beadlily is an indicator of more maritime microsites.
In northern and central Idaho, however, it is an indicator of more mesic
microsites [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Clintonia uniflora
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
No information is available concerning the specific use of queencup
beadlily by livestock or wildlife.  The forage potential is basically
fair in early seral habitat types which include queencup beadlily as an
understory associate.  As these sites mature, however, the forage
potential becomes poor to nonexistent in late-seral to near-climax
stands with closed canopies [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Low forage quality and
abundance indicate that mature stands that include queencup beadlily are
nonrange for livestock [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The fruit of queencup beadlily is often eaten by small mammals and
birds.  Birds in southeastern Washington chose it as food more than
other species; this preference may be based on the amount of fresh pulp
contained in the fruit [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Elk in central Idaho forage on queencup
beadlily leaves, but the palatability is rated low [<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Nutritional quality of queencup beadlily fruits from the Rainbow Creek
Research Natural Area, southeastern Washington, was as follows [<a href="#26">26</a>]:

                   Mean           Standard Error

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Queencup beadlily is not transplanted for site recovery projects.  It
has low resistance to human trampling but also exhibits high short-term
resilience to disturbance.  Visitor-use disturbance to queencup
beadlily, as well as its recovery rate, can be predicted [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Queencup beadlily is not specifically managed.  The associated
overstory, however, is usually highly productive [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Partial
cutting on these sites generally leads to marked seral shrub and forb
increase.  Queencup beadlily has been observed to grow larger and
possess more root biomass in open sun than in shade (35% open sun) [<a href="#25">25</a>].
Conversely, it has been reported to decrease in percent cover from uncut
sites to cut sites [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  This may indicate that queencup beadlily
is prone to injury from logging, intolerant to excessive sunlight, or
sensitive to change in soil moisture.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Clintonia uniflora
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Queencup beadlily is a small, perennial, rhizomatus forb, with a single
white flower about 1 inch (2 cm) long.  Following pollination, a
solitary, smooth, blue berry approximately 0.25 to 0.40 inch (6-10 mm)
long forms on the stem.  The plant has two or three shiny-green basal
leaves which are broad and flat, and about 3 to 6 inches (7-15 cm) long.
Both the stem and leaves are clothed with fine white epidermal hairs
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

Means and ranges of queencup beadlily morphological characteristics are
as follows [<a href="#2">2</a>]:

<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Queencup beadlily generally reproduces through rhizomes located 1.2 to
2.4 inches (3-6 cm) below the soil surface.  In a laboratory study
analyzing germination rates from seeds collected in the fall, queencup
beadlily germinated approximately 250 days after sowing and continued to
germinate steadily for 375 days.  In early fall it germinated faster
(approximately 100 days) and peaked quicker (approximately 140 days)
[<a href="#25">25</a>].

Morphological characteristics of queencup beadlily fruit from the
Rainbow Creek Research Natural Area, southeastern Washington, are as
follows [<a href="#26">26</a>]:

<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Queencup beadlily occupies moist, coniferous forest areas on high
slopes, benches, and stream terraces.  The elevational distribution of
queencup beadlily ranges from 2,000 to 6,100 feet (555-1,860 m)
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  It tends to occur on warm, moist sites, although it can be
found on all aspects.

Soils:  Queencup beadlily occurs on a variety of soil types ranging from
silty clay loams, loams, to gravelly loams.  Parent materials generally
include granite, quartz, and other noncalcareous substrates.  Volcanic
ash seems to be widely present in the upper soil horizons of most
queencup beadlily habitat types [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Soil pH usually ranges from 5.5
to 6.5.


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Climax Species

Queencup beadlily is an understory indicator species primarily found in
mature forests [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Its understory associates mostly include
twinflower (Linnaea borealis), bunchberry dogwood (Cornus canadensis),
and wintergreen (Pyrola spp.) [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Queencup beadlily is often a
dominant understory species, making it a dependable habitat type
indicator.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Phenological observations for queencup beadlily in northern Idaho and
west of the Continental Divide in Montana from 1928 to 1937 were as
follows [<a href="#28">28</a>]:

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Stickney [<a href="#30">30</a>] listed queencup beadlily as an on-site survivor following
fire.  It sprouts from rhizomes buried approximately 1.5 inches (4 cm)
in the soil [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Clintonia uniflora
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Queencup beadlily is typically top-killed by fire.  High-severity fires
may lead to the total destruction of the plant.  Miller and Miller [<a href="#21">21</a>]
reported it to be absent from sample sites during 4 years of study
following wildfires in North Cascades National Park, Washington.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Although no information is available for queencup beadlily specifically,
it usually decreases following fire.  The postfire environment is not
thought to be suitable for rapid recovery of queencup beadlily [<a href="#9">9</a>].  A
queencup beadlily ecosystem in British Columbia steadily increased in
percent cover following fire, leveling off about 9 years after the burn
[<a href="#13">13</a>].
