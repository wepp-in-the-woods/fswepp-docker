<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Agastache cusickii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Cusick's giant hyssop is found in the Steens Mountains of southeast
Oregon; the Santa Rosa, White Pine, and Toiyabe mountains of north and
central Nevada; and the Tendoy Mountains in southwest Montana.  It is
also found in numerous locations in central Idaho [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].  In addition,
populations are reported from other mountain ranges in Nevada [<a href="#10">10</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Agastache cusickii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Cusick's giant hyssop is a dwarf perennial forb, usually 4 to 8 inches
(10-20 cm) tall with a spiked inflorescence.  Numerous simple or
branched stems arise from a woody taproot and branching caudex.  Leaves
are mostly 0.4 to 1.0 inch (1-2.5 cm) long and are finely puberulent.
The fruits are nutlets [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Cusick's giant hyssop is found on dry, rocky sites, and often on talus
slopes.  It occurs at mid- to upper elevations in mountains (7,590 to
10,560 feet [2,300-3,200 m]) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].

Mid- to high elevation sites in the Santa Rosa and Toiyabe ranges in
Nevada are occupied by scattered limber pine (Pinus flexis) and
pinyon-juniper woodlands at the lower elevational limits of Cusick's
giant hyssop.  On Steens Mountain, Oregon, Cusick's giant hyssop may be
associated with western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis), curlleaf
mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius), quaking aspen (Populus
tremuloides), or high-elevation sagebrush-grasslands [<a href="#1">1</a>].  In the Tendoy
Mountains, Montana, Cusick's giant hyssop is common on limestone talus
with mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) and Indian ricegrass
(Oryzopsis hymenoides) [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Cusick's giant hyssop flowers from June to August [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Agastache cusickii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Cusick's giant hyssop often inhabits talus slopes that are not generally
susceptible to fire.  It may sprout from the caudex following
disturbance.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Caudex, growing points in soil

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Specific information on the effect of fire on Cusick's giant hyssop is
not available in the literature.  However, aboveground parts of
nettleleaf giant hyssop (Agastache urticfolia) were completely consumed
by late summer and fall fires in the Great Basin Rate of Spread Study,
which was conducted in Nevada [<a href="#13">13</a>].
 


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>

<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Specific information on the response of Cusick's giant hyssop to fire is
not available in the literature.  Nettleleaf giant hyssop sprouted in
the first postfire year following late summer and fall fires in Nevada
[<a href="#13">13</a>].
