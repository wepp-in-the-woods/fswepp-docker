<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Fagus grandifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Beech wood is used to make flooring, furniture, veneer plywood, and
railroad ties.  It is especially favored as fuel wood because of its
high density and good burning qualities.  Coal tar made from beech wood
is used to protect wood from rotting.  The creosote made from beech wood
is used to treat various human and animal disorders [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Beech mast is eaten by a variety of birds and mammals, including mice,
squirrels, chipmunks, blackbear, deer, foxes, ruffed grouse, ducks, and
bluejays [<a href="#41">41</a>].





<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Beech is regarded as a poor deer browse.  THe frequency of its use in
some areas is due to the low availability of more preferable browse [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
American beech provides cover for the Carolina chicadee (Parus
carolinensis) and the black-capped chickadee (Parus atricapillus) [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Beech grows relatively slowly and has a low tolerance to fire.  Its
value as a colonizer is limited [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Beechnuts are roasted and eaten or used a coffee substitute.  The leaves
and bark are used to make dyes [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Even-aged silviculture adversely affects beech production and favors
production of associated hardwoods.  Beech seedlings may be overtopped
in clearcuts by less shade-tolerant species such as birches (Betula
spp.) and oaks, which respond vigorously to increased light.  Repeated
clearcutting at short intervals may eliminate beech.  Shelterwood cuts
allow beech to develop with little competition from more intolerant
species [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].

Beech is seriously affected by beech bark disease.  The saddled is its
most serious defoliater, and the forest tent caterpillar, gypsy moth,
fall cankerworm ruce spanworm (Operophtera bruceata) occasionally cause
heavy damage [<a href="#41">41</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Fagus grandifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Beech is a large, native, deciduous tree.  It normally grows 65 to 80
feet (20-25 m) tall but can can grow up to 130 feett (40 m) and can live
to over 300 years old.  The bark is blue gray.  The leaves are yellow
green during the growing season.  The branches are stout and horizontal,
or ascending, with interlocking leaves forming a dense crown.  The root
system is shallow and spreading.  The fruit is a bur, usually containing
two nuts [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte
   

<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction:  Beech begin producing seed when 40 years old and
by 60 years old may produce large quantities.  Beech produces seed at 2-
to 8-year intervals.  Beech seeds average about 1,600 per pound
(3,500/kg) [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Most seeds drop to the ground.  A few are carried by
rodents but dispersal is limited.  Bluejays may transport seeds several
kilometers [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Most of the seeds will germinate in the 1st year; after
that, the seeds lose viability [<a href="#41">41</a>].

Beech seeds germinate from early spring to early summer.  Chilling is
required to break dormancy.  Germination is good on mineral soil or
leafy litter, but poor on excessively wet sites.  Seedlings grow best
under a moderate canopy or in protected small openings where the soil
does not dry out below the depth of the shallow roots [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Vegetative Reproduction:  Beech can regenerate by root suckers or by
stump sprouts [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Sprouts may develop on the trunk of a tree
immediately below a wound and from the top of stumps.  Adventitious buds
develop in callus tissue of the cambial layers of stumps.  Sprouts can
also develop from the exposure of the roots to air or elevated
temperatures.  Sometimes root sprouts develop when no apparent injury
has occurred [<a href="#14">14</a>].

The advance of beech bark disease, with its resultant mortality of
overstory beech stems, is likely to result in an increase in root
suckering [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Beech is more likely to develop by sprouting than by
seedling establishment [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Beech is found at low elevations in the North and relatively high
elevations in the South.  Local soil and climatic factors probably
determine whether beech grows at the higher elevations.  In the
Adirondack Mountains, low temperatures and wind keep beech below 3,200
feet (975 m) in contrast to the Appalachian Mountains where on the
warmer slopes it grows at elevations up to 6,000 (1,830 m) feet.  At
altitudes in the middle of its range, beech is more abundant on the
cooler, moister, northern slopes than on the southern slopes [<a href="#41">41</a>].

Beech is usually found within two principal soil groups:  the gray
podzolic (Hapludalf) and the laterite (Acrothox) and is prevalent on
podzols.  It is seldom found on limestone soils except in the western
edge of its range.  Beech populations are higher on coarse textured, dry
to mesic soils in the northern part of its range [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
American beech is a climax species that grows slowly underneath an
overstory of conifers or hardwoods.  Beech grows faster in canopy
openings and eventually ascends into the overstory [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].  In an
old-growth forest in New Hampshire, beech replaced yellow birch and
sugar maple and then was able to maintain itself via root suckering
[<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Flowering occurs from March to May.  Fruiting occurs from September to
October.  Seeds are released in October or November after frost [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Fagus grandifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Thin bark renders American beech highly vulnerable to injury by fire.  Postfire
colonization is through root suckering [<a href="#39">39</a>].

When fire is absent or of low frequency, beech frequently becomes a
dominant species in mixed deciduous forests [<a href="#5">5</a>].  The transition from an
open fire-dominated forest to a closed canopy deciduous forest favors
the beech-magnolia type in the southern portion of beech's range [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex
   survivor species; on-site survivng rhizomes
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by animals or water; postfire yr 1&2

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Fagus grandifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire  usually top-kills American beech. Mortality of young trees is related to fire severity:  Cool fires kill 40 to 50 percent
of the seedlings and saplings[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
Fire wounds may serve as entrance courts for a host of decaying fungi
[<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Beech trees that survive a fire regenerate by root suckering or stump
sprouting [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fire could create favorable conditions for beech production.  Fire could
reduce the litter and humus layer, expose roots, or injure the parent
tree, creating conditions for the production of sucker shoots [<a href="#39">39</a>].
