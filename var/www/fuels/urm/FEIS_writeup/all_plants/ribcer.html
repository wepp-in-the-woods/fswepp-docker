mountain shrub communities.

In addition to the plant associations and cover types listed in
preceding slots, wax currant occurs in the Bebb willow (Salix bebbiana)
community type in the northwestern third of New Mexico [<a href="#42">42</a>].  In the
Siskiyou and Cascade ranges and the Sierra Nevada, wax currant occurs
with Baker's cypress (Cupressus bakeri) at several disjunct locations
[<a href="#13">13</a>].

Species commonly associated with wax currant but not previously
mentioned include sugar pine (P.  lambertiana), Washoe pine (P.
washoensis) [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>], Rocky Mountain maple (Acer glabrum), sierra

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ribes cereum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Wax currant provides food and cover for wildlife [<a href="#30">30</a>].  It is only fair
to poor browse for deer, but it is important on ranges where little else
is available [<a href="#28">28</a>].  In Oregon, pocket gophers fed on wax currant during
the dormant season (December - March).  Chickadees and other birds
consume the fruit of wax currant [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Wax current is fair to poor browse for livestock [<a href="#28">28</a>].



<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability of wax currant to livestock is rated as follows [<a href="#12">12</a>]:

                           CO        MT       UT       WY

Horses                    fair	    poor     poor     fair


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
In north-central Colorado, the new annual growth of wax currant
contained 5.6 percent crude protein.  Phosphorus and calcium
concentrations were 0.23 and 0.85 percent, respectively [<a href="#48">48</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Cover values for wax currant are as follows [<a href="#12">12</a>]:

                        CO           UT            WY

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The fruit of wax currant is used for making jam, jelly, or pie [<a href="#30">30</a>].
Some western Indian tribes used currants for making pemmican [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Wax
currant is cultivated as an ornamental [<a href="#30">30</a>].



<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Wax currant is an alternate host for white pine blister rust (Cronartium
ribicola) which infests five-needled pines [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Because of its
association with the rust, wax currant has been a target of various
eradication studies [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Efforts to eradicate Ribes spp. have been
unsuccessful and have not resulted in decreased rust infection [<a href="#49">49</a>].

In central Idaho, wax currant establishes after light ground
scarification and thrives after thorough scarificication which induces
germination and decreases the existing shrub cover [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ribes cereum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Wax currant is a native, deciduous, nonrhizomatous shrub growing from
1.65 to 4.95 feet (0.5-1.5 m) tall [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Its numerous branches are
smooth-barked. The small, orbicular, three- to five-lobed leaves are 0.2
to 1 inch (0.5-2.5 cm) long and 0.28 to 2 inches (0.7-5 cm) wide
[<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Short-stalked, tubular flowers form drooping clusters [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].
Globose berries about 0.48 inch (1.2 cm) in diameter contain numerous
seeds [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Wax currant reproduces mainly by seed.  Its ability to sprout from the
root crown is described in the literature as "weak" [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].  In
east-central Idaho, Peek and others [<a href="#51">51</a>] observed wax currant sprouting
2 years after a low-severity, prescribed fire.

Shrubs of Ribes spp. begin fruiting after 3 years [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Seeds require
scarification to germinate [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Many seeds fall beneath the parent
plant; they are also dispersed by birds and mammals.  Fallen seeds
remain viable in the soil and duff for many years [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Low-severity
fire may promote germination of soil-stored seed [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Wax currant commonly occurs on dry, open slopes, ridges, and rock
outcrops at elevations from 4,950 to 13,200 feet (1,500-4,000 m)
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].

Wax currant grows on a variety of substrates.  In Montana, wax currant
grows in soils that range from sandy to clayey [<a href="#8">8</a>].  In Baker's cypress
communities (California and Oregon), wax currant occurs on serpentine
soils or on lava flows where only a superficial layer of soil has
accumulated [<a href="#13">13</a>].  At Lava Beds National Monument in California, wax
currant grows on rocky basalt lava flows [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Climate varies throughout the range of wax currant.  Lava Beds National
Monument exhibits a modified maritime climate with warm, dry summers and
cool, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 13.6 inches (340
mm).  The daily mean high temperature in July is 80.6 degrees Fahrenheit
(27 deg C) and in January, the daily mean low temperature is 21.2
degrees Fahrenheit (-6 deg C) [<a href="#43">43</a>].  In the Cache la Poudre River
drainage in Colorado, climate is characterized by cold winters and warm
spring and summer months.  Mean annual precipitation is 14.92 inches
(373 mm).  Most of the precipitation occurs between April and September.
The mean temperature in January, the coldest month, is 26.1 degrees
Fahrenheit (-3.3 deg C), and in July the mean temperature is 69.26
degrees Fahrenheit (20.7 deg C) [<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Wax currant is shade intolerant [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Although it sometimes grows in
open coniferous forests, it occurs most often and grows most vigorously
on sites without forest canopy.

In central Idaho, wax currant is considered an early seral species
within Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) habitat types.  It is one of
the first shrubs to dominate well-scarified sites but declines when a
canopy taller than its own develops.  A few wax currant may remain
present to the midseral stage.  Wax currant shrubs having relatively
dense canopies provide favorable microsites for Douglas-fir seedlings
[<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].

In the Bitterroot Mountains of Idaho, Ribes spp. play an important role
in secondary succession.  Their roots stabilize the soil, and their
foliage may shelter fir (Abies spp.), spruce (Picea spp.), and western
white pine (Pinus monticola) seedlings [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Wax currant flowers from April to June, and the fruit ripens by August
[<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ribes cereum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Wax currant regeneration is favored by short-duration, low-severity fire
because soil-stored seed requires scarification to germinate.  Most wax
currant plants are severely damaged or killed by fire.  The ability of
wax currant to sprout after fire is described in the literature as
"weak" [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].

Germination after severe fire is described for one site containing wax
currant in the Stanislaus National Forest, California.  Except for two
or three wax currant plants, all Ribes were R. roezli.  Ribes spp.
developed more rapidly and fruited earlier on "intensely burned" areas
than in partially burned thickets [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Shrub without adventitious-bud root crown
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ribes cereum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire usually kills wax currant [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>].

In Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota, low-severity prescription
fires conducted during the spring and fall of 1979 resulted in decreases
in Ribes spp. during postfire years 1 and 2.  Weather conditions were as
follows [<a href="#3">3</a>]:

                wind speed      temperature     relative
                mi/h (km/h)     deg F (deg C)   humidity (%)

spring burn      5 (8)          57 (13.9)       32

Prefire and postfire values for Ribes spp. on experimental (burned) and
control (unburned) plots were as follows [<a href="#3">3</a>]:

                                Prefire         Postfire 1      Postfire 2

* indicates that value for control plot was significantly (p<.05)
  greater than value for experimental plot.  


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Wax currant seedlings establish after fire.  After low-severity,
prescribed fire in a California red fir (Abies magnifica) forest of
King's Canyon National Park, California, wax currant seedlings
established; there were no shrubs on the site before the fire [<a href="#23">23</a>].  In
Stanislaus National Forest, California, a large and vigorous population
of Ribes spp., including two or three wax currant plants, "promptly
developed" after a 1.5-acre, human-caused fire in August of 1936 [<a href="#32">32</a>].
In Winema National Forest, Oregon, Burton and Black [<a href="#10">10</a>] reported the
presence of wax currant in early, seral postfire vegetation dominated by
annual and perennial grasses and annual forbs.  Prefire vegetation was
characterized as a ponderosa pine/bitterbrush (Purshia
tridentata)/needlegrass (Stipa occidentalis) community.

In east-central Idaho, Peek and others [<a href="#51">51</a>] observed wax currant
sprouting 2 years after a low-severity prescribed fire.  


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In the Blacktail Hills of central Montana, the crude protein content of
wax currant twigs and foliage increased by 4.2 to 9.8 percent after
spring prescribed fires of varying fireline intensities [<a href="#22">22</a>].

In north-central Colorado, fire treatments applied with a flamegun
during the growing season decreased the production of annual growth in
wax currant for 2 years following treatment.  Treatments applied during
the dormant season had little or no effect on wax currant production
[<a href="#48">48</a>].

A wildfire burned through mixed pine-fir forests in the Sierra Nevada in
1960.  Effects of postfire treatments are described by Bock and others
[<a href="#5">5</a>].  Little or no management action took place after fire on control
plots.  On "plantation" plots, brush and dead trees were piled and
burned, Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) seedlings were planted in postfire
year 5, and herbicide was applied to kill shrubs in postfire years 11
and 12.  In postfire year 15, the plantation plots had a significantly
greater (p<0.001) number of wax currant plants than the control plots.

Shelter and food for wildlife and forage for livestock can be improved
with prescribed fire in habitats where wax currant occurs.  Fire
prescriptions for grasslands invaded by Douglas-fir in west-central and
southwestern Montana are described [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Fire prescriptions for
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir communities in the
Intermountain West are also described [<a href="#50">50</a>].
