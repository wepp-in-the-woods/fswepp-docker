The currently accepted scientific name of Colorado pinyon is <i>Pinus edulis</i>
Engelm. (Pinaceae) [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>,<a href="#166">166</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>].

<p>Where the ranges of both species overlap, Colorado pinyon frequently
hybridizes with singleleaf pinyon (<i>P. monophylla</i>)
[<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>]. The eastern edge of the Great Basin is the rough boundary
between Colorado and singleleaf pinyons, and forms a &quot;zone of
hybridization&quot; [<a href="#95">95</a>]. Colorado pinyon also hybridizes
with Mexican pinyon (<i>P. cembroides</i>) [<a href="#106">106</a>].</p>

Colorado pinyon is primarily a species of the southwestern United States and
Colorado Plateau, extending to the eastern rim of the Great Basin [<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>]. It occurs abundantly in Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New
Mexico [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>,<a href="#166">166</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>], though its
range extends to extreme southern Wyoming, eastern Nevada and California, western
Oklahoma, the Trans-Pecos region of Texas, and northern Mexico
[<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>]. Colorado pinyon occurrence is generally rare or

Colorado pinyon forms a characteristic woodland community with Utah juniper (<i>Juniperus
osteosperma</i>) known as the pinyon-juniper woodland
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>]. In this community, Utah juniper often extends to lower elevations without the Colorado pinyon component, while
Colorado pinyon grows at elevations above Utah juniper. The pinyon-juniper woodland often forms large
continuous stands, as for example in the western part of the Uinta Basin [<a href="#26">26</a>]. Other pinyon (<i>Pinus</i> spp.) and juniper (<i>Juniperus</i> spp.)

Colorado pinyon often grows as a low, bushy tree [<a href="#166">166</a>] with an
irregularly rounded, spreading crown [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>]. Crowns of young trees are broadly conical, and those of old
trees are spreading or flat-topped [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>]. The trunk is generally short and crooked
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>], with several large, crooked
branches [<a href="#64">64</a>]. It may grow to 40 inches (1 m) in diameter [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>]. Height
is typically 26 to 56 feet (8-17 m) [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>].

<p>The needles are 2.7 to 4.3 inches (6-11 cm) long
[<a href="#167">167</a>] and in fascicles of 2 [<a href="#126">126</a>].&nbsp;Needles remain on the tree for
approximately 9 years. Bark thickness of Colorado pinyon ranges
from 0.5 to 0.87 inch (1.3-2.2 cm) [<a href="#64">64</a>], with young trees having smoother and thinner
bark than older trees. Cones are 1.5 to 2 inches (3.5-5)
cm long and are borne singly or in groups of 2 to
4 [<a href="#126">126</a>]. The average cone contains 10 to 20 soft-shelled seeds
[<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>].&nbsp;<a href="https://hua.huh.harvard.edu/FNA/volumes.html">The Flora of
North America</a> provides a morphological description and identification
key for Colorado pinyon.</p>

<p>Colorado pinyon's root system consists of a taproot and shallow lateral
roots occurring more than 1 inch (3 cm) below the soil surface [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>]. Taproots extend to soil depths of
at least 20 feet (6 m) [<a href="#50">50</a>].&nbsp;Laterals are generally found at depths of 6 to 16 inches
(15-40 cm) and can
extend from the tree up to twice the crown radius [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>].</p>

<p>Colorado pinyon is a slow-growing, long-lived tree [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>]. It can survive more than 500 years
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#155">155</a>] and may reach 800 to 1,000 years of age [<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>]. The density
of Colorado pinyon in woodland communities ranges from none or few to several hundred stems
per hectare [<a href="#139">139</a>].</p>

REGENERATION PROCESSES:</a>
</span>
<br />

Colorado pinyon regenerates solely from seed; asexual regeneration has not been
documented [<a href="#5">5</a>]. The natural reproduction of Colorado pinyon is limited due to
unfavorable climate, infertility of the seed, rapidly declining germination of
seed produced, and loss of seed to vertebrates and insects [<a href="#159">159</a>].

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">
Breeding system:</font>  </b> Colorado pinyon is generally monoecious [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>]. The upper crown of Colorado pinyon tends to bear more ovulate than
staminate cones and the opposite is true of the lower crown, though there may be
broad overlap [<a href="#97">97</a>]. Some dioecious individuals do occur [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>]. Dioecy may be more prevalent
in younger age classes, perhaps as an adaptation to arid environments or other stress
[<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>]. Dioecy may
also occur in response to site factors, with male trees potentially
predominating on south-facing slopes; however, clear connections between site
conditions and Colorado pinyon breeding systems have not been established [<a href="#46">46</a>]. In 1 study, monoecious trees produced
significantly more (p&lt;0.001) empty seeds than female dioecious trees, and
seedlings from monoecious trees were shorter and less vigorous than seedlings
from dioecious trees [<a href="#48">48</a>]. Laboratory experiments have found 57%
survival of self-pollinated cones and 83% survival of outcrossed cones. Outcrossed cones
produced more seeds per cone than self-pollinated
cones [<a href="#97">97</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">
<b>
Pollination:</b></font>  The pollen of Colorado pinyon is carried
for miles by the wind [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">
Seed production:</font> </b>Colorado pinyon may start bearing cones at
25 years. Good seed production occurs on
trees that are 75 to 100 years old, with maximum seed production occurring on
trees 160 to 200 years of age [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>]. Large seed crops are produced every 3
to 7 years and are adversely impacted by water stress [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>]. The periodicity of seed
crops is related to the drain of nutrients required to produce a large crop and
the time required for nutrients to be replenished [<a href="#40">40</a>]. Cones
require 3 years to mature [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>]. Colorado pinyon cones and seeds are attacked by a variety of
insect species, which may destroy large portions of seed crops [<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>
Seed dispersal:</b></font>  The wingless seeds of Colorado pinyon are dispersed by birds
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#166">166</a>] and small mammals, primarily squirrels and
chipmunks [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>]. Four species of birds cache Colorado
pinyon seeds: Clark's nutcrackers, scrub jays, pinyon jays, and Steller's jays [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>]. However, most 
seeds are cached outside the elevational range of Colorado
pinyon by Clark's nutcracker and to some extent, pinyon and Steller's jays.
Scrub jays that live permanently in pinyon-juniper woodlands cache substantial
numbers of seeds, making these birds locally important in Colorado pinyon regeneration
[<a href="#68">68</a>].</p> 

<p>Failure of Colorado pinyon cones to open, possibly due to a wetter spring moisture regime,
renders seeds more difficult to access and reduces seed dispersal, particularly
dispersal by small mammals [<a href="#43">43</a>].&nbsp;</p> 

<p>On sloping sites, Colorado pinyon seeds may be washed &quot;some distance away&quot;
by runoff [<a href="#64">64</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>
Seed banking:</b></font>  In general, Colorado pinyon has short-lived seeds. As a result, seeds form only a temporary seed bank, with
most seeds germinating the spring following dispersal. The
potential for a large temporary seed bank is high following years of good seed
production, while in other years the seed bank is likely sparse [<a href="#20">20</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Germination:</font></b>
Colorado pinyon seeds generally germinate in the shade of a tree or shrub rather than in open grassland
[<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>]. Germination occurs in response to moisture and moderate temperatures of 65 to 75 degrees
Fahrenheit (18-24 <sup>o</sup>C). It occurs in the spring after snowmelt and/or
warming temperatures [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>]. If moisture conditions are not suitable, Colorado
pinyon seeds may not germinate until the summer monsoon season [<a href="#59">59</a>].
Floyd [<a href="#47">47</a>] found that germination of Colorado pinyon occurs optimally at a
mean temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 <sup>o</sup>C) and 15 hours of light, with germination rates ranging
from 25 to 65% [<a href="#47">47</a>]. Cold stratification may result in more
rapid seed germination [<a href="#60">60</a>]. Floyd [<a href="#45">45</a>] found that germination and establishment of Colorado pinyon may be
enhanced under a Gambel oak canopy, possibly due to increased moisture retention
by litter, shading, decreased evapotranspiration in oak stands, and reduced seed
predation. One study found higher Colorado pinyon
germination rates when scrub jays cached seeds under junipers or near/under
bushes, while very few seeds germinated if cached in the open [<a href="#68">68</a>].</p> 

<p> Viability of fresh seeds varies between 85 and 95%. Seed viability decreases rapidly in 1 year or less, and the
rate of germination is low [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seedling establishment/growth: </b> </font>Reproduction of
Colorado pinyon is generally sparse and scattered due to removal of seeds by
birds and mammals [<a href="#64">64</a>], and seedling establishment is dependent on
chance dispersal to favorable sites and ample rainfall [<a href="#86">86</a>]. More seedlings establish under trees or shrubs than away from them
[<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>]. Colorado pinyon seedlings require extra moisture or shade until their elongating taproots
reach deeper substrates [<a href="#117">117</a>]. Taproots of 1-year-old
seedlings in northern Arizona averaged 8 inches (20.5 cm) long with a range of
6.7 to 10.6 inches (17-27 cm).&nbsp;Height
of 1-year-old Colorado pinyon seedlings averaged 2 inches (5 cm) on northern Arizona
sites [<a href="#71">71</a>]; growth was estimated at 1 inch per year for the
first 10 years [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>]. Biomass of 1-year-old seedlings is
distributed evenly between shoot and root growth [<a href="#71">71</a>]. Seedlings growing in partial shade until they reach about 12 inches (30 cm) in
height experience better
early growth than those in complete shade under mature trees [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>]. Water is the primary limiting factor in seedling
survival and growth [<a href="#112">112</a>]. Competition for moisture usually
results in the suppression of smaller trees, though they gradually resume normal
growth when released from severe competition [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>]. Saplings grow 4 to 6 inches
(10-15 cm) in height annually, and mature trees grow 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm) annually [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>]. Mean annual diameter growth of
Colorado pinyon is approximately 0.7 inch
(1.8 cm) per decade when trees are about 50 years old [<a href="#139">139</a>].</p>

<br />

Colorado pinyon is found on level or gently rolling uplands [<a href="#39">39</a>] to moderately steep
and very steep slopes (27-75%)
[<a href="#72">72</a>]. It also occurs in riparian areas in the Southwest [<a href="#42">42</a>] and on slopes adjacent to river drainages
[<a href="#72">72</a>]. Colorado
pinyon sites include dry foothills, plateaus, mesas, mountain slopes, and canyon sides
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#166">166</a>].&nbsp;The distribution of Colorado pinyon in pinyon-juniper
woodlands may be limited by Colorado pinyon's lack of tolerance for water stress
on low
elevational, xeric sites [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#174">174</a>]. At high elevations, distribution may be limited by low temperatures or
competition with ponderosa pine [<a href="#8">8</a>]. Moisture is likely the
most critical factor controlling the distribution, composition, and density of
pinyon-juniper woodlands [<a href="#58">58</a>], though the distribution of Colorado
pinyon may also be affected by soil characteristics [<a href="#174">174</a>].

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Elevation:</font></b>
Pinyon-juniper woodlands occur in the foothills above desert shrub or grassland vegetation but below ponderosa pine
forest [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>]. Colorado
pinyon occurrence ranges from 4,500 to 9,000 feet (1,400-2,700 m) elevation
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>]. In pinyon-juniper woodland, Colorado pinyon tends to increase in abundance with
increasing elevation, while junipers decrease [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>]. Colorado
pinyon is not generally affected by topographic position (aspect or steepness of slope),
other than its prevalence relative to juniper [<a href="#129">129</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>]. The following table presents information on the elevational

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Climate:</font></b> Colorado pinyon occurs in the warm, semiarid climate of the
Southwest (Arizona, New Mexico) and in the cold, semiarid climate of the
mountainous west (Nevada, Utah, Colorado) [<a href="#34">34</a>]. Summers in the pinyon-juniper
zone are hot and winters relatively cold. A high percentage of clear
days, intense solar radiation, and windy conditions favor high
evapotranspiration rates [<a href="#139">139</a>], and precipitation
generally exceeds evapotranspiration only during December, January, and February
[<a href="#39">39</a>]. Growth is limited
primarily by low precipitation in the Southwest, while in the mountainous west
it is limited by both freezing temperatures and low precipitation [<a href="#34">34</a>].</p>

<p>Temperature and
precipitation in the pinyon-juniper zone vary in relation to elevation and
geographic location [<a href="#131">131</a>]. Colorado pinyon occurs on sites experiencing approximately
120 frost-free days and 4 to 20 inches (102-520 mm) of annual precipitation, with variable seasonal
distribution [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#168">168</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>]. In the southern portion of the
pinyon-juniper woodland distribution, precipitation peaks occur during the
summer fed by moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. In the more northern areas,
precipitation from convection storms occurs in July and August, and winter storms from the Pacific
coast provide moisture during the cool season [<a href="#131">131</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>]. Colorado pinyon is
mostly dependent on soil moisture stored from winter precipitation. Much of
summer rainfall is ineffective due to runoff after heavy thunderstorms and high
evaporation [<a href="#159">159</a>]. Colorado pinyon
occurs in zones
that are generally 6 degrees warmer than in the vegetation zone above
and 5 degrees cooler than the zone below [<a href="#39">39</a>].</p>

<p>Colorado pinyon is tolerant of cold and drought [<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>]. According to field studies
using simulated rainfall events, Colorado pinyon can respond effectively to both
monsoon precipitation and small rainfall events [<a href="#170">170</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Soils:</font></b> Colorado pinyon occurs on a wide range of soil types and is not
limited by the character or geologic origin of soils [<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#176">176</a>].
Soils of these communities may be shallow to moderately deep and are often rocky,
well drained,
and low in fertility [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>]. Colorado pinyon growing in deeper soils
generally grow faster than those in shallow soils [<a href="#159">159</a>]. Colorado pinyon occurs on a range of
parent materials, including sandstone, limestone, shale, basalt, granite, and mixed
alluvium [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>].</p>

<p>Soils under well-developed pinyon-juniper stands are completely occupied by
tree roots, limiting understory growth [<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>].
The lateral roots of the tree species efficiently access interspaces in these communities
for soil water and nutrients, further impacting herbaceous species [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>]. In
addition, understory vegetation is reduced by shading and potentially by allelopathic
effects [<a href="#35">35</a>]. Colorado pinyon accumulates nutrients beneath the tree canopy [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>].
Organic carbon and nitrogen are greater under pinyon-juniper canopies than in
interspaces, especially under mature canopies as compared to younger or more
recently disturbed stands [<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>]. In addition to accumulations of organic matter, concentrations of soluble salts
(Na, Ca, Mg, and K) are significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) under Colorado pinyon
canopies than in adjacent shrub-dominated areas. Accrual of nitrate
and sulfate is also evident under Colorado pinyon trees, as is higher average concentration of phosphorus and boron, which may
be phytotoxic to some herbaceous species [<a href="#9">9</a>]. Colorado pinyon litter is
specifically associated with a reduction of blue grama production [<a href="#79">79</a>].</p>


<span class="subframeName">

SUCCESSIONAL STATUS:</a>

<br />

Pinyon-juniper stands have slow succession rates [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. Colorado pinyon occurs as an
early to late-seral or climax species [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#172">172</a>]. Following a fire in a pinyon-juniper stand in southern Colorado, Colorado
pinyon began establishing in postfire year 25 [<a href="#31">31</a>]. Successional pathways of pinyon-juniper stands are indeterminate, and
conditions after disturbance are generally less stable than the late seral,
tree-dominant communities [<a href="#63">63</a>]. Factors that influence the pattern
of succession after fire include past use history, site factors, moisture
regime, stand age when disturbed, fire severity, presence of residual trees, and
the presence of animal dispersal agents [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>]. Seedlings may appear as early
as the 1st postfire year [<a href="#172">172</a>], potentially the result of effective seed
dispersal by animals, a wet moisture regime, and suitable shady sites
provided by residual trees.

<p>The general successional
recovery after fire in dense stands of pinyon-juniper begins with the
establishment of annuals, a stage that may peak in the 2nd and 3rd postfire
years. A perennial grass stage follows, in which perennials are more abundant than annuals, with a shrub
stage developing soon after. The re-establishment of trees during the shrub
stage then leads to the pinyon-juniper climax, presuming no further fire
occurrence [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>]. The suppression of shrubs by mature trees may take up to 100 years [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>], and climax stands may require
300 years to develop [<a href="#25">25</a>]. Frequent disturbance in these woodlands maintains
earlier seral stages (e.g. the open shrub stage) [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. As
pinyon-juniper crown cover increases, cover, productivity, and density of
understory species decrease. The understory is generally most
productive, diverse, and responsive to disturbance when pinyon-juniper crown
cover is at or below 20%. When crown cover exceeds 20 to 30%, understory
thinning accelerates [<a href="#77">77</a>]. &quot;Old-growth&quot; stands of pinyon-juniper
are fairly open and contain a cohort of dominant old, slow-growing
trees with little or no understory of grass or shrubs. Down dead material is
common, as is dead material on the live trees [<a href="#113">113</a>].</p>

<p> Colorado pinyon is intolerant
of shade in all but the seedling stage of its growth [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>]. &quot;Nurse plants&quot; are required during this stage to protect the
seedlings from excessive drying and heating [<a href="#14">14</a>].</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT">
SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Phenology of Colorado pinyon has been studied infrequently, primarily due to the
lack of easily observed, periodic phenophases. Observed phases include the emergence of male and female cones, pollination, when cones
reach their full size, and when cones begin to open. Both male and female cones emerge in May or June
from buds formed the previous year. The growth of these conelets stops around
the last week of August -- at the
end of the 1st summer their dimensions are only about 1/7 those of ripe cones
-- and is resumed the following May. Cones and seeds then reach their full size
in July and mature by September of the 2nd year. Cones open in late September and
October [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>]. In pinyon pines (<i>P. edulis</i>, <i> P. monophylla</i>, <i> P.
cembroides</i>), male and female cones open for pollination during the
late spring and early summer. Pollen is only dispersed for a few days and reaches a maximum in
the last week of March.
Natural germination of Colorado pinyon seed usually takes place the 1st spring
following dispersal. Under favorable conditions however, seed may germinate
during the summer or early fall [<a href="#159">159</a>].

<br />

Fire opens pinyon-juniper stands, increases diversity and productivity in
understory species, and creates a mosaic of stands of different sizes and ages across
the landscape. In addition, fire maintains the boundaries between the woodlands
and adjacent shrub- or grasslands [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font>  
Mature Colorado pinyon
trees are short with open crowns, but they do not self-prune their dead branches
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>]. The accumulated fuel in the crowns, thin bark, and the relative flammability of
the foliage make individual trees susceptible to fire [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>]. Stand structure also
impacts fire susceptibility; open stands of trees with large amounts of fine
grass fuel or dense, mature trees capable of carrying crown fire during dry,
windy conditions are the most flammable [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>]. With sparse fuels, Colorado pinyon
survives fire because it is seldom exposed to lethal heat [<a href="#67">67</a>].</p>

<p>Where stand-replacing fires do occur and potential seed sources are removed,
dispersal of Colorado pinyon seeds by animals becomes particularly important in
the reestablishment of tree seedlings. Birds in particular may cache seeds at
&quot;considerable distances&quot; from the seed source [<a href="#68">68</a>]. Seeds cached within the
shade of shrubs or trees are more likely to germinate and establish seedlings
[<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>]. For more information on seed dispersal and Colorado pinyon
succession following fire, please see the &quot;Biological and Ecological
Characteristics&quot; section of this FEIS species summary.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font>   
Pinyon-juniper stands can
support stand-replacing fires [<a href="#63">63</a>], though presettlement fire
regimes were likely a mixture of surface and crown fires with intensities and
frequencies dependent on site productivity [<a href="#125">125</a>]. Natural fires may be infrequent due to
a sparseness of vegetation combined with an infrequency
of lightning in some areas [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>]. Floyd and others [<a href="#44">44</a>] estimated
the &quot;natural&quot; fire turnover times of pinyon-juniper woodlands
in southern Colorado at approximately 400 years, with fires largely the result
of lightning strikes. Keeley [<a href="#86">86</a>]
estimated the natural fire frequency of pinyon-juniper woodlands at 100 to 300
years. The woodlands are described as &quot;resilient&quot; with a minimum
fire-free interval of 100 years and an unlimited maximum fire-free interval [<a href="#86">86</a>]. However, of 10 fire-scarred Colorado
pinyon trees collected from 3 locations in New Mexico, multiple fire scars reflected a mean
point fire interval for the trees of 27.5 years, with a range of intervals from
10 to 49 years [<a href="#16">16</a>]. A 208-year fire chronology of an eastern California
pinyon-juniper woodland (based on fire scarred trees) suggests that fires burned
somewhere within the &lt;100-acre study area every 8 years [<a href="#67">67</a>].
Gottfried and others [<a href="#62">62</a>] estimate fire intervals ranging from 10 to 50 years
for surface fires and &gt;200 years for crown fires in the Middle Rio Grande
Basin. Other studies report
surface fire intervals of 20 to 30 years, and standwide fires occurring at 15 to
20 year intervals in New Mexico [<a href="#125">125</a>]. The variation in fire intervals in
Colorado pinyon&nbsp; is the result of differences in fuel loading and
composition; where vegetation is sparse and unable to carry fire, fire-free
intervals are much longer than in areas with a well-developed understory or
greater tree density.</p>

<p> The amount of fine fuels varies with habitat type, stand
history, and climatic conditions. Fuel loadings of more than 11 tons per acre
(25,000 kg/ha) are considered heavy [<a href="#125">125</a>]. Fine fuels
in many open pinyon-juniper stands range from 600 to 1,000 pounds per acre (635-998
kg/ha), and approximately 600 to 700 pounds per acre (635-726 kg/ha) are
required to sustain surface fires [<a href="#14">14</a>]. Open pinyon-juniper
stands (average canopy cover 12.4 to 21.8%) at Los Alamos, New Mexico, contained
an average of 17,666 pounds per acre (20,033 kg/ha) of downed woody fuels and
22,347 pounds per acre (25,342 kg/ha) of total
surface fuels [<a href="#122">122</a>]. Stands of moderate tree density
where overstory competition reduces the herbaceous fuel and the trees are widely
spaced are less likely to burn. Closed pinyon-juniper
stands do not have understory shrubs to carry a surface fire, and do not burn until
conditions are met to carry a crown fire [<a href="#14">14</a>].&nbsp;Key
conditions for crown fires include sufficient canopy closure to promote fire
spread between trees, abundance of dead woody fuels on the surface and as
standing snags, and extreme weather conditions (low humidity and high winds)
[<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>].</p>

<p> Fire intervals in Colorado pinyon are difficult to
quantify because living fire-scarred trees are rare: Colorado pinyon is often killed
directly by fire or indirectly due to increased susceptibility to heart rot
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>]. Though fire-scarred Colorado pinyon verify fire occurrence
in pinyon-juniper communities, they are not a reliable indicator of fire
frequency. Localized stand-replacing fires do occur in
pinyon-juniper woodlands, and the absence of frequent fire in
pinyon-juniper communities likely results in increased tree cover and tree density,
encouraging crown fires rather than surface fires [<a href="#67">67</a>].</p>

<p>Due to the slow establishment and growth of Colorado pinyon,
repeated fires maintain earlier seral stages in these communities [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>]. Repeated burning every 20 to 40 years may eventually replace pinyon-juniper
woodlands with shrub communities because shrubs colonize areas much faster than
trees can re-establish [<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>], while the absence of fire
eventually allows Colorado pinyon to replace extensive shrub vegetation [<a href="#87">87</a>]. Frequent fire may prevent the expansion of Colorado pinyon into grasslands, based on the perception that periodic fires burned these grasslands
often enough to kill tree seedlings while they are most susceptible to fire. In
the absence of frequent fire, seedlings become established in the grassland, eventually converting it to a woodland or
savanna community. The effectiveness of fire in restricting
the spread of Colorado pinyon (and juniper) depends on fire frequency and intensity of the fire, with the time required for seedlings to reach 4 feet
(1.2 m) tall a
critical determinant of the effective fire interval [<a href="#130">130</a>].</p>

<p>Fire regimes for plant communities and ecosystems in which Colorado pinyon
occurs are summarized below. For further information regarding fire regimes and
fire ecology of communities and ecosystems where Colorado pinyon is found, see

IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Colorado pinyon is very sensitive to fire and may be killed by even low-severity
surface burns [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>], especially when trees are less than 4 feet (1.2 m)
tall [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#117">117</a>,<a href="#172">172</a>].&nbsp; Colorado pinyon is particularly susceptible when individuals are &gt;50%
defoliated by fire [<a href="#29">29</a>]. Fire kill of Colorado pinyon may be more
extensive on flat to gently rolling terrain; in rough terrain, islands of
unburned trees may be left on ridges and hills [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>]. Crown fires kill
Colorado pinyon of all age classes [<a href="#172">172</a>].

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT">
DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT:</a>
</span>
<br />

Colorado pinyon 6 feet (1.8 m) tall or more may be somewhat resistant to
surface fire
because foliage is high enough above the ground to avoid damage [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#172">172</a>]. In
communities where Colorado pinyon has reached 4 feet (1 m) or more in height,
the tress are often less susceptible to fire due to an absence of fine
fuels to carry fire [<a href="#175">175</a>]. Young Colorado pinyon are generally killed by fire [<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#172">172</a>]. Research in New
Mexico [<a href="#172">172</a>] showed that Colorado pinyons less than 4 feet
(1.2 m) tall experienced more damage
than taller trees after tebuthiuron application and fire, even though saplings
were more readily defoliated by herbicide
treatments than seedlings [<a href="#162">162</a>].

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE">
PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:</a>

<br />

The reestablishment of Colorado pinyon following fire is solely by seed [<a href="#44">44</a>].
Seedlings may appear within the 1st year following fire [<a href="#172">172</a>], but several
decades may be required before many seedlings establish. Following a fire in a
pinyon-juniper stand in southern Colorado, Colorado pinyon began establishing at
postfire year 25 [<a href="#31">31</a>].

<br />

Fire exclusion may increase the density of Colorado pinyon stands, increasing
potential for crown fire [<a href="#67">67</a>]. It may also encourage the invasion of grasslands by Colorado
pinyon, eventually converting grassland to woodland communities [<a href="#137">137</a>,<a href="#140">140</a>].<p>Prescribed burning to establish and maintain open areas, early seral plant
communities, plant diversity, and herbage production in pinyon-juniper woodlands
may provide habitat for wildlife, particularly deer, elk, and bighorn sheep
[<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>].&nbsp;Fire in open pinyon-juniper stands
with even a scattered understory of perennial grasses will
increase forage production through a reduction in competition for moisture
and light [<a href="#78">78</a>]. Mule deer may utilize burned pinyon-juniper woodlands more
heavily as winter range, as long as some
unburned areas remain close to the burned sites [<a href="#110">110</a>].&nbsp;</p><p> Burning after herbicide application may be more effective in reducing Colorado pinyon
and increasing forage production than either treatment alone [<a href="#172">172</a>].
Burning in dense stands with
little or no understory is difficult due to lack of fine fuels [<a href="#145">145</a>,<a href="#172">172</a>].
Allowing the herbaceous
understory to recover from herbicide treatment may increase the fine fuels that carry fire,
thus improving the effectiveness of fire treatments [<a href="#172">172</a>].</p>

<p>Prescribed burning of large slash piles is not recommended because of soil degradation. However, small piles of slash may be burned in low-severity fires to encourage herbaceous vegetation.
Slash burning is less desirable
in partially harvested stands, where selection or shelterwood methods have been
used to sustain tree production because burning tends to damage residual trees,
especially where slash has accumulated at the base [<a href="#125">125</a>].</p>

<p>Colorado pinyon seedlings growing in severely burned soils are generally smaller
than those in lightly burned or unburned soils. Elevated concentrations of
extractable nitrogen and phosphorus may be present for up to a year following
severe burning, and these concentrations may be high enough to reduce pinyon
seedling growth [<a href="#70">70</a>]. Beyond these initial effects, fire may result in a sizeable loss of nitrogen and other nutrients from the
floor of
pinyon-juniper woodlands, mostly due to loss of the litter layer [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>].
Burning may result in short-term increases in
ammonium, which in combination with
soil heating, affects the processes of nitrogen mineralization, nitrification,
and nitrogen immobilization. One study in Arizona found immediate increases in
soil ammonium and nitrate after burning. However, within 90 days of burning the
ammonium levels approximated those in unburned controls while nitrate levels in
controls were 5 to 15 times the levels on burned sites [<a href="#88">88</a>]. Other studies also
demonstrate that prescribed burning of pinyon-juniper slash following fuelwood harvest results in
short-term increased soil nitrogen. Immediate increases in ammonium following burning have
been observed 1 year after fire, nitrate concentrations increase while ammonium
concentrations decrease, and by postfire year 5, no increased levels of nitrogen in
either form remain detectable [<a href="#24">24</a>]. Postfire nitrification rates appear to be
related to the degree of soil heating, which affects nitrogen-fixing microbes [<a href="#88">88</a>]. Slash burning following
chaining may also increase soil moisture after the 1st
postburn year [<a href="#55">55</a>], though adverse effects include temporarily reduced
infiltration rates and a subsequent increase in erosion and runoff [<a href="#56">56</a>].</p>

<b><font face="Bell MT">Control of Colorado pinyon:</font></b> 
Broadcast burning of pinyon-juniper stands
requires densities of 200 to 400 trees per acre to achieve control of trees [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>], though it may also be effective if an adequate
understory of shrubs or grass is present to carry the fire between clumps of
trees [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>]. Fire carries well through pinyon-juniper stands
during high temperatures, low humidity, moderate winds, and long preceding
periods of little precipitation [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>]. Burning of individual trees
may also be an effective Colorado pinyon control where stands are too open to
carry fire [<a href="#5">5</a>].&nbsp;Burning dense stands of Colorado pinyon is
often difficult because the lack of fine fuels to carry fire may make crown
fires necessary to effectively control the trees [<a href="#175">175</a>]. Slash burning following chaining is
usually effective in eliminating 90 to 95% of the small trees left undisturbed
by the mechanical treatment [<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>], and is more
effective in controlling trees than mechanical treatment without slash burning [<a href="#144">144</a>]. Chaining followed by burning may render the microclimate unfavorable for
seedling establishment [<a href="#175">175</a>]. Delaying burning 2 or 3 years after
mechanical treatment ensures that most on-site seeds will germinate, and
seedlings are easily removed because Colorado pinyon less than 4 feet tall is readily killed by
fire [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#175">175</a>].

IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Livestock grazing is an important use of pinyon-juniper woodlands [<a href="#34">34</a>].
Pinyon-juniper communities provide food and shelter for deer, elk,
pronghorn, wild horses, small mammals, and both game and nongame bird species [<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>].
They also provide habitat for
coyotes, mountain lions, and bobcats [<a href="#134">134</a>], and are important winter habitat for goshawks [<a href="#63">63</a>].

<p>
Pinyon-juniper woodlands are important winter ranges for mule deer [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>], providing cover, shelter, and
understory forage [<a href="#34">34</a>]. Colorado pinyon provides browse for mule deer,
though it is not substantially utilized [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>].
It may constitute 1 to 5% of mule deer winter diets [<a href="#91">91</a>].
</p>

<p>
The seeds of Colorado pinyon are an important food source for birds,
particularly Clark's nutcracker [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>],
scrub jays, and pinyon jays [<a href="#21">21</a>]. Clark's nutcracker&nbsp; preferentially
harvest seed from trees with large cone crops. Cones chosen for seed removal also tend to have more seeds as
well as more viable seeds, potentially resulting in differential reproductive
success of Colorado pinyon [<a href="#22">22</a>]. Seeds are an important
food for small mammals, primarily chipmunks and squirrels [<a href="#21">21</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Palatability/nutritional value:</b></font>   
 Colorado pinyon browse is unpalatable to domestic cattle, sheep, and, horses
[<a href="#28">28</a>]. The seeds are rich in protein and unsaturated fats, containing essential
amino acids, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals [<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>].
</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Cover value:</font></b>  
Colorado pinyon provides
good cover for elk, mule deer, white-tailed deer, pronghorn, upland game birds,
small nongame birds, and small mammals [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].
Pinyon-juniper woodlands also provide important cover for coyotes [<a href="#54">54</a>].</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES">
VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES:</a>
</span>
<br />

Colorado pinyon is used to rehabilitate mined areas and critical habitats
that have been damaged by fire [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#173">173</a>].

<p><b><font face="Bell MT">Artificial regeneration:</font></b> Dormancy of Colorado pinyon seeds is broken by soaking the seed for 1 to 2
days, followed by cold stratification at temperatures between 33 and 41 degrees
Fahrenheit for 0 to 60 days [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>].</p>



<span class="subframeName">
<a name="OTHER USES">
OTHER USES:</a>
</span>
<br />

The edible seeds of Colorado pinyon are gathered from native stands and marketed
commercially [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>]. Traditionally, these seeds were an important dietary supplement for Native Americans in the Southwest
[<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>]. Traditional Native American uses for Colorado
pinyon pitch include medicinal purposes and waterproofing of baskets and clay water bottles
[<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>]. Colorado pinyon is used for Christmas trees [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>] and landscaping
[<a href="#49">49</a>].

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Wood Products:</b></font>   
The wood of Colorado
pinyon is narrow-ringed, hard, and very brittle [<a href="#64">64</a>]. Wood products from
Colorado pinyon include fuelwood, charcoal, mine timbers, railroad crossties,
lumber, fenceposts, and pulpwood [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>].</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Substantially reduced canopy cover in pinyon-juniper woodlands generally results
in greater understory blue grama biomass, though the canopy reduction may
decrease the biomass of cool-season grasses [<a href="#128">128</a>]. Mechanical treatments such as chaining may be applied to Colorado pinyon in an effort to increase
herbage yields and ground cover by decreasing tree competition, and/or achieve a desired tree density
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>]. Chaining and
cabling can effectively kill 50 to 80% of Colorado pinyon in pinyon-juniper
stands [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>], though it slips over smaller trees [<a href="#6">6</a>].
Chaining reduces the density of Colorado pinyon both directly (knocking down and
killing trees) and indirectly (through cambial injuries or root exposure) [<a href="#161">161</a>]. However, individual trees may survive if the fine roots remain
in the soil [<a href="#151">151</a>,<a href="#161">161</a>]. 

<p>Two years after a chaining treatment in a pinyon-juniper stand in Utah, trees were
reduced to 6% of the total cover (from 26% pretreatment), while herbaceous plants
increased from 2 to 13% and shrubs increased from 2 to 8%.
After 24 years, trees and shrubs comprised 84% of total cover [<a href="#148">148</a>]. Another study in Utah found that 26 years after chaining, the
density of Colorado pinyon remained 26% lower than on untreated sites [<a href="#161">161</a>]. Small
trees left after mechanical treatment may grow faster after release from the
dominance of the larger overstory trees, reducing or eliminating any gains in
herbage yield [<a href="#6">6</a>].&nbsp;A study in New Mexico found that 20 years after a
cabling treatment, density of Colorado pinyon was almost the same as on
uncabled control sites, though basal and aerial cover were lower than on controls. Herbage production on these sites did not increase appreciably
following mechanical treatment [<a href="#138">138</a>]. Another study in New Mexico
found that Colorado pinyon increased coverage 28 years after chaining
[<a href="#141">141</a>].&nbsp;Most trees that remain alive on a chained area will increase in size and become
more visually apparent; some recruitment of new seedlings will also occur [<a href="#151">151</a>].
Colorado pinyon may be slow to re-establish following the mechanical removal of
trees, but once tree density reaches 48 trees per acre (120 trees/ha) the rate of
re-establishment may increase. This rate increase is likely the result of
suppression of competing herbaceous growth and the accumulation of moist shady
litter to benefit Colorado pinyon seedlings [<a href="#144">144</a>].</p>

<p> The effects of chaining on infiltration rates are inconclusive, though chaining
followed by seeding to grassland likely reduces sediment yield [<a href="#171">171</a>].</p>
<p>An increased use of cabled or chained areas by mule deer in spring and summer
may be related to an increase in forage, though treatments
may also reduce the amount of hiding or escape cover [<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>]. Small
mammals may also prefer mechanically treated areas due to increased forage
production and the potential increased cover availability in the form of debris
and slash piles [<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. However, conversion
projects (e.g. chaining and cabling) often fail to increase livestock carrying
capacity for more than a few years [<a href="#112">112</a>], and use of
mechanically treated areas by birds is often less than on control plots [<a href="#143">143</a>].</p>

<p>Though chaining and cabling are often used to increase forage production, the
result may be invasions of weedy species. On a chained site in Utah, bur
buttercup (<i>Ranunculus testiculatus</i>) and cheatgrass (<i>Bromus
tectorum</i>) occurred in high numbers following chaining and
seeding of herbaceous species. However, these weedy annuals decreased 85% and
88%, respectively, by the 3rd posttreatment year as the seeded perennials became
more established [<a href="#13">13</a>].</p>

<p>Colorado pinyon may be effectively controlled with applications of
tebuthiuron and picloram [<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>,<a href="#172">172</a>].&nbsp;Medium-sized
and large saplings are more readily defoliated by tebuthiuron than seedlings and
small saplings [<a href="#162">162</a>], though trees shorter than 4 feet (1.2 m) may experience
higher mortality if herbicide treatment is followed by fire [<a href="#172">172</a>]. High levels of trampling may also damage Colorado pinyon, reducing seedling
density [<a href="#158">158</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<p>Forage production in pinyon-juniper stands is substantially increased by
protection from grazing; ungrazed sites in New Mexico produced up to twice as
much forage as grazed sites after about 20 years [<a href="#132">132</a>]. Heavy grazing,
on the other hand, may result in an increase in the density and extent of
Colorado pinyon stands [<a href="#136">136</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>]. Grazing hastens establishment of
Colorado pinyon trees by reducing competition from the herbaceous understory
[<a href="#144">144</a>,<a href="#168">168</a>]. The resulting scattered understory reduces the opportunity for fire
in pinyon-juniper communities [<a href="#168">168</a>].</p>

Colorado pinyon can be found in the &quot;Fire Effects&quot; section of this
