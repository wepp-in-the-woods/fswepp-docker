<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Spiraea douglasii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Douglas' spirea has limited value as livestock forage because of
typically dense stands, high water tables, and scarcity of palatable
grasses [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  It is sometimes eaten by livestock in the summer and
fall [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].

In western Washington and Oregon Douglas' spirea is browsed by
black-tailed deer [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].  


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
In Oregon Douglas' spirea has a low palatability rating [<a href="#29">29</a>].  


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
In Washington a breeding population of long-billed marsh wrens was found
nesting in a Douglas' spirea emergent shrub community type [<a href="#52">52</a>].  In
British Columbia Douglas' spirea is a component of the western
hemlock-Sitka spruce habitat type which is important grizzly bear
habitat [<a href="#2">2</a>].  In Oregon quaking aspen-lodgepole pine/Douglas'
spirea/widefruit sedge and lodgepole pine/Douglas' spirea/widefruit
sedge habitat types are utilized by livestock for bedding and shade.
These two habitat types are also important to deer, elk, and raptors
[<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Carlson [<a href="#6">6</a>] recommends Douglas' spirea for riparian revegetation
programs in the Pacific Northwest.  In a black cottonwood (Populus
trichocarpa) riparian community, Douglas' spirea seedlings were planted
in the fall of 1980 and had a 27 percent survival rate.  In 1988 percent
cover of Douglas' spirea had increased [<a href="#6">6</a>].  In Oregon Douglas' spirea
was propagated as in situ hardwood cuttings (collected and planted
on-site the same day) in a Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis) community
[<a href="#48">48</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In Oregon Douglas' spirea is sensitive to trampling and soil compaction
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  The riparian lodgepole pine/Douglas' spirea/forb association
has been overgrazed in Oregon.  Douglas' spirea may be eliminated with
continued overuse [<a href="#29">29</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Spiraea douglasii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Douglas' spirea is a rhizomatous, deciduous shrub with erect, spreading
stems 3 to 6 feet (1-1.8 m) tall [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Leaves are 1 to 4 inches
(3-10 cm) long [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Seeds are 0.08 inch (2 mm) long [<a href="#40">40</a>].
Douglas'spirea forms adventitious roots after burial [<a href="#1">1</a>].  


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Douglas' spirea is a rhizomatous shrub that often forms dense colonies
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  It will sprout from the stem base and root crown following
disturbance [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  In Washington following the May 18, 1980 volcanic
eruption of Mount St. Helens, Douglas' spirea showed extensive rhizome
development in the tephra (volcanic aerial ejecta) and contained one to
five adventitious roots per centimeter of stem 1 year after burial.
Maximum adventitious root length of Douglas' spirea was 3.6 inches (9
cm) [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Douglas' spirea produces small seeds that are probably dispersed via
animals and strong winds [<a href="#40">40</a>].  
  


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Douglas' spirea occurs in riparian areas including wet meadows,
floodplains, terraces, bogs, swamps, and along streams, rivers, lakes,
springs, and ponds [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  

Douglas' spirea grows best on moist to semiwet soils with good drainage
[<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  It grows best on loam and sandy loam soils, but
occurs on silty clay, clay loam, and gravelly substrates as well
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Douglas' spirea is tolerant of permanently
water-logged soils (peat) and widely fluctuating water tables [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  

Elevations for Douglas' spirea are as follows:

                           feet                 meters

California              4,620-6,435           1,400-1,950     [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>]
Montana                 3,760-6,700           1,147-2,044     [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>]
Oregon                  2,200-5,800             660-1,740     [<a href="#29">29</a>]
Washington              2,500-5,000             750-1,500     [<a href="#19">19</a>]


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Douglas' spirea occurs mostly in seral communities [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  It is
generally shade intolerant [<a href="#28">28</a>], but horticultural specimens have been
described as shade tolerant [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  In British Columbia Douglas'
spirea is a pioneer species in disclimax communities maintained by
avalanches [<a href="#2">2</a>].  In southwestern British Columbia and northwestern
Washington, Douglas' spirea is a pioneer species on clearcut sites
[<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  In northwestern Montana a Douglas' spirea community type may
be seral to an as yet undefined thinleaf alder/Douglas' spirea habitat
type [<a href="#4">4</a>].  

Douglas' spirea often forms dense impenetrable thickets in riparian
areas [<a href="#4">4</a>].  In Washington Douglas' spirea usually occurs in mosaics with
other hydric and mesic non-forest species in riparian forest openings
[<a href="#19">19</a>].  
 


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
In California Douglas' spirea flowers from June to September [<a href="#40">40</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Spiraea douglasii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Douglas' spirea is moderately resistant to fire [<a href="#32">32</a>] and sprouts readily
from the stem base and rhizomes after fire [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  In
presettlement times, wildfires were "probably common" in Douglas' spirea
communities of riparian areas in Montana and Oregon; soils were usually
dry by mid-summer, allowing fires from adjacent uplands to encroach upon
the stand [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Fires were probably infrequent in the thinleaf
alder-Douglas' spirea association in Oregon [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Small shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Rhizomatous shrub, rhizome in soil

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Douglas' spirea is probably topkilled by most fires and killed by
severe fires.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
The literature contains few reports describing Douglas' spirea after
fire.  Because of its sprouting ability, it probably survives most
fires.  In central British Columbia Douglas' spirea was present with
shinyleaf spirea (Spiraea betulifolia var. lucida) in seral Engelmann
spruce (Picea engelmannii)-fir (Abies spp.) stands.  Relative density of
the Spiraea spp. in plots 4 to 22 years after fire was 4 percent; in
plots 37 to 75 years after fire, it was 9 percent [<a href="#13">13</a>].  In British
Columbia McMinn [<a href="#38">38</a>] studied a site in a western hemlock/Sitka spruce
forest burned in 1861 and again in 1931.  By 1948 Douglas' spirea had
formed dense thickets with salmonberry and thimbleberry.
