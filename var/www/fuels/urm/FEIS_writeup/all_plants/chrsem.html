<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of bush chinquapin is Chrysolepis
sempervirens (Kell.) Hjelmqv.  It is a member of the Fagaceae, or oak
family [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  The older name of Castanopsis sempervirens (Kell.)
Dudley is still frequently encountered in the literature.  There are no
subspecies, varieties, or forms.

Bush chinquapin hybridizes with giant chinquapin (C. chrysophylla) in
western Siskiyou County, where distributions of the two species overlap
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].

<pre><center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Chrysolepis sempervirens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Bush chinquapin occurs in mountainous regions of California and southern
Oregon.  It is distributed along the Pacific Coast from the San Jacinto
and San Bernadino mountains north through the Coast Ranges to
southwestern Oregon.  Eastward it is distributed through the Sierra
Nevada and Cascade Range to south-central Oregon [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Giant
chinquapin has a shrub form that is difficult to distinguish from bush
chinquapin, and there is some confusion as to the exact distribution of
each [<a href="#25">25</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Bush chinquapin is a common codominant of montane chaparral.  Occurring
at higher elevations than other types of chaparral, montane chaparral
consists of low-growing, often dense thickets of sclerophyllous shrubs
in the coniferous forest zone.  Forest cover is lacking, usually due to
removal of trees by fire or logging [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Mountain whitethorn
(Ceanothus cordulatus), snowbrush ceanothus (Ceanothus viscidiflorus),
and greenleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula) are frequent codominants
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Together these shrubs may form almost impenetrable stands [<a href="#6">6</a>].
Bush chinquapin also occurs in pure stands.  These are not extensive in
montane chaparral but are common in alpine zones [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].

Bush chinquapin often dominates or codominates the understories of
mid-seral coniferous forests adjacent to montane chaparral [<a href="#18">18</a>].
Coniferous forests may also contain scattered thickets of bush
chinquapin on sites unfavorable to conifer growth, such as rocky
outcrops or dry ridges [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Bush chinquapin occupies breaks
in the overhead canopy where windthrow or tree death has occurred [<a href="#8">8</a>].

On the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range, bush
chinquapin is associated with the western juniper (Juniperus
occidentalis)-big sagebrush (Artemesia tridentata)-bluebunch wheatgrass
(Pseudoroegenaria spicata) community of the Great Basin [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Chrysolepis sempervirens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
The seeds of bush chinquapin are a staple diet item of various birds and
rodents [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Twigs and leaves are rarely browsed by either
livestock or big game animals [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Bush chinkapin is rated as poor to useless for sheep, goats,
black-tailed deer, and bighorn sheep and useless for cattle and horses
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Managers have been largely frustrated in attempts to use bush chinquapin
for site rehabilitation, although it is recommended for such use on
disturbed watersheds and wildlife habitations [<a href="#24">24</a>].  The species is
difficult to cultivate.  Hormone-treated cuttings fail to root [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>],
and containerized seedlings do not transplant well [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Seedlings
outplanted on a favorable central Sierra Nevada site denuded by a large
broken water pipe showed poorer survival (81 percent) after 2 years than
any of six other native species.  Average height and stem diameter of
surviving bush chinquapin was significantly (p>0.05) less than other
outplanted species [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Many managers have experienced 100 percent
mortality of transplants [<a href="#24">24</a>].  No attempts at establishing plants from
seed sown directly on-site were found in the literature, although this
method is recommended [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Managers have found onsite sowing of seed
to be the most effective in establishing the closely-related native
California oaks (Quercus spp.) because taproots develop normally [<a href="#17">17</a>].
Seed collection and processing information is available in the
literature [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The golden sheen of the lower leaf epidermis, showy cream-white male
catkins, and attractive burred fruits makes bush chinquapin of interest as
an ornamental, but commercial cultivation of the species has not been
successful [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

The seeds are palatable to humans, either raw or roasted.  They were a
common diet item of Native Americans [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Rangeland:  Large numbers of bush chinquapin in rangelands are considered
indicators of overgrazing [<a href="#40">40</a>].

Timber:  Bush chinquapin suppress growth of young conifers in the shrub
understory. In one such case, a brushfield of bush chinquapin, greenleaf
manzanita, and Sierra mountain misery (Chamaebatia foliolosa) on the
Blodgett Forest Research Station of El Dorado County, California, was
cleared and planted with sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum).  Within 16
years, the bush chinquapin and greenleaf manzanita had grown to 6 feet
(1.8 m) in height.  Sequoia saplings were suppressed at or below this
level.  Researchers removed all brush and sprayed sprouting brush with
herbicide the following year.  Released sequoias developed much broader
crowns and grew from 3 to 4 feet (0.9-1.2 m) within 2 years [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Control:  Mature bush chinquapin sprouts after initial herbicide
spraying and requires repeated treatments to effect a high percentage of
kill.  Foliar sprays of phenoxy herbicides applied in early spring are
effective [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Bush chinquapin cover was significantly (p>0.05) reduced
on a burn planted with Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) following treatment
with 2,4,5-T [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Diseases:  Bush chinquapin is susceptible to oak wilt, a potentially
lethal disease caused by a fungal pathogen (Ceratocyctic fagacearum).
Oak wilt is spreading westward from the Great Plains area [<a href="#38">38</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Chrysolepis sempervirens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bush chinquapin is a monecious, native, evergreen, schlerophyllous
shrub.  It may grow up to 8 feet (2.5 m) tall [<a href="#9">9</a>] but is typically from
1 to 5 feet (0.3-1.5 m) in height [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Plants have a prostrate to
spreading, round-topped growth form [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Male catkins are produced from
the tips of terminal and side branches [<a href="#26">26</a>].  One to three female
flowers grow at the base of the male catkins or on short separate
catkins [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  The fruit is a nut with a woody seed coat enveloped by
a densely burred involucre [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Nuts contain from one to three
seeds, usually one [<a href="#33">33</a>].  No information concerning the bark thickness
or rooting habit of bush chinquapin is available.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Chinquapins are wind pollinated [<a href="#29">29</a>].  The age of sexual maturity and
maximum seed production are not reported in the literature.  Most seed
falls under the parent.  Some seed may be disseminated by animals when
the nut burs catch on furs or hides.  Other seed is dissemminated by
seed-eating birds and rodents [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Seed predation is high [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Some
seed is probably buried by seed-caching animals, and unconsumed seed so
buried may have higher rates of germination.  Germination is hypogeal
and occurs from 16 to 25 days after nuts split and release seed.  Cold
stratification does not increase germination rates.  Investigations of
fresh seed viability are scant, but one study showed 30 percent
germination of seeds 25 days following sowing.  Chinquapins seeds has
remained viable for 5 years with cold, dry laboratory storage [<a href="#24">24</a>].
Research on the long-term viability of seed in seed banks is lacking.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bush chinquapin grows on steep, often south-facing slopes within the
coniferous forest zone [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  It is also found on the more gentle
slopes of that zone where disturbance has removed the original forest
cover [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Low-growing forms of this shrub occur above timberline and
can be found on Sonora, Tioga, and Carson passes [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Bush chinquapin
occurs as high as 12,000 feet (3,658 m) [<a href="#26">26</a>] but is most common from
1,500 to 6,000 feet (459-1,829 m) in elevation [<a href="#22">22</a>].

The climate of montane chaparral is dry in summer, with precipitation
usually plentiful from October until May.  Some precipitation is in the
form of snow.  One 5,500-foot (1,676 m) site on the Shasta-Trinity
National Forest, California, receives an average of 38 inches (985 mm)
of annual precipitation, half as snow [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Soil conditions are
generally the same as those of adjacent coniferous forests [<a href="#18">18</a>].

Overstory associates not listed in Distribution and Occurrence include
sequoia, sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), incense-cedar (Libocedrus
decurrens), Sierra western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis var.
australis), Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia), bigleaf maple (Acer
macrophyllum), and Pacific dogwood (Curnus nuttallii) [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

Shrub associates not previously mentioned include Sierra mountain
misery, pinemat manzanita (Arctoshaphylos nevadensis), Saskatoon
serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia), sharpleaf snowberry
(Symphoricarpos mollis), Parish snowberry (S. parishii), huckleberry oak
(Quercus vaccinifolia), and bitter cherry (Prunus emarginata)
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].

Herbaceous associates include bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum),
feather Solomon's-seal (Smilacina racemosa), rockcress (Arabis
platysperma), Penstemon spp., fleabane (Erigeron breweri), and goosefoot
violet (Viola purpurea).  Grass associates are few but include crested
stipa (Stipa coronata var. depauperata), California needlegrass (S.
californica), bluebunch wheatgrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus
elymoides) [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Montane chaparral is seral to various coniferous forests [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Bush
chinquapin is an enhanced survivor in these early- to mid-seral
communities.  Its cover is greatest in the late mid-seral stage, when
tree canopy begins to close [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Bush chinquapin is moderately shade
tolerant and grows in the lower strata of near-climax open coniferous
forests.  When fire is excluded from coniferous forests for long periods
of time, bush chinquapin is shaded out [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].

Montane chaparral represents a topographic or edaphic climax on some
sites, such as steep, south-facing slopes or areas with shallow rocky
soil.  Bush chinquapin is considered part of climax vegetation on such
sites [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Plants flower continuously from July through September in most of their
range [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Bush chinquapin on the western edge of the Great Basin
bloom from June until the onset of winter [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Seed ripens in the late
summer or early fall of the second year of development [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].
Nuts open in mid-fall [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

<pre><center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Chrysolepis sempervirens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Bush chinquapin survives fire by sprouting from the roots, root crown,
and stump when aboveground portions of the plant have burned
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  Because bush chinquapin occurs in many plant communities,
natural fire regimes vary.  Thickets growing in rock outcrops escape
fire for long periods of time [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Plants in the understory of
coniferous forests historically burned often.  Mixed coniferous,
sequoia, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and Jeffrey pine forests
burned at 2- to 8-year intervals prior to fire suppression [<a href="#4">4</a>].
Frequent fire in these forests favors understories of bush chinquapin
over understories of coniferous seedlings [<a href="#23">23</a>].  High-elevation thickets
of bush chinquapin in the whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) cover type
typically escape burning for 50 to 300 years [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Small shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Geophyte, growing points deep in soil

<pre><center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Chrysolepis sempervirens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire top-kills bush chinquapin [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Very little research has been conducted on postfire recovery of bush
chinquapin.  Most sprouting schlerophyllous shrubs of California and
Oregon begin growth within weeks of fire, even when soils are dry [<a href="#10">10</a>].
Bush chinquapin presumably sprouts soon after fire.  Following a
wildfire of unreported severity in a mixed coniferous forest of the
Shasta-Trinity National Forest, bush chinquapin sprouts did not grow as
quickly as greenleaf manzanita seedlings but outcompeted snowbrush
ceanothus.  Bush chinquapin density at postfire year 5 was 9,650 plants
per acre (3,860 plants/ha), with plants averaging 1.7 feet (0.6 m) in
height.  There were no bush chinquapin seedlings present [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Reports
of seedling colonization of other burn sites were not found in the
literature.

Montane chaparral species, including bush chinquapin, recover from fire
more slowly than species of other types of chaparral due to the shorter
growing season [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Countryman [<a href="#11">11</a>] supplies data regarding characteristics of bush
chinquapin fuel, including ash content, density, surface-to-volume
ratio, heating value (Btu/lb), and weight of solvent extractives present
in leaves.  He also details fuelbed characteristics of bush chinquapin
and mixed bush chinquapin-mountain whitethorn-snowbush ceanothus stands,
including standing fuel loading and standing fuel vertical distribution,
dead fuel loading, and litter loading.  Carpenter [<a href="#6">6</a>] provides data
regarding seasonal moisture content of bush chinquapin leaves, twigs,
and stems.

Frequent fires in ponderosa or Jeffrey pine forests following logging
operations may convert these communities to montane chaparral [<a href="#23">23</a>].
