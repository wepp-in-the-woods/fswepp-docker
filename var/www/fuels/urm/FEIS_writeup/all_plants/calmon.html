<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Calamagrostis montanensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Plains reedgrass provides forage for sheep, cattle, and horses [<a href="#24">24</a>].  It
is also consumed by deer, elk, and small mammals [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Plains reedgrass coarse leaves are considered less palatable than most
prairie species it occurs with [<a href="#2">2</a>].  The relish and degree of use shown
by livestock and wildlife species for plains reedgrass in several
western states is rated as follows [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>]:

            CO       MT       ND       WY

Cattle     Fair     Fair     ----     Fair
Sheep      Fair     Fair     Fair     Fair
Horses     Fair     Fair     Fair     Fair
Elk        ----   Fair-Good  ----     ----
Deer       ----   Poor-Fair  ----     ----


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Plains reedgrass has been rated as fair in energy value and poor in
protein value [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The degree to which plains reedgrass provides environmental protection
during one or more seasons for wildlife species is rated as follows [<a href="#9">9</a>]:

                         MT       ND       WY

Pronghorn               ----     Poor     Poor   
Elk                     ----     ----     Poor
Mule deer               ----     Good     Poor   
White-tailed deer       ----     Good     Poor   
Small mammals           ----     ----     Fair
Small nongame birds     Fair     ----     ----   
Upland game birds       Fair     ----     ----   
Waterfowl               Poor     ----     ----   


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Because plains reedgrass is rhizomatous and exhibits aggressive growth
after disturbance, it can be used for erosion control.  It also has
potential for long-term revegetation of disturbed sites [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Grazing:  Plains reedgrass increases in response to grazing [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].  When
comparing grazed and ungrazed sites of a mixed-grass community, Brand
and Goetz [<a href="#4">4</a>] found that the average herbage production of plains
reedgrass on grazed rangeland was 41 times greater than on ungrazed
lands.

Herbicides:  Plains reedgrass increased in range areas after spraying
with 2,4-D [<a href="#6">6</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Calamagrostis montanensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Plains reedgrass is a native, cool-season, perennial grass [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].
The culms grow from 6 to 16 inches (15-40 cm) tall [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  The
mostly basal leaves have smooth sheaths and strongly rolled blades [<a href="#22">22</a>].
The rhizomes are slender with short paperish leaves at each node.  Roots
arise from the nodes and are similar to the rhizomes in thickness.
Maximum root-depth ranges from 3.28 to 4.92 feet (1-1.5 m) [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte
   Cryptophyte (Geophyte)


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Plains reedgrass regenerates sexually, and vegetatively through rhizomes
[<a href="#23">23</a>].  Specific information on seed dispersal and viability is lacking.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Plains reedgrass occurs on plains and dry open areas of grasslands,
sagebrush benchlands, and foothills from 4,800 to 8,500 feet
(1,463-2,591 m) in elevation [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  It grows in sandy loams,
loams, clay loams, and clayey soils [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].

Climate:  In areas where plains reedgrass commonly occurs, moisture is
usually available early in the growing season but later becomes limited.
Summers are marked by high temperatures and low humidity creating a dry
climate.  In winter, snowfall is considerable and temperatures may drop
to -20 degrees Fahrenheit (-29 deg C) [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Plant associates:  Plains reedgrass is commonly associated with the
following species:  needle-and-thread (Stipa comata), green needlegrass
(S. viridula), blue grama, prairie junegrass (Koeleria cristata),
bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata), rough fescue (Festuca
scrubrella), Idaho fescue (F. idahoensis), and threetip sagebrush
(Artemisia tripartita) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Plains reedgrass is an early seral to climax species.  It increases
following disturbance and commonly persists for several years.  On some
grazed ranges, plains reedgrass maintains subdominance with other
shortgrass species [<a href="#4">4</a>].  This grass also occurs in mixed prairie climax
communities dominated by Agropyron and Stipa spp. [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Plains reedgrass
abundance on sandy soils is generally an indicator of late seral stages [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Plains reedgrass growth begins in early April followed by the initiation
of fruiting stalks in late May [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Flowering generally begins in late
June to July and ends in August [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  Seeds mature in late July and
are shed in mid-August [<a href="#12">12</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Calamagrostis montanensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Plains reedgrass appears to be well adapted to periodic burning.
Postburn establishment quickly occurs through sprouting of on-site
surviving rhizomes and, presumably, through colonization from off-site
seed sources [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Calamagrostis montanensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Although fire will kill aboveground parts of plains reedgrass,
underground rhizomes survive even high-severity fires [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Even after high-severity fire, plains reedgrass will sprout vigorously
from on-site surviving rhizomes.  This grass provides more forage on
burned sites than on unburned sites [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Three years following an August sagebrush-grass fire on the upper Snake
River plains, Idaho, plains reedgrass exceeded its original density on
burned sites.  At postfire year 9 this grass was still producing
significantly more herbage on burned sites than on unburned sites [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Prescribed burning is a valuable management tool for range improvement
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  Herbage production of perennial grasses and forbs often
increase within a year after burning [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Burning favors rhizomatous
grasses such as plains reedgrass if plants are burned when dormant
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].  Range managers have suggested that grazing be deferred in burned
areas for at least 1 year to allow for the uninterrupted growth of
herbaceous vegetation [<a href="#5">5</a>].
