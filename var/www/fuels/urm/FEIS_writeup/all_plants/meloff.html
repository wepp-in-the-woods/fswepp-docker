<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Yellow sweetclover was introduced to North America from Europe in the
18th century as a forage crop species.  It is now pandemic in the United
States and nearly so in Canada, occurring more frequently in the
southern third [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Yellow sweetclover is found in a wide variety of habitats.  Clary and
Medin [<a href="#11">11</a>] reported yellow sweetclover as an important forb in riparian
zones dominated by Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratense) and bluebunch
wheatgrass (Pseudoregneria spicata).

Hopkins and others [<a href="#32">32</a>] reported that yellow sweetcover is an important
understory component of cottonwood (Populus spp.) woodlands.  The
overstory components are eastern cottonwood (P. deltoides var.
deltoides), Rocky Mountain juniper (Juniperus scopulorum), and green ash
(Fraxinus pensylvanica).

Girard and others [<a href="#28">28</a>] reported yellow sweetclover as a consistent,
important understory species in an eastern cottonwood/green ash
community type.  The other dominant overstory species is Rocky Mountain
juniper.  Important shrubs are wolfberry and wild rose (Rosa woodsii).
Dominant herbs are yellow sweetclover, veiny meadowrue (Thalictrum
venulosum), and false Solomon's seal (Smilacina stellata), with no
important grasses.  They also reported a similar community type in the
same series:  eastern cottonwood/Rocky Mountain juniper plus green ash,
with the same important shrubs.  The herb layer is dominated by yellow
sweetclover, poison ivy (Toxicodendron rydbergii), Canada wildrye
(Elymus canadensis), and daisyseed meadowrue (Thalictrum dasycarpum).
In addition, they reported a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)/Rocky
Mountain juniper habitat type with the shrub layer dominated by
wolfberry and the herb layer dominated by western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum
smithii), blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), and sedge.  Yellow
sweetclover is consistently present but not a major component of ground
cover.

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Eaten by most herbivores including elk, deer (all species), pronghorn,
and domestic livestock, yellow sweetclover is an important range,
forage, hay, and pasture species [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].  Yellow sweetclover will
comprise up to 35 percent of pronghorn diet [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Mule deer diet
consists of up to 77 percent yellow sweetclover in summer and early fall
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  Kufeld [<a href="#39">39</a>] and Mackie [<a href="#44">44</a>] rated sweetclover as
highly valuable for Rocky Mountain elk in summer and fall.

Yellow sweetclover is important to birds as cover and food, and is
planted with grass seed to improve sage grouse and prairie chicken
habitat [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  It is considered important nesting habitat for
dabbling ducks (mallard, gadwall, blue-winged teal) in hayland and
seeded fields [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Cropland adjustment program areas (fields left
fallow for wildlife habitat) in North Dakota containing yellow
sweetclover as a principal species with wheatgrasses (Agropyron spp.) or
brome grasses (Bromus spp.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) provide
habitat for pheasants, sharp-tailed grouse, greater prairie chickens,
American bitterns, marsh hawks (northern harriers), short-eared owls,
and many species of passerine birds [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].

A problem with yellow sweetclover as a hay crop is sweetclover bleeding
disease.  Coumarin, which is present is sweetclover and gives its bitter
taste, breaks down to dicoumarol when sweetclover becomes moldy.
Dicoumarol is a powerful anticoagulant and causes hemorrhage in cattle
(it is not as harmful to sheep or horses), and can result in death.
Sweetclover bleeding disease can be avoided by proper curing of
sweetclover hay and/or by interspersing the feeding of moldy hay with
other materials, as it takes several weeks of feeding moldy hay to cause
the disease.  Cultivars with reduced coumarin content are available
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].  Bloat can also be caused by yellow sweetclover but occurs less
frequently than with alfalfa (Medicago sativa) or clover (Trifolium
spp.) [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Yellow sweetclover has a bitter taste, making it less palatable to
cattle than other legumes.  It is more palatable in early spring and
summer, becoming woody in late summer and fall [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].

Palatability of yellow sweetclover for elk and deer is rated high in
spring and summer, and for pronghorn is rated medium in summer [<a href="#60">60</a>].

Palatability of yellow sweetclover in several western states has been
rated as follows [<a href="#17">17</a>]:

                UT      CO      WY      MT      ND
Cattle         fair    good    good    good    good
Sheep          fair    good    good    good    good
Horses         fair    fair    good    good    good


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Yellow sweetclover makes palatable and nutritious hay when properly
cured.  Protein content and digestible protein of yellow sweetclover hay
was reported as follows [<a href="#48">48</a>]:

crude protein                   15.0 %
digestible protein-cattle       10.2 %
                   goats        10.8 %

                   sheep        10.6 %


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Yellow sweetclover provides good cover for small mammals and birds
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Wildlife cover values for several western states are as
follows [<a href="#17">17</a>]:

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Yellow sweetclover grows rapidly and is easy to establish, therefore it
is widely used in grass and forb seed mixtures for stabilization of
disturbed sites such as road cuts, mining disturbances and mine spoils
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>] after any type of burn [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>], and for
rehabilitation of overgrazed rangeland [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Yellow sweetclover is often planted in grass/forb seed mixtures on range
sites, including pinyon (Pinus edulis)-juniper (Juniperus spp.)
communities, to improve forage production [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>], and for soil
improvement, to increase available soil nitrogen and to improve
drainage, aerate the soil, and increase water absorption in heavy clay
soils [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].

Yellow sweetclover is considered an excellent source of nectar for honey
production and also an excellent source of pollen [<a href="#62">62</a>].

Yellow sweetclover is used medicinally as a source of an anticoagulant
(dicoumarol and derivatives) used to reduce postsurgical blood clots
[<a href="#62">62</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Use of yellow sweetclover as an agricultural species has declined in
part due to its tendency to "volunteer" for years after planting and to
its weediness in colonizing disturbed sites.  It is considered a noxious
weed in some areas; its ability to colonize undisturbed habitat is
related to the amount of disturbed area (including roads) adjacent to
habitat and the amount of light penetrating to the understory [<a href="#26">26</a>].
Additional factors contributing to the decline in its use include:
stand establishment problems due to sweetclover weevil (Sitona
cylindricollis), bleeding disease, a decrease in rotation systems of
cropping, and the availability of inexpensive nitrogen fertilizers
[<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].

Control:  In an effort to restore native prairie, invading yellow
sweetclover is controlled with a combination of brush-hogging,
herbicides, and prescribed fire [<a href="#8">8</a>]. Yellow sweetclover is sensitive to
2,4-D, dicamba, tordon, aflon, nevuron, and dalapon.  It is more
difficult to kill with 2,4-D in the second year [<a href="#67">67</a>].


Establishment:  To provide habitat for dabbling duck nesting, it is
necessary to establish vigorous stands with the tallest, densest cover
form possible.  This can be achieved through a combination of prescribed
fire and planned grazing for native seedings, but mechanical tillage,
with reseeding every 2 years, is best to maintain introduced grasses and
legumes [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Prairie grouse habitat can be developed on cultivated
land by planting yellow sweetclover and leaving it undisturbed until
stand vigor declines, and then restoring it by tillage and replanting or
by prescribed fires [<a href="#36">36</a>].

If yellow sweetclover is to be used to convert sage range to grassland,
there needs to be a minimum of 11 inches (30 cm) of annual
precipitation.  It should be seeded in grass mixtures at a rate of 1 to
2 pounds of yellow sweetclover seed per acre (2.2 kg/ha) [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Love and
Jones [<a href="#42">42</a>] recommend a grazing rotation that includes no grazing the
first year; light grazing the second; grazing early in the third year
then removal of stock; a prescribed fire the fourth year, keeping stock
off; then a repeat of the cycle, with the fifth year as the second.
Removal of tops during the critical growth period in September reduces
root growth and top growth the following year.  No grazing or mowing
should be done during this time [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].  Nitrogen fertilizers are not
needed if sweetclover is inoculated with Rhizobium bacteria at seeding;
it does respond to phosphorous, potassium, and sulfur fertizilation
[<a href="#64">64</a>].

Elliot [<a href="#22">22</a>] found that yellow sweetclover does not affect seedling
survival of ponderosa pine and can be used as part of soil stabilization
seeding mixtures.

Rietveld [<a href="#56">56</a>] noted that the bunchgrasses contain a substance toxic to
germination of sweetclover, and that sweetclover roots contain
substances allelopathic to crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum),
Russian wildrye (Psathyrostachys juncea), intermediate wheatgrass
(Thinipyrum intermedium), smooth brome (Bromus inermis), and timothy
(Phleum pratense).

Diseases and Pests:  Some diseases of yellow sweetclover include root
rot (Phytophthora cactorum), brown root rot (Plenodomus meloliti),
common leaf spot (Pseudopeziza meliloti), and gray stem canker
(Ascochyta caulicola).  The 'Yukon' cultivar is resistant to brown root
rot and gray stem canker.  Common leaf spot is controlled by cutting
before defoliation becomes severe, and gray stem canker can be
controlled through crop rotation and cutting fields cleanly [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].

The primary pest of yellow sweetclover is the sweetclover weevil (Sitona
cylindricollis).  To avoid infestation, new stands should not be planted
adjacent to established stands.  Cultivars that are more resistant to
sweetclover weevil are available [<a href="#62">62</a>].  Other serious insect pests
include grasshoppers and cutworms, which can be controlled with poisoned
baits [<a href="#69">69</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Melilotus officinalis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Yellow sweetclover is 20 to 60 inches (50-150 cm) tall.  It is a
biennial legume, with a narrow root crown producing 1 to 10 upright
stems; short, erect rhizomes; a deep taproot; and adventitious roots
that extend the root diameter to 12 to 16 inches (30-40 cm) [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].
The roots form nodules when infected with Rhizobium bacteria, but no
mycorrhizal associates have been reported [<a href="#67">67</a>].
 
Yellow sweetclover will take up molybdenum at a higher rate than
grasses, maintaining a low copper to molybdenum ratio when grown on
sites with high concentrations of those metals [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Therophyte
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Yellow sweetclover reproduces by seed.  The seeds are "hard" (impervious
to water) and require scarification before germinating.  Natural
scarification occurs through freezing and thawing; passage through
animal digestive tract; or by fire.  The seeds remain viable for 40 or
more years, and can be either wind dispersed, carried by rainwater, or
carried by animals [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].  Yellow sweetclover is winter hardy, with
contractile roots that pull the crown 2 inches (5 cm) or more below the
soil surface in the fall.  No vegetative reproduction appears to occur
in this species [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Yellow sweetclover will grow on a wide variety of soil types and is
tolerant of saline and alkaline soils [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].  It is not tolerant
of acidic soils [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>].  Often found on disturbed sites, yellow
sweetclover can occupy a wide variety of sites, including roadsides,
railroad beds, sand bars, and prairie dog colonies [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>].  It is
highly drought tolerant; water stress is critical only for a short
period during germination [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].

Some common associates of sweetclover include white sweetclover
(Melilotus alba), quackgrass (Agropyron repens), wild carrot (Daucus
carota), black medic (Medicago lupulina), buckhorn plantain (Plantago
lanceolata), goldenrod (Solidago spp.), common dandelion (Taraxacum
officinale), milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), timothy, red clover
(Trifolium pratense), and white clover (T. repens) [<a href="#66">66</a>].

Associates of yellow sweetclover in riparian zones dominated by Kentucky
bluegrass (Poa pratense) are slender wheatgrass (Elymus trachycaulus
ssp. trachycaulus), sedge (Carex spp.), mannagrass (Glyceria spp),
Baltic rush (Juncus balticus), field horsetail (Equisetum arvense),
common yarrow (Achillea millefolium), Aster spp., clover (Trifolium
spp.), and lupine (Lupinus spp.) [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community species

Yellow sweetclover is not tolerant of shade.  In a study of secondary
succession in New Jersey, it was found only on newly abandoned fields (2
years) and not on older sites [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].  In a study of succession,
Eichhorn [<a href="#21">21</a>] found it in various cover percentages (not steadily
increasing or decreasing) up to 18 years following a wildfire in
Montana.  Rietveld [<a href="#56">56</a>] found yellow sweetclover as an invader species
in a ponderosa pine/bunchgrass community, able to colonize disturbed
areas.  If the ground surface is covered by perennial species, yellow
sweetclover tends to be eliminated, although it will persist on sites
that have periodic disturbances [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]

Roberts [<a href="#57">57</a>], in a seed bank study of secondary succession, found
sweetclover seeds only on early seral sites.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Germination of yellow sweetclover can occur at any time of year, with
the largest flush of new seedlings in March and April.  The first year
of growth involves a primary, branched stem and a primary root,
sometimes branched.  Yellow sweetclover only rarely flowers the first
year.  The first year is characterized by rapid top growth through late
summer, then a critical growth phase that occurs in mid-September, in
which carbohydrates and nitrogen are transferred to the roots.  During
this phase and into winter dormancy the crown buds become enlarged and
conspicuous.  First year shoots die back with freezing temperatures
[<a href="#67">67</a>].

The second year of growth begins in early spring with rapid growth from
the crown buds or rhizomes, using the previous fall-accumulated
reserves, which are not replenished.  Flowering begins in May and June,
continuing through frost, with seed set in June and July [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Melilotus officinalis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fire scarifies the seed coat of yellow sweetclover, increasing
germination.  Yellow sweetclover will colonize areas disturbed by fire
[<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Melilotus officinalis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire can damage tissues of yellow sweetclover, particularly the crown
buds of second-year plants.  If these are killed by an early spring
fire, the plant cannot produce any new stems.  Fire can kill or injure
stems at the base [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Fire kill of the crown buds of second year effectively kills the plant.
Death or injury to branched stems at the base will severely retard new
growth; once the crown buds have expanded, new growth occur from the tip
of branches and from buds in branch axils.  No additional top growth
will occur after stems have been severed or killed below the axil of the
lowest lateral branch.  An early May fire appears to result in a
decrease in second-year plants and an increase in first-year plants.  A
July fire appears to decrease both first and second year plants, and a
fall burn results in increased winter mortality if it occurs at or
before the critical growth period [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Burning aids establishment of yellow sweetclover on grassland, probably
because it aids germination of seeds through scarification and by
creating openings in which sweetclover can establish. If the management
goal is to establish yellow sweetclover, then an early spring fire would
be recommended [<a href="#30">30</a>].

If the management goal is to suppress yellow sweetclover, there are
three strategies that may achieve that objective.  The first strategy is
an annual early May fire once the second-year shoots are visible.  The
second strategy involves burning every second year in July before the
second-year plants have ripened seed.  The third strategy is to burn
annually near the beginning of the critical growth period.  Whether the
presence of the sweetclover is more damaging than the fire regime to the
management objectives is a question that should be considered.  A
rotational scheme of this type of management is recommended:  divide the
area into plots that undergo different treatments and alter treatments
over time [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].
