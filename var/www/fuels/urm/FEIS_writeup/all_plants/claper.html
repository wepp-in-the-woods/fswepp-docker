<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Claytonia perfoliata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Miner's-lettuce is preferred by cattle in blue oak (Quercus douglasii)
savannas in California [<a href="#5">5</a>].  It is also grazed by pocket gophers [<a href="#6">6</a>].
Mourning doves, California quail, and other seed-eating birds consume
the fruits [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>]. 


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The nutritional composition of miner's-lettuce has been determined to be
37.1 percent protein, 42.5 percent total carbohydrate, and 12.4 percent
crude fiber.  The calcium:phosphorus ratio is 0.66:1.0 [<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The blossoms, leaves, and stems of miner's-lettuce may be eaten by
humans at any time during the growing season.  They are eaten raw or
cooked, and are a good source of vitamin C [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  Historically,
miner's-lettuce was used as a salad plant and potherb by white settlers
and Native Americans [<a href="#19">19</a>].  It was also used to avert or cure scurvy
[<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In California, density and overall yield of miner's-lettuce is greater
in bracken fern communities than in surrounding grasslands [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].
This may be due to increased moisture availability in winter and early
spring, when bracken fern is dormant [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Miner's-lettuce is a host to the beet western yellows virus, which is
spread by aphids [<a href="#43">43</a>].  

Purslane sawfly larvae, which consume the seeds, afford some biological
control over miner's lettuce [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Claytonia perfoliata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Miner's-lettuce is a native winter or spring annual.  It is branched
from the base with stems growing up to 14 inches (35 cm) tall.  Leaves
are mostly basal, simple, and 2.4 to 8.0 inches (6-20 cm) long,
including the stalk.  Miner's-lettuce has two stem leaves that fuse to
form a disc just below the flower stalk.  The elongate stalk bears
numerous small flowers.  Fruits are tiny, three-valved capsules
containing one to three seeds.  Roots are fibrous [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Therophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Miner's-lettuce reproduces by seed [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Selfing is the most
common method of pollination, but insect pollination also occurs.  Seeds
are dispersed by explosive dehiscence.  They are capable of immediate
germination [<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Miner's-lettuce usually occurs on moist or vernally moist sites
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Miller [<a href="#39">39</a>] reported it from a variety of substrates
including river silt, sand, gravel, road tar, loam, rock crevices,
talus, and scree.  He also found it on burned sites.  Some polyploids
occur on specialized, distinctive sites.  The Columbia River Gorge
octoploid, for example, occurs only on north-facing basalt talus slopes
or cliff faces.  Other polyploids are more plastic in site requirements
[<a href="#40">40</a>].

In California, miner's-lettuce is most common below 6,500 feet (2,000 m)
[<a href="#38">38</a>]; in Arizona it grows at elevations of 2,500 to 7,500 feet
(750-2,270 m) [<a href="#19">19</a>]; in Utah it grows at elevations of 2,600 to 10,890
feet (800-3,300 m) [<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Miner's-lettuce occurs in all seral stages.  It often colonizes
disturbed sites, particularly following fire [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Miner's lettuce
is also found on virgin fields dominated by bluebunch wheatgrass
(Pseudoroegneria spicata) and Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda) in
southeastern Washington [<a href="#8">8</a>].  However, miner's-lettuce is shade tolerant
[<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>] and is more prominent under a canopy than in openings in oak
savanna, western white pine (Pinus monticola), and antelope bitterbrush
(Purshia tridentata) communities [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Time from germination to flowering varied from 33 to 90 days in a
Columbia River Gorge population [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Miner's-lettuce flowers from
February to May in Arizona and California [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  In Utah, it flowers
from June to July [<a href="#1">1</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Miner's-lettuce has long-lived seeds that are stored in the soil [<a href="#33">33</a>]
and germinate following fire [<a href="#34">34</a>].  It is a prolific seeder [<a href="#24">24</a>]; mass
flowering in the years immediately following a fire recharges the
seedbank [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Miner's-lettuce can develop high cover on exposed soil
in full sun [<a href="#31">31</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Miner's-lettuce is probably killed by fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Miner's-lettuce was present in the first growing season after the
stand-destroying Marble-Cone wildfire in the Santa Lucia Range of
California in August 1977.  Peak cover was reached in postfire year 2
and declined by postfire year 3.  Percent frequency of miner's-lettuce
on two study sites that had been dominated by Coulter pine follows [<a href="#16">16</a>]:
 
                   Site                  1978      1979      1980
                   ______________________________________________

                   Chews Ridge site 2       7        48         2

Miner's-lettuce is common in recently burned chaparral [<a href="#20">20</a>].  A year
after a fire in chaparral in the Sierra Nevada foothills,
miner's-lettuce had high seed production on moist north-east slopes.
Postfire cover quickly exceeded prefire levels [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Miner's-lettuce
was also present the year following a severe fire in a chaparral
riparian zone in the Los Padres National Forest, California, but its
frequency was reduced by postfire year 2 [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Miner's-lettuce is also common after fire in more northern portions of
its range.  It was present in the first growing season after a fall
wildfire in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) stands in the
Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, Idaho, and had increased in frequency by
postfire year 3 [<a href="#25">25</a>].  In burned ponderosa pine shelterwood cut units in Idaho,
miner's-lettuce was present in postfire year 1 on sites burned with dry fuels,
but was not present on sites burned with moist fuels.  It also was
not present in the preburn vegetation or in unburned control plots [<a href="#30">30</a>].
Miner's-lettuce was present in the first growing season following the
stand-destroying Pattee Canyon wildfire in a Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
menziesii)/ninebark (Physocarpus malvaceus) habitat type in west-central
Montana [<a href="#7">7</a>].  It was still present in the herbaceous layer 10 years
later [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Basin big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata spp. tridentata)-Idaho fescue
(Festuca idahoensis)-bluebunch wheatgrass communities at the John Day
Fossil Beds National Monument in eastern Oregon were burned in the
spring and fall.  Although not in the preburn vegetation,
miner's-lettuce was present in trace amounts (less than 2% frequency)
the summer after the fall prescribed fire.  It was not present after the
spring fire or in control plots [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Miner's-lettuce establishes after fire in disturbed and climax
grasslands in southeastern Washington [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Rapid growth of miner's-lettuce after fire in chaparral in the Sierra
Nevada foothills contributes to an increased food supply for flocking
bird species such as mourning dove and western meadowlark [<a href="#24">24</a>].
