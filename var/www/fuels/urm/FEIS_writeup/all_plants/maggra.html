<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Magnolia grandiflora
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
The hard, heavy wood of southern magnolia is used to make furniture,
pallets, and veneer [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Southern magnolia seeds are eaten by squirrels, opossum, quail, and the
wild turkey [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Southern magnolia provides cover for many small birds and mammals [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Southern magnolia is a valuable and extensively planted ornamental.  The
leaves, fruit, bark, and wood yield a variety of extracts with potential
applications as pharmaceuticals [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Southern magnolia is a good
urban landscape tree because it is resistant to acid deposition [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Winter drought can cause extensive dieback and mortality of southern
magnolia.  Seedlings are susceptible to frost damage; even a light
freeze can cause mortality.  A number of Fomes and Polyporus fungi cause
heartrot in southern magnolia.  Heavy infestations of magnolia scale
(Neolecanium cornuparyum) kill branches or entire trees [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Magnolia grandiflora
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Southern magnolia is a fast-growing, medium-sized, native evergreen tree
that grows 60 to 90 feet (18-27 m) tall [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  The large, white
flowers are perfect and fragrant.  The seeds are drupelike with a soft,
fleshy outer seed coat and an inner stony portion.  Southern magnolia
develops a deep taproot.  As trees grow the root structure changes.
Trees of sapling stage and beyond have a rather extensive root system.
Older trees develop a fluted base with the ridges corresponding to the
attachment of major lateral roots [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (mesophanerophyte)
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (microphanerophyte)
   Burned or Clipped State:  Cryptophyte (geophtye)


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Southern magnolia is a prolific seed producer, and good seed crops
usually are produced every year.  Trees as young as 10 years can produce
seed, but optimum seed production does not occur until age 25.  Cleaned
seeds range from 5,800 to 6,800/pound (12,800-15,000/kg).  Seed
viability averages about 50 percent.  The relatively heavy seeds are
disseminated by birds and mammals, but some may be spread by heavy rains
[<a href="#24">24</a>].  Southern magnolia is pollinated by insects [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Southern magnolia grows best on rich, loamy, moist soils along streams
and near swamps in the Coastal Plain [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  It grows also on mesic
upland sites where fire is rare.  Although primarily a bottomland
species, southern magnolia cannot withstand prolonged inundation;
consequently, it is found mostly on alluvium and outwash sites [<a href="#24">24</a>].  No
part of its range is higher than 500 feet (150 m) in elevation and most
of it is less than 200 feet (60 m).  Coastal areas within its range are
less than 100 feet (30 m) above sea level.  In the northern parts of its
range in Georgia and Mississippi, it is found at elevations of 300 to
400 feet (90-120 m) [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  In additon to those listed under under
Distribution and Occurrence, common overstory associates include
American beech (Fagus grandifolia), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua),
yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), live oak (Quercus virginiana),
southern red oak (Q. falcata), white oak (Q. alba), mockernut hickory
(Carya tomentosa), and pignut hickory (C. glabra).  Some common
understory associates include flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), swamp
dogwood (C. stricta), strawberry-bush (Euonymus americanus), southern
bayberry (Myrica cerifera), Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus
quinquefolia), greenbrier (Smilax spp.), and grape (Vitis spp.) [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].
 


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Southern magnolia is moderately tolerant of shade.  It can endure
considerable shade in early life but needs more light as it becomes
older [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Southern magnolia will invade pine or hardwood stands and
is able to reproduce under a closed canopy.  It will not reproduce under
its own shade.  Once established, it can maintain or increase its
presence in stands by sprouts and seedlings that grow up through
openings, which occur sporadically in the canopy [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Southern
magnolia has been migrating onto mesic upland sites and establishing
itself, along with associated hardwoods, as part of the climax forest
[<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].



<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Southern magnolia flowers between April and June; its fruit ripens from
September through late fall [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Magnolia grandiflora
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Southern magnolia is well adapted to fire.  Although the bark is
relatively thin, the cork layer underneath the bark does not burn easily
and is relatively resistant to heat [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by animals or water; postfire yr 1&2






</pre>

<pre>
<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Magnolia grandiflora
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Southern magnolia seedlings are easily killed by fire.  Older trees, due
to bark characteristics, are quite fire resistant.  Plants sprout
vigorously when top-killed by fire [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Southern magnolia sprouts from surviving root collars following fire [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Where fire is surpressed or infrequent, southern magnolia and live oak
can become dominant species in the southern mixed hardwood forests.  The
transition from an open, fire-dominated forest to a closed-canopy,
deciduous forest favors the Quercus-Magnolia climax community [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].
