<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Sacahuista is commonly found in the understory of pinyon pine (Pinus
spp.), juniper (Juniperus spp.), scrub oak (Quercus spp.), and
Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  In the shrub layer,
sacahuista is associated with sotol (Dasylirion wheeleri), skunkbush
(Rhus trilobata), datil yucca (Yucca baccata), sandpaper bush (Mortonia
scabrella), and creosotebush (Larrea spp.) [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].

Sacahuista is listed as an indicator or dominant species in the
following community type (cts) and plant association (pas)
classifications:

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Nolina microcarpa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Sacahuista has little value for livestock.  Cattle graze the foliage
only in times of drought.  If they are forced to make extensive use of
the plant they may be poisoned [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Sacahuista is habituative and
extremely toxic to sheep and goats.  Toxicosis results in loss of
appetite, depression, and death within 3 to 10 days from
photosensitization, hyperbilirubinemia (excess amounts of bile pigment
in the blood stream), and renal damage or renal failure [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Deer (Odocoileus spp.), however, can consume large portions of
sacahuista seasonally, with no apparent ill effect.  The flower heads
and stalks comprise 12 percent and 10 percent of white-tailed deer (O.
virginianus) and mule deer (O. hemionus) diets, respectively, from May
to June [<a href="#2">2</a>].  The foliage is used by both species in drought years [<a href="#30">30</a>],
but in moist years only mule deer browse the foliage, usually for a
brief time in the spring [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability of sacahuista is generally poor for wildlife and livestock.
The succulent new growth is the most palatable to cattle and mule deer
[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  The palatability of sacahuista to livestock and wildlife
species in several western states has been rated as follows [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>]:

                         AZ     NV     NM     TX

Cattle                  Poor   Poor   Poor   Poor
Mule deer               Fair   Fair   Fair   Fair
White-tailed deer       Poor   Poor   Poor   Poor


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Urness and McCulloch [<a href="#30">30</a>] compared the nutritional values of the forage
species common in Arizonia chaparral; their results showed sacahuista to
be of poor nutritional quality.  Protein composition of sacahuista was
the lowest of the species sampled.  Phosphorus:calcium ratio was 1:4,
which is indicative of a nutritionally poor forage species, due to the
supression of phosphorus uptake from excess calcium.

Catlin [<a href="#8">8</a>] reported the nutritional values for sacahuista in the spring
as follows:

N2-Free                     Crude         Crude          
Extract       Ash           Protein        Fiber           Fat
                        (percent composition)

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Native Americans used sacahuista foliage to weave baskets and mats [<a href="#18">18</a>]
and ate the flower stalks and caudex raw, boiled, or roasted [<a href="#17">17</a>].

During World War II, sacahuista was discovered to have commerical value
as a source of fiber.  Since then, it has been harvested in Arizona, New
Mexico, and northern Mexico.  The fiber is used as a substitute for
broomstraw in the production of corn brooms [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Sacahuista can be used as an indicator of range condition.  Darrow [<a href="#9">9</a>]
reported the following indicator values for Arizona rangeland:

Range Condition                   Indication

Good                              Flower stalks selectively browsed
                                  and foliage exhibits no cropping

Fair                              No flower stalks, and foliage
                                  shows signs of cropping

Poor                              Pure stands of sacahuista are 
                                  noticeably hedged

When planning grazing allotments the land manager should inform the
livestock owner of the presence of sacahuista and the danger of
toxicosis.  Preliminary evidence suggests that an oral treatment with an
aqueaus zinc sulfate at 0.0235 ounces per pound (30 mg/kg) of body
weight may be an effective prophylactic as well as a therapy for
toxicosis in sheep [<a href="#27">27</a>].

The commerical harvest of wild sacahuista stands on public and private
lands every 18 to 22 months yields approximately 38,175 pounds per acre
(42,750 kg/ha) of foliage [<a href="#18">18</a>].  This harvest increases available forage
for cattle and deer by opening areas for more desirable forage species
and increasing the production of new, succulent sacahuista foliage
[<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Nolina microcarpa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sacahuista is a long-lived, perennial, evergreen, monocot half shrub
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  The plant has a basal rosette of long, narrow leaves from a
large, underground, woody caudex that sends up flower stalks 8.2 feet
(2.5 m) in height [<a href="#24">24</a>].  The flower head is a densely flowered, terminal
panicle; the fruit is a three-lobed capsule [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (microphanerophyte).
   Burned or clipped state:  Hemicryptophyte.


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sacahuista reproduces sexually [<a href="#17">17</a>], and it resprouts from the woody
caudex [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sacahuista achieves dominance on the more mesic slopes and flats above
5,000 feet (1,515 m) in the arid Southwest [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Soils:  Sacahuista occurs in the Alfisol, Aridisol, Entisol, and
Mollisol soil orders [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Climate:  Sacahuista inhabits areas where the winters are short and mild
and the summers are long and hot.  The annual precipitation is 12 to 18
inches (25-45 cm) per year, with the majority of it falling in the
summer [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].

Elevation:  Sacahuista grows at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 6,500
feet (900-1,970 m) [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Sacahuista is a member of the climax vegetation of the pinyon-juniper
woodland but also has qualities of an invader.  It increases in response
to grazing and increases under a regime of fire suppression [<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Sacahuista flowers fom May to June depending on latitude and elevation
[<a href="#17">17</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Nolina microcarpa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Sacahuista resprouts from the woody, underground caudex after a fire
[<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex

<pre>
<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Nolina microcarpa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
The immediate effect of fire on sacahuista is partial or complete crown
removal, depending on fire severity [<a href="#32">32</a>].  A cool fire will remove part
of the crown and result in little or no mortality of mature plants, and
a minor loss of young plants.  A moderate to hot fire results in a high
loss of young plants, and greater than 10 percent mortality of mature
plants [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
Mature plants have large amounts of cured foliage which burns hot.  The
heat influx or burning of the caudex can severely damage or kill the
plant [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
After a moderate fire in an oak/juniper woodland, sacahuista was much
reduced.  Ten percent of the mature plants died immediately after the
fire, and another 10 percent succumbed after a feeble attempt to
resprout.  Another 15 percent were in such a weakened condition that
survival after the study was doubtful.  Two years after the fire, only
13 percent had fully recovered [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fire can be an effective tool for improving range quality by deterring
the spread of sacahuista [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Fire would open up the range for the
growth of more desirable forage plants for livestock and wildlife [<a href="#32">32</a>].
