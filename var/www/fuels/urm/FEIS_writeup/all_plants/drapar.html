<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Dracocephalum parviflorum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
American dragonhead is a native annual, biennial, or short-lived
perennial forb.  Solitary or clustered stems arise from a taproot and
are 6 to 32 inches (15-80 cm) tall [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Leaves are coarsely serrate and
flowers are crowded in a dense terminal or axillary cluster.  The fruits
are nutlets [<a href="#29">29</a>].  


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
American dragonhead is a seedbanking species.  Seeds are large and are
not wind-dispersed.  Buried seeds remain viable for a long period of
time [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Seeds require fire or other disturbance for germination
[<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
American dragonhead commonly grows on open, moist sites [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>] and in
disturbed areas [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  In the Great Plains it grows on gravelly
soils along streams, in open woodlands, or on moist wooded hillsides
[<a href="#15">15</a>].  In the Northeast, American dragonhead is found on rocky or
gravelly calcareous soils in recently cleared areas [<a href="#12">12</a>].  It occurs
from 4,500 to 10,000 feet (1,360-3,000 m) elevation in Colorado [<a href="#16">16</a>],
and from 4,850 to 10,890 feet (1,470-3,300 m) elevation in Utah [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Some species commonly associated with American dragonhead include russet
buffaloberry (Shepherdia canadensis), Oregon-grape (Mahonia repens),
snowberry (Symphoricarpos spp.), serviceberry (Amelanchier spp.), western
yarrow (Achillea millefolium), strawberry (Fragaria spp.), heartleaf
arnica (Arnica cordifolia), fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium), Bicknell
geranium (Geranium bicknellii), and wild hollyhock (Iliamna rivularis)
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

American dragonhead is prominent in initial or early successional
communities following disturbance [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Its seedbanking ability allows
colonization of disturbed areas even when no parent plants are present
[<a href="#13">13</a>].  American dragonhead has usually disappeared or declined in
importance within the first few years following disturbance [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
American dragonhead flowers from June to August in the Intermountain
region [<a href="#8">8</a>], and from June to September in the Great Plains [<a href="#15">15</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Dracocephalum parviflorum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Seedbanked American dragonhead seeds are fire activated, germinating
after even severe fire [<a href="#22">22</a>].  American dragonhead flowers during the
first few postfire years.  New seeds remain dormant in the soil until
the next stand-replacing fire or other disturbance occurs [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)
   Secondary colonizer - on-site seed

<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>

<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
American dragonhead is a residual colonizer that is prominent in initial
postfire communities, even after holocaustic fires [<a href="#26">26</a>].

After fire in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) habitats in central
Idaho, American dragonhead dominated the initial postfire vegetation.
Plants were absent from preburn communities and adjacent 20-year-old
burns.  Frequencies in postfire years 1 and 2 were 96 and 100 percent,
respectively.  American dragonhead comprised 30 percent of all plant
cover in the first postfire year and 37 percent of all cover in the
second postfire year.  It's cover was greatly reduced by the third
growing season following the fire [<a href="#21">21</a>].

In ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) types in the Black Hills of South
Dakota, American dragonhead exhibited initial postfire prominence but
disappeared or greatly declined in importance by the second or third
postfire growing season [<a href="#23">23</a>].  It showed the same response in jack pine
(Pinus banksiana) habitats in Saskatchewan [<a href="#6">6</a>], white spruce (Picea
glauca) habitats in Alaska [<a href="#28">28</a>], quaking aspen (Populus
tremuloides)-mixed conifer types in Idaho [<a href="#5">5</a>], and in Douglas-fir
habitats in western Montana [<a href="#7">7</a>].  American dragonhead was present in
4-year-old and 29-year-old burns in pinyon (Pinus spp.)-juniper
(Juniperus spp.) habitats in Colorado, but cover was sparse [<a href="#10">10</a>].  It
played an important role in early succession after severe fires in fir
(Abies spp.)-spruce (Picea spp.) habitats in Grand Teton National Park,
Wyoming, but disappeared within 43 postfire years [<a href="#2">2</a>].  American
dragonhead had greater density in moderately-burned stands compared to
severely-burned lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands in Yellowstone
National Park [<a href="#1">1</a>].
