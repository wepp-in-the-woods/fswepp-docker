The scientific name of foxtail pine is <i>Pinus balfouriana</i> Grev. &amp; Balf. 
(Pinaceae). There are 2 subspecies [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]:

<p><i>Pinus balfouriana </i>ssp.<i> austrina </i>R.J. &amp; J.D. Mastrogiuseppe&nbsp; 
southern foxtail pine<br>
<i>Pinus balfouriana</i> ssp.<i> balfouriana&nbsp; </i>northern foxtail pine</p>

<p>Foxtail pine, 
<a href="../pinlon/all.html">Great Basin bristlecone pine</a> (<i>P. longaeva</i>), and 
<a href="../pinari/all.html">Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine</a> (<i>P. aristata</i>)
share a common ancestor [<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>]. Taxa within the 
foxtail-bristlecone pine complex (<i>Pinus</i>, subgenus <i>Strobus</i>, section
<i>Parrya</i>, subsection <i>Balfourianae</i>) are distinguished by growth 
form, bark, and  differences in chemical composition 
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>]; however, 
these  characters intergrade [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]. 
Foxtail and bristlecone pines readily produce fertile hybrids in the laboratory [<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>]. 
Disjunct distributions, and possibly other factors, prevent natural hybridization among the 4 taxa. Southern 
foxtail and Great Basin bristlecone pine populations seem geographically close enough for 
limited pollen dispersal 
(see <a href="all.html#GENERAL DISTRIBUTION">General Distribution</a>); yet to 
date (2004), southern foxtail <font face="Times New Roman">�

Foxtail pine is  endemic to California. There is a 300-mile (480-km) gap in the distributions of the 2 subspecies. 
Southern foxtail pine
occurs in the high southern Sierra Nevada of Fresno, Tulare, and Inyo counties. 
Its distribution lies within Sequoia and 
Inyo National Forests and Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park. Highest 
population concentrations are in Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park, the center 
of most research on southern foxtail pine. Northern foxtail pine
occurs in the high North Coast and Klamath ranges in Siskiyou, Trinity, Shasta, 
and Tehama counties. Northern foxtail pine's distribution lies within the Klamath, Shasta, 
Trinity, and Mendocino National Forests, including the Marble Mountain, Yolla-Bolly-Middle Eel, 
and Trinity Alps Wilderness Areas [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>]. 
Southern and northern foxtail pines have 
probably been separated since major upliftings of the Sierra Nevada during the 
early Pleistocene [<a href="#8">8</a>]. Inyo Valley, located between 
the southern Sierra Nevada and the White Mountains, creates a 20-mile-wide (32-km) 
gap between southern foxtail  and Great Basin bristlecone pine populations [<a href="#26">26</a>].
<a href="https://climchange.cr.usgs.gov/data/atlas/little/">The U.S. Geological Survey</a> provides a distributional 
map of southern and northern foxtail pines.

<b>Southern foxtail pine</b> is the dominant conifer in upper-elevation 
subalpine communities of the south-central Sierra Nevada [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>].&nbsp;It is the 
most abundant subalpine conifer in Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park 
[<a href="#10">10</a>]. Southern foxtail pine often occurs in pure 
stands [<a href="#63">63</a>]. California red fir (<i>Abies magnifica</i> var. <i>magnifica</i>),  Sierra juniper 
(<i>Juniperus occidentalis</i> ssp. <i>australis</i>), Sierra lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i> var. <i>murrayana</i>), 
Jeffrey pine (<i>P. 
jeffreyi</i>), and limber pine (<i>P. flexilis</i>) may associate on low-elevation foxtail pine sites, while whitebark pine 
(<i>P. albicaulis</i>) may associate on high-elevation sites [<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>]. The most common 
shrub associates in 
southern foxtail pine communities are bush chinquapin (<i>Chrysolepis sempervirens</i>), 
oceanspray (<i>Holodiscus discolor</i>), wax currant (<i>Ribes cereum</i>),  gooseberry currant (<i>R. montigenum</i>), 
Parish's snowberry 
(<i>Symphoricarpos rotundifolius</i> var. <i>parishii</i>), and curlleaf mountain-mahogany 
(<i>Cercocarpus ledifolius</i>) [<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>]. Pinemat manzanita (<i>Arctostaphylos nevadensis</i>), 
green manzanita (<i>A. patula</i>), and bitter cherry (<i>Prunus emarginata</i>) may also be present [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. 

<p>In Sequoia-King Canyon National Park, Vankat [<a href="#106">106</a>] found less than one-fourth of southern foxtail pine communities 
contained shrubs. Herbaceous cover averaged around 10%, although some stands showed 
as much as 65% herbaceous cover. Tree cover was almost entirely foxtail pine; a few stands also had Sierra lodgepole pine. 
Bush chinquapin and 
oceanspray were the most common shrubs. Shrub associates are more common on marginal foxtail pine 
sites than in Sequoia-Kings Canyon, which is prime foxtail habitat. Southern monardella (<i>Monardella australis</i>) 
is the most consistent herbaceous associate across southern foxtail pine's range [<a href="#82">82</a>]. At their lowest elevations, 
southern foxtail pine communities merge with upper-elevation Sierra lodgepole pine or, more rarely, 
east-slope Jeffrey pine 
communities. Southern foxtail pine communities often 
form a mosaic with subalpine meadows [<a href="#15">15</a>]. At their highest elevations, southern foxtail pine communities merge into 
alpine meadows and fell-fields [<a href="#44">44</a>].</p>

<p>The Klamath Ranges support some of the most diverse plant communities in North 
America [<a href="#86">86</a>], and <b>northern foxtail pine </b>contributes to this diversity.  Northern foxtail communities are 
typically more diverse compared to southern foxtail pine communities [<a href="#67">67</a>].        Eckert and Sawyer [<a href="#30">30</a>] found that 
along a latitudinal gradient, diversity of northern foxtail pine communities increased 
to the north. Lowest diversity occurred in the southern Yolla Bolly Mountains, the 
southernmost of the Klamath ranges, while highest diversity occurred in the 
Trinity and Marble mountains, the northernmost of the Klamath ranges. 
Northern foxtail pine generally dominates on subalpine 
<a href="../../../glossary.html#SERPENTINE SOILS:">serpentine soils</a>.
Whitebark pine or mountain hemlock (<i>Tsuga mertensiana</i>) may 
associate on upper-elevation sites, although they are more common on nonserpentine 
soils [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. Northern foxtail pine communities on 
serpentine, other 
<a href="../../../glossary.html#ULTRAMAFIC SOILS:">ultramafic</a>,
or dry soils often form a mosaic with whitebark 
pine-mountain hemlock or mountain hemlock-Brewer spruce (<i>Picea 
breweriana</i>) communities that occur on nonserpentine or wetter, 
north-slope soils [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>]. Jeffrey pine and Sierra lodgepole pine may associate  on 
dry (south and west aspects), mid-subalpine sites (&lt;2,200 m), while Shasta red fir (<i>Abies magnifica</i> var.
<i>shastensis</i>) and western white pine may associate on 
wetter, mid-subalpine sites [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]. 
Western white pine or white fir (<i>A. concolor</i>) associate on lowest-elevation 
subalpine sites [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>].&nbsp; Incense-cedar (<i>Calocedrus decurrens</i>) and 
coast Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> var. <i>menziesii</i>) may be 
occasional associates at these lower elevations [<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. Northern foxtail pine 
communities merge with coast Douglas-fir, Sierra lodgepole pine, or mixed-conifer forest 
communities at their lowest 
elevations and with alpine fell-field or 
alpine meadow&nbsp;communities at highest 
elevations [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>].</p>

<p>In the Trinity Mountains on the Siskiyou-Trinity county line, northern foxtail pine occurs 
in pure stands at timberline. 
Shasta red fir, western white pine, and Jeffrey pine associate on mid-subalpine 
sites. Trinity 
buckwheat (<i>Eriogonum alpinum</i>), pinemat manzanita, big sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i>), and 
huckleberry oak (<i>Quercus 
vaccinifolia</i>)  occur in the understory. Ground-layer associates include cobwebby paintbrush (<i>Castilleja arachnoidea</i>), 
Cascade aster (<i>Eucephalus 
ledophyllus</i>), spreading phlox (<i>Phlox diffusa</i>), and bottlebrush 
squirrel (<i>Elymus elymoides</i>) [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>]. Unusually diverse northern foxtail 
communities exist on China and Russian peaks, where northern foxtail pine 
associates with Jeffrey pine, incense-cedar, and Pacific Douglas-fir [<a href="#85">85</a>].</p>

Holland [<a href="#44">44</a>], Rundel and others [<a href="#81">81</a>], and Sawyer and  Thornburgh [<a href="#86">86</a>] provide vegetation typings describing foxtail pine 
communities.

Foxtail pine is a native conifer. It is a low-growing pine, generally 20 to 50 
feet (6-15 m) tall, but occasionally reaching 72+ feet (22+ m) in height [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>]. The 
champion tree is a northern foxtail pine on the Trinity National Forest that 
measures 76 feet (23 m) in height, 34 feet (10 m) in spread, and 26.3 feet (8 m) in 
circumference [<a href="#2">2</a>]. Foxtail pine's trunk is usually single-stemmed. Unlike other 
North American conifers, foxtail pine rarely assumes krummholz form at high 
elevations; instead, it retains a straight bole [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>]. 
 Bark of mature foxtail pine is &quot;exceptionally thick&quot; [<a href="#8">8</a>]: 
nearly as thick as that of ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>). Bark thickness measurements of 
1.85 inches (4.70 cm) [<a href="#45">45</a>] and 2.4 to 3.1 inches (6-8 cm) [<a href="#8">8</a>]  are reported for 
mature foxtail pines. Mature tree crowns are 8.5 feet (2.6 m) or less in diameter. 
Branches are short and thick in diameter [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>]. Branching 
habit is sparse in southern foxtail pine [<a href="#59">59</a>]; southern foxtail pine also 
tends to be self-pruning. Northern foxtail pine branches tend to be thicker, and 
may extend to the ground [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>] (the photos in the 
<a href="all.html#INTRODUCTORY">Introductory</a> 
section illustrate this difference).
Foxtail is a 5-needle pine. The <i>Balfourianae</i> complex is unique among pines in that about half of 
their branches originate from within the needle fascicles [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>]. Needle clusters are thickly 
set toward the branch ends, resembling foxtails [<a href="#58">58</a>]. Needles persist for 
5 to 7+ years [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>]; trees at lower elevations tend to retain 
needles longer than trees at timberline [<a href="#64">64</a>]. Female cones are 2.4 to 7.5 
inches (6-19 cm) long, 
dehiscent, and have tiny prickles. Seeds are&nbsp;small (~0.3 inch (8 mm) long), with 
detachable seed wings 
about 3 times longer than the seeds [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>]. Northern foxtail pines tend to have 
heavier cones and larger seeds with longer seed wings than southern foxtail pines 
[<a href="#66">66</a>].

<p>Morphological differences between 
southern foxtail pine, northern foxtail pine, 
and Great Basin bristlecone pine are slight. Southern foxtail pine has thinner 
bark that tends to grow in square plates (pictured above right) compared to 
northern foxtail pine, which has relatively thicker bark that tends to grow in 
narrow ridges. Southern foxtail pine retains its needles longer  than northern foxtail pine  [<a href="#39">39</a>]. Northern foxtail pine tends 
to have a fuller crown and suffer from less cambial die-back than southern 
foxtail pine [<a href="#59">59</a>]. Great Basin bristlecone pine is 
distinguished from foxtail pines by having relatively longer cone prickles (2-6 mm) compared to foxtail pines (&lt;1mm). 
Distributions of Great Basin, southern foxtail, and northern foxtail pines do not 
overlap [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>], so distinguishing among them in the field is easy.</p>

<p><b><font size="4" face="Bell MT">Stand structure:</font></b> 
Foxtail pine communities are typically  open, with a sparse understory and scattered 
woody debris. Arid, high-elevation conditions allow woody debris to persist for many years 
without decaying [<a href="#44">44</a>]. In Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park, southern 
foxtail pine grows in widely spaced woodlands in its 
upper elevational range and is often the only tree species. At lower elevations it 
forms a more dense forest, either in mixed or monospecific stands 
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. The foxtail pine-alpine ecotone is usually abrupt as a result of 
foxtail pine's inability to form krummholz [<a href="#63">63</a>]. Northern foxtail pine communities 
tend toward greater density then southern foxtail pine communities [<a href="#82">82</a>]. In 
the Klamath Ranges, stand densities of northern foxtail pine communities ranged from a 
minimum of&nbsp; 51 trees/ha in the Yolla Bolly Mountains to a maximum of 381 
trees/ha in the Trinity Mountains [<a href="#30">30</a>]. Stand densities of southern 
foxtail pine communities in Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park range from 50 
trees/ha to 600 trees/ha [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. 
Ryerson [<a href="#82">82</a>] found a mean stand density of 100 trees/ha on sites across 
southern foxtail pine's distribution.</p>

<p><b><font size="4" face="Bell MT">Age class:</font></b> 
Age class structure within foxtail pine stands appears  mixed [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].&nbsp;Few studies 
have been conducted on age class distributions in foxtail pine. In a study across the Klamath Ranges, Eckert 
and Sawyer [<a href="#30">30</a>] found northern foxtail pines less than 100 years of age were most 
common (<u>&gt;</u>50% relative density). A few very old trees (around 1,000 
years of age) were scattered within all the study sites. In a study across southern foxtail 
pine's distribution in the Sierra Nevada, Ryerson [<a href="#82">82</a>] found most trees were in the 
350- to 500-year-old class, followed by trees less than 200 years old, and trees 
older than 800 years, respectively.</p>

<p>Foxtail pine is a very long-lived conifer, although it does not approach the extreme ages of bristlecone pines. 
Foxtail pine occurs on wetter sites than bristlecones; consequently, foxtail 
pines show relatively faster growth,  develop heart rot, and die more quickly 
than bristlecone pines [<a href="#8">8</a>]. Foxtail pine has advanced heart rot by 1,000 
years of age. The oldest foxtail pine on record (as of 2004) is a 3,400-year-old southern foxtail pine 
[<a href="#82">82</a>]. Northern foxtail pines occur in wetter habitats then southern 
foxtail pines and are shorter lived, attaining maximum ages of about 1,600 
years [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].</p>

<p><b><font size="4" face="Bell MT">Physiology:</font></b> 
Its relative inability to withstand cold may partially explain foxtail pine's narrow 
distribution compared to its more widely distributed high-elevation associate, whitebark pine. Poor 
ability to form krummholz limits foxtail pine's ability to withstand ice 
blasting [<a href="#13">13</a>]. Its seedlings are less resistant to freezing 
than whitebark pine seedlings [<a href="#82">82</a>].</p>

Environmental interactions that foster foxtail pine recruitment are poorly 
understood. Climate and water balance may be the primary factors driving foxtail 
pine establishment, with best recruitment during periods of warm, wet 
winters and cool summer temperatures [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>]. Dendrochronologists studying a 3,500-year history of southern foxtail pine 
recruitment and death rates in Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park found 2 
periods of poor southern foxtail pine recruitment. The 1st was during a drought 
lasting decades (950-550  years BP); the other was an extended period 
of below-average temperatures (450-50 years BP). Death rate was 
relatively stable over the last 1,000 years, averaging about 0.05% per capita. 
Death appeared to be due to local or endogenous factors except during periods of 
extreme climate fluctuation. Mortality spiked during the periods of extended drought  and 
extended cold. Overall recruitment rate was slightly higher 
than death rate, averaging around 0.06% per capita [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>]. As 
of this writing (2004), field studies on the seed germination and seedling 
establishment stages of foxtail pine's life cycle are lacking. Further studies are needed 
on the regeneration requirements and life cycle of foxtail pine.

<p><b><font size="4" face="Bell MT">Barriers to regeneration:</font></b> 
Domestic livestock grazing may adversely affect foxtail 
pine regeneration in areas where grazing is still practiced. Vankat [<a href="#106">106</a>] found southern foxtail pine in Sequoia-Kings Canyon 
National Park showed a pulse of recruitment from 1890-1895. That period 
coincides with a period of reduced domestic sheep grazing in the southern Sierra 
Nevada.</p>

<p>White pine blister rust (<i>Cronartium ribicola</i>) affects the ability of 5-needle pines to reproduce 
by killing cone-bearing branch tips. An infected northern foxtail pine 
population on the Klamath National Forest 
(see <a href="all.html#OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">Other Management Considerations</a>) 
shows poor recruitment, although it is uncertain at this time if blister rust is 
responsible. Levels of blister rust infection in foxtail pine are being monitored [<a href="#99">99</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Breeding system:</font></b> 
Allozyme surveys show that genetic diversity is low in foxtail pine compared to other pine 
species. There is more genetic differentiation among than within populations. 
Interpopulation genetic diversity is particularly pronounced in northern foxtail 
pine, which tends to have small (300-600 individuals), isolated populations, and 
restricted between-population gene flow. Natural selection for serpentine 
tolerance, global warming (see Other Management Considerations, <a href="all.html#Climate">Climate</a>), 
and genetic drift have likely contributed to northern foxtail pine's low genetic diversity [<a href="#77">77</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Pollination:</b></font> 
Foxtail pine is wind pollinated [<a href="#59">59</a>].</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Seed production:</font></b> 
Foxtail pine 1st produces cones at 20 to 50 years of age [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. 
The cone cycle (development through maturity) takes 5 to 6 years&nbsp; [<a href="#28">28</a>]. 
There is usually a 5- to 6-year interval between large cone crops [<a href="#52">52</a>]. 
Environmental conditions promoting large crops are undocumented (as of 2004).</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seed dispersal:</b></font> 
Foxtail pine seed is dispersed by wind [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>]. How long seed is retained in the cone, 
and whether it survives fire and disperses from cones onto burns, is poorly documented 
(as of 2004). Likewise, average range of dispersal for wind-blown foxtail pine seed 
is unknown, making it difficult to predict the potential for long-range foxtail 
pine seed dispersal onto  burns or other open seedbeds.  </p> 

<p>Although Clark's nutcrackers disperse 
bristlecone pine seeds, there have been no sightings of the birds dispersing the smaller 
seeds of foxtail pine [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>]. Trees growing from Clark's 
nutcracker caches often have multiple, genetically distinct stems [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>]. 
The typical single-stemmed habit [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>] of foxtail pine 
suggests that Clark's nutcracker dispersal and caching is unusual. Ryerson [<a href="#83">83</a>], 
however, noted the presence of&nbsp; 
a few multiple-stemmed trees throughout foxtail pine's distribution, suggesting 
the possibility of Clark's nutcracker seed dispersal and caching. Genetic 
identities of multiple-stemmed foxtail pine &quot;individuals&quot; have not been 
determined. Further investigation is needed on mechanisms of seed dispersal for 
foxtail pine.</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seed banking:</b></font> 
No information is available on this topic.</p>

<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Germination:</font></b> 
Seeds require stratification [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>]. Fresh, stratified southern foxtail 
pine seed collected in Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park showed 86% 
germination. After 9.4 years in cold storage, the same seed lot showed 72% 
germination [<a href="#75">75</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seedling establishment/growth:</b></font> 
Based on limited information, foxtail pine seedling establishment appears to be 
episodic, occurring during periods of mild, wet winters [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>].  </p>

<p>Foxtail pine is a slow-growing conifer [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].  Best growth of southern foxtail pine occurs in years with 
relatively warm, wet winters and cool summers [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>]. Studies on growth 
rates of foxtail pine are limited. One study found relative height growth rates of 0.2 to 0.9 
inch (0.5-2.3 cm) per year for seedlings in Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park. 
Seedlings in open, high-elevation sites tended to grow taller than 
seedlings in lower-elevation, forested areas [<a href="#92">92</a>]. For mature trees, 
another Sequoia-Kings Canyon study found trees at lower elevations (&lt;8,200 feet (2,500 m)) 
had greater relative growth rates compared to trees at high elevations (&gt;9,800 
feet (3,000 m)). Relative growth rates were 6.7-9.1 inches/100 years compared to 
2.4-3.1 inches/100 years (17-23 cm/100 yrs vs. 6-8 cm/100 yrs), at low and high 
elevations, respectively [<a href="#82">82</a>].</p>

<br />

Foxtail pine is adapted to harsh 
environmental conditions [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].
Its long life span, slow growth, and  persistent needles are typical 
 of conifer species adapted to stressful habitats [<a href="#70">70</a>]. Foxtail pine&nbsp; holds an ecological position between whitebark 
pine and limber pine: it is less tolerant of cool, short growing seasons than  whitebark 
pine and less tolerant of warm, arid growing conditions than limber pine 
[<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>]. North of southern foxtail pine's distribution in the Sierra, freezing 
temperatures occur all year long [<a href="#82">82</a>].  Foxtail pine communities are most common on &quot;safe sites,&quot; such as 
ultramafic 
soils and dry granite fields, that few other conifer species can tolerate 
[<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>]. Slope varies from gentle to 
as much as 55% [<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>].

<p><b>Southern foxtail pine</b> grows on well-drained, decomposed granite and  granite boulder fields. 
Southern foxtail pine does not occur on serpentine or other ultramafic soils, 
which are rare in the high Sierra Nevada [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. 
It is more common on the 
drier, eastern side of the Sierra Nevada, while whitebark pine is more common on 
the west slope [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>]. Climate  in the southern Sierra Nevada is 
mediterranean, with cold winters and warm, dry summers [<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>]. Annual 
precipitation on the east slope  ranges from 20 to 30 inches (500-750 mm) [<a href="#13">13</a>]. 
Southern foxtail pine occurs from 8,900 to 12,000 feet (2,700-3,700 m) elevation 
[<a href="#39">39</a>]. Tree damage from ice- and sandstorms is common [<a href="#67">67</a>]. Highest density of southern 
foxtail pine occurs on north-facing slopes; least density is on south slopes. Percent slope across southern 
foxtail pine's range averages less than 
33% [<a href="#82">82</a>].</p>

<p>Habitat of <b>northern foxtail pine</b> is even more restricted than that of 
southern foxtail pine. The Klamath Ranges are 
geologically complex, consisting of steep elevational gradients and a variety of 
parent rock materials that strongly influence plant community boundaries 
[<a href="#51">51</a>]. Climate is mediterranean, but is strongly moderated by the maritime influence 
of the nearby Pacific Ocean [<a href="#67">67</a>]. Annual 
precipitation averages from 49 to 60 inches (1,250-1,750 mm) [<a href="#13">13</a>].&nbsp;Northern foxtail pine occurs from 
6,900 to 8,200 feet (2,100-2,500 m) elevation [<a href="#39">39</a>].  There are relatively few 
high-elevation peaks in the 
Klamath Ranges; therefore, northern foxtail pine tends to segregate into small 
populations on isolated &quot;sky islands&quot; [<a href="#77">77</a>]. Substrates 
on which northern foxtail pine grows include gabbro, granodiorite, limestone, 
schist, and most commonly, serpentine [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>]. Because most associated 
conifers (except Jeffrey pine) are less tolerant to them, serpentine soils can 
partially ameliorate the elevational restriction and lower northern foxtail 
pine's elevational distribution. Northern 
foxtail pine tends to grow in large, monospecific stands when on serpentine 
soils. On other substrates it is generally found in small stands (a few hundred 
trees) on  ridge crests, mountain tops, and steep, south- or west-facing 
slopes [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>]. 
Populations on serpentine soils are more likely to occur on all aspects, 
including valley bottoms and lake shores [<a href="#77">77</a>]. Percent slope ranged from 
15-32% on 4 sites in the Klamath Ranges [<a href="#82">82</a>].</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SUCCESSIONAL STATUS">
SUCCESSIONAL STATUS:</a>

<br />

Foxtail pine is shade intolerant, requiring open, sunny locations throughout its 
life cycle [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>]. 
Foxtail pine pioneers on serpentine and high-elevation subalpine sites [<a href="#30">30</a>]. It 
competes poorly on nutrient-rich, mesic, and low-subalpine sites [<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>]. 
Foxtail pine is generally noninvasive [<a href="#79">79</a>]; however, it has extended its 
distribution into the California red fir zone in times of global cooling [<a href="#82">82</a>]. 
On high-elevation, ultramafic or dry granitic sites, foxtail pine is not threatened by successional replacement by 
shade-tolerant conifers such as California red fir and mountain hemlock because 
no other tree is as well 
adapted to the harsh sites that foxtail pine occupies [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>]. On more favorable 
sites, successional replacement of foxtail pine by mountain hemlock and firs may 
be occurring. Research is needed on successional patterns in foxtail pine 
communities on mesic, nonserpentine sites.</p>

<p>A resurvey in Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park showed that in 27 years, southern foxtail 
pine basal area and cover increased 8% and 16%, respectively. The changes were 
entirely due to foxtail pine diameter growth; in 27 years there had been no foxtail pine 
mortality, and no ingrowth of foxtail pine or other tree species, on the study 
plots [<a href="#80">80</a>]. To date (2004), there are no studies of succession in 
foxtail pine communities following fire, avalanche, or other disturbances. Studies 
documenting postdisturbance  recruitment and succession in foxtail&nbsp; 
pine communities are needed.</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT">

<br />

Pollen dispersal and pollination of new foxtail pine cones occurs in July and August. 
Mature cones open and disperse seed in September and October [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>]. Common 
garden studies show foxtail and bristlecone pines open their cones later in the 
season than other North American pine species [<a href="#25">25</a>]. Little is know of foxtail pine's seed 
biology and the phenological development 
of seedlings. Further work is needed in this area.

FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b><a name="Fire adaptations:">Fire adaptations:</a></b></font> 
Foxtail pine has many characteristics of a fire survivor [<a href="#87">87</a>]. 
Some of its morphological characteristics are similar to ponderosa pine, a highly fire-adapted species [<a href="#4">4</a>]. 
Like ponderosa pine, foxtail pine is a long-lived tree with a large-diameter bole, thick bark, and 
large-diameter branches [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. Branches are generally sparse and 
self-pruning in southern foxtail pine, although thin branching and a 
self-pruning habit are less common in northern foxtail pine 
[<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>]. Few fire studies on foxtail pine have been 
conducted; however, Ryerson [<a href="#82">82</a>] found mature, fire-scarred southern 
foxtail pines throughout the tree's distribution. As further evidence of foxtail 
pine's ability to survive fire, Keifer [<a href="#48">48</a>] reported that in the Sierra 
lodgepole pine-southern foxtail pine ecotone in Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park, 
foxtail pines were uneven-aged and showed multiple fire scars, while Sierra 
lodgepole pines were even-aged and showed no evidence of scarring. More fire 
history studies are needed on foxtail pine.
 
<p>Foxtail pine seedlings 
pioneer on burned sites. The seeds are small, light, and 
have large wings [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>], suggesting the possibility of foxtail pine seed 
dispersal onto burns from on- and off-site parent trees. In Sequoia-Kings Canyon National 
Park, Ryerson [<a href="#82">82</a>] found southern foxtail pine seedlings on 2 burned sites. On 
the 1st burn, seedlings established near 4 lightning-killed, mature trees. On 
the 2nd burn, foxtail pine seedlings grew in openings created when fire burned 
across a ridgetop. Further studies are needed on patterns of foxtail pine seed dispersal and 
seedling establishment after fire.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font> 
Fires are infrequent, and are generally of low severity, in subalpine regions of the 
southern Sierra Nevada. Scant litter production and discontinuous fuels do not promote 
fire spread in foxtail pine communities. Fire intensity tends to decrease when 
lower-elevation fires burn into southern foxtail pine. Fire spread slows; or, 
fires may extinguish due to lack of fuels [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>]. Although 
foxtail pine sites receive more lightning strikes than lower-elevation forests, 
ignitions are uncommon [<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>]. Rocky, highly dissected 
foxtail pine habitats rarely sustain large fires. In a fire history 
study, Keifer [<a href="#48">48</a>] found frequent fire in Sierra lodgepole pine, 
but only occasional fires in southern foxtail pine sites. The National Park 
Service [<a href="#101">101</a>] classifies fire occurrence as &quot;very low&quot; in subalpine conifer zones 
of Sequoia-King Canyon National Park, with a mean fire return interval of 187 
years and a maximum recorded fire return interval of 508 years. Caprio and 
Lineback [<a href="#21">21</a>] found southern foxtail and whitebark pine communities of Sequoia-Kings 
Canyon National Park had the longest return fire intervals of all plant 
communities in the Park. Estimated area burned in southern foxtail pine 
communities averaged 145 acres/year (168 ha/yr) with a mean fire return interval of 187 years. 
Estimated burn area extended to 153 acres/year (62 ha/year) under the maximum mean fire return interval 
of 508 years. Fire scar data from 2 watersheds show few fires in 
foxtail-whitebark pine communities of Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park from 
1700 to 2000: 7 on north aspects and 3 on south aspects [<a href="#19">19</a>]. Differences 
in fire return intervals between aspects were not significant [<a href="#18">18</a>].</p>

<p>The fire ecology of upper subalpine zones of California is poorly understood 
[<a href="#101">101</a>]. This is particularly true for northern foxtail pine, for which fire 
ecology and fire regime information are nearly absent. Thornburgh [<a href="#95">95</a>] found white 
fir-mountain hemlock communities of the Marble Mountains, where northern foxtail 
pine is an associate, experience a regime of mixed low- and moderate-severity 
fires. Fire effects and postfire recruitment of foxtail pine were not reported. Further documentation 
and research are needed on the 
fire ecology of foxtail pine and other subalpine communities of&nbsp; California.</p>

<p>Occasionally, large, stand-replacing fires occur in southern foxtail pine [<a href="#91">91</a>]. For 
example, The 1949 Kern Canyon 2 Fire burned 1,100 acres (445 ha) of southern 
foxtail and 
Jeffrey pine habitat in Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park. Ignited by lightning on 13 July, it was controlled by 31 
July. Southwesterly winds up to 40 mph (64 km/hr) caused crowning and spotting. 
Steep, rugged terrain contributed to fast fire spread and resistance to control 
[<a href="#10">10</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Fuels:</font> 
Foxtail pine snags and woody debris are 
highly resinous, and are slow to decay in high-elevation  habitats. 
In Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park, downed foxtail pines that have been 
dead for over 1,000 years still retain medium-sized (&gt;0.8-inch (2-cm) diameter) or larger 
branches [<a href="#62">62</a>]. Foxtail pine communities are not typically highly 
flammable though, because woody fuels are limited and discontinuous [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>], and litter is sparse [<a href="#81">81</a>]. 
Live fuels are also scant. A 1978 fuel 
inventory in Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park showed a 
mean of 10 tons/acre in foxtail and other subalpine types [<a href="#10">10</a>]. Basal area 
and litter quantity decreased with elevation, although litter quality (N:C ratio) 
increased with elevation [<a href="#64">64</a>]. The live understory is typically sparse in 
foxtail pine communities. Lloyd and Graumlich [<a href="#63">63</a>] found 
less than 1 plant/m<font face="Times New Roman">�</font> 
in southern foxtail pine understories in Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park. Van Wagtendonk and others [<a href="#105">105</a>]

Lightning damage to foxtail pines is common, especially to trees in the upper

Fire and climate may play an interactive role in determining the California red fir-foxtail 
pine ecotone. California red firs (<i>Abies magnifica</i> var. <i>magnifica</i> and <i>A. 
m.</i> var. <i>shastensis</i>) have thicker bark and are more fire-tolerant than 
most firs [<a href="#7">7</a>], but are not as fire-tolerant as foxtail pine. 
Warming climate and more frequent fires may promote foxtail pine invasions into 
lower-elevation California red fir communities [<a href="#82">82</a>]. 


<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE">
PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Foxtail pine's thick bark helps protect it from damage from surface fires. 
Sparse, large-diameter branches discourage torching and fire spread. Little is 
known about foxtail pine's response after the fire has passed.
In the 1979 Fire Management Plant for Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park, 
Bancroft [<a href="#10">10</a>] wrote &quot;Very little research has been conducted on the effect of 
fire on natural regeneration in subalpine forests.&quot; This remains true of foxtail 
pine and other subalpine forests today. Research is needed on the fire ecology of  foxtail 
pine.<p>Kiefer [<a href="#48">48</a>] found  foxtail pine recruitment in Sequoia-Kings Canyon 
National Park was uneven-aged and did not appear to be correlated with fire 
history. This was in sharp contrast to associated Sierra lodgepole pine, whose 
recruitment dated from past fires. Kiefer suggested that climate may play a more 
important role in foxtail pine recruitment than fire.

FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Southern foxtail pine communities are managed with prescribed natural fire 
(wildland fire for resource benefit) [<a href="#91">91</a>]. Fire may extend foxtail pine's 
distribution downslope on some sites [<a href="#48">48</a>], although the postfire interactions of 
California subalpine conifers have had too little study to predict postfire 
results with confidence. Fire may encourage foxtail pine recruitment and growth 
on existing foxtail pine sites by releasing nutrients from slow-decaying woody 
debris. On those relatively rare foxtail pine sites with closed canopies, fire 
would encourage foxtail pine recruitment by creating an open mineral seedbed.

Foxtail pine boughs probably provide shelter for wildlife. Chipmunks and birds 
probably eat the seeds, but little is known about wildlife use of foxtail pine 
habitats. Research is needed on the ecology of foxtail pine communities.

Foxtail pine is an ecologically important species. The open structure of foxtail pine 
stands slows snowmelt and helps retain snowpack. Foxtail pine also helps 
stabilize soil on steep subalpine slopes [<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>].<p>As a long-lived conifer, foxtail pine is a valuable species for 
dendrochronological and related climate studies [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>]. 

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Wood Products:</b></font> Foxtail pine is

<a name="OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font size="4" face="Bell MT">Damaging bioagents:</font>
Foxtail pine is highly susceptible to <b>white pine blister rust</b>, 
a usually fatal fungal disease that affects 5-needle pines [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>]. 
In the greenhouse, Hoff and others [<a href="#40">40</a>] inoculated 18 species of Eurasian and 
North American 5-needle pine seedlings with blister rust. Of the 18 species, 
foxtail and southwestern white pine (<i>Pinus strobiformis</i>)  showed least 
resistance to blister rust. All of the 92 inoculated foxtail pines became 
infected. Other studies show a 75-100% seedling infection rate [<a href="#93">93</a>]. Although the 
mediterranean climate of California once protected all but the northernmost populations of 5-needle pines from blister 
rust, that is no longer true. Some northern foxtail pines on the Scott River 
District of the Klamath National Forest have blister rust [<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>]. 
As of this writing (2004), blister rust has not been detected in southern 
foxtail pine, although western white pine and sugar pine (<i>P. lambertiana</i>) 
in Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park are infected [<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>].

<p>Blister rust-infected trees may take from 2 years to decades to succumb, but 
infection is always fatal [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].
Gooseberries and currants (<i>Ribes</i> spp.) are the primary host of white 
pine blister rust. Life cycle of white pine blister rust is complex. 
Gitzendanner and others [<a href="#35">35</a>] 
and McDonald and Hoff [<a href="#71">71</a>] 
provide details of the rust's life history and ecology. Hoff [<a href="#41">41</a>] 
provides a diagnostic guide to aid managers in recognizing symptoms of blister 
rust infection in white pines. There are no known methods of
<a href="https://www.nrmsc.usgs.gov/research/blister.htm">controlling blister 
rust</a> [<a href="#47">47</a>]. Fungicide application, pruning infected tree branches, and/or 
removing <i>Ribes</i> spp. have neither eliminated nor controlled white pine 
blister rust [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>], and such treatments have undesirable ecological effects 
[<a href="#47">47</a>]. For further information on management of white pine blister rust, see Samman and Schwandt [<a href="#84">84</a>]. </p>
<p>Some northern foxtail pines on the Scott River District show phenological 
resistance to blister rust. Identification and breeding programs for these 
genetically valuable, blister-rust resistant individuals are crucial to an 
integrated strategy for protecting and restoring foxtail and other white pines 
[<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>]. Breeding programs for&nbsp; blister rust-resistant foxtail pines 
are being implemented [<a href="#99">99</a>]. </p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Other damaging bioagents</font><font face="Bell MT" size="4">:</font> 
Foxtail pines are susceptible to 
mountain pine beetle attacks [<a href="#107">107</a>]. Two rare species of <i>Pityophthorus</i> 
bark beetles may feed primarily on foxtail pine [<a href="#17">17</a>]. While contributing to 
biodiversity, little is known of the impacts of these <i>Pityophthorus </i>bark beetles to foxtail 
pine. Limber pine dwarf-mistletoe (<i>Arceuthobium cyanocarpum</i>) occasionally 
infects foxtail pine [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>]. A fungal needle cast (<i>Lophodermium 
durilabrum</i>) has caused minor damage to northern foxtail pines in the 
Marble Mountains [<a href="#72">72</a>].</p>

<p><font size="4" face="Bell MT"><a name="Climate">Climate</a></font> 
affects foxtail pine's elevational range. For most of the period for 
which tree records are available (<u>~</u>3,500 years), southern foxtail pine 
has existed above present treeline [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>]. For example, Vankat 
[<a href="#106">106</a>] found&nbsp;dead stands of foxtail pine above present timberline (10,800- 
11,200 feet (3,300-3,400 m)) 
on the Kern River Watershed in Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park. These &quot;ghost 
forests&quot; may be relicts of foxtail pines that died during a period of global 
warming [<a href="#56">56</a>]. Lloyd 
and Graumlich [<a href="#63">63</a>]  documented 3 episodes where southern foxtail pine expanded 
upslope. Although the data are somewhat unclear [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>], these 
expansions appear to have occurred during relatively warm, wet periods. Presently, southern foxtail pine is expanding its 
range both upslope and laterally into subalpine meadows and previously untreed 
east slopes. This expansion has been explained as a response to global 
warming [<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>], or due to a combination of factors including global warming, low conifer 
diversity (and consequent lack of growth interference for foxtail pine in the upper elevations 
of the southern Sierra Nevada), and stochasticity [<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>].</p>

Northern foxtail pine is threatened by global warming. Already restricted to 
a relatively few high-elevation peaks, there are no higher-elevation refugia for 
the Klamath Mountains subspecies to migrate to. Many northern foxtail pine populations 
are being &quot;squeezed off the tops of mountains that are insufficiently high to 
provide suitable habitat&quot; [<a href="#77">77</a>].
