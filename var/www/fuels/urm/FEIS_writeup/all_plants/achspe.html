<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Desert needlegrass is an important grass species in the understory of
pinyon-juniper woodlands of northern Arizona and New Mexico [<a href="#21">21</a>].  In
sagebrush steppe, desert needlegrass importance increases in arid areas
[<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  Desert needlegrass is a component in the shadscale (Atriplex
confertifolia) series of the Great Basin desertscrub and in the
creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) communities of the Mohave Desert,
California [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].

Desert needlegrass is an indicator for habitat types in the following
publications:

(1) Survey of endangered plants, Joshua Tree National Monument [<a href="#17">17</a>]
(2) Transmontane coniferous vegetation [<a href="#34">34</a>]

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Desert needlegrass produces considerable basal foliage and is good
forage while young [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Desert bighorn sheep in Arizona and feral
burros in California grazed desert needlegrass [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Young desert needlegrass is palatable to all classes of livestock [<a href="#25">25</a>].
Mature herbage is moderately grazed by horses and cattle but rarely
grazed by sheep [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
In Arizona, Seegmiller and others [<a href="#26">26</a>] analyzed the nutritional quality
of desert needlegrass at bimonthly intervals for 1 year.  Desert
needlegrass dry matter peaked at 95 percent in late summer.  Protein
content increased through June to 6.73 percent and then dropped in
autumn to 2.35 percent.  Acid detergent fiber percentages remained
constant through the year at 43.67 percent.  Lignin and cellulose
increased from January to December, ending the year at 8.86 and 39.83
percent, respectively.  Lipids steadily decreased from 3.74 percent in
January to 1.86 percent in December.


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Desert needlegrass seeds are easily germinated and have potential for
commercial use [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Desert needlegrass may be used for groundcover in
areas of light disturbance, but it is susceptible to excessive trampling
[<a href="#18">18</a>].  For 5 years, Cole and Hall [<a href="#6">6</a>] studied impacts to vegetation at
campsites in the Grand Canyon, Arizona.  Although still infrequent,
desert needlegrass was relatively more abundant in campsites (2 plants
total) than in undisturbed controls (0 plants).


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Desert needlegrass florets have a prominent callus.  The sharp-pointed
seeds with long, bent awns injure mouths and eyes of grazing animals
[<a href="#13">13</a>].

Desert needlegrass may be eliminated from areas with a high
concentration of grazing animals due to excessive trampling and
overgrazing [<a href="#18">18</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Achnatherum speciosum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Desert needlegrass is a native, cool-season, perennial bunchgrass with
stems 12 to 24 inches (30-60 cm) tall [<a href="#10">10</a>].  It grows in large dense
clumps that have persistent leaf bases [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  The inflorescence is
compact and looks feathery due to the very hairy, bent awns [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].
Roots extend into the soil 3.3 to 3.9 feet (1-1.2 m) with most of the
roots located from 0 to 1 foot (0-0.3 m) deep [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Desert needlegrass reproduces asexually and sexually.  Vegetative
reproduction occurs with the annual growth of new tillers [<a href="#7">7</a>].  This
wind-pollinated grass may produce large amounts of seed [<a href="#25">25</a>].  From year
to year, desert needlegrass seed crops are variable in amount and
germibility in different populations [<a href="#42">42</a>].  Sexual reproduction is
closely tied to water availability.  Seed is not set if soil moisture is
low and temperatures are high [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Desert needlegrass has persistent seed and seedling banks [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Seeds
are self-planting.  Depending upon moisture conditions, the awn
alternately twists (dry) and untwists (wet), which drives the seed into
the ground [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Awns and calluses catch on animal fur, assisting in
seed dissemination [<a href="#13">13</a>].  The long awns may aid in wind dispersal.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Desert needlegrass typically occurs on coarse-textured soils with no
profile development, often on sandy or gravelly alluvial fans
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  It grows on dry rocky hills, talus slopes, and in
canyons [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Desert needlegrass is found at elevations from
4,025 to 5,249 feet (1,227-1,870 m) in California and Nevada
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  It is found from 3,000 to 7,000 feet (914-2,134 m) in
Arizona and up to 8,500 feet (2,590 m) in southwestern Colorado [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].

Desert needlegrass grows in warm to temperate mediterranean climates,
characterized by mild winters and warm to hot summers [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Young and
Evans [<a href="#42">42</a>] state that compared to other native needlegrasses, desert
needlegrass probably occurs in the most arid and harsh environments.

Associated species not mentioned in Distribution and Occurrence are
Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia), white burrobrush (Hymenoclea salsola),
Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides), Thurber
needlegrass (Achnatherum thurberianum), and spiny phlox (Leptodactylon pungens)
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Desert needlegrass is a stress-tolerant ruderal [<a href="#35">35</a>].  In disturbed
areas, such as abandoned town sites and roads, in Great Basin vegetation
(for example, spiney hopsage [Atriplex spinosa] communities), desert
needlegrass and Indian ricegrass seedlings were the first perennials to
appear [<a href="#23">23</a>].  In town sites abandoned for 30 to 73 years, desert
needlegrass and white burrobrush continued to dominate the vegetation
[<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].

At the Nevada Test Site, vegetation in the crater from an aboveground
nuclear detonation was assessed after 14 and 24 years [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Desert
needlegrass and Indian ricegrass had gradually filled in after annual
plants.  After 24 years, desert needlegrass plants had advanced into the
crater 2,000 feet (610 m) and increased to 2.8 plants per square foot
(30 plants/sq m).


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
New leaves emerge from dormant desert needlegrass tufts in the spring.
Most vegetative growth occurs from late spring to early summer when
moisture conditions and temperatures are conducive to growth [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].
Florets are produced April to June [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  Seed production and
dissemination occur May to June [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Tiller senescence begins in late
summer [<a href="#3">3</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Achnatherum speciosum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Desert needlegrass has persistent dead leaf bases, which make it
susceptible to burning.  Fire removes the accumulation; a rapid, cool
fire will not burn deep into the root crown [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Most perennial
grasses have root crowns that can survive wildfire [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tussock graminoid
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Achnatherum speciosum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire probably top-kills desert needlegrass.  Most needlegrasses (Achnatherum 
spp.), especially young plants, are very susceptible to fire damage
[<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Surviving tufts of desert needlegrass probably will sprout.

Two years after a lightning fire on the Nevada Test Site, many new
seedlings and surviving bunches of desert needlegrass were present [<a href="#12">12</a>].
Fire did not kill belowground root crowns.

In pinyon-juniper woodlands of the Great Basin, desert needlegrass was
one of the perennial grasses that remained the same or increased in
frequency 15 to 17 years after fire [<a href="#14">14</a>].

A recent (number of postfire years not mentioned) fire in pinyon (Pinus
edulis)-juniper rangeland resulted in 1,271 pounds per acre (1,425
kg/ha) of desert needlegrass compared with nonburned production of 612
pounds per acre (686 kg/ha) [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Season of burning may be critical to desert needlegrass survival.  Early
summer fires caused higher mortality than fall fires in other
needlegrass species (needle-and-thread (Nassella comata) and Thurber
needlegrass) populations [<a href="#41">41</a>].
