<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name for Montezuma baldcypress is
Taxodium mucronatum Ten. (family Taxodiaceae) [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  There are no
accepted infrataxa.  Montezuma baldcypress differs from its congener
baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) primarily by the presence of a
needlelike point (a mucro) on the megasporophylls (female cone scales) [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Taxodium mucronatum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
In the United States, Montezuma baldcypress is known only from the Rio
Grande Valley in Cameron and Hidalgo counties of extreme southern Texas.
It is common and widespread in Mexico [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Montezuma baldcypress occurs in the riparian zone of a desert shrub
community along the Rio Grande.  The riparian zone includes black willow
(Salix nigra), Texas ebony (Pithecellobium flexicaule), and mesquite
(Prosopis glandulosa).  The upland area includes sotol (Dasylirion
texanum), catclaw mimosa (Mimosa biuncifera), and blackbrush acacia
(Acacia rigidula) [<a href="#20">20</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
The wood of Montezuma baldcypress is reported by Standley [<a href="#12">12</a>] as soft
and weak.  According to Elias [<a href="#5">5</a>], however, it is hard and durable.
Montezuma baldcypress wood is used in Mexico for fine furniture and
general construction [<a href="#12">12</a>].  The wood of its congener, baldcypress, is
widely recognized for its durability [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Specific information on the value of Montezuma baldcypress for wildlife
is lacking in the English language literature.  Baldcypress and
pondcypress (Tazodium distichum var. nutans) form characteristic groves
in swampy areas that support complex and variable ecosystems, and are
used by many wildlife species [<a href="#3">3</a>].

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Montezuma baldcypress is being planted along the banks of the Rio Grande
in an effort to restore natural ecosystems on sites that were cleared
for agriculture [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Montezuma baldcypress is planted as an ornamental [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  It is an
important medicinal plant and may have been considered sacred by some
Mexican civilizations.  A gummy resin produced after the tree is wounded
was used to cure skin diseases, wounds, ulcers, gout, and toothaches by
the Aztecs; some of these uses continue in popular practice.  Pitch
produced by burning woodchips in a reducing atmosphere was used as a
cure for bronchitis.  The leaves were used as a relaxant and a cure for
itching.  The bark was used as a diuretic and an emmanagogue (an agent
promoting menstruation) [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Montezuma baldcypress occurs on the Lower Rio Grande National Wildlife
Refuge.  Many seedlings are being planted there as part of an ecosystem
restoration project [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].

Montezuma baldcypress was heavily utilized for timber for the
construction of both Tenochtitlan and for Mexico City.  Continuing
demands for timber and charcoal have decimated natural groves [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Seedlings are subject to herbivory by rodents; greenhouses have to be
rodent-proofed.  Rabbits will gnaw the bark of outplanted seedlings and
saplings [<a href="#2">2</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Taxodium mucronatum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Montezuma baldcypress is a large, native, semideciduous to evergreen
tree [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  Mature height usually ranges from 60 to 100 feet (18-30
m), but the oldest trees can be much taller: a record height of 170 feet
(51.8 m) has been reported for the Tree of Montezuma (Chapultepec Park,
Mexico City) which was estimated as 700 years old [<a href="#12">12</a>].  The Montezuma
baldcypress is better known for its massive, convoluted trunk than for
its height.  El Arbor del Tule (Oaxaca, Mexico), an individual at least
1,000 years old and possibly much older, is more than 50 feet (15 m) in
diameter and has a circumference of 117.6 feet (35.84 m).  Perimeter
measures that include the bays and promontories of the buttressed trunk
exceed 150 feet (45 m) [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Montezuma baldcypress has a broad, spreading crown with strong,
horizontal branches and delicate, weeping branchlets.  The leaves are
0.24 to 0.48 inch (6-12 mm) long.  The staminate strobili are borne in
long, slender spikes.  The ovulate cones are subglobose and 0.59 to 0.98
inch (1.5-2.5 cm) in diameter.  The bark is shreddy.  The roots of trees
growing in standing water often send up conical projections ("knees")
[<a href="#12">12</a>].  Trees that experience periodic drying out, such as those growing
along stream courses, apparently do not form knees [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Montezuma baldcypress reproduces primarily by seed.  Seeds are released
upon cone ripening, and germinate as soon as moisture conditions permit.
The seeds are only viable for a short period of time.  No special
treatment is needed for greenhouse germination [<a href="#2">2</a>].  No vegetative
reproduction has been reported for Montzuma baldcypress, although
baldcypress will produce stump sprouts.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Montezuma baldcypress usually occurs on moist soils along streams, or on
low, poorly drained sites [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].  It is drought tolerant when
established; colonies of Montezuma baldcypress grow along seasonally dry
stream courses in the lower Sonoran Desert in Mexico [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
The staminate and pistillate cones of Montezuma baldcypress open in
February [<a href="#15">15</a>].  The cones of baldcypress ripen in October after
flowering in March or April; it is likely that Montezuma baldcypress
follows a similar pattern [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Montezuma baldcypress is often
described as evergreen even though it normally sheds all of its leaves
when new growth emerges in the spring.  Leaflessness in the Texas
populations is more often associated with drought and/or low
temperatures rather than with season [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Other populations of
Montezuma baldcypress may shed some or all of their leaves in the fall
and remain leafless through the winter [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Taxodium mucronatum
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Montezuma baldcypress usually occurs along stream courses, in habitats
that are moist or at least seasonally flooded.  Fires burning in
adjacent savanna and scrublands may encroach on Montezuma baldcypress
stands depending on moisture conditions.  Baldcypress is easily injured
by fire, particularly peat fires which can damage the roots [<a href="#17">17</a>]; it is
likely that Montezuma baldcypress is similarly vulnerable to fire.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>

<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>

<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Baldcypress and pondcypress will sprout from the stump when top-killed
by fire [<a href="#19">19</a>].  It is likely that Montezuma baldcypress does the same.
