   rosy pussytoes

<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name for rosy pussytoes is Antennaria
microphylla Rydb. [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Antennaria is a taxonomically complex
genus due to a high degree of apomixis, polyploidy, and hybridization.
Antennaria microphylla is a highly variable species and many segregates
have been named, although none appear to warrant taxonomic recognition
[<a href="#12">12</a>].  Rosy pussytoes is often confused with A. rosea Greene because of
frequent hybridization.  These two species have been treated as the same
entity by some authorities, but it has recently been determined that
they are taxonomically distinct [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Rosy pussytoes also frequently
hybridizes with umbrinella pussytoes (A. umbrinella) [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>] and alpine
pussytoes (A. alpina) [<a href="#16">16</a>].

<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Rosy pussytoes does not survive mechanical scarification but can
colonize bare scarified soil.  Herbaceous layers dominated by rosy
pussytoes in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)/pinegrass
(Calamagrostis rubescens) habitat types in central Idaho occur on
scarified, cool, dry sites where the herbaceous layer is depauperate.
Rosy pussytoes in this habitat type has the following responses to
different silvicultural practices:  a minor increase in vegetative
growth after clearcutting with no subsequent site preparation; a major
decrease in canopy cover after shelterwood cuts followed by mechanical
scarification; a major decrease in canopy cover and a minor increase in
seedling establishment after clearcutting followed by mechanical
scarification; and a minor decrease in canopy cover after wildfire and
after clearcutting followed by broadcast burning [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Rosy pussytoes is often present in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides)
stands heavily grazed by cattle and deer in Wyoming [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Under light to
moderate grazing in central Idaho, it dominates the herbaceous layer of
Douglas-fir/ pinegrass habitat types [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Pussytoes (Antennaria spp.)
generally increase in response to grazing [<a href="#26">26</a>].

The herbicide 2,4-D caused light damage (1-33% kill) to rosy pussytoes
when it was sprayed on nearby sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Antennaria microphylla
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Rosy pussytoes is a stoloniferous, mat-forming, perennial forb.  Stems
are generally 1.6 to 12 inches (4-30 cm) tall.  Leaves are spoon-shaped
or narrowly oblong and simple, alternate, and mostly basal.  Cauline
leaves are reduced upwards.  The inflorescence is a congested to open
cyme with 2 to 13 heads.  The fruit is an achene 0.03 to 0.05 inch
(0.08-0.12 cm) long [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Stolons are usually 0.4 to 2 inches
(1-5 cm) long [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Rosy pussytoes reproduces from seed or spreads vegetatively through
stolons.  Seeds are light and wind dispersed.  They are generally
not stored in soil seedbanks [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Rosy pussytoes is dioecious [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Rosy pussytoes is found in dry, open habitats including plains, hills,
open woods, and dry meadows [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  It is found at elevations
of 6,000 to 11,400 feet (1,830-3,450 m) in Utah and 5,000 to 11,000 feet
(1,500-3,300 m) in Colorado [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  In west-central Montana, rosy
pussytoes is found from the valley floor to alpine zones [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Rosy pussytoes is found in disturbed areas as well as stable climax
communities.  It was present on thin mud and tephra in the first 2 years
following the volcanic eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington [<a href="#29">29</a>].
It invades heavily grazed sagebrush-grassland communities in Nevada
[<a href="#25">25</a>].  In central Idaho rosy pussytoes is a major early seral species in
subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa)/beargrass (Xerophyllum tenax) habitat
types [<a href="#21">21</a>] and a prominent mid-seral species in Douglas-fir/pinegrass
habitat types, where it persists beneath a partial canopy [<a href="#22">22</a>].  It also
occurs in seral and climax trembling aspen communities in Utah [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Rosy pussytoes flowers from the end of May to July [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Rosy pussytoes colonizes bare mineral soil from light, wind-dispersed
seed [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Antennaria microphylla
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Rosy pussytoes is probably killed by moderate or severe fires.  However,
no marked rosy pussytoes plants were killed by low-severity spring or
fall prescribed fires in mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata
spp. vaseyana)/rough fescue (Festuca scabrella), mountain big
sagebrush/Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratense), or Douglas-fir/mountain big
sagebrush vegetation types in the Helena National Forest, Montana [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
The response of rosy pussytoes to fire probably depends on site
characteristics and fire severity.  It is a major early seral species
following fires in subalpine fir/beargrass habitat types in central
Idaho [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Rosy pussytoes was first observed in postfire year 3
following the severe Sundance Forest Fire in northern Idaho [<a href="#23">23</a>].  In
Douglas-fir stands in the Deerlodge National Forest, Montana, rosy
pussytoes decreased 22.5 percent in the first 2 postfire years after
spring fires [<a href="#7">7</a>].  In sagebrush habitats in Idaho rosy pussytoes
decreased the first years following September prescribed fires, but then
increased and regained much of its original cover.  Production was
greater on lightly burned or moderately burned sites than on either
unburned or severely burned sites 15 years after the fires [<a href="#3">3</a>].
