<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Leptodactylon pungens

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Prickly phlox was used by bighorn sheep in December and by mule deer in
February and April on bighorn sheep range in east-central Idaho [<a href="#17">17</a>].
In southeastern Idaho, prickly phlox is moderately grazed by sheep in
early and late summer [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The degree of use shown by livestock and wildlife species for prickly
phlox in several western states is rated as follows [<a href="#6">6</a>]:

                       CO        UT      WY         

Cattle                Poor      Poor    Poor
Sheep                 Poor      Poor    Fair  
Horses                Poor      Poor    Poor
Pronghorn             ----      Fair    ----
Elk                   ----      Poor    ----  
Mule deer             ----      Poor    ----  
Small mammals         ----      Fair    ----
Small nongame birds   ----      Fair    ---- 
Upland game birds     ----      Fair    ----
Waterfowl             ----      Poor    ----


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Prickly phlox is rated poor in energy and protein value [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The degree to which prickly phlox provides environmental protection
during one or more seasons for wildlife species in Utah is as follows
[<a href="#6">6</a>]:

Pronghorn             Poor
Elk                   Poor
Mule deer             Poor   
Small mammals         Fair  
Small nongame birds   Poor
Upland game birds     Poor
Waterfowl             Poor


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Prickly phlox is described as having low to moderate establishment
requirements and low potential for biomass production [<a href="#6">6</a>].  It is rated
as having low potential for erosion control and for short- and long-term
revegetation projects [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Prickly phlox frequency has been reported to decrease with livestock
exclusion [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  On a southeastern Idaho sagebrush-grass range,
Harniss and Wright [<a href="#14">14</a>] found a decrease in percent production of
prickly phlox the first 2 years from early summer and late summer
grazing by sheep.  West and others [<a href="#32">32</a>] reported prickly phlox lives
much longer on ungrazed plots.

In areas in Utah where 2,4 D application had removed the shrub canopy,
prickly phlox increased in density by seedling establishment within 4
years.  However, it increased only at sites where cheatgrass (Bromus
tectorum) did not increase and the remaining perennial grasses were not
abundant [<a href="#35">35</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Leptodactylon pungens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Prickly phlox is a native, perennial shrub or subshrub with a taproot
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  It is more or less erect, open or densely branched, and ranges
from 4 to 24 inches (1-6 dm) in height [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  The plant is somewhat
aromatic [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Herbage is puberulent to glandular-puberulent or
glandular-villous to glabrous [<a href="#31">31</a>].  The numerous and crowded leaves are
alternate to subopposite (or the lower are opposite) and are cleft into
three to nine rigid, spinulose-tipped segments [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Dead leaves
commonly persist through one or more seasons [<a href="#5">5</a>].

The sessile flowers of prickly phlox are solitary and auxillary or are
at the ends of short leafy branches [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Flowers are usually dull white
or cream colored and marked or washed with pale lavender outside but can
vary to yellowish or salmon colored [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Flowers are nocturnal [<a href="#5">5</a>].
The seed capsule is usually three-loculed and persists for some time
after seed dehiscence [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Chamaephyte
   Burned or Clipped State:  Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Little information could be located in the available literature
concerning the regenerative characteristics of prickly phlox. Its fruit
is usually a three-loculed capsule which splits open at maturity to
release the small seeds [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Prickly phlox grows on relatively open sites from the deserts, plains,
valleys, and foothills to timberline or above in the drier mountains
[<a href="#5">5</a>].  It occurs on alluvial terraces and fans, drainage bottoms, flats
and gently rolling slopes to ridgetops in hilly and mountainous terrain
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  Soil surface horizons are often coarse to cobbly and
stoney, sandy or sandy loam in texture [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Soils are
frequently granitic in origin, but prickly phlox also occurs on soils
derived from colluvial and residual gneissic and schistic rock,
sandstone, dolomite, limestone, and pumice [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].

Generalized elevational ranges for prickly phlox in several western
states are reported as follows [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>]:

          from 4,101 to 12,000 ft (1,250-3,658 m) in CA
               4,000 to  9,500 ft (1,219-2,896 m) in CO
               6,200 to  7,500 ft (1,890-2,286 m) in MT
               4,593 to 12,000 ft (1,400-3,658 m) in NV
               4,800 to  4,900 ft (1,463-1,493 m) in OR
               4,500 to  8,600 ft (1,372-2,621 m) in UT
               4,100 to  8,100 ft (1,250-2,469 m) in WY

Elevational range for ssp. halli in California is reported to be 4,000
to 9,000 feet (1,219-3,658 m) [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Prickly phlox is typically not an abundant part of the vegetation [<a href="#5">5</a>].
It commonly occurs with such species as needle-and-thread grass (Stipa
spp.), cheatgrass, bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata),
thread-leaf sedge (Carex filifolia), sandwort (Arenaria kingi), sulfur
buckwheat (Eriogonum umbellatum), longleaf phlox (Phlox longifolia),
rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus spp.), snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae),
prickly pear (Opuntia polyacantha), bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus
elymoides), wax current (Ribes cereum), bitterbrush (Purshia
tridentata), oak (Quercus turbinella), big sagebrush (Artemisia
tridentata), and black sagebrush (A. nova) [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].
 


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
In southern Idaho, Eggler [<a href="#8">8</a>] described prickly phlox as a dominant
shrub on old, soil-covered volcanic flows.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
General flowering dates for prickly phlox in four western states are
[<a href="#6">6</a>]:

     Beginning of Flowering    Flowering    End of Flowering

       CO                 May               June           August
       MT                 June              July           July
       WY                 May               June           July
       UT                 May               ____           June

In southern Idaho, Eggler [<a href="#8">8</a>] reported growth of prickly phlox ceased
early in August.

(within parenthesis) for prickly phlox were as follows [<a href="#32">32</a>]:
