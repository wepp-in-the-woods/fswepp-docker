<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Bearded fescue is a member of maple-quaking aspen (Acer spp.-Populus
tremuloides), quaking aspen-mountain brush, and aspen-spruce-fir
(Picea-Abies spp.) communities in the mountains of northern Utah [<a href="#24">24</a>].
It is found in stands dominated by Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) in Red
Butte Canyon, Utah [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Bearded fescue is found in upland coastal redwood (Sequoia sempervirens)
forests of northern California and montane coniferous forests of the
Sierra Nevada, California [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].

Bearded fescue is commonly found in the Sitka spruce/devil's club (Picea
sitchensis/Oplopanax horridus) association in British Columbia and the
Pacific Northwest [<a href="#1">1</a>].  It is also found in the coastal Douglas-fir
(Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) and western hemlock (Tsuga
heterophylla) zones of British Columbia [<a href="#19">19</a>].  On the Saturna Island
Ecological Reserve, British Columbia, bearded fescue is a member of a
virgin Douglas-fir forest [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Bearded fescue is a common understory species in red alder (Alnus rubra)
communities in the central Oregon Coast Range [<a href="#3">3</a>].  In Washington,
bearded fescue occurs in western hemlock/vanillaleaf (Achlys triphylla),
western hemlock/devil's club, red alder/salmonberry (Alnus rubra/Rubus
spectabilis), and Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis)/devil's club
associations [<a href="#6">6</a>].  At Mount St. Helens, Washington, in the airfall area
(the area surrounding the immediate devastated area), bearded fescue is
one of the dominant riparian herbs [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Species commonly associated with bearded fescue not previously mentioned
in Distribution and Occurrence include noble fir (Abies procera),
Alaska-cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis), vine maple (Acer circinatum),
dwarf Oregon-grape (Berberis nervosa), red huckleberry (Vaccinium
parviflorum), Alaska blueberry (V. alaskensis), baldhip rose (Rosa
gymnocarpa), salal (Gaultheria shallon), western fescue (Festuca
occidentalis), blue wildrye (Elymus glaucus), evergreen violet (Viola
sempervirens), twinflower (Linnaea borealis), bunchberry (Cornus
canadensis), oneleaf foamflower (Tiarella unifoliata), sweet-scented
bedstraw (Galium trifolium), starry Solomon-seal (Smilacina stellata),
thimbleberry (Rubus parviflorus), California hazel (Corylus cornuta var.
californica), oceanspray (Holodiscus discolor), Oregon oxalis (Oxalis
oregana), western sword fern (Polystichum munitum), and bracken fern
(Pteridium aquilinum) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Festuca subulata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bearded fescue is a native, perennial bunchgrass [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Culms are
16 to 32 inches (40-80 cm) tall [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Leaf blades are drooping, flat
or loosely rolled, and 4 to 12 inches (10-30 cm) long [<a href="#9">9</a>].  The
inflorescence is an open, loose panicle 4 to 16 inches (10-40 cm) long
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Bearded fescue is occasionally stoloniferous in Utah [<a href="#9">9</a>], and
California plants reportedly have short rhizomes [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Bearded fescue may sprout from rhizomes and perennating buds at the base
of the culms.  It also reproduces by seed [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bearded fescue occurs on mesic to moist sites in meadows, thickets,
forests, shaded places, coastal mountain valleys, wet benches, terraces
and streambanks [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  It is most commonly found in soils
derived from sandstone, shale, and conglomerates [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].

Elevations for bearded fescue in some western states are as follows:  

                            feet                meters

California                 <8,250               <2,500    [<a href="#9">9</a>]
Utah                  5,544-7,656          1,680-2,320    [<a href="#24">24</a>]
Washington            1,815-4,820            550-1,460    [<a href="#6">6</a>]



<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Bearded fescue grows in both open and shaded areas [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>], but does
best in full or partial shade [<a href="#9">9</a>].  In British Columbia, bearded fescue
occurs as a pioneer species in communities disturbed by avalanches [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Bearded fescue blooms from June to August in California [<a href="#17">17</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Festuca subulata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Bearded fescue grows best in plant communities that burn infrequently,
but it can grow on open, disturbed sites.  Western hemlock, redwood, and
Pacific silver fir forests, in which bearded fescue occurs, have
fire-return intervals of 500 years or more [<a href="#26">26</a>].  The fire-return
interval varies with respect to location, associated species, and
climate.

Bearded fescue has basal culm buds and rhizomes which may sprout after
aerial portions are burned.  Bearded fescue forms densely clumped stems
with persistent dead leaf sheaths at the plant base [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  If thick
tufts form, they may protect the basal buds from fire damage.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil
   Surface rhizome/chamaephytic root crown
   Tussock graminoid
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Festuca subulata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Bearded fescue culms, leaves, and stolons are probably killed by fire.
Plants with rhizomes are probably only top-killed.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Bearded fescue may sprout following some fires.  


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Agee [<a href="#26">26</a>] summarizes fire management options in Pacific Northwest
forests where bearded fescue occurs.  In western hemlock forests no
natural areas are large enough to allow a free-ranging fire, and few
will allow prescribed natural fire.  Also, much of the protected western
hemlock forest is within conservation areas for the northern spotted owl
and is being managed to preserve owl habitat.  Without fire, the
proportion of Douglas-fir in natural stands will decline, particularly
on more mesic sites, and western hemlock will assume a more important
role.  In Pacific silver fir forests fire is not a useful management
option.  Under controllable conditions, prescribed fires will not
spread.  As a fuel reduction tool, prescribed fire usually increases
dead fuel loadings [<a href="#26">26</a>].
