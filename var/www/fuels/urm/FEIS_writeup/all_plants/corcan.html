<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of bunchberry is Cornus
canadensis L.

The discussion of how closely related forms in the Cornaceae should be
recognized has gone on for years and is summarized by Eyde [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>] and
Ferguson [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Two main groups within Cornus are red-line dogwoods,
with showy bracts below the flowers and red fruit, and blue-line
dogwoods, without bracts and blue or white fruit [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Some authorities
have made the dwarf red-line dogwoods into a separate genus called
Chamaepericlymenum Hill (other names given this genus include Mesomora,
Cornella, and Arctocrania) [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>].  Most authorities consider these few
species to be species of Cornus [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>].

Bunchberry hybridizes with Lapland cornel (Cornus suecica) where their
range overlaps in Alaska, Labrador, and Greenland [<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Bunchberry is classified as a mesophytic species which indicates moist
forest types [<a href="#79">79</a>].  In west-central Alberta lodgepole pine (Pinus
contorta)-white spruce (Picea glauca) forests, bunchberry consistently
dominated the forb group in all forest types [<a href="#54">54</a>].  In British Columbia,
it is ubiquitous and thus a poor indicator [<a href="#74">74</a>].  Published
classification schemes listing bunchberry as an indicator species or as
a community dominant are presented below.

Associated species:  In moist northern forests bunchberry grows with a
typical group of herbs called the Cornus-Linnaea synusia, which include
twinflower (Linnaea borealis), greenish flowered wintergreen (Pyrola
virens), dwarf red blackberry (Rubus pubescens), starflower (Trientalis
borealis), and kidney-leaved violet (Viola renifolia) [<a href="#79">79</a>].  Other
species commonly found with bunchberry include sweetscented bedstraw
(Galium triflorum), coltsfoot (Petasites palmatus), Canada mayflower,
starflower, goldthread (Coptis groenlandica), prince's pine (Chimaphila
umbellata), wild sarsaparilla, pink lady's-slipper (Cypripedium acaule),
twinflower, bluebead lily (Clintonia borealis), Indian cucumber-root
(Medeola virginiana), mountain wood-sorrel (Oxalis montana), sidebells
pyrola (Pyrola secunda), and painted trillium (Trillium undulatum)
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#79">79</a>].  In Nova Scotia it is associated with Schreber's moss
(Pleurozium schreberi) following logging [<a href="#97">97</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cornus canadensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
In Alaska, bunchberry is one of the two most important forage plants for
mule deer and black-tailed deer [<a href="#42">42</a>] and is used throughout the growing
season [<a href="#96">96</a>].  Moose also use bunchberry during the growing season
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>].  Bunchberry (C. canadensis and C. suecica) made up 15 percent
of the summer diet of a tame moose on a Newfoundland island [<a href="#10">10</a>].
Spruce and sharp-tailed grouse use the fruit and buds, and the Ipswich
sparrow, veery thrush, Philadelphia vireo, and warbling vireo eat the
fruit [<a href="#57">57</a>].  Alaskan populations of northern red-backed voles rely
heavily on the fruit production of bunchberry and other shrubs in all
seasons, but especially in winter [<a href="#98">98</a>].  Mice may also use the fruit and
disperse the seeds [<a href="#89">89</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
In palatability trials with captive black-tailed deer in southeastern
Alaska, deer preferred leaves from bunchberry plants growing in a forest
over leaves from plants growing in a clearcut [<a href="#42">42</a>].  The degree of use
shown by livestock and wildlife species for blue elderberry in Wyoming
is rated as follows [<a href="#15">15</a>]:

                         WY   
Pronghorn               poor  
Elk                     good

Small mammals           good  
Small nongame birds     good  
Upland game birds       good  
Waterfowl               fair  


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The nutrient content of bunchberry leaves varies seasonally,
geographically, and by site.  In southeastern Alaska, bunchberry leaves
had higher values for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, copper, zinc, and
iron in May than in July and October.  Laboratory analysis showed that
May samples were more digestible than the later samples.  Values for
calcium, magnesium, and sodium varied seasonally in the opposite
direction [<a href="#95">95</a>].

Leaves of bunchberry plants collected in a forest had 1.9 to 2.5 times
more digestible protein than those collected in an adjacent clearcut,
with an average crude protein content 27 percent higher for forest
leaves than for clearcut leaves [<a href="#78">78</a>].  Plants growing in the understory
allocate carbon primarily for growth and maintenance; those in the open
had higher concentrations of carbohydrates, tannins, and other phenolics
[<a href="#42">42</a>].  Mean values from this southeastern Alaska study of bunchberry
plants from three clearcuts and two forest sites are summarized below
[<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Bunchberry is cultivated as an ornamental groundcover because of its
showy flowers and fruits and attractive fall coloring [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>].
Occasional plants with reddish or purplish bracts are considered to be
separate forms by horticulturists [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Bunchberry fruit can be used
for jelly and pies [<a href="#96">96</a>].  The fruit can also be eaten fresh and was used
by native people [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].

In a field study of the effects of acid rain, bunchberry was found to
neutralize acid rain better than Canada mayflower (Maianthenum
canadense), wild sarsaparilla (Aralia nudicaulis), or mountain maple
(Acer spicatum).  It has many trichomes rich in calcium present on its
leaf surfaces that may be largely responsible for neutralizing the acid.
There is as well a continuing reduction in hydrogen ions that may be the
result of an ion-exchange process [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Bunchberry's slender and shallow rhizomes make it vulnerable to soil
disturbance.  Consequently, it is most important in early succession
where there has been little soil disturbance from logging [<a href="#5">5</a>].  In
northern Idaho, bunchberry increases in frequency following logging
without fire and with piling and burning.  It increases slightly
following broadcast burns [<a href="#64">64</a>].  Bunchberry appears to increase its
cover following logging without burning in Ontario red pine (Pinus
resinosa) and eastern white pine (P. strobus) forests [<a href="#86">86</a>].  Following
various logging treatments in northwestern Montana, bunchberry decreased
in presence but increased in cover when compared with untreated stands
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cornus canadensis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bunchberry is a low, rhizomatous subshrub with erect, mostly herbaceous
stems 2 to 8 inches (5-20 cm) tall [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>].  There is a terminal whorl
of four to seven true leaves.  The small white flowers are borne in
clusters above four white or pinkish bracts which makes the entire
inflorescence resemble a single flower [<a href="#55">55</a>].  The coral-red fruits look
like berries but are actually drupes [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>].

Bunchberry has a clonal habit which allows it to maintain itself under a
canopy.  In Alaska, clones are often roughly circular, but rhizomes
ramble across the forest floor and over or through decaying logs [<a href="#90">90</a>].
The rhizomes have annual increments of wood [<a href="#18">18</a>].  The longest living
rhizome found in one study was 172 inches (436 cm), and its age was
estimated at 36 years exclusive of early growth, which was already dead
[<a href="#90">90</a>].  In British Columbia, bunchberry rhizomes generally grow between 2
and 5 inches (5-13 cm) below the surface of the mineral soil [<a href="#60">60</a>].
However, another British Columbia study found bunchberry rhizomes in the
organic layer [<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>].  In Alaska, the "thread-like" rhizomes
were found 1 to 3 inches (2-8 cm) below the forest floor [<a href="#90">90</a>].  In New
Brunswick bunchberry rhizomes were found in mineral soil at a mean depth
of 3.1 inches (8 cm) with a range of 1.6 to 5.1 inches (4-13 cm) [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Tappeiner and Alaback [<a href="#90">90</a>] describe bunchberries growing in old growth
forests with canopy openings, young stands with dense canopies, and open
clearcuts:

<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Bunchberry appears to be self-sterile and is dependent on pollinators
such as bumblebees, solitary bees, beeflies, and syrphid flies [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].
The flowers have one petal with an awnlike extension that initiates the
explosive release of pollen [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Results of one study show low (21.5%)
fruit-set after controlled cross-pollination, and significantly lower
(10.7%) fruit-set after open pollination.  In the same study, other
factors also affected reproductive success.  Buds did not open, fruit
development did not occur, and developing fruit aborted, suggesting that
fruit-set is resource limited.  Possible limiting factors include low
light levels and nutrient-poor soils [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Seeds of bunchberry are
dispersed by birds and mammals [<a href="#62">62</a>].  The seeds of bunchberry are much
smaller than those of other dogwoods, which may be an adaptation to seed
dispersal by mice and/or mouse predation [<a href="#89">89</a>].

Bunchberry seeds have dormant embryos and need cold stratification.
Details of treatment are given in Brinkman [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Normally seed of
bunchberry germinates over a 3-year period, with most of the seed
germinating in either the first or second year.  Further study of
bunchberry germination found good (61-87%) germination in the laboratory
and good germination (72-85%) in packets placed on the soil surface, but
germination was poor (1-8%) in fine mesh packets placed 0.4 inches (1
cm) under the forest floor.  Seed placed beneath the forest floor that
did not germinate within 1 year, did germinate in the laboratory.  Low
light levels may have caused the low germination rates, although other
factors such as low temperature were not ruled out [<a href="#90">90</a>].

A light requirement for germination could be useful to a species that
stores seed in the soil.  Soil-stored seed of bunchberry has been found
in Alberta [<a href="#31">31</a>], in Minnesota [<a href="#4">4</a>], in Maine [<a href="#68">68</a>], and in Quebec [<a href="#62">62</a>].  A
postfire test of buried seed germination in a northern Saskatchewan
white spruce, jack pine (Pinus banksiana), aspen (Populus tremuloides),
and balsam poplar (P. balsamifera) forest found bunchberry seedlings
comprised 5.2 percent of the total sample [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Early growth and clonal development are slow and survival is low (13
percent by the fourth year).  After 3 years, seedlings averaged 1 inch
(25 mm) in height, and by 4 years no rhizomes had been produced [<a href="#90">90</a>].

The establishment of new bunchberry plants from seed is low due to low
fruit set [<a href="#46">46</a>], low germination and survival rates, and slow early
growth.  Although some new seedlings are established, bunchberry is a
clonal perennial that relies heavily on vegetative regeneration to
maintain itself and spread.  It responds vigorously to disturbance [<a href="#90">90</a>].
By September 1980 following the May 18 eruption of Mount St. Helens,
bunchberry had sprouted from rhizomes in previously clearcut areas,
blowdown, and scorched sites [<a href="#61">61</a>].  It was growing on ripped up tree
roots where pieces of rhizomes had survived [<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bunchberry prefers moist, well-drained sites [<a href="#26">26</a>].  It is considered a
facultative wetland plant, which is sometimes found in wetlands but is
usually found on uplands [<a href="#76">76</a>].  It is considered to be indicative of
very moist sites [<a href="#51">51</a>] and of moist soils with moderately good drainage
[<a href="#79">79</a>].  In southeastern Alaska where bunchberry's range overlaps with
that of Lapland cornel, bunchberry is consistently a forest species,
while Lapland cornel is found in bogs.  Hybrids between them are found
on intermediate sites [<a href="#66">66</a>].  In Wisconsin, bunchberry is primarily a
boreal forest plant, although it is frequent in open bogs and occurs in
dry forest types as well [<a href="#13">13</a>].  It is also found on high levees and can
tolerate poorly drained forest sites [<a href="#5">5</a>].  The limitations on
bunchberry's range to the south may be due to its preference for cool,
acidic soils and its inability to survive in soils warmer than 65
degrees F (18 degrees C) in the summer [<a href="#99">99</a>].

Soils:  In northern Idaho, bunchberry grows more abundantly on soils
relatively low in organic matter (2-5.5%) and on granitic rather than
quartzite soils [<a href="#64">64</a>].  It prefers a pH of 7.0 to 7.9, although it grows
on soils with pH from 3.0 to 7.9 [<a href="#51">51</a>].  A perhaps more common view of
bunchberry is that it is an "acid loving" species [<a href="#14">14</a>].  In peatlands of
the boreal forest it is classified as very eutrophic, although it grows
on a wide range of sites [<a href="#51">51</a>].  In rich swamp forest it is an indicator
of minerotrophic water with pH 5.8-7.0, calcium 10-25 p/m, and calcium +
magnesium 13-30 p/m [<a href="#45">45</a>].

Elevation:  Elevational ranges in some western states are as
follows [<a href="#15">15</a>]:

                            Minimum              Maximum
                         feet     meters      feet     meters
Colorado                5,700     1,737      11,000     3,353
Montana                 3,200       975       6,600     2,012
Wyoming                 4,600     1,402       9,000     2,743


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
In Alaskan Sitka spruce-western hemlock forests, bunchberry had 11.3
percent cover under gaps and only 0.87 percent cover under the forest
canopy.  In comparison with other understory species it is more shade
tolerant than salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis) and less shade tolerant
than fernleaf goldthread (Coptis asplenifolia), Alaska blueberry
(Vaccinium alaskaense), and red huckleberry (Vaccinium parvifolium) [<a href="#5">5</a>].
A shade frame study in Manitoba found little difference in frequency of
bunchberry growing in different shade frames, but cover increased
extremely rapidly in plots with 0 percent shade and more rapidly in
plots with 25 percent shade than those with 50 to 100 percent shade
[<a href="#50">50</a>].

During secondary succession on disturbed Sitka spruce-western hemlock
forest sites in Alaska, bunchberry may become a dominant species on
moist microsites within the first 3 years.  It then continues to be a
dominant understory plant until around 40 years when the pole-sized,
overstory canopy becomes dense and continuous.  As the overstory
matures, the canopy opens and becomes stratified.  At around 150 years,
bunchberry biomass may increase sharply and continue to rise as the
old-growth stage is reached [<a href="#5">5</a>].

On Alaskan white spruce sites, bunchberry is a common species by the
mixed hardwood-spruce stage (55-90 years).  By this time tree stands
have thinned out sufficiently to allow light to reach the understory
[<a href="#16">16</a>].  Another report on Alaskan white spruce shows bunchberry
increasing to a peak in the tall shrub-sapling stage (3-30 years),
decreasing as trees become dense (26-45 years), then increasing in the
hardwood stage (45-150 years), and remaining constant or decreasing
slightly into the spruce stage (150-300 years).  The pattern on Alaskan
black spruce (Picea mariana) sites is very similar, although
bunchberry's cover reaches a peak in the mixed hardwood-spruce stage
(55-90 years) [<a href="#25">25</a>].  A study of Michigan red maple (Acer rubrum)-eastern
white pine forests initially dominated by bigtooth aspen (Populus
grandidentata), found bunchberry had its greatest frequency at 50 years
[<a href="#81">81</a>].  In northwestern Montana red cedar (Thuja plicata)-western hemlock
forests, bunchberry frequency is higher early in succession and
decreases sharply in the climax forest [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Phenology for bunchberry in various areas is as follows

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Bunchberry is classed as moderately susceptible to fire-kill [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].
Its rhizomes can survive all but severe fires that remove the duff and
heat the upper soil for an extended period [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  The rhizomes may
survive hotter fires in moist microsites such as depressions [Cooper
1928].  Rowe [<a href="#80">80</a>] considers it a late successional sprouter which is
adapted to short, intermediate, and long fire cycles.  Whether rhizomes
are growing in the organic layers or in mineral soil is important to
fire survival, and this varies both on a site [<a href="#90">90</a>] and between sites
[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>].  While most postfire reports on bunchberry
indicate it sprouts from rhizomes, bunchberry also has soil-stored seed,
which may germinate following fire [<a href="#6">6</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Aboveground plant parts are killed by fire.  The underground rhizomes can
survive all but severe fires that remove the duff and heat the upper
soil for an extended period [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Postfire frequency of bunchberry is usually similar to prefire
frequency, with only a slight decrease or increase [<a href="#83">83</a>].  By 3 to 5
years after fire in Maine and in black spruce forests of southeastern
Labrador, the frequency of bunchberry decreased slightly, but rapid
growth led to a dramatic increase in cover and flower production
[<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#87">87</a>].  After logging in Alaskan western hemlock and Sitka spruce,
bunchberry had higher cover in burned plots than in unburned plots [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Bunchberry usually responds to fire by rhizome sprouting rather than by
seedling establishment from buried seed [<a href="#63">63</a>].  Following spring fire and
less severe summer fires bunchberry readily sprouts from rhizomes, but
it does not do as well after severe fires that remove organic horizons
down to mineral soil [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].  Bunchberry increased its cover by the
second postfire year after logging and prescribed burning in Minnesota
jack pine stands [<a href="#2">2</a>].  However, following a severe fire, bunchberry
cover will decrease sharply at first and then increase slowly.
Bunchberry may also disappear after severe fire [<a href="#3">3</a>].  The timing of the
fire is important.  Following light spring and summer prescribed burns
in New Brunswick mixed forests, density of bunchberry had increased over
prefire density within 3-4 months.  Recovery was slower following light
fall burns [<a href="#24">24</a>].

A survey of burns following logging in Nova Scotia gave the following
results for bunchberry [<a href="#58">58</a>]:

Age of Burn     Severity of Burn     Density     Cover     Frequency

 1 year         severe                1.5        -----      5.3
 2 years        light                27.0        -----     50.0
 6 years        light                 1.4        -----     20.0
 9 years        unknown               0.2        -----     12.0
10 years        unknown              -----       0.3        5.7
22 years        light                -----       0.55      50.0
29 years        light                -----       -----     ----
