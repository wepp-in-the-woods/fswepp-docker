<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Myrica cerifera
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Southern bayberry is most common in peninsular Florida and on the
Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States.  It occurs from the
Florida Keys north to southern New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware; west
to eastern Texas, southeast Oklahoma, and central Arkansas.  Atypical
reported occurrences include Maine, Massachusetts, and New York.

Outside the United States, southern bayberry grows in Bermuda, Cuba, the
Bahamas, Puerto Rico, and the British West Indies.  It grows in Mexico,
Central America, and South America from Costa Rica to Belize [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Southern bayberry is common in a variety of habitats and plant
communities in the southeastern United States.  It grows equally well
with the subtropical vegetation of south Florida and the temperate
vegetation of the Inland Coastal Plain.  Southern bayberry is the most
common shrub in the longleaf (Pinus palustris)-slash pine (P. elliotii)
type [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  Other common overstory associates include loblolly
pine (P. taeda), southern redcedar (Juniperus silicicola) [<a href="#11">11</a>], cabbage
palmetto (Sabel palmetto) [<a href="#48">48</a>], pond pine (Pinus serotina) [<a href="#4">4</a>], live oak
(Quercus virginiana) [<a href="#19">19</a>], spruce pine (Pinus glabra) [<a href="#22">22</a>], and
baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  Common understory associates
include dahoon holly (Ilex cassine), sawgrass (Cladium jamacensis) [<a href="#30">30</a>],
muhly grass (Muhlenbergia spp.), beard grass (Andropogon spp.), saltbush
(Baccharis halmifolia), myrsine (Myrsine floridana), and sweet bay
(Magnolia virginiana) [<a href="#49">49</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
A consistent contributor to the available browse biomass in southeastern
forests, southern bayberry is occasionally eaten by cattle [<a href="#7">7</a>].
Southern bayberry frequently invades rangeland and decreases the
production of more palatable forage [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Many birds eat southern
bayberry fruit, including the northern bobwhite quail and the wild
turkey [<a href="#15">15</a>].  The seeds are important winter food for Carolina wrens and
tree sparrows [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Southern bayberry is unpalatable to white-tailed deer in eastern Texas
[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Its palatability to cattle is unreported.


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Diffuse southern bayberry growth provides some cover for northern
bobwhite quail, although unrestricted growth produces unusable habitat
[<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Southern bayberry's usefulness for disturbed site rehabilitation is
unknown.  Useful attributes include a moderate tolerance of salt-spray
[<a href="#34">34</a>] and an ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen at a rate that exceeds
that of legumes [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Wild southern bayberry seeds can be harvested by hand or shaken onto a
canvas.  Seed processing requires removal of the waxy coat by mechanical
agitation or rubbing over a dry screen.  Before sowing, the seeds
require stratification at 34 to 40 degrees F (1-4 deg C) for 90 days.
The seeds should be drilled into rows 8 to 12 inches (20-30 cm) apart
and covered with 0.25 inch (0.8 cm) of firmed soil.  Fall plantings
should be mulched.  Southern bayberry yields approximately 84,000
cleaned seeds per pound (184,000/kg) [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Southern bayberry is the source of wax used in making bayberry candles.
Boiling removes the wax from the fruit.  The genus name comes from the
Greek "myrike", meaning tamarisk or some other fragrant plant.  The
specific epithet, cerifera, means "wax-bearing" [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].

Southern bayberry was first cultivated in 1699 for medicinal purposes.
Its leaves, bark, and fruit yield pharmaceutical chemicals [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Southern bayberry is a popular ornamental because it grows quickly,
responds well to pruning, and is heavily clothed in attractive evergreen
foliage [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Southern bayberry is an understory pest on southern pine plantations.
It competes with pine seedlings and contribute to an accumulation of
understory fuels which increases the potential for damaging wildfires
[<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Pearson and others [<a href="#36">36</a>] believe that the presence of southern
bayberry on grazed longleaf pine plantations may have eased grazing
pressure on the pine seedlings.

A 20 percent Garlon 4, 10 percent Cide-kick (a penetrant), 70 percent
diesel-oil herbicide mixture can be used for southern bayberry control.
Basal applications should be made in February, using the "streamline"
technique [<a href="#32">32</a>].

Tests of burning, chopping, and blading methods for southern bayberry
control found that southern bayberry can return to pretreatment levels
within 3 years [<a href="#43">43</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Myrica cerifera
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Southern bayberry is an erect, evergreen, small tree or shrub.  It is
native to low-elevation tropical, subtropical, and warm-temperate
regions of the Americas.  It grows to a maximum height of 40 feet (12
m), and a maximum d.b.h. of 12.5 inches (32 cm) at maturity [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].
Its flat leaves are toothed near the end and aromatic when crushed [<a href="#3">3</a>].
The diminutive flowers are unisexual, dioecious, and borne on catkinlike
axillary spikes.  Southern bayberry fruit are small, light green, dry
drupes which are covered with a conspicuous layer of pale blue wax,
giving them a "warty" appearance.  Each axillary spike bears 1 to 12
berries, which may persist over winter [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  The seeds have no
endosperm [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Southern bayberry is clonal, with several stems growing from a common
root collar.  Underground runners extend the growth laterally [<a href="#16">16</a>].
Root nodules, associated with a symbiotic actinomycete, are capable of
atmospheric nitrogen fixation [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (microphanerophyte)
                       Phanerophyte (nanophanerophyte)
   Burned or Clipped State:  Cryptophyte (geophyte)


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Southern bayberry reproduces vegetatively by sprouting from its root
collar and underground runners [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Seedlings will establish on
disturbed sites [<a href="#39">39</a>], but the seeds require removal of their waxy
coating before they will germinate [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Birds, feeding on southern
bayberry fruit, probably accomplish wax removal and seed dispersal.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Southern bayberry grows on a variety of sites but seems to be restricted
to climates with mild winters and long, hot, humid summers, and
elevations below 500 feet (150 m).  It grows in heavy soils [<a href="#41">41</a>] which
may be either wet or dry, in habitats that may be open or wooded [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Southern bayberry's ecological amplitude is demonstrated by reported
growth on fresh to slightly brackish banks and shores, flats and
interdune swales, pine and palmetto flatwoods and savannas, cypress-gum
ponds and swamps, wet and dry prairies, pitcher-plant bogs, upland mixed
woodlands, old fields, and fence and hedge rows [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].
Additionally, it grows on sites that are peculiar to the Florida
Everglades, particularly the drier portions [<a href="#29">29</a>] where it reaches its
highest density with low to medium flooding [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Such sites include
tree islands, cypress heads, and wet and dry hammocks [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Southern bayberry is an early successional species.  It is one of the
first woody plants to invade secondary dunes and beach meadows in the
Southeast [<a href="#9">9</a>], and naturally reseeds disturbed sites from adjacent
forests [<a href="#31">31</a>].  In the Everglades, increased human-caused disturbance,
such as draining and burning, has caused southern bayberry to become
more common as it invades sawgrass, marl prairie, and mixed hardwood
swamp communities.  Dense thickets form, known locally as "hell nests"
[<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].



<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Southern bayberry flowers between February and June.  Its fruit ripens
from August to October [<a href="#2">2</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Myrica cerifera

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Southern bayberry is a fire survivor.  Its root collar suvives fire and
it regenerates by basal sprouting [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex


</pre>
<hr size="3">
<pre><center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Myrica cerifera
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire easily top-kills southern bayberry shrubs [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Typically the
entire aerial portion of the stem dies [<a href="#13">13</a>], although extremely light
fires may only kill the most recent annual growth [<a href="#21">21</a>].  The root collar
survives and remains vigorous.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
Southern bayberry stems die quickly.  The stems and foliage of southern
bayberry contain large amounts of aromatic compounds that are quite
flammable [<a href="#6">6</a>], making it a potential fire hazard.  Presumably, severe
enough fires will kill southern bayberry rootstock, although no such
instances were reported in the literature.  The rootstock is apparently
quite hardy.


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Southern bayberry sprouts vigorously from surviving root collars
following fire [<a href="#2">2</a>].  The most vigorous growth occurs in the 1st postfire
year [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Stem density and frequency increase rapidly relative to
cover.  Cover increases less rapidly because the southern bayberry
clones are self-thinning [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Fire periodicity probably determines the long-term fire response of
southern bayberry.  In loblolly stands in South Carolina, single or
occasional summer fires caused southern bayberry cover to increase.  By
contrast, annual summer fires reduced southern bayberry cover and
sprouting vigor, eventually eliminating it.  Lotti [<a href="#27">27</a>] documented 100
percent mortality after as few as three successive annual summer fires.

Fire response may be site dependant as well.  A single fire on an
eastern Texas slash pine stand caused a steady decline in southern
bayberry for 3 years [<a href="#24">24</a>].  On wet everglades sites (sawgrass, marl
prairie, mixed hardwood swamp), drainage coupled with frequent burning
favors southern bayberry invasion [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  On drier savannas, fire
suppression favors southern bayberry invasion [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>].  On eastern Texas
longleaf pine savannas, southern bayberry control required fires every 5
years [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Lotti [<a href="#28">28</a>] recommended four successive annual fires or three successive
biannual summer fires to achieve a cumulative southern bayberry
mortality of about 90 percent.

Winter fires are less effective than summer fires for southern bayberry
control and may be used when management goals call for southern bayberry
enhancement [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Winter fires can be used for control if done
frequently.  When southern bayberry invasion is undesirable, fires
should be annual for the first several years, then become less frequent
as southern bayberry cover decreases.  Such a prescription may be
combined with grazing for control and maintenance at a level where
southern bayberry provides livestock forage [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].

On nitrogen-poor sites, managers should be cautious about southern
bayberry control.  Annual fires greatly reduce southern bayberry
density, minimizing its nitrogen-fixing contribution [<a href="#42">42</a>].

Dry fuel weights can be predicted from basal stem diameters for southern
bayberry.  Refer to Reeves and Lenhart [<a href="#39">39</a>] for fuel load calculations.
