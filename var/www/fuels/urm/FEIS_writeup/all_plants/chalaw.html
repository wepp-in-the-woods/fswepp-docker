<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of Port-Orford-cedar is
Chamaecyparis lawsoniana (A. Murr.) Parl. [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  There are no
recognized subspecies, varieties, or forms; however, over 200 cultivars
have been developed which vary in size, shape, branching, and coloration
[<a href="#37">37</a>].

Port-Orford-cedar belongs to the family Cupressaceae.  The genus
Chamaecyparis includes eight taxa of which Port-Orford-cedar is the
largest in size.  The range of Alaska-cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis)
overlaps that of Port-Orford-cedar, but natural hybrids are extremely
rare [<a href="#37">37</a>].

<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Chamaecyparis lawsoniana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Port-Orford-cedar has a very limited distribution, occurring near the
Pacific Ocean in southwestern Oregon and northwestern California.  The
northern limit of its distribution is near Coos Bay, Oregon.  The
species' range extends southward about 220 miles (350 km) to the central
portion of the Mad River drainage in Humbolt County, California [<a href="#10">10</a>].
Isolated populations occur near Mount Shasta and the Trinity Mountains
in northern California [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].  It occurs in greatest abundance within
about 40 miles of the coast [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Farther inland, its distribution is
spotty, and it is mostly limited to sites with abundant soil moisture
and/or atmospheric moisture [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  Port-Orford-cedar is cultivated in
Hawaii [<a href="#39">39</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Port-Orford-cedar is found in many vegetation types where it either
forms small, pure stands, codominates with other conifers, or occurs as
scattered trees.  It is a long-lived, shade-tolerant climax species that
dominates or codominates with other coniferous trees to form mature
stands within four vegetation zones.  The following published
classification schemes list Port-Orford-cedar as a climax species or
dominant part of the vegetation in community types (cts) or plant
associations (pas) within the Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), white fir
(Abies concolor), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), and
mixed-evergreen zones:

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Since its discovery by European settlers in the 1850's,
Port-Orford-cedar wood has been used in manufacturing many diverse
products.  Early use was primarily as lumber for house and ship
building, timbers for mines, and in the manufacture of furniture.
Port-Orford-cedar has been used in making a variety of products
including airplanes, arrow shafts, boats, cabinets, crates, decking,
doors, handles, hangers, lawn furniture, mouldings, plywood, telephone
poles, screens, shelves, siding, stools, tables, toys, and yardsticks.
During the 1920's and 1930's production increased dramatically because
of two specialty industries:  the manufacture of battery separators and
venetian blinds.  Following World War II, substitute materials were
found for these products.  Subsequently domestic use almost disappeared,
and today remains almost nonexistent.

Today nearly all harvested Port-Orford-cedar is exported to Japan.
Port-Orford-cedar is very similar to hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtusa) wood,
which is used in traditional Japanese house and temple construction.  On
federal timber sales, Japanese trading companies sometimes purchase
stumpage on bid after examining individual trees.  The wood is regarded
so highly as a hinoki substitute that trees are felled with great care;
sometimes cables are used to control the fall.  Because the supply of
hinoki is very limited, Port-Orford-cedar sells for a premium price as a
hinoki substitute.  Logs exported from the Powers Ranger District,
Oregon, in 1981 sold for an average of $2,166 per thousand board feet.
(the above information is summarized from Zobel and others 1985 [<a href="#37">37</a>] and
Zobel 1986 [<a href="#35">35</a>])


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
As a food source, Port-Orford-cedar is of little importance to wildlife
and livestock.  Seedlings and saplings within regenerating stands show
little browsing damage [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Some plantations, however, have shown
moderate use.  In a wildlife damage study, 19 percent of
Port-Orford-cedar in 8- to 26-year-old plantations was moderately or
severely damaged from browsing.  Sixty percent of the damage was from
deer and elk, and 40 percent from domestic livestock and small mammals
[<a href="#13">13</a>].

Douglas squirrels harvest Port-Orford-cedar cones and eat the seed [<a href="#32">32</a>].
Mountain beavers and rabbits occasionally eat the foliage of saplings,
and woodrats and porcupines eat the bark [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  Caged white-footed
deer mice showed a dislike for Port-Orford-cedar seed [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Port-Orford-cedar appears to be of low palatability to hooved browsers.


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Due to its susceptibility to a fatal root rot, Port-Orford-cedar is
probably of very limited use for rehabilitating disturbed sites (see
Management Considerations).


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Port-Orford-cedar is a commercially important ornamental tree in Europe.
Numerous cultivars exist.  It was first cultivated in 1854.  Within the
natural range of Port-Orford-cedar, branches are collected for use in
florist's greens [<a href="#37">37</a>].  This activity is often regulated by permits.
Native Americans used Port-Orford-cedar wood for house planks, canoes,
utensils, and arrows, and wove the shredded bark into clothing [<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Port-Orford-cedar is extremely susceptible to a fatal root rot caused by
two soil-borne fungi, Phytophthora lateralis and P. cinnamomi.  The
crown of infected trees changes color from the normal blue-green to
gold, bronze, reddish brown, and finally a dull brown.  Moisture stress
in the spring and summer initiates the rapid death of the entire crown.
Within the roots, the fungus moves from the root tips throughout the
tissue to the root crown.  Roots turn a dark brown and finally black and
rot within a few months [<a href="#35">35</a>].

Sometime prior to 1923, root rot spread within hundreds of nurseries,
ornamentals, and windbreaks in the Pacific Northwest north of the
natural range of Port-Orford-cedar and attacked only Port-Orford-cedar
[<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  In 1952 the disease was introduced into the natural range of
Port-Orford-cedar, apparently from infected soil of transplanted
ornamentals [<a href="#35">35</a>].  The disease has now spread throughout much of the
range of Port-Orford-cedar.  The fungus is carried through water-borne
spores transported primarily by natural water flow or in mud carried by
animals or machinery.  Thus spread of the disease has been greatly
accelerated by road construction and maintenance, logging, and house
building [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  In the 1970's mortality of old-growth trees was about
10 million board feet annually and has gradually decreased to about 5
million board feet annually, largely due to the depletion of the
resource [<a href="#37">37</a>].  About 60 percent of coastal second-growth
Port-Orford-cedar which developed following cutting from 1880 to 1930
has been lost to this disease [<a href="#37">37</a>].  It may be over 100 years before
Port-Orford-cedar harvest can contribute significantly to the regional
economy, and this will only happen through proper timber and disease
management [<a href="#37">37</a>].

There is currently no known cure for trees infected with root rot.  Work
is being conducted to find a genetic source resistant to root rot for
developing planting stock [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Root rot can be avoided on sites where
topography prevents the flow of runoff water [<a href="#35">35</a>].  For future harvests,
managers may have to concentrate on growing Port-Orford-cedar on sites
unlikely to be reached by the fungus [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Current root rot management
generally consists of minimizing the spread of the disease by
restricting or regulating human activities.  Zobel and others [<a href="#37">37</a>]
discuss ways to manage Port-Orford-cedar to minimize the spread of the
root rot disease.  With a better understanding of root rot, planting has
begun on some federal and forest industry lands.  Eight to 12 inch
(20-30 cm) tall container stock has been planted at 20 to 26 foot (6-8
m) spacing [<a href="#37">37</a>].  The wide spacing minimizes root overlap and root to
root spread of the root rot fungus.

Because of its high commercial value, numerous Port-Orford-cedar
plantations were begun north of its natural range prior to 1950.  In the
fall of 1955, a severe cold spell caused high mortality of trees on
these plantations [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Some plantations received up to 100 percent
mortality.  Because of its susceptibility to cold injury and root rot,
Port-Orford-cedar should not be used in forestry projects outside its
natural range [<a href="#14">14</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Chamaecyparis lawsoniana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Port-Orford-cedar is a long-lived, shade-tolerant, coniferous, evergreen
tree.  Mature trees typically grow up to 200 feet (60 m) tall and have 4
to 6 foot (122-183 cm) diameter trunks [<a href="#7">7</a>].  The largest tree on record
is 239 feet (73 m) tall with a 12 foot (3.6 m) diameter trunk [<a href="#11">11</a>].
Trees can live more than 600 years.  Old trees have an enlarged base, a
50 to 70 foot (15.2-21.3 m) long branch-free bole, and a spirelike head
of small horizontal or pendulous branches with slender flattened
branchlets [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Occasionally the trunk will fork.  The leaves are
small, scalelike, and arranged close to the branchlets.
Port-Orford-cedar has no taproot but produces vertical sinkers from the
wide-spreading horizontal root system [<a href="#37">37</a>].  This makes trees subject to
windthrow.  The bark of mature trees is very thick, up to about 10
inches (25 cm) [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Growth and height of mature trees varies considerably among different
forest communities.  Height-to-age relationships of Port-Orford-cedar
trees in different forest communities throughout its range is summarized
below [<a href="#12">12</a>]:

Port-Orford-cedar readily grows under the shade of other conifers but
grows faster in the open [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Generally it grows slower than
Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii).  Recent research suggests that
Port-Orford-cedar is one of the most shade-tolerant conifers throughout
its range [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  Seedlings and saplings are often found in the shade
of old-growth forests.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Undisturbed State:  Phanerophyte (megaphanerophyte)
   Burned or Clipped State:  Therophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual regeneration:  The primary method of natural reproduction of
Port-Orford-cedar is via seed.  Trees produce seed in sufficient
abundance to ensure seedling establishment under forest stands.
Currently, where root rot is not a problem, Port-Orford-cedar is
reproducing itself in almost all Port-Orford-cedar communities [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Male and female flowers are found on the same branch but on different
branchlets.  Flower buds begin growth in the spring and become fully
developed by the end of the summer.  Pollination occurs the following
spring, and seeds become fully developed by September or October [<a href="#13">13</a>].
The seeds are borne in small cones that are from 0.25 to 0.5 inch
(0.6-1.2 cm) in diameter [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Port-Orford-cedar seeds have small, thin marginal wings, weigh about 2
mg each, and are about 0.11 to 0.16 inch (3-4 mm) long [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Harris
[<a href="#11">11</a>] reports that seeds are quite variable in weight and size, requiring
from 60,000 to 600,000 to equal a pound.

Port-Orford-cedar begins to produce seed early, between 5 and 9 years of
age.  Cone production becomes greatest at about age 100 and continues
throughout the life of the tree [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Although trees produce seed every
year, heavy seed crops are produced every 4 or 5 years [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Zobel
[<a href="#32">32</a>] found annual seed production to vary considerably from year to year
and from site to site within a given year, from 8,097 to 1,862,348 seeds
per acre (20,000-4,600,000/ hectare) and from 56 to 17,193 seeds per
square foot of tree basal area (600 to 185,000/sq m).  The variability
was not clearly related to stand or site factors.  Seed fall begins in
September and continues throughout winter and spring.  Generally about
50 to 60 percent of the seed has fallen by mid-January, with 90 percent
or more fallen by the beginning of May [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Dispersal distance is
generally short.  One to three tree heights is a common distance of
invasion into clearcuts [<a href="#37">37</a>].  The small wings aid in floating on water.
Dispersal by water may be of some importance in streamside habitats.

Most Port-Orford-cedar seed germinates the first spring after dispersal,
but a very small amount may lay dormant for up to 5 years [<a href="#13">13</a>].
Germination generally occurs from mid to late June [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Viability of
seed can be low.  Germination of seed collected from seed traps from
many sites ranged from 13.8 to 44.2 percent [<a href="#32">32</a>].  In this study, seeds
which fell early or late had lower germination percentages than seeds
which fell during peak seed fall, and seed collected from trees had
higher germination percentages (37, 52, and 55 percent) than seed
collected from seed traps [<a href="#32">32</a>].  This is much closer to the 48 to 52
percent range reported by Harris [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Seed may be stored in sealed
containers at temperatures below freezing with seed moisture content
below 10 percent.  Viability of seed stored in this manner for 7 years
dropped from an initial 56 to 43 percent [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Seedling establishment on forest floor litter accounts for the majority
of natural Port-Orford-cedar reproduction.  The litter layer under
Port-Orford-cedar is generally shallow, averaging about 0.4 to 1.6
inches (1-4 cm) [<a href="#12">12</a>].  First year survival of seedlings is often about
50 percent [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>] but drops dramatically thereafter.  Disturbance of
the mineral soil can greatly enhance establishment.  Native
Port-Orford-cedar seed was sown on plots that were treated as follows:
(1) undisturbed with the litter left intact, (2) the litter removed, (3)
burned, or (4) spaded after litter was removed.  The most germinants and
the most surviving germinants after one growing season were found on
spaded plots [<a href="#33">33</a>].  By the end of two growing seasons, no seedlings
survived on plots that were burned or had the litter removed.  After
three seasons, 5 percent of the original germinants survived on spaded
plots and 6 percent survived on undisturbed plots.  Seedlings and
saplings are often found growing in the open or under shade but not
under extremely dense shade.  One study found that live seedlings were
found growing in 0.7 to 2.5 percent of full light, but that dead or
nearly dead seedlings were on sites receiving only 0.2 to 0.4 percent of
full light [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Thus seeds may germinate in dense, young stands, but
extreme shading can cause total mortality of emerging seedlings.
Following clearcutting or shelterwood cutting, Port-Orford-cedar
successfully establishes from seed within about about 88 to 132 yards
(80-110 m) from a seed tree [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Emerging seedlings are delicate and
probably sensitive to drought [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Within a deer exclosure 1-year-old
seedlings averaged 1.4 inches (3.6 cm) in height, and 2-year-old
seedlings averaged 3.1 inches (7.9 cm) [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Vegetative regeneration:  Vegetative regeneration is very limited in
Port-Orford-cedar.  Plants do not naturally sprout.  However, stem
cuttings root relatively easily if proper methods are followed [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].
Layering occurs infrequently and is restricted mostly to trees buried by
sand or thrown by wind [<a href="#37">37</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Although restricted to a small range that covers only 220 miles (350 km)
from north to south, Port-Orford-cedar occupies many vegetation zones,
soil types, and elevations.  It commonly grows in mixed stands but
occasionally forms pure stands.  It occurs mainly within Sitka spruce,
western hemlock, white fir, redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), red fir
(Abies magnifica), mixed-pine, and mixed-evergreen forests
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Within each forest, Port-Orford-cedar is
primarily restricted to moist locations such as benches, drainageways,
or some type of concavity which receives a constant seepage of water
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  It is mostly absent from ridges and upper slopes due to
the lack of water; however, some coastal Oregon and upper elevation
Klamath Mountain stands do occupy top-slope positions [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].
Port-Orford-cedar also occurs on coastal dunes and in bogs with
ultramafic soils.

Common associates:  Besides the above mentioned species,
Port-Orford-cedar is commonly associated with Douglas-fir, grand fir
(Abies grandis), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), western redcedar
(Thuja plicata), and Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia) in coastal areas
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  Inland tree associates include sugar pine (P. lambertiana),
western white pine (P. monticola), incense-cedar (Libocedrus decurrens),
and Pacific yew [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  Hardwood tree associates include tanoak
(Lithocarpus densiflorus), Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), golden
chinkapin (Castanopsis chrysophylla), red alder (Alnus rubra), and
canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  Associated shrubs
include dwarf Oregongrape (Berberis nervosa), salal (Gaultheria
shallon), oceanspray (Holodiscus discolor), the shrub form of tanoak (L.
densiflorus var. echinoides), Sadler oak (Q. sadleriana), huckleberry
oak (Q. vaccinifolia), Pacific rhododendron (Rhododendron macrophyllum),
western azalea (Rhododendron occidentale), baldhip rose (Rosa
gymnocarpa), red huckleberry (Vaccinium parvifolium), and evergreen
huckleberry (V. ovatum) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].

Soils:  Port-Orford-cedar occurs on many different soil types including
dune sands, organic bog soils, and soils derived from gabbro, diorite,
serpentine, peridotite, river alluvium, and other rock types [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].
On diorite it is more commonly found above 2,500 feet (760 m) [<a href="#30">30</a>].
Most low elevation Port-Orford-cedar forests occur on soils dervived
from ultramafic parent materials [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Port-Orford-cedar is more
successful in communities where the parent material is at least
partially derived from ultramafic rock and where competition is somewhat
reduced [<a href="#77">77</a>].  On all soil types, Port-Orford-cedar is limited to mesic
situations [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Litter:  The litter layer under eight Port-Orford-cedar communities was
found to be relatively shallow, averaging only 0.4 to 1.6 inches (1-4
cm) deep [<a href="#12">12</a>].  The foliage of Port-Orford-cedar is less acidic than
Pinaceae.  Thus the litter and soil under Port-Orford-cedar stands are
less acidic than under nearby conifer stands [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Climate:  Port-Orford-cedar is distributed over an area that has warm,
dry summers and cool, wet winters.  Most stands in California receive at
least 59 inches (150 cm) of precipitation annually [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Inland
disjunct stands receive at least 49 inches (125 cm) of precipitation
annually.

Elevation:  Port-Orford-cedar is found from sea level to 5,100 feet
(1,554 m) in elevation [<a href="#3">3</a>].  


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Port-Orford-cedar occurs as both an early seral invader and as a
long-lived, shade-tolerant climax species.  Seedlings become established
after disturbances such as clearcutting or fire but also become
established within mature forests.  Continual seedling establishment and
shade tolerance produce stands with many age classes [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Following disturbances such as fire or cutting, Port-Orford-cedar
readily establishes where a seed source exists.  Fire can eliminate
young trees, but old-growth trees are very fire-resistant and often
survive fire to reseed the site.  In some old forests, two or more size
classes of Port-Orford-cedar may exist, resulting from the establishment
of trees following periodic fires [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Shoot growth of Port-Orford-cedar differs greatly from that of pines and
firs.  Pines and fir species have bud tissue which preforms the
following year's shoots.  Port-Orford-cedar does not have preformed
buds; therefore shoot elongation over the summer takes longer than
competing Pinaceae.  Port-Orford-cedar grows much slower than
Douglas-fir, and in the northern part of its range where
Port-Orford-cedar grows best, prolonged shoot elongation may be
necessary for it to compete.  Port-Orford-cedar's twig growth phenology
may partially explain its northern distributional limit.  North of its
range, the prolonged shoot elongation needed to make plants more
competitive with other conifers would make them susceptible to frost.
Port-Orford-cedar grows on hot open sites and tends to initiate twig
growth earlier and often completes growth more quickly than trees on
colder sites. (the above information is summarized from Zobel 1983 [<a href="#34">34</a>])

Port-Orford-cedar flower buds are typically set in the fall with
pollination taking place the following spring [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Cones ripen in
September or October with seed dispersal occurring immediately
thereafter and continuing until spring [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Chamaecyparis lawsoniana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Although young Port-Orford-cedar trees are easily killed by fire,
relatively old trees are very fire resistant because their bark may be
up to 10 inches (25 cm) thick.  It is apparently less fire resistant
than Douglas-fir, Ponderosa pine, sugar pine, Jeffrey pine, and
incense-cedar, but more fire resistant than true firs and hemlocks
[<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  Many vigorous old trees show evidence of repeated burning and
have large fire scars [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  A stump in Oregon that was 21 inches (54
cm) in diameter and 285 years old had fire scars at 35, 183, and 228
years [<a href="#37">37</a>]. Some fires have removed all but a thin, incomplete outer
shell of wood and bark at the tree base, yet trees remain healthy [<a href="#37">37</a>].
These surviving trees provide a seed source for postfire seedling
establishment.  Pole-sized trees have moderate fire resistance and can
probably withstand ground fires [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Port-Orford-cedar drops much less litter on the forest floor than
Douglas-fir [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Fire frequency is partially dependent upon this fuel
accumulation. Atzet [<a href="#1">1</a>] rated the likelihood of fire occurring under
different conifer stands as follows:

                        Less Likely
                        -----------              
                        red fir 
                        Jeffery pine
                        Port-Orford-cedar
                        tanoak
                        Douglas-fir
                        white fir
                        -----------
                        More Likely

On inland sites Port-Orford-cedar mostly occurs along stream channels,
boggy drainages, other moist topographic concavities or north aspects
[<a href="#3">3</a>].  These sites have a low probability of fire carrying after ignition
[<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   crown-stored residual colonizer; short-viability seed in on-site cones
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by wind; postfire years 1 and 2

</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Relatively small Port-Orford-cedar trees are easily killed by fire.
Repeated fires can eliminate all the Port-Orford-cedar regeneration size
classes from mature forest understories [<a href="#1">1</a>].  This is probably why
Port-Orford-cedar is rare where fires occur frequently [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Mature Port-Orford-cedars are very fire resistant and often survive
fire.  Seed dispersed from surviving trees allows Port-Orford-cedar to
rapidly establish numerous seedlings.  Seedlings may maintain dominance
for a few years but are usually overgrown by faster growing conifers
within about 20 to 25 years [<a href="#13">13</a>].  Since Port-Orford-cedar is very shade
tolerant, trees established following a fire will persist in the
understory and eventually replace other conifers such as Douglas-fir if
there is a sufficient fire-free interval to allow trees to grow to a
fire-resistant size [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  Some sampled stands have two or more
distinct size classes, each thought to have become established following
a fire [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].
