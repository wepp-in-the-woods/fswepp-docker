<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Ocotillo is a characteristic species of the vegetation of the Sonoran
and Chihuahuan deserts [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].  In the Sonoran Desert,
ocotillo is a dominant member of mixed woody, succulent scrub,
creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) scrub, and shrub-grassland associations
on well-drained rocky slopes, bajadas, and alluvial fans, often with
shallow soils [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].  Ocotillo is a dominant species in
desert scrub, lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla) scrub, and yucca (Yucca
spp.) woodland vegetation of the Chihuahuan Desert on rocky bajadas,
slopes, and ridges [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].

Ocotillo is also prominent in desert grassland and oak woodland habitats
at elevations above desert scrub vegetation [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>], and in
subtropical thorn scrub or thorn forest communities [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].

Publications listing ocotillo as a dominant, codominant, or indicator
species in vegetation classifications follow:

Sonoran desertscrub [<a href="#66">66</a>]
Natural terrestrial communities of Brewster County, Texas, with special
  reference to the distribution of the mammals [<a href="#13">13</a>]
Vegetation and flora of Fort Bowie National Historic Site, Arizona [<a href="#71">71</a>]
A vegetation classification system applied to southern California [<a href="#47">47</a>]

Some species commonly associated with ocotillo not mentioned in
Distribution and Occurrence include saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea),
leatherstem (Jatropha spp.), jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis), range ratany
(Krameria parvifolia), Wheeler sotol (Dasylirion wheeleri), brittle bush
(Encelia farinosa), lechuguilla, ironwood (Olneya tesota),
false-mesquite (Calliandra eriophylla), wolfberry (Lycium spp.), agave
(Agave spp.), yucca (Yucca spp.), acacia (Acacia spp.), prickly pear and
cholla (Opuntia spp.), threeawn (Aristida spp.), and grama (Bouteloua
spp.)  [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].

Ocotillo may also be associated with, or in close proximity to, riparian
habitats along rivers, floodplains, or desert washes.  In these
instances ocotillo may occur with narrowleaf cottonwood (Populus
angustifolia), Fremont cottonwood (P. fremontii), boxelder (Acer
negundo), Arizona walnut (Juglans major), honey mesquite (Prosopis
glandulosa), sycamore (Platanus spp.), oaks (Quercus spp.), and blue
paloverde (Cercidium floridum) [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Habitats dominated or codominated by ocotillo are important to mule and
white-tailed deer in the San Cayetano Mountains in south-central
Arizona.  White-tailed deer prefer communities which include ocotillo
fom February to April.  Honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa var.
glandulosa)-ocotillo habitat types are indicative of mule deer habitat;
79 percent of observed deer were found in these types during May, June,
and July [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  White-tailed deer had a higher volume of ocotillo in
their diet in drought years than in nondrought years, whereas mule deer
had a higher volume of ocotillo in their diet in nondrought years [<a href="#1">1</a>].
Actual ocotillo use by deer in Arizona and New Mexico is considered low
(1-5% of rumen contents) [<a href="#54">54</a>].

Ocotillo is eaten by desert bighorn sheep in the Harquahala Mountains in
Arizona [<a href="#53">53</a>].

Ocotillo has no forage value for livestock [<a href="#26">26</a>], although cattle and
goats have been observed browsing it on floodplains along the Rio Grande
[<a href="#14">14</a>].

Birds of the Organ Pipe National Monument utilize ocotillo for foraging [<a href="#46">46</a>].

NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
In the Southwest, ocotillo stems are cut and planted close together to
make living fences or walls.  Ocotillo makes an excellent ornamental in
desert landscaping theme and cactus gardens [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].  The resin
and wax from ocotillo bark is used for conditioning leather [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].
Historically, ocotillo fruits and flowers were eaten by Cahuilla
Indians.  Roots were powdered by Apache Indians and used to treat wounds
and painful swellings.  They also bathed in an ocotillo root mixture to
relieve fatigue [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].  A beverage made from ocotillo flowers was
used for cough medicine [<a href="#69">69</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Ocotillo increased under protection from livestock grazing (0.5 to 2.4%
frequency) over a 50-year period at the Carnegie Desert Laboratory in
southern Arizona.  The vegetation was dominated by Sonoran Desert
species such as ocotillo, creosotebush, foothill paloverde (Cercidium
microphyllum), and saguaro [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Ocotillo produces tannins which may help in its defense against
herbivory [<a href="#75">75</a>].

The endangered Lucifer hummingbird's habitat in New Mexico centers on
slopes and adjacent canyons in arid montane areas dominated by ocotillo
and agave species [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Ocotillo competes for space with jumping cholla (Opuntia fulgida) in
Arizona upland vegetation associations.  Its root system may also
overlap with that of saguaro, suggesting competition for root space
between the two [<a href="#76">76</a>].

Removal of grasses by grazing may allow shrubs, including ocotillo, to
increase in low desert grasslands [<a href="#79">79</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Fouquieria splendens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Ocotillo is a drought-deciduous shrub with 6 to 100 wandlike branches
that arise from the root crown.  Stems are 9 to 30 feet (2-9 m) tall
with spines to 1.5 inches (4 cm) long.  Leaves grow to 2 inches (5 cm)
long and are thick and leathery.  Leaf abscission occurs under water
stress so ocotillo appears leafless most of the year, but it quickly
refoliates after rain [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].  Four or five crops of leaves may
be produced annually [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  The leaves mature within a few weeks and
are then shed [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  Ocotillo is dormant when leafless and is
protected from further water loss by its waterproof bark [<a href="#36">36</a>].  The
bisexual scarlet flowers are clustered at the stem tips in a panicle and
often appear before the leaves in spring.  The fruit is a capsule that
contains numerous, winged seeds [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].

The root system of ocotillo is shallow with a few laterals branching
from the main taproot just below the soil surface [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>].  Taproots
penetrated to a depth of 3 to 6 inches (8-15 cm) on adobe clay underlain
by caliche on the bajada of Tumamoc Hill near Tucson, Arizona [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Ocotillo has the physical capacity to produce leaves without the
concurrent movement of nutrients or hormones from the roots, and without
addition of exogenous nutrients or hormones.  The process is dependent
of water availability.  Cut ocotillo stems decoupled from root activity
began to refoliate within 24 hours after being placed in water, even
after months of dry storage.  The largest leaves were approximately 1
inch (2.4 cm) long within 8 days.  The cut stems did not produce roots
[<a href="#31">31</a>], although stem cuttings are known to sprout [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].

Ocotillo has extrafloral nectaries (nectar-secreting glands) located on
the flower buds that may promote mutualistic interactions with insects.
Insects gain nutrients and water while ocotillo gains decreased
herbivory [<a href="#48">48</a>], particularly during the reproductive period


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Ocotillo reproduces by basal sprouting [<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>] and sprouting from stem
cuttings [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].

Ocotillo flowers produce nectar and are pollinated by hummingbirds and
bees.  Ocotillo may self pollinate to a limited extent.  In southern
Arizona flowering coincides with the northward migration of
hummingbirds.  Seed set per flower is greater for plants flowering
during migration than for plants flowering after hummingbirds have
migrated [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].

Freeman [<a href="#16">16</a>] stated that each ocotillo plant produces at most a few
hundred highly viable seeds (viability of 90%) per year that are known
to germinate after rain.  Germination remains relatively high (about
40%) even after 8 days of exposure to temperatures of 104 degrees
Fahrenheit (40 deg C) for 12 hours each day.  This lack of sensitivity
to high temperatures suggests that ocotillo can germinate readily after
late summer rains.  Ocotillo seeds probably do not survive for long in
the soil.  Ocotillo probably requires a sequence of favorable conditions
to regenerate well, such as heavy winter rain for seed production
followed by heavy summer rain for seedling establishment [<a href="#78">78</a>].  Shreve
[<a href="#55">55</a>] reported that ocotillo had low and erratic seedling establishment
and a large amount of seedling mortality due to moisture stress.  After
summer rains extremely high densities of seedlings (more than 100/sq m)
were observed, but less than 1 percent of those survived to 1 year of
age.  Survival from year 1 to 7 was approximately 27 percent.  No
ocotillo seedlings were found in the months following heavy September
rainfall in a desert community in San Diego County, California [<a href="#78">78</a>].

The winged seeds of ocotillo are probably wind dispersed.

Ocotillo recruitment has a positive significant (p<0.05) association
with triangle bursage (Ambrosia deltoidea) in desert shrub communities
in Arizona [<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Ocotillo is found on dry, well-drained, rocky slopes, mesas, bajadas,
outwash plains, and valleys in desert shrub and desert grassland
habitats [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].  Soils are generally rocky, shallow, and
of limestone or granitic origin and are often underlain by caliche
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#71">71</a>].  Ocotillo generally occurs from sea level to approximately
5,200 feet (1,600 m) elevation [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].  It may reach its upper
elevational limits 900 to 1,500 feet (270-450 m) higher on limestone
than on granitic soils [<a href="#56">56</a>].  In the Guadalupe and Del Norte mountains
of the Trans-Pecos region of Texas, ocotillo is found on limestone
ridgetops, outcrops, and slopes, at elevations as high as 6,700 feet
(2,050 m) [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  Ocotillo may also occur at higher elevations in
oak woodlands above desert grassland communities [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Aspect is
generally south or southeast, where surface temperatures allow daily
thawing even with freezing air temperatures above the surface layer
[<a href="#10">10</a>].

In the Sonoran Desert ocotillo is found from the valley plains to upper
bajadas at elevations up to 2,300 feet (700 m).  It is probably more
abundant on the upper bajadas due to rapid infiltration and thus greater
available soil moisture in the coarse rocky upland soils than in the
heavy silt loams of the valley plains [<a href="#70">70</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Little information is available on the successional status of ocotillo.
Seedlings are rarely found on disturbed soils [<a href="#76">76</a>] but are found under
the canopy of mature plants [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>].  Zedler [<a href="#78">78</a>] stated that ocotillo
is a long-lived stable element of desert vegetation with specialized
requirements for seed germination that limit its capacity to exploit
opportunities for population expansion.  Shreve [<a href="#58">58</a>] reported that the
rate of growth and mortality of ocotillo are high and that its life span
probably does not exceed 60 years.  Others have observed ocotillo plants
that were 72+ years old [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Ocotillo persisted on eroded clay beds on a few inches to 1 foot (30 cm)
of soil in the early stages of erosion at the Tornilla Clay Beds, Texas
[<a href="#42">42</a>].  


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Ocotillo generally flowers from March to June depending on latitude
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  In southern Arizona ocotillo produces flowers from March to
May and flowering generally lasts 50 to 60 days.  Seed drop occurs from
May to mid-June [<a href="#72">72</a>].

The following phenological pattern was observed in ocotillo on an upper
bajada in the Chihuahuan Desert in New Mexico between July 1978 and June
1980 [<a href="#30">30</a>]:
             
  September-October, 1978 --growth of new leaves
   October-November, 1978 --leaf abscission
              April, 1979 --initiation of flower buds
          April-May, 1979 --flowering
                May, 1979 --growth of new leaves
          June-July, 1979 --mature fruits
        July-August, 1979 --leaf yellowing
   August-September, 1979 --growth of new leaves
            October, 1979 --leaf abscission
              April, 1980 --initiation of flower buds
          April-May, 1980 --flowering
                May, 1980 --growth of new leaves
               June, 1980 --mature fruits

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Fouquieria splendens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Ocotillo bark contains resin and wax which allow it to burn easily
[<a href="#69">69</a>].  Its seeds probably do not survive for long in the soil [<a href="#78">78</a>] and
seedlings are not known to establish in recently burned areas.  Ocotillo
does sprout from the root crown following damage from fire, but its
sprouting ability is probably dependent on fire severity [<a href="#73">73</a>].  Fires
that occur when ocotillo is leafless (as it is for much of the year) may
be less harmful than those that occur when the plant is actively growing.

Fires in general are not prevalent over much of the range of ocotillo.
Although desert vegetation rarely burns completely due to a lack of
continuous fuels, unusually heavy winter rains may produce a cover of
annual species dense enough to carry a fire when cured.  Fires resulting
from this situation tend to occur at the desert shrub-desert grassland
ecotone [<a href="#28">28</a>], or in tobosa (Hilaria mutica) or sacaton (Sporobolus spp.)
swales [<a href="#27">27</a>], which are common habitats for ocotillo.  Thomas [<a href="#63">63</a>] has
estimated that fire frequency in the Sonoran Desert is over 250 years,
but has cited references suggesting that fire intervals in adjacent
desert grasslands may be as short as 3 to 40 years.  During the period
of 1973 to 1979, 210 fires burned in the Lower Colorado and Arizona
Upland subdivisions of the Sonoran Desert [<a href="#52">52</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Fouquieria splendens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Ocotillo is at least top-killed by most fires but survival is related to
fire severity.  Ocotillo is considered moderately sensitive to fire
[<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Ocotillo was severely reduced following a wildfire in June, 1963, near
Sasabe, Arizona.  The desert grassland vegetation consisted of ocotillo,
mesquite (Prosopis spp.), Mexican blue oak (Quercus oblongifolia),
Wheeler sotol, beargrass (Nolina microcarpa), velvetpod mimosa (Mimosa
dysocarpa), bullgrass (Muhlenbergia emersleyi), and grama.  Plants whose
crowns were charred or completely consumed were classed as severely
damaged.  Damage was moderate when only portions of a plant were burned.
Plants at the edge of the burn that were only scorched were classed as
lightly damaged.  By postfire year 2, the proportion of ocotillo plants
refoliating or sprouting after fire was 33 percent in the severe damage
class, 60 percent in the moderate damage class, and 50 percent in the
light damage class.  The differences were not tested for statistical
significance.  Sprouting after the fire was confined to the base for
moderately and severely burned ocotillo that survived, but some lightly
damaged plants also refoliated original branches [<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].

No ocotillo sprouts or seedlings were observed within 3 years following
a June wildfire near Phoenix, Arizona, although ocotillo was present in
the prefire desert shrub community dominated by creostotebush, triangle
bursage, foothill paloverde, and acacia (Acacia spp.) [<a href="#52">52</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Humphrey [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>] suggested that the invasion of woody species (such as
ocotillo) into desert grasslands can be reversed or controlled by
burning at 5- to 10-year intervals.
