<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In Montana, kidney-leaved violet is threatened by timber harvesting in
mesic forests.  Within Glacier National Park, populations should be
located and threats assessed [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Viola renifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Kidney-leaved violet is a native perennial that grows 2 to 4 inches
(5-10 cm) tall.  It has reniform, or kidney-shaped, leaves that are 1 to
2.5 inches (3-6 cm) long.  It does not have stolons, as some similar
species do.  The flowers are zygomorhpic and cleistogamous.  The 10- to
15-mm-long corolla has white petals; the lower three are purple-penciled.
The capsule is purplish; seeds are brown and 1 to 5 mm long [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Kidney-leaved violet reproduces by both sexual and vegetative means [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Kidney-leaved violet grows from inland forests to subalpine slopes.  It
occurs on cool or damp sites in moist coniferous forests at low to
middle elevations [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  It is usually found in cedar swamps, woods,
and thickets of other conifers in the Lake States [<a href="#18">18</a>] and in rich, open
woods in New England [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Seeds have been found in organic but not
mineral soils [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Kidney-leaved violet was more common in mesotrophic white spruce (Picea
glauca) forests than in submesotrophic lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta)
forests [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Across Canada, it had 47 percent presence in white spruce
forests and 35 percent presence in black spruce (Picea mariana) [<a href="#10">10</a>].
In a white spruce forest in Alberta, kidney-leaved violet represented
0.2 to 0.5 percent of the plant cover [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Kidney-leaved violet occurs at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000
feet (900-1,525 m) in Montana [<a href="#17">17</a>] and 6,500 to 10,500 feet (2,095-3,199
m) in Colorado [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
In Alberta, kidney-leaved violet seeds were found in the soil seed bank
only where mature plants were already present.  The species was present
in stands 80 to 145 years old [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Kidney-leaved violet floweres in June and July in Montana [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  In
New England, it flowers during the last week of May [<a href="#15">15</a>].
