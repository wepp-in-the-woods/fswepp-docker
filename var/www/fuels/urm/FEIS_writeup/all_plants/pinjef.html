<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Jeffrey pine typically occurs in pure stands along the eastern slope of
the Sierra Nevada.  In the northern Sierra Nevada and into the southern
Cascade Range, it forms more mixed stands with Washoe Pine (Pinus
washoensis), ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa), incense cedar (Libocedrus
decurrens), white fir (Abies concolor), and western juniper (Juniperus 
occidentalis).  Common understory associates in mixed stands include
shinyleaf ceanothus (ceanothus velutinus), greenleaf manzanita
(Arctostaphylos patula), curlleaf mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius), 
and bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].

<pre><center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus jeffreyi
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
For commercial use, no distinction is made between the wood of Jeffrey pine
and ponderosa pine.  Low-grade trees are processed into dimensional lumber 
and other products for the construction market.  High-grade lumber is an
important raw material for molding, mill work, cabinets, doors, and windows 
[<a href="#5">5</a>].



<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Food:  Birds and mammals use Jeffrey pine as a food source.  Seeds are
eaten by the Clark's nutcracker and other birds.  Many small mammals
such as mice, chipmunks, squirrels, and voles eat the stems and roots of
young Jeffrey pine.  During harsh winters or drought, large mammals such
as elk and deer will browse on the needles and bark [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Shelter:  Young Jeffrey pine seedlings provide ground shelter for small
birds and mammals.  Older stands serve as windbreaks for larger mammals.
Insect-killed trees provide snags and fallen logs which become habitat
for nesting birds and cavity dwellers [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Jeffrey pine is considered low in palatability to livestock and
wildlife.


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Jeffrey pine is an important tree for providing wildlife cover.  Birds
that use this tree include various species of flycatcher, chickadee,
warbler, and junco [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Primary and secondary cavity-nesting birds such
as woodpecker and sapsucker use both the live and dead pine trees.
Jeffrey pine provides thermal and escape cover for elk and deer.  Fallen
logs and stumps are used as cover by cottontail, small rodents, and
reptiles [<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Jeffrey pine exhibited positive revegetative potential on acid mine
waste sites in northeastern California.  It was found to be well adapted
to a sulfur mine spoil site that was high in acidity and low in nitrogen
availability [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Jeffrey pine pitch was distilled for turpentine early in the century, however,
the terpens were found to contain high amounts of the explosive chemical
heptane [<a href="#27">27</a>].



<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Jeffrey pine management must consider both biotic and abiotic factors.
Environmental conditions that cannot be managed, such as cold
temperatures, may kill needles, buds, or even inner bark.  Severe
drought or flooding can also damage root systems.  Human activities such
as road salting, sewage disposal, and air pollution all affect Jeffrey
pine [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Jeffrey pine is highly susceptible to ozone and acidic mists
created by pollutants from urban areas of California [<a href="#39">39</a>].

The usual cause of seed failure is poor seedbeds, sparse seed crops,
poor seed dissemination, seed predators, cutworms, and pathogens.  Once
established, however, Jeffrey pine responds well to silvicultural
treatments [<a href="#31">31</a>].  A study in northeastern California found Jeffrey
pine's average d.b.h. and height growth to increase 167 and 62 percent
respectively during the first 5 years after thinning [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Insects:  Many insects attack Jeffrey pine.  In general, these include
various defoliators, borers, tip moths, bark beetles, and a host of cone
and seed feeders.  The worst enemy of Jeffrey pine is the Jeffrey pine
beetle (Dendroctonus jeffreyi).  This beetle is prevalent throughout its
range and causes large amounts of timber mortality.  Two other damaging
insects include the California flatheaded borer (Melanophila
californica) and red turpentine beetle (Dendroctonus valens) [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Disease:  Fungus such as elytroderma (Elytroderma deformans), Medusa
needle blight (Davisomycella medusa), and cenangium limb canker
(Cenangium ferruginosum) all reduce growth or kill Jeffrey pine.  Rust
inhibitors to growth include stalactiform rust (Peridermium
stalactiforme), filamentosum rust (Peridermium filamentosum), sweetfern
rust (Cronartium comptoniae), tarweed rust (Coleosporium madiae), and
western gall rust (Peridermium harknessii) [<a href="#21">21</a>].  The most damaging
disease of Jeffrey pine is caused by western dwarf mistletoe
(Arceuthobium campylopodum).  Heavy infections cause witches brooms,
reduced growth, and eventually death.  Dwarf mistletoe has predisposed
many stands to insect attack and has induced 60 to 80 percent of all
Jeffrey pine mortality in years of severe drought [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Root fungal diseases include annosus (Heterobasidion annosum),
armillaria (Armillaria mellea), and black stain (Verticicladiella
wagnerii).  Fungi causing heart rots include species of lentinus, fomes,
and polyporus.  Fumigation of nursery stock is necessary to control
nematodes, and root rots such as rhizoctoria, phytophthora, pythium,
macrophomina, Fusarium spp., and foliar diseases such as phoma and
sirococcus [<a href="#21">21</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus jeffreyi
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Jeffrey pine may live 400 to 500 years and can attain immense size.  The
species typically grows 4 to 6 feet (1.2-2.8 m) in diameter and 170 to
200 feet (52-61 m) in height.  The largest Jeffrey pine found in the
western Sierra Nevada measures 7.5 feet (2.28 m) in diameter and 175
feet (53 m) in height [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  The bark is deeply furrowed with hard
scales and lacks resin pits.  Needles are in bundles of three and are
7.5 to 11 inches (12-28 cm) long, persisting 5 to 8 years.  Female cones
are subterminal, long-oval, and are 6 to 10 inches (15-25 cm) long [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Jeffrey pine regenerates sexually.  It does not reproduce naturally by
vegetative methods.

Flowering and Fruiting:  Jeffrey pine is monoecious.  Following
pollination, the conelets develop slowly, achieving less than one-fifth
their mature size the first growing season.  Fertilization occurs about
13 months after pollination, and cones reach full size during the second
summer.  Mature cones normally shed their seeds in September or October
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

Seed production and dissemination:  Trees as young as 8 years have borne
cone crops, although typically cone-bearing Jeffrey pines are 60 to 180
feet (18-55 m) tall and produce large seed crops every 2 to 8 years.
Seeds are typically strewn 7.2 ft/s (2.2 m/s) from the source when
carried by winds of 5 mi/h (8 km/h).  Heavy winds may disperse seeds up
to 2,460 feet (750 m) from a tree height of 164 feet (50 m).  Wildlife,
such as the Clark's nutcracker, also aids in seed dissemination.  Vander
Wall [<a href="#42">42</a>] found dissemination patterns of Jeffrey pine linked
extensively to animal hoarding of seeds in shallow surface caches.
Small mammals such as the golden-mantled ground squirrel and western
gray squirrel, in addition to mice and voles, harvest and store the
seeds [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].

Growth and yield:  In comparison, Jeffrey pine grows less rapidly than
ponderosa pine during the sapling stage but more rapidly in the pole
stage.  Jeffrey pine generally grows to the same age and size as
ponderosa pine.  Jeffrey pine lateral roots are strong and extensive.
On favorable sites, live roots up to 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter were
found approximately 100 feet (30 m) away from the source [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].
Generally, Jeffrey pine trees grown from seed collected east of the
Sierra Nevada are slower growing, more drought resistant, and less
susceptible to cold damage than Jeffrey pine trees grown from seed
collected elsewhere.  Also, trees from high elevations tend to be slower
growing than those from lower elevations [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Seedling development.  Seeds collected from various areas require
different periods of moist, cold stratification for rapid and complete
germination.  Most stored seeds germinate best after 60 days of
stratification.  Nursery stock seeds are sown in April and achieve a
plantable size in one growing season.  Planting begins at the onset of
spring conditions.  With adequate spring rain, field survival ranges
from 90 to 99 percent [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Jeffrey pine occupies many sites from the edges of moist high montane
meadows to arid slopes bordering deserts.  It generally occurs on the
drier or higher elevation sites on soils derived from pumic or granite.
Its northwest population is strongly correlated with edaphic factors,
while the northeast, central, and southern populations strongly reflect
climatic and elevational factors [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].

Climate:  Most populations east of the Sierra-Cascade crest are exposed
to January mean temperatures between 8 and 23 degrees F (-13 to -5 deg
C), while those in the west and south are between 19 and 36 degrees F
(-7 to 2 deg C).  Summer temperatures in July can be from 34 degrees F
(1 deg C) to 47 degrees F (8 deg C) throughout its distribution.
Precipitation falls mostly as snow.  Average snowfall typically ranges
from 12 inches (30 cm) or less at the lowest elevations in the Klamath
Mountains to well over 204 inches (520 cm) at high elevations in the
Sierra Nevada [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Soils and topography:  Twenty percent of the Jeffrey pine distribution
lies on ultramafic soils.  On the western slope of the northern Sierra
Nevada, and in the North Coast Range and Klamath Mountains, Jeffrey pine
often dominates and is almost entirely restricted to soils derived from
ultramafic rocks, peridotites, or serpentines.  Typical soils occupied
by Jeffrey pine are fine, fine-loamy, and clayey-textured skeletal
surface soils.  These soils are highly infertile and mostly shallow.
Jeffrey pine typically grows on granitic soils in the Sierra Nevada
[<a href="#21">21</a>].

Elevation:  In the northern Sierra Nevada, Jeffrey pine commonly occurs
at 5,000 to 6,000 feet (1,520-1,830 m), rising to 7,000 to 9,000 feet
(2,130-2,740 m) to the south [<a href="#3">3</a>].  In the Sierra San Pedro Martin, it
ranges from 6,000 to 10,000 feet (1,830-3,050 m) [<a href="#33">33</a>].  At high
elevations Jeffrey pine becomes deformed by strong winds [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Jeffrey pine is common in the Sierra Nevada, but it is confined to
scattered outcrops of peridotite and serpentine in the northern most
extent of its range in the Siskiyou Mountains, Oregon.  Jeffery pine is
climax on many of these sites but gradually loses its competitve ability
as moisture conditions in the soil and atmosphere become favorable for
other species [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Jeffrey pine is a strong invader species in Lassen
Volcanic National Park, California.  The elimination of competing
vegetation by volcanic activity facilitates the establishment of pine
seedlings [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  Factors relating to poor seed dispersal seem to be
the major limiting factor in the natural succession of Jeffrey pine
[<a href="#18">18</a>].

Jeffrey pine overlaps extensively with ponderosa pine and sugar pine
(Pinus lambertiana) on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada,
California.  In mixed stands on favorable growing sites, Jeffrey pine is
generally seral to more tolerant conifers such as Douglas-fir
(Pseudotsuga menziesii), white fir, incense cedar, and red fir (Abies
magnifica) [<a href="#46">46</a>].  In the Sierra Nevada, California, young Jeffrey pine
was found to have a high mortality rate due to an outbreak of Jeffrey
pine beetles (Dendroctonus jeffreyi).  This susceptibility allows for
successional replacement, while also creating important habitat for
wildlife [<a href="#35">35</a>].



<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Jeffrey pine seasonal development closely follows that of Pacific
ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. ponderosa).  Jeffrey pine flowers
from June to July; cone ripening and seed dipersal occur from September
to October.  See Pacific ponderosa pine write-up for further information
[<a href="#21">21</a>].

<pre><center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus jeffreyi
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Jeffrey pine shares many of the same ecological adaptations to fire as
Pacific ponderosa pine.  Pryor [<a href="#34">34</a>] classified Jeffrey pine as being
moderately resistant to fire.  It has a thick, corky bark that
withstands high temperatures and has a tall, erect bole free of lower
limbs.  The buds develop thick scales able to withstand considerable
amounts of heat [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Jeffrey pine seedlings have also adapted to
reproducing well on bare mineral soil.  Lightning is common in the
Sierra Nevada and strongly influences Jeffrey pine through wildfires
[<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Generally, Jeffrey pine is an early-seral species on burned
sites, eventually being replaced by more tolerant tree species.  A
postfire succession study from the Donner Ridge burn, Sierra Nevada,
California, found Jeffrey pine as an early colonizer eventually being
replaced by white fir [<a href="#6">6</a>].



<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>

</pre>

<pre><center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Pinus jeffreyi
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Jeffrey pine has adapted to withstand low-severity fires in wellspaced
stands.  Moderate- to high-severity fires will, however, kill trees pole
size and smaller.  Mature Jeffrey pines can survive most fires,
suffering only bole scorch.  These fire effects are intensified with
tree density and fuel load.  Depending on the season, Jeffrey pine may
experience extensive heat-kill of foliage, but may receive only light
damage to buds and twigs.  Wagener [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>] found that bud kill is more
important than foliage kill in determining survival of Jeffrey pine.
More than 50 percent of live buds are usually needed for a tree to
survive.  High-severity fires may also scorch bark and kill cambium
[<a href="#44">44</a>].

Fire-damaged Jeffrey pines are weakened physiologically, and for 2 or
more years are more susceptible to insect attacks than are undamaged
trees [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Insects have been found to reproduce and deposite eggs in
the scorched bark of Jeffrey pine within 24 hours after ignition.  Adult
pine beetles (Arhopalns asperatus) were found on the basal 3 feet (1 m)
of the most severely scorched tree [<a href="#45">45</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Jeffrey pine response to fire will vary according to fire severity, age,
and season.  High-severity fires that occur during periods of high
stress will generally result in death.  Low- to moderate-severity fires
will generally restrict the growth and regeneration of the tree, but
recovery is usually evident the following year [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Jeffrey pine has a
weak tendancy to put out vigorous epicormic shoots bearing juvenile
foliage on stem and branches [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Standing fire-killed Jeffrey pine
trees will not deteriorate appreciably until the third year after fire
[<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Primary fire management considerations involve postfire activities.
Jeffrey pine is very susceptible to insect damage, and the success of
silvicultural regeneration depends upon the proper management decisions.
Whenever possible, areas of complete kill should be logged first in
order to hinder subsequent insect attacks.  Smaller diameter trees are
more likely to be infested than larger ones.  Therefore, initial logging
should concentrate on smaller timber, thus maximizing the potential
salvage volume [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Expedient marking of live and dead Jeffrey pine
trees is necessary in order to better manage the stand for commercial
and silvicultural treatments [<a href="#44">44</a>].
