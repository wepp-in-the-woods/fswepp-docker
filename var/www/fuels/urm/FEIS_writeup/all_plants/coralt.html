<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Alternate-leaf dogwood is an understory dominant in the northeastern
United States and in the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) forest of the
Great Lakes region [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].

Common associates of alternate-leaf dogwood include chokecherry (Prunus
virginiana), American hazel (Corylus americana), hazelnut (C. cornuta),
mountain maple (Acer spicatum), striped maple (A. pennsylvanicum), black
cherry (Prunus serotina), serviceberry (Amelanchier canadensis),
mountain-laurel (Kalmia latifolia), huckleberries (Vaccinium spp), and
dogwoods (Cornus spp.) [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
At least 11 species of birds including ruffed grouse eat alternate-leaf
dogwood.  Black bear also eat the fruit.  The leaves and stems are eaten

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cornus alternifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Alternate-leaf dogwood is a large shrub or small tree that may reach 25
to 30 feet (7.5-9 m) in height [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  The trunk forks near the
ground into several branches that spread horizontally in layers.  The
bark is thin.  The alternate leaves occur mainly at the end of the
twigs.  The fruit is a drupe [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
The dogwood species reproduce by layering, sprouting from the root
crown, and by seed [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  The seed is dispersed by gravity and
animals.  Germination is delayed due to embryo dormancy [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Alternate-leaf dogwood is vegetatively propagated [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Alternate-leaf dogwood grows best on well-drained deep soils. It is
found in moist woodlands, along forest margins, on stream and swamp
borders, and near deep canyon bottoms [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Alternate-leaf dogwood is shade-tolerant [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  It is a dominant
understory species in mature forest in New England, and a
late-successsional understory shrub in the aspen (Populus spp.) and
sugar maple forests of Michigan [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  

Alternate-leaf dogwood also occurs in younger tree stands.  It was a
dominant shrub species in a 49-year-old aspen stand and an 18-year-old
aspen stand in northern Minnesota [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Alternate-leaf dogwood had a
density of 54 stems per hectare in a 20- to 30-year-old burn in North
Carolina [<a href="#36">36</a>].  Alternate-leaf dogwood occurs in both young (age <41
years) and old (age >40 years) oak (Quercus spp.) clearcuts in
southwestern Wisconsin [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Alternate-leaf dogwood flowers from May to July.  The fruit ripens from
July through September [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cornus alternifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fire survival and postfire regeneration strategies for alternate-leaf
dogwood are not well documented in the literature.  If the roots or
stems survive fire, it may reproduce vegetatively.  Alternate-leaf
dogwood may colonize fire disturbed sites with animal-dispersed seed
[<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tall shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Cornus alternifolia
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fires probably top-kills alternate-leaf dogwood.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
No specific information is available on fire response of alternate-leaf
digwood.  Since it sprouts from the root crown, it probably does so
after top-kill by fire.

Perala [<a href="#23">23</a>] reported that alternate-leaf dogwood was "encouraged" by
prescribed fire in an aspen-mixed hardwood forest in north-central
Minnesota, but no details were given.
