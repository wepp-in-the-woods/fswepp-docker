California white fir naturally hybridizes with grand fir (<i>Abies grandis</i>)
in a belt extending from north-west California, across Oregon, and into central
Idaho [<a href="#146">146</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>,<a href="#346">346</a>,<a href="#347">347</a>,<a href="#348">348</a>]. Under controlled conditions, white fir has successfully been crossed
with other firs. Fertile hybrids were produced with the following crosses [<a href="#277">277</a>,<a href="#282">282</a>]:

GENERAL DISTRIBUTION:</a>
</span>
<br />

White fir occurs from Oregon in the Blue Mountains and southern Cascade range,
south throughout California and into the San Pedro de
M&aacute;tir in northern Baja, California; west through parts of southern Idaho, to
Wyoming; and south throughout the Colorado Plateau and southern Rocky
Mountains in Utah and Colorado, and into the isolated mountain ranges of southern Arizona, New Mexico and northern Mexico [<a href="#145">145</a>,<a href="#309">309</a>].
<a href="https://climchange.cr.usgs.gov/data/atlas/little/abieconc.pdf">U.S. Geological Survey</a>
 provides a distributional map for white fir.<p>Rocky Mountain white fir occurs in the mountains of central
and southern Colorado to
southeast Idaho and eastern Nevada, south to southeastern California and southern
Arizona and New Mexico, with localized populations in northwest Mexico [<a href="#191">191</a>]. It is only sparingly distributed in the mountains of the eastern Mojave
Desert in California [<a href="#186">186</a>]. Rocky Mountain white fir is common on the
eastern rim of the Great Basin, with the central Great Basin forming a 200-mile gap between the two varieties of
white fir [<a href="#185">185</a>].</p>
<p>California white fir occurs primarily in the Sierra Nevada, Klamath and
Siskiyou mountains of California, and in western Nevada on the eastern slopes of
the Sierra [<a href="#102">102</a>]. Some report its distribution into the mountains of southwest Oregon south to
northern Baja [<a href="#191">191</a>], while others report that in the ranges of
southern California and northern Baja, white fir more closely resembles the
Rocky Mountain variety [<a href="#316">316</a>].</p>

<p>It is planted in rural and urban landscapes across the northern and
northeastern United States [<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#202">202</a>], and distribution maps
include it in Maine and Massachusetts [<a href="#309">309</a>].</p>

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">In higher elevations and mesic sites of the mixed conifer forests of California and
southern Oregon, California white fir is common and often dominant, sometimes comprising
80% or more of the large trees in a stand, and may form pure
stands [<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#244">244</a>,<a href="#262">262</a>]. It may also share dominance with incense-cedar (<i>Calocedrus
decurrens</i>), ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>), lodgepole pine (<i>P.
contorta</i>),
sugar pine (<i>P. lambertiana</i>), Jeffrey pine (<i>P. jeffreyi</i>),
Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>), California black oak (<i>Quercus kelloggii</i>), grand fir, Pacific
madrone (<i>Arbutus menziesii</i>), and tanoak (<i>Lithocarpus </i><i>densiflorus</i>)
[<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#244">244</a>]. Western juniper (<i>Juniperus occidentalis</i>)
may be found on shallow soil inclusions in white fir forests in California and
Oregon [<a href="#77">77</a>]. Herbaceous cover
tends to be sparse (seldom &gt;5%) in white fir forests, except on moist sites
where it may approach 100% [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#262">262</a>]. Understory species diversity is high. Rundel and others [<a href="#262">262</a>] list several important understory
species found in white fir forests.
Riparian communities in California white fir forests include white alder (<i>Alnus rhombifolia</i>),
thinleaf alder (<i>A. incana</i>  ssp. <i>tenuifolia</i>), bigleaf maple (<i>Acer macrophyllum</i>),
red-osier dogwood (<i>Cornus sericea </i>ssp.<i> sericea</i>), western azalea (<i>Rhododendron occidentale</i>),
Sierra currant (<i>Ribes
nevadense</i>), thimbleberry (<i>Rubus parviflorus</i>), Oregon ash (<i>Fraxinus latifolia</i>),
Pacific ninebark (<i>Physocarpus capitatus</i>), black cottonwood (<i>Populus
balsamifera</i>  ssp. <i>trichocarpa</i>), swamp carex (<i>Carex senta</i>), wild
rhubarb (<i>Darmera peltada</i>) and California spikenard (<i>Aralia californica</i>). White fir is also a secondary species in
the subalpine woodland represented by whitebark pine (<i>P. albicaulis</i>), limber
pine (<i>P. flexilis</i>), mountain hemlock (<i>Tsuga mertensiana</i>), lodgepole
pine, western
white pine (<i>P. monticola</i>) and foxtail pine (<i>P. balfouriana</i>) [<a href="#40">40</a>].
California white fir is
one of the coniferous dominants of the California hardwood forests consisting
primarily of tanoak, California black oak, giant chinquapin (<i>Chrysolepis
chrysophylla</i>), Pacific madrone, California bay (<i>Umbellularia californica</i>),
canyon live oak (<i>Q. </i><i>chrysolepis</i>), and red alder (<i>A. rubra</i>).
Its dominance in this type fades in the hardwood forests of the northern Sierra
and southern Cascades where it may occur with Pacific madrone, giant chinquapin, and Pacific yew (<i>Taxus brevifolia</i>)
[<a href="#126">126</a>,<a href="#206">206</a>].
<br><br>

The center of distribution of California white fir is the mixed-conifer forest of the Sierra Nevada
Mountains, where it may share or shift dominance with incense-cedar, ponderosa pine,
sugar pine, Jeffrey pine, and Douglas-fir. Subdominant trees may include California black oak,
Pacific dogwood (<i>C. nuttallii</i>), bigleaf maple, canyon live oak,
and tree forms of curlleaf mountain-mahogany (<i>Cercocarpus ledifolius</i>). The
shrub canopy is represented by the genera <i>Arctostaphylos</i>, <i>Ceanothus</i>,
<i>Chamaebatia</i>, <i>Chrysolepis</i>, <i>Lithocarpus</i>, <i>Prunus</i>, <i> Quercus</i>,
<i>Ribes</i>, <i>Symphoricarpos</i>, and <i>Vaccinium</i>.
Common genera in the herb layer include <i>Adenocaulon</i>, <i>Clintonia</i>, <i>Disporum</i>,
<i>Galium</i>, <i>Iris</i>, <i>Lupinus</i>, <i>Osmorhiza</i>, <i>Pteridium</i>, <i>Pyrola</i>,
<i>Maianthemum</i>, and <i> Viola</i>
 [<a href="#40">40</a>]. California white fir stands are common on mesic
sites at upper elevations in the Sierra, in what may be called the white fir
zone [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#262">262</a>]. Near its upper elevational limits and on the
eastern slope of the Sierra, California white fir shares
its climax status with California red fir (<i>A. magnifica</i>)
in extensive pure fir forests [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#262">262</a>]. Here ponderosa pine and incense-cedar are less common
and may be absent [<a href="#40">40</a>]. Where California white fir occurs on the lower-west-side of the
Sierra, ponderosa pine usually dominates, and associates
include incense-cedar, sugar
pine, and Douglas-fir. California white fir is less
common on these xeric sites, although its density has increased since the
turn of the century, especially in the smaller size classes in the understory [<a href="#262">262</a>]. White fir is a major component of giant sequoia (<i>Sequoiadendron
giganteum</i>) groves along the west slope of the central Sierra Nevada, where
California hazelnut (<i>Corylus cornuta</i> var. <i> californica</i>) and
Pacific dogwood may also be found [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#262">262</a>,<a href="#330">330</a>]. California white fir is an
important component in Jeffrey pine communities on
the east slope of the Sierra, where associates include incense-cedar,
California black oak, black cottonwood, greenleaf manzanita (<i>Arctostaphylos
patula</i>), Sierra mountain misery (<i>Chamaebatia foliolosa</i>), bigleaf maple,
California black oak, canyon live oak, and ceanothus [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#262">262</a>]. The most significant understory component
in many of these forests may be the dense thickets of
white fir and incense-cedar saplings with common coverages of 5-10% and 30% or
more not being unusual [<a href="#262">262</a>]. California white fir occurs with varying degrees of dominance on
drier sites in the northern Sierra, with sugar pine, Jeffrey pine, ponderosa pine,
California black oak, incense-cedar, western juniper, singleleaf pinyon (<i>P. monophylla</i>), big
sagebrush (<i>Artemisia
tridentata</i>), ceanothus, greenleaf manzanita, antelope
bitterbrush (<i>Purshia tridentata</i>), Utah snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos
oreophilus</i> var. <i>utahensis</i>), chokecherry (<i>Prunus virginiana</i>), and rabbitbush (<i>Ericameria bloomeri</i>)
as possible associates [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#262">262</a>,<a href="#316">316</a>]. More detailed descriptions of the
Sierran montane and subalpine conifer forests can also be found in Pase
[<a href="#241">241</a>,<a href="#242">242</a>].

</p>
<p class="subframeContent"> In the Cascade Range, the white fir zone occurs at elevations above 4,900
feet (1500 m) where white fir is clearly dominant in nearly pure stands with Douglas-fir, sugar pine, ponderosa pine,
western white pine, and lodgepole pine as associates [<a href="#111">111</a>]. Atzet and McCrimmon
[<a href="#29">29</a>] recognize 18 white fir associations in the
Cascades with the
following codominant species: lodgepole pine,
western serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier alnifolia</i>), mountain hemlock, Pacific rhododendron (<i>R.</i> <i>macrophyllum</i>), twinflower (<i>Linnaea borealis</i>),
California red fir, prince's pine (<i>Chimaphila umbellata</i>), Pacific silver
fir (<i>A. amabilis</i>) [<a href="#140">140</a>], Oregon-grape (<i>Mahonia repens</i>), vine maple (<i>A. circinatum</i>), western
hemlock (<i>T. heterophylla</i>), vanillaleaf (<i>Achlys triphylla</i>), big
huckleberry (<i>Vaccinium</i> <i>membranaceum</i>), salal (<i>Gaultheria shallon</i>),
Rocky Mountain maple (<i>A. glabrum</i>), anemone (<i>Anemone </i>spp.), California hazelnut, poison
oak (<i>Toxicodendron</i>  <i>diversilobum</i>), and incense-cedar. The white fir zone in the
Cascades grades into
red fir forest at upper elevations, where white fir remains an important component along with western
white pine, lodgepole pine, mountain hemlock and currant [<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#220">220</a>]. On the western slopes of the
Cascades, white fir is found at mid-elevations and on mesic
sites above the ponderosa pine forests in
mixed conifer stands in mixed dominance with sugar pine, ponderosa pine, incense-cedar, Douglas-fir and California black oak. Here it may also be associated with
western hemlock, Pacific dogwood, Pacific yew, pacific madrone, vine maple,
twinflower, and shrubs such as snowbrush ceanothus (<i>C. velutinus</i>), giant chinquapin, bush
chinquapin (<i>C. sempervirens</i>), bitter cherry (<i>P. emarginata</i>),
sharpleaf snowberry (<i>S. acutus</i>), baldhip rose (<i>Rosa gymnocarpa</i>),
Sierran gooseberry (<i>Ribes roezlii</i>), snow raspberry (<i>Rubus nivalis</i>),
common whipplea (<i>Whipplea modesta</i>), and pinemat manzanita (<i>A. nevadensis</i>) [<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#208">208</a>,<a href="#220">220</a>,<a href="#262">262</a>]. It is found less commonly on the east side of the Cascade Range
[<a href="#262">262</a>]. In the
Silver Lake area of southern Oregon, white fir occurs in association with
ponderosa pine and Idaho fescue (<i>Festuca idahoensis</i>), along with antelope
bitterbrush, greenleaf manzanita and Oregon-grape [<a href="#75">75</a>].
</p>
<p class="subframeContent"> The Klamath Mountains in northwestern California and
southwestern Oregon have the greatest concentration of
conifer species on earth, with white fir among them [<a href="#300">300</a>].
Here white fir is considered an indicator of the lower elevational limit of montane
forest vegetation, which blends into Douglas-fir-hardwood forests below on the west
side and into ponderosa pine-California black oak on the east side. On the west side
white fir occurs primarily with Douglas-fir as a
codominant, and on the east side with <i> Pinus</i> spp. and California red fir. Westside associates also include sugar pine,
ponderosa pine, incense-cedar, Port-Orford-cedar (<i>Chamaecyparis lawsoniana</i>),
Pacific yew, giant chinquapin, prince's pine, bigleaf maple, canyon live oak, Pacific
madrone, Pacific trillium (<i>Trillium ovatum</i>), and American
vetch (<i>Vicia americana</i>). Eastside associates include Douglas-fir, incense-cedar, sugar pine,
ponderosa pine,
Pacific dogwood, canyon live oak, California black oak, bigleaf maple, Pacific yew,
giant chinquapin, Mahala mat (<i>Ceanothus
prostratus</i>), and dwarf Oregon-grape (<i>Berberis nervosa</i>), with an understory of mainly
sclerophyllous shrubs in dense patches, or of nonsclerophylls such as baldhip rose,
and creeping snowberry (<i>S. mollis</i>). Herbs are uncommon except for
prince's pine, and bracken fern (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>). At higher elevations, white fir grades into red fir with which
it shares dominance on some sites. At still higher elevations, white fir may be
found with western hemlock, western white pine, and lodgepole pine [<a href="#268">268</a>]. The white fir series in the
Siskiyou Mountains of southern Oregon and northern California is divided into
several associations with codominants including: California red fir, currant, baldhip rose, creeping snowberry, prince's pine, sandler oak,
Oregon boxwood (<i>Paxistima myrsinites</i>), dwarf Oregon-grape, giant chinquapin, Alaska-cedar
(<i>C. nootkatensis</i>),
brewer spruce (<i>Picea breweriana</i>), big huckleberry, salal, tanoak, Pacific yew,
Port-Orford-cedar, Douglas-fir, Rocky Mountain maple, oceanspray
(<i>Holodiscus discolor</i>),
ponderosa pine,
western hemlock, vine maple and Jeffrey pine [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#136">136</a>,<a href="#305">305</a>]. Mixed conifer associates in the Siskiyou Mountains include
Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, sugar pine, incense-cedar, western hemlock, vine
maple, Pacific yew, twinflower, snow raspberry, common whipplea,
and pinemat manzanita [<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#220">220</a>]. Some characteristic understory species of white fir forests in
the Siskiyou Mountains are given by Franklin and Dyrness [<a href="#111">111</a>].
</p>
<p class="subframeContent"> In the South Warner Mountains of
northeastern California, the white fir series occurs in three habitat types and
is codominant with tailcup lupine (<i>Lupinus caudatus</i>), sweet cicely (<i>Osmorhiza</i>
 <i>claytonii</i>), and whiteveined wintergreen (<i>Pyrola picta</i>) [<a href="#257">257</a>]. White fir is important in closed forest stands on the
Modoc Plateau in association with incense-cedar, ponderosa pine, quaking aspen,
and western juniper [<a href="#262">262</a>,<a href="#316">316</a>]. In northeastern California, white fir is increasingly influenced
by grand
fir [<a href="#124">124</a>]. In southeastern Oregon, white fir occurs in the
ponderosa pine forest zone with grand fir, western larch (<i>Larix occidentalis</i>),
Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, western white pine, mountain-mahogany, common snowberry (<i>S. albus</i>), mountain snowberry (<i>S.
oreophilus</i>), antelope bitterbrush, mountain big sagebrush
(<i>A. tridentata</i> ssp. <i>vaseyana</i>),
elk sedge (<i>C. geyeri</i>), Idaho fescue, pinegrass (<i>Calamagrostis
rubescens</i>), Wheeler bluegrass (<i>Poa nervosa</i>), and bluebunch wheatgrass (<i>Pseudoroegneria
spicata</i>). In the true fir forest zone of southeastern Oregon, white fir
occurs with grand fir, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, western larch, Douglas-fir, western white pine,
Pacific yew,
thimbleberry, twinflower, big
huckleberry, grouse whortleberry (<i>V. scoparium</i>), western oakfern (<i>Gymnocarpium
dryopteris</i>), oneleaf foamflower (<i>Tiarella trifoliata</i> var. <i>unifoliata</i>),
and drops of gold (<i>Disporum hookeri</i>) [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#130">130</a>]. Further
north, white fir grades into the grand fir zone, with the two species
hybridizing where they intergrade [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>].
In this zone of genetic overlap, it is impossible to visually tell the two species and
their hybrids apart [<a href="#103">103</a>].

</p>
<p class="subframeContent">In the mountain ranges of southern California,
dominance shifts from ponderosa to Jeffrey pine to white fir with increasing
elevation. White
fir is also a major component of the subalpine forest type in this area.
California black oak stands, montane meadows and chaparral are interspersed
throughout the area where white fir is dominant, and sugar pine, incense-cedar,
and western juniper are secondary components in many stands [<a href="#287">287</a>].
In the San Bernardino Mountains
white fir is codominant with ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pine or with
sugar pine on north aspects, with incense-cedar and California black oak as common associates and a
wealth of herbaceous species mixed with a considerable understory of shrubs. It
may also be codominant with sugar pine in more open stands, with Jeffrey pine, canyon live oak
and some timberland chaparral species as understory, and no herbaceous species
present [<a href="#151">151</a>,<a href="#217">217</a>]. In the Transverse and Peninsular ranges
of southern California, white fir occurs at upper elevations and mesic slopes
with ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pine, sugar pine, and incense-cedar. Here white fir and
sugar pine form a community on moister slopes with incense-cedar, lodgepole pine,
Sierra currant, Sierran gooseberry,
thimbleberry, Sitka willow (<i>Salix</i> <i>sitchensis</i>),
and blue elderberry (<i>Sambucus cerulea</i>). It may also be found with bigcone Douglas-fir
(<i>P. macrocarpa</i>) in this area [<a href="#204">204</a>]. Scattered and gnarled specimens of white fir may also be found in the
western juniper woodland, lodgepole pine, or limber pine forest [<a href="#306">306</a>]. In the Clark and Kingson mountains of the Mojave Desert,
and other southern California populations as far north as the Tehachapi
Mountains, white fir more closely resembles the Rocky Mountain variety, and is
found with singleleaf pinyon, Colorado pinyon (<i>P. edulis</i>), Utah juniper
(<i>J.
osteosperma</i>), Rocky Mountain maple, Utah serviceberry (<i>A. utahensis</i>),
singleleaf ash (<i>Fraxinus
anomala</i>), bush oceanspray (<i>H. dumosus</i>), canyon live oak,
shrub live oak (<i>Q. turbinella</i>), wax currant (<i>R. cereum</i>), desert
gooseberry (<i>R. velutinum</i>), and common elderberry (<i>S.</i> <i>nigra</i>
 ssp. <i>canadensis)</i>  [<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#316">316</a>]. In the Sierra San Pedro M&aacute;rtir, white fir and incense-cedar
are restricted
to the most mesic sites in an open forest dominated by Parry pinyon (<i>P.
quadrifolia</i>) and Jeffrey pine from 4,600 to 7,900 feet (1400-2400 m) [<a href="#40">40</a>].

</p>
<p class="subframeContent">Rocky Mountain white fir is found in nearly all the major mountain ranges
in the southwest [<a href="#84">84</a>,<a href="#188">188</a>]. The white fir series in the southwest can have any mixture of white
fir with Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce (<i>P. engelmannii</i>), blue spruce (<i>P.
pungens</i>), subalpine fir (<i>A. lasiocarpa</i>), ponderosa
pine, and southwestern white pine (<i>Pinus strobiformis</i>), depending on the moisture and temperature relationships
of the site, and the stage of succession. The more successful reproduction of
white fir is diagnostic of the white fir series [<a href="#188">188</a>,<a href="#232">232</a>]. White fir grades into blue spruce at
cooler moister sites at the same elevation, into the subalpine fir series (Engelmann
spruce and corkbark fir (<i>A. lasiocarpa</i> var. <i>arizonica</i>)) at higher elevations, and Douglas-fir or ponderosa pine
at lower elevations with complex ecotones [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#188">188</a>]. At its northern limit in the Rocky Mountains, white fir is
replaced by Douglas-fir as the indicated climax on montane forest sites [<a href="#201">201</a>]. Rocky Mountain white fir is a dominant or climax component of
several habitat types and series in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado.

<p class="subframeContent">In Utah, the white fir series occurs throughout the
higher mountain ranges of the northwestern region, is found locally in the Uinta Mountains, and increases in importance through
southern Utah. On
exposed, lower elevation sites white fir occurs either as scattered individuals
or groups with quaking aspen (<i>Populus tremuloides</i>) and Douglas-fir as dominant seral associates, and abundant brush or woodland
species, such as bigtooth maple and Gambel oak in the interspaces. Western serviceberry,
paxistima, and chokecherry are common associates [<a href="#201">201</a>].
Undisturbed
forest sites in the subalpine zone of Utah are dominated by Engelmann spruce,
blue spruce, subalpine fir and white fir with a diverse herbaceous component.
These subalpine forests
are intermixed with meadows, stringers of limber and bristlecone pines, and open woodlands of
aspen or lodgepole pine in areas that have been disturbed by
fire in recent times [<a href="#38">38</a>]. White fir is a seral species in the
subalpine fir series and occurs as scattered individuals in the Douglas-fir series
and limber and ponderosa pine habitat types [<a href="#201">201</a>,<a href="#344">344</a>]. Where Rocky mountain white fir is codominant with quaking aspen,
associates include mountain snowberry, Kentucky bluegrass (<i>Poa pratensis</i>), and
greenleaf manzanita [<a href="#230">230</a>]. <i> Carex</i> spp. are common understory
components in some white fir habitat types in Utah [<a href="#201">201</a>,<a href="#230">230</a>].
</p>
<p class="subframeContent">The white fir series is the most widespread mixed
conifer series in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. Here it is
often co-climax with Douglas fir. Other tree associates include blue spruce,
limber pine, ponderosa pine, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, quaking aspen,
and Rocky Mountain juniper. It is also found in several subalpine fir community
types, and blue spruce, Douglas fir, and limber pine habitat types [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>].
</p>
<p class="subframeContent">The white fir-Douglas-fir-Ponderosa pine series is the most
widespread and one of the most varied types in Arizona and New Mexico [<a href="#82">82</a>]. In New Mexico mixed conifer forest, white fir shares climax
status with Douglas fir, and the white fir/Gambel oak habitat type is the most
widespread [<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>,<a href="#223">223</a>]. White fir types grade into Engelmann spruce, blue spruce, and subalpine fir types
at higher elevations with mixtures of corkbark fir, Douglas-fir,
southwestern white pine, and quaking aspen. At lower
elevations, white fir types grade into Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine types [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#225">225</a>,<a href="#294">294</a>]. Additional tree associates include
Chihuahua pine (<i>P. leiophylla </i>var.<i> chihuahuana</i>), Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (<i>P.

 spp.) with a high understory cover of Arizona fescue [<a href="#82">82</a>].

</p>
<p class="subframeContent"> 
In the Madrean region, on mesic slopes,
Douglas-fir is often codominant with or is successional to white fir [<a href="#225">225</a>,<a href="#245">245</a>]. These two species join with spruce and southwestern white pine on
cool
sites and with ponderosa pine on warm sites. At higher elevations and northern
aspects Douglas-fir is replaced by Engelmann spruce and corkbark fir with southwestern white pine in low densities,
and occasional stands of quaking aspen [<a href="#349">349</a>]. In the Animas Mountains of southern New Mexico and
the Sierra Los Ajos in Sonora, Mexico, white fir is found at upper elevations
and on north aspects in association with Douglas-fir, quaking aspen, Gambel
oak, silverleaf oak (<i>Q. hypoleucoides</i>) and madro&ntilde;o (<i>Arbutus arizonica</i>)
[<a href="#321">321</a>]. A more detailed description of Rocky Mountain and Madrean montane conifer forests

Historically white fir was considered undesirable for timber. Now that the availability of
premium timber species has declined, white fir is being recognized as a highly
productive and valuable tree species and is widely used in the wood products
industry [<a href="#109">109</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>]. White fir is a general,
all-purpose, construction-grade wood used extensively for solid construction
framing and plywood, and to a lesser extent, for pulpwood [<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#277">277</a>]. It is also used for poles and pilings because of its straight grain
and low taper, but requires large amounts of preservatives because the heartwood
decays rapidly. It is poorly suited for
firewood because of its low specific gravity and heat production (80% as much
heat by volume as Douglas-fir produces), but it is used for firewood anyway [<a href="#277">277</a>].

Stands dominated by white fir seldom produce enough forage for domestic
livestock grazing except on harvested or open forest sites, or where grasses and sedges dominate
the understory [<a href="#81">81</a>].
These forests do, however, provide abundant browse and cover for large and small
wildlife species [<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#294">294</a>].
Deer, elk, and bear often use white fir habitats as either summer or winter
range [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>]. Mule and black-tailed deer
generally eat small amounts of white fir during the spring, fall, and winter,
and sometimes larger amounts during the summer [<a href="#152">152</a>,<a href="#177">177</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>]. Mule deer are especially fond of succulent, new white fir growth
in the spring [<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>]. Spring
browsing of white fir by deer can be particularly heavy when small white firs
are the only green food available; all of the current or previous year's
growth may be consumed [<a href="#119">119</a>]. Porcupines enjoy the bark of white fir, and may destroy
saplings in their enthusiasm [<a href="#138">138</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#201">201</a>]. Rodents feed on the cambial tissue of white fir in
preference to that of Douglas-fir. During the winter, mice feed on the leaders
of small white firs near snow level. In the spring, they feed on
seedlings, sometimes destroying a large proportion of the current year's
seedlings [<a href="#138">138</a>,<a href="#201">201</a>]. Pocket gophers also feed on white fir seedlings in the winter and spring
[<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>]. White fir needles are an important part of
the diet of blue grouse [<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#197">197</a>]. White
fir seeds are eaten by several species of small mammals and birds including
grouse [<a href="#183">183</a>,<a href="#322">322</a>], chipmunks and mice [<a href="#323">323</a>], flying squirrels [<a href="#345">345</a>], chickadees, crossbills, and Clark's
nutcracker
[<a href="#127">127</a>,<a href="#197">197</a>]. In the southern Cascades and Sierra Nevada, the Douglas squirrel
cuts and caches white fir cones during late summer and fall, before the cones
are fully mature [<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>]. Hollow logs and snags of white fir can be important to various birds and animals for foraging in the
interior wood [<a href="#240">240</a>].
<br><br>
There are about 33 species of mammals
commonly present in the white fir forest type in California, and of these 7 are generally associated with
mature forests [<a href="#178">178</a>]. Hollowed-out trunks of old
white fir trees, dead or alive, are
denning sites for mammals ranging form weasels to porcupines to black bears
[<a href="#186">186</a>]. In one study, abundance of white fir had a strong positive association with
California mountain beaver
habitat use [<a href="#42">42</a>]. About 123
species of birds are found in the white fir type of California and southern
Oregon, about 50 of which are associated primarily with mature forests, and many
of which use mature white fir trees and snags for foraging, roosting, nesting
and/or breeding [<a href="#155">155</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#212">212</a>,<a href="#228">228</a>,<a href="#317">317</a>]. These
include bald eagles [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#292">292</a>],
northern spotted owls [<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#182">182</a>,<a href="#303">303</a>], California
spotted owls [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#318">318</a>,<a href="#319">319</a>], flammulated owls [<a href="#320">320</a>], brown creepers and
red-breasted nuthatches [<a href="#1">1</a>]. In Oregon, mature white fir
forests provide nesting and feeding habitat for important bird species, such
as the goshawk, pileated woodpecker, white-headed woodpecker, and, when near lakes or streams,
osprey and bald eagle [<a href="#149">149</a>].
Reptiles in white fir forests are represented by 17 species, mostly at lower elevations,
8 of which are associated with mature forests [<a href="#178">178</a>].
<p class="subframeContent">In
the southwest, desert bighorn sheep and white-tailed deer occasionally browse white fir
[<a href="#183">183</a>,<a href="#276">276</a>]. In the Rocky Mountains, red squirrels cache white fir cones during late summer and fall before the cones
are fully mature [<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>]. Some
white fir habitat types in the Southwest and Utah provide habitat for black bears
and cougars and have high cover value for wildlife [<a href="#190">190</a>,<a href="#294">294</a>]. In riparian woodlands in the
Southwest,
white fir is often a codominant species with hardwoods such as maples. These
woodlands tend to be small in area, but provide unique and critical habitat for many species
of wildlife such as the Arizona gray squirrel, river otter, zone-tailed hawk, common black
hawk, American dipper, summer tanager, bullock oriole, yellow warbler, Arizona
alligator lizard, Sonoran mud turtle, and canyon tree frog [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#294">294</a>]. At the southern end
of its range in the Madrean region, white fir occurs in &quot;island&quot;
habitats at the uppermost elevations of isolated mountain ranges, providing
small areas of geographically unique habitat for wildlife. An example are the wildlife species
present in the Rincon Mountains of Saguaro National
Monument, Arizona, presented by Davis and Sidner [<a href="#73">73</a>]. The highly variable stand
structure with multi-storied shrub layers in some southwestern white fir habitat
types provides increased microhabitat diversity for birds [<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#294">294</a>].
White fir forests in the Southwest provide habitat for Mexican
spotted owls in Arizona, New Mexico [<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#194">194</a>], and Utah [<a href="#341">341</a>]; goshawks in Arizona
[<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#196">196</a>,<a href="#255">255</a>].
Thick-billed parrots, reintroduced in the mountains of
southeastern Arizona, occur in mixed-conifer forests with white fir [<a href="#279">279</a>]. Several
species of amphibians and reptiles may be found in white fir montane mixed
conifer forests such as that at upper elevations in Saguaro National Monument
[<a href="#193">193</a>].
Two
species of endangered salamanders (Jemez Mountains salamander and Sacramento Mountain
salamander) in New Mexico are found in mixed conifer forests dominated by white
fir [<a href="#250">250</a>].

Because they contain resins, terpenes, and other substances that make the
foliage irritating to the digestive tract, most conifers are not particularly
palatable to grazing animals. White
fir may be slightly palatable to goats [<a href="#266">266</a>].
Immature foliage is enjoyed by mule and black-tailed deer [<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#189">189</a>]. White fir seeds are palatable to numerous species of small
rodents, although seeds of Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and sugar pine are
preferred [<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#249">249</a>].

White fir's evergreen foliage provides good hiding cover year-round and is
usually continuous from the ground upward on trees less than 8 to 10 inches
(20-25 cm) dbh [<a href="#148">148</a>]. White fir stands of this nature provide excellent hiding cover for large wildlife species such as deer, elk, and
black bear [<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#187">187</a>]. If enough shrubs
are present in the understory to provide adequate hiding cover, mature white fir
forests are used by deer during fawning and by elk during calving [<a href="#149">149</a>,<a href="#174">174</a>].
<br><br>
In mixed conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada,
cavity-nesting birds prefer white fir snags over the snags of associated trees. Cavity nesters using white fir snags include the American
kestrel, mountain chickadee, brown creeper, mountain bluebird, house wren, tree
swallow, northern flicker, and several nuthatch, sapsucker and woodpecker
species [<a href="#251">251</a>]. Other forest songbirds nest within
white fir foliage. Hollowed trunks of older trees are used by several species of
mammals such as black bears,
for hibernation; American martens, for dens and rest sites; and bushy-tailed
woodrats, flying squirrels and other small mammals for cover [<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#240">240</a>]. Most bear dens in Yosemite National Park are found in the
hollowed trunks of white fir [<a href="#202">202</a>].

White fir can be planted on disturbed sites within forest vegetation types where
it naturally occurs. It is a good
soil stabilizer and may be particularly useful on roadcuts [<a href="#248">248</a>]. Fir seedlings exhibit very slow initial growth, and are therefore
usually outplanted as 2- to 3-year-old seedlings or 3- to 4-year-old transplants
[<a href="#108">108</a>]. Transplanting nursery stock is more successful than direct seeding [<a href="#248">248</a>]. White fir can be propagated from stem cuttings, which root easily
when treated with a rooting medium [<a href="#88">88</a>]. Because this wide-ranging tree exhibits a large degree of genetic variation, seed or planting stock for
rehabilitation projects is best provided by a local source [<a href="#214">214</a>,<a href="#248">248</a>]. Methods for collecting, processing, testing, storing,
and planting white fir seeds have been discussed in detail [<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>].

White fir is a valuable ornamental tree. It is often used for ornamental plantings in
rural and urban landscapes in northern U.S.
cities, because it is attractive and frost-hardy [<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#202">202</a>]. White
fir is not, however, very tolerant of air
pollution and therefore seems best suited for suburbs or rural areas [<a href="#175">175</a>]. White fir eventually attains great size and is best grown in parks or
other open public areas. White fir is used extensively in the Christmas tree
industry [<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>]. Native Americans used the needles for tea [<a href="#149">149</a>].

<a name="OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Ecosystem management: Changes in white fir ecosystems are evident and well
documented and are
attributed to many human activities and their interactions on the landscape (for example, see [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#209">209</a>,<a href="#234">234</a>]).
Some management objectives call for some form of &quot;ecological restoration&quot;,
or the &quot;restoration of natural conditions&quot;, or the reversal of recent, human-caused ecological degradation,
based on reference conditions. These reference conditions can occur over a range of temporal and spatial
scales, and are determined by detailed study of historical and ecological data, including fire history, of a particular
site or ecosystem [<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#161">161</a>,<a href="#227">227</a>,<a href="#289">289</a>]. Once these historical reference
conditions are estimated, they may be used to delineate management objectives based on
conditions that are within a range of historical variability for a particular site,
and the tools necessary to achieve them [<a href="#123">123</a>].
 

<br><br>
For example, decades of research
in giant sequoia groves of the Sierra Nevada [e.g.
<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>,<a href="#261">261</a>,<a href="#285">285</a>,<a href="#291">291</a>,<a href="#293">293</a>,<a href="#295">295</a>] make it one of the better understood ecosystems, and reference conditions
are available for
these forests [<a href="#285">285</a>,<a href="#289">289</a>]. Still, there are limitations here that may also be
faced by scientists and land managers in other forest ecosystems [<a href="#289">289</a>]. Researchers have found it easier to determine past fire
regimes than to determine past grove structures. Surface fires had 2 to 3-year mean
fire return
intervals at Sequoia National Park for more than 1300 years before the era of
fire suppression [<a href="#172">172</a>,<a href="#295">295</a>]. Most
giant sequoia groves are now overwhelmingly dominated by white fir which could
not have survived in such numbers under such a fire regime [<a href="#288">288</a>]. This increased density of white fir in giant sequoia groves may have
implications for changes in the natural fire regime from surface fires to crown
fires. It may also have implications for damage by insects and diseases,
such as
annosus root rot, that may also affect giant sequoia [<a href="#247">247</a>]. Using silvicultural techniques to restore prehistoric structure alone
may not restore healthy ecosystem function, but it is possible that restoration of
fire may restore the former structure of sequoia groves [<a href="#288">288</a>,<a href="#289">289</a>].
For example, giant sequoia seedlings numbered between 7,514 and 40,130 per acre
(18,560 and 99,120 per ha) after prescribed burning at Redwood Mountain [<a href="#170">170</a>].
Conversely, where group selection harvest with
different slash treatments was applied in giant sequoia stands in an
attempt to simulate the structural complexity of the prehistoric, patchy, high
intensity fire regime that once existed there, regeneration in the small openings was dominated by
white fir instead of giant sequoia. Giant sequoia seedling density ranged from 0
to 57seedlings/acre (0-141.5 seedlings/ha). Important ecosystem
processes, such as increased seed dispersal in giant sequoia following
patchy, high intensity fire and large scale nutrient cycling, are not
duplicated by harvest alone [<a href="#284">284</a>]. It may be
necessary to use a combination of treatments.
 

<br><br>
In areas shifting from fire-climax ponderosa pine to
fire-intolerant white fir, the ecologically appropriate treatment may be to
thin white fir stems from below and follow with
prescribed fire, monitoring the effects of the treatment and fine-tuning as needed. It is important that such activities avoid the
following: 1) excessive opening of overstory canopies; 2) road building and damage to soils;
3) thinning in mid- to high elevation and moist forests where dense understories
and long fire intervals are more characteristic; and 4) large-scale
conversion of closed-canopy forests to open-canopy, even-aged stands since this
would adversely affect many wildlife species such as the northern spotted owl and
lynx who depend on closed canopy and dense forests, respectively [<a href="#79">79</a>]. Leaving
some mid and late successional stands would allow for a diversity of stand ages, structures, characteristics on the
landscape. Definitions and characteristics
of different stages of forests in which white fir is a component are available
[<a href="#280">280</a>,<a href="#281">281</a>].
 
<br><br>
Wildlife: Managing white fir forests for
wildlife habitat involves complex interactions of several plant and wildlife
species, and consideration of stages of forest development that are important to
the species of interest. Relationships of habitat for Rocky Mountain elk and Rocky Mountain mule
deer to timber management and stand characteristics in white fir forests in
Oregon have been explored [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>]. White fir habitat is not used heavily by
Columbian black-tailed
deer who seem to prefer the mixed conifer, montane hardwood and annual grassland
habitats on the west slope of California's coast range, suggesting that the
exclusion of fire and subsequent changes in these forests may have adversely affected
habitat for these deer [<a href="#192">192</a>]. Bird species diversity was found to be higher in the early
postfire and mature forest successional stages in the Sierra Nevada, and
lowest in the brush-dominated phase of succession [<a href="#51">51</a>]. Hollow logs and snags can be important to various
birds and animals for nesting, foraging, denning and roosting sites [<a href="#240">240</a>].
Therefore, leaving snags and logs might be an important consideration in a
management prescription. Leaving &quot;high-cut
stumps&quot; was evaluated as a possible method for simulating snags for wildlife habitat
[<a href="#228">228</a>].
White fir forests are home to several
sensitive, threatened and endangered species.
Two
species of endangered salamanders (Jemez Mountains salamander and Sacramento Mountain
salamander) in New Mexico are found in mixed conifer forests dominated by white
fir and are vulnerable to some forest management practices [<a href="#250">250</a>]. Management
recommendations for wildlife habitat are given for wildlife in general [<a href="#60">60</a>], nongame birds
[<a href="#275">275</a>], the northern goshawk and its
prey species in the southwest [<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#255">255</a>], for the California spotted
owl [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>,<a href="#318">318</a>,<a href="#319">319</a>], Mexican spotted owl [<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#311">311</a>], and bald
eagle [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>]. Forest practices that emphasize the retention of
mature trees and coarse woody debris also promote the abundance and diversity of
truffles, which are integral an functionally important members of forest
ecosystems [<a href="#23">23</a>].

<br><br>
Timber harvest and regeneration treatments: White fir can be regenerated naturally or
artificially. Advanced regeneration of white fir greater than 4.5 ft (1.4 m) at the
time of
release tended to grow taller than projected growth of planted seedlings of
Douglas-fir on similar sites in southwest Oregon [<a href="#173">173</a>].
Most
white fir stands have been managed for timber production using even-aged
management techniques [<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#180">180</a>,<a href="#181">181</a>]. Even-aged management by
seed tree method is described by Aune [<a href="#32">32</a>] with guidelines for selecting
appropriate individuals to leave as seed trees in white fir. Clearcutting and shelterwood cutting have been successful at
promoting regeneration of white fir, as long as the maximum downwind width of openings does
not exceed 1.5 to 2 times the height of trees left as seed sources [<a href="#178">178</a>]. Shelterwood methods generally result in the best regeneration of
white fir [<a href="#201">201</a>,<a href="#260">260</a>], although heavy overstory removal in some areas may favor Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, or
hardwoods over white fir. With less overstory removal, such
as by light shelterwood cutting or selection cutting, regeneration of shade-tolerant white fir
will be favored. Any kind of partial cutting where white fir is present will favor white fir and
increase its importance in the stand [<a href="#178">178</a>].
Partial harvesting of an old-growth interior ponderosa pine stand in
northeastern
California resulted in increased growth rate of white fir.
However, mortality
exceeded recruitment into the largest size classes presumably due to competition
with the tremendous number of smaller stems stressing the older trees. The
dramatic increase in the smaller diameter classes is most likely a response to
partial cutting without burning [<a href="#87">87</a>]. Group selection and patch clearcutting
resulted in good regeneration in an Arizona mixed conifer forest [<a href="#94">94</a>]. The group selection
method is discussed by Laacke [<a href="#179">179</a>] with reference to white fir. Response of white fir to different timber harvest treatments
are given by Vora [<a href="#326">326</a>], and show an increase in white fir numbers with no
treatment as well as with heavy overstory removal in northeastern California after 40
years. These unexpected results impress the variability of ecosystem response
and suggest site specific management plans.
<br><br>
Uneven-aged management, such as the single-tree selection method [<a href="#132">132</a>], may produce stands that most
closely resemble reference conditions. However, uneven-aged
management of white fir, requiring repeated selective harvests (multiple entry),
has not been recommended in the past because it promotes
several pest problems, such as decay fungi and insects, which take advantage of
wounded trees and freshly cut stumps, especially in the Pacific Northwest [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#238">238</a>].
Thinning operations also favor these pests because 20 to 50% of the
residual trees may be wounded [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>]. Suggestions for reducing
injuries during stand management activities are given by Aho and others [<a href="#10">10</a>].
Immediate removal of stumps may be effective in preventing the spread of
disease fungi, but it is highly disturbing to the soil and may cause excessive
erosion and loss of site productivity [<a href="#97">97</a>]. Chemically
treating freshly cut fir stumps may be an alternative [<a href="#288">288</a>].
<br><br>
Competition and Animal damage: Establishment of white
fir may be difficult where graminoid cover is dense
[<a href="#294">294</a>]. Dense brush does not prevent regeneration of white fir, but it
may slow down establishment, with white fir taking 30 to 50 years to overtop shrubs
[<a href="#180">180</a>]. Managers have sometimes used cattle to control
brush and aid in regeneration following clearcutting in the mixed conifer forests of
the Sierra Nevada [<a href="#21">21</a>]. However, free-ranging cattle favor riparian areas in these
forests, so their usefulness in this endeavor may be related to the proximity
of the site to a riparian area [<a href="#166">166</a>]. Furthermore, white fir
seedling establishment may be difficult where damage from livestock trampling is
possible [<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>]. Protective plastic tubing can be used
to protect seedlings threatened by gophers and other rodents. Browsing of
seedlings by deer and elk can reduce height growth for years, but seldom kills
plants. Browsing does not seriously affect growth of trees over 4 feet (1.2 m)
tall [<a href="#180">180</a>]. Methods of mechanical and chemical control of shrub competition
are available [<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#180">180</a>]. 
<br><br>
Pests and diseases: Heavy to severe mortality of
white fir was reported throughout Idaho and Utah in the late 1980's most likely
attributed to insects and diseases [<a href="#199">199</a>]. Filip and Schmitt [<a href="#98">98</a>] provide a review of root diseases, stem
decays, and dwarf mistletoes of true firs, and the effects of management
techniques, especially silvicultural techniques such as commercial and
precommercial thinning on these diseases. It has been argued that if we leave
late-successional reserves or &quot;overmature&quot; stands for critical habitat in the short-term that we are increasing "the risks of insect outbreaks, tree-killing pathogens, and catastrophic wildfires"
[<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>]. Others suggest that insect and disease outbreaks are part of the evolutionary scene and
helped to create mosaics of
contrasting successional stages on the landscape [<a href="#223">223</a>]. 
<br><br>
Dwarf mistletoes: The trunks of California white fir are often malformed or broken off where
dwarf-mistletoe infections have created stem cankers that cause weak spots and reduce the strength of the
lumber produced [<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#200">200</a>]. Two species, white fir mistletoe (<i>Phoradendron bolleanum
</i> ssp. <i>pauciflorum</i>), and white fir dwarf mistletoe (<i>Arceuthobium abietinum</i> f.
sp. <i>concoloris</i>) are responsible, and can be
a serious
problem in some areas [<a href="#137">137</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>]. White fir dwarf mistletoe
occurs on white fir throughout most of its range in California, Nevada,
Arizona, and southern Oregon [<a href="#137">137</a>]. White fir may be
infected by Douglas-fir dwarf mistletoe in Utah and New Mexico [<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>]. Infected trees may suffer
significant growth losses and become more prone to infection by other diseases such as <i>Cytospora abietis</i>, a fungus that
causes &quot;flagging&quot; and kills branches and further reduces growth [<a href="#137">137</a>]. Infected trees are also more susceptible to attacks by
bark beetles and heart rots. Dwarf mistletoe and fir canker were the most
important pathogens, followed by fir engraver, associated with death in white
fir in Sequoia National Park over a 5 year period [<a href="#233">233</a>]. A detailed
discussion of the dwarf mistletoes as ecological components of forest canopies is provided
by Mathiasen [<a href="#200">200</a>].
<br><br>
Decay fungi: White fir can be severely damaged or is highly
susceptible to a number of decay fungi including annosus root disease (<i>Heterobasidion annuosum</i>),
Armillaria root disease (<i>Armillaria</i> spp.), laminated root diseases,
yellow cap fungus (<i>Pholiota
limonella</i>), Indian paint fungus (<i>Echindontuim tinctorium</i>), and white
pocket rot (<i>Phellinus pini</i>) [<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#239">239</a>,<a href="#272">272</a>]. Decay fungi may enter the tree through
wounds (e.g. annosus) associated with mechanical
injuries, fire, insects and/or frost cracks; or may be dormant in the tree and
activated by wounding (e.g. Indian paint fungus) [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#238">238</a>]. Stem decay losses in white fir can be large, with over 20% attributable to annosus root disease in eastern
Oregon [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>]. Annosus root disease may be the most damaging pathogen to true
firs east of the Cascades in the Pacific Northwest [<a href="#118">118</a>]. Although it does not usually
kill white fir directly, annosus produces moisture stress and loss of vigor and can predispose
the tree to attack by bark beetles. Filip [<a href="#96">96</a>] presents an equation for estimating the
volume of timber loss due to stem decay in white and other true fir stands. Symptoms and
diagnosis of annosus root disease are given by Schmitt [<a href="#270">270</a>].
<br><br>
Insects: The fir engraver beetle is the most damaging white fir pest, causing major losses throughout the range of white
fir [<a href="#343">343</a>]. Maintenance of stand health and vigor
is the only known control.
Of the many insects that feed on white fir foliage, a few can cause serious damage. The Douglas-fir tussock moth is a serious defoliator
[<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#340">340</a>,<a href="#342">342</a>], as are the
western spruce budworm [<a href="#195">195</a>,<a href="#223">223</a>], the New Mexico fir looper, and the white fir needle miner [<a href="#178">178</a>]. White fir seedlings and
saplings lack chemical defenses against, and tend to be killed by budworm
feeding, while healthy mature trees usually survive [<a href="#223">223</a>]. Susceptibility to
budworm may be reduced by thinning young white fir [<a href="#223">223</a>,<a href="#294">294</a>]. Extensive
spraying with chemical insecticides has been shown to be futile [<a href="#223">223</a>]. Further discussion of western spruce budworm population dynamics and
ecology is available [<a href="#325">325</a>,<a href="#343">343</a>]. Insects that may cause damage to white fir cones and
seeds include
seven genera, the most abundant and damaging of which are seed maggots and the fir cone looper [<a href="#178">178</a>]. Cutworms may cause significant seedling
mortality [<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>].
<br><br>
White fir is sensitive to oxidant damage from air
pollution [<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>,<a href="#262">262</a>], but less sensitive than some associated species [<a href="#40">40</a>].

GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />

White fir is a large, native, coniferous tree. Mature white fir trees in the central
Sierra Nevada are 140 to 180 feet (43-55 m) tall, and 40 to 80 inches (1-2 m)
dbh, but may grow larger [<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>]. Rocky mountain white fir rarely exceeds
125 feet (38 m) tall or 3 feet (0.9 m) in diameter [<a href="#105">105</a>]. Bark on young trunks is smooth, gray and blistered with resin
vesicles, becoming thick, hard and deeply furrowed into scaly ridges with age
[<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#162">162</a>].<p> The crown of young trees is
symmetrical and
sharp-pointed, becoming irregular and rounded at the summit [<a href="#162">162</a>]. California white fir has a narrow, cylindrical, almost spire-like crown
[<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>]. Rocky mountain white fir tends to have a broader crown [<a href="#185">185</a>].
White fir branches are short and stout, with leaves 1.2 to 2.8 inches (3-7 cm) long and generally curved
upward. Branches are arranged in whorls of 4 or 5, which are repeatedly
branched in one plane to form flat, horizontal sprays. Buds are
blunt and resinous [<a href="#71">71</a>]. In Arizona white fir stands, braches reach nearly to the
ground if the trees are
widely spaced, and in more dense stands,
half or more of the trunk is often bare [<a href="#162">162</a>].

<p>The rooting habit of white fir is usually fairly shallow, but appears to be adaptable to
local conditions:
deep and intensive where soil conditions permit, to shallow and widespread where
rocks or seasonal water tables limit effective soil depth. There is no strong
tendency to maintain a single deep taproot although rapid taproot development is
critical for survival of new germinants in a dry summer climate.
White fir is susceptible to wind throw following partial cutting. Root diseases
may contribute to lack of wind firmness. Root grafting between firs is common and is
a factor in the
spread of root rots [<a href="#178">178</a>]. Effects of mycorrhizal
associations have been explored and appear to be important in white fir,
especially for establishment and early growth on poor sites. It appears that
bare mineral soils promote the association [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>].</p>

<p>White fir is thought to be a slow growing species [<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#219">219</a>]. It can survive for exceptionally long periods as a
suppressed tree and still respond to release by increasing growth dramatically.
White fir may reach ages of 300-400 years. Old growth characteristics in
Southwest are given by Steuver and Hayden [<a href="#294">294</a>]. Information on productivity of white fir is
available [<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#201">201</a>,<a href="#262">262</a>].</p>

<p>The varietal differences in California and Rocky Mountain white fir are based on differences
in morphological and chemical characteristics, such as needle tip shape and stomatal arrangement
[<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>] and terpene content [<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>].&nbsp;</p>

<br />

White fir reproduction is by seed, and it shows no tendency to reproduce by
sprouting or layering. Cuttings can, however, be rooted with or without hormones
[<a href="#178">178</a>]. White fir is monoecious. The male strobili are 0.2 to 0.4 inches
(6-9 mm) long and are densely grouped on
the underside of 1-year-old twigs about mid-crown. Female cones are 3 to 5 inches
(7-12 cm) long
and borne erect
on 1-year-old branches, usually in the uppermost crown.

</p>

<p>Cone and seed production: Cone and seed production
vary with tree
size, age and dominance. White fir trees can begin bearing cones at 40 years and
continue beyond 300 years [<a href="#178">178</a>]. The best producers are mature, healthy
dominants in the 12 to 35 inch (30-89 cm) d.b.h. range [<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>]. Cone
production is higher on trees near openings [<a href="#119">119</a>] and on trees
following release [<a href="#178">178</a>]. Immature trees can produce heavy seed crops, but their production is
more erratic than that of mature trees [<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>].
Pole-sized trees in dense stands will not produce cones unless their leaders
reach full sunlight. In mixed conifer forests of California only 4% of
understory white fir between 3.6 and 7.5 inches (9.1-19 cm) in diameter produce
cones [<a href="#105">105</a>]. In Oregon and California, heavy seed crops in white fir are borne on a 3- to 9-
year cycle, with fair to good crops occurring every 2 to 5 years, and bumper
crops every 5 to 9 years [<a href="#178">178</a>]. In the Rocky Mountains, medium to heavy
seed crops are produced every 2 to 4 years [<a href="#105">105</a>]. Cone production patterns may be different on extreme sites
[<a href="#110">110</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>]. Because cones are borne on the uppermost part of the crown, any top
damage caused by insects, diseases or mechanical agents (e.g. wind and snow)
directly reduces cone production. Cones produce about 185 to 295 seeds apiece [<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>]. Seed numbers can reach 600,000/acre (1.5 million/ha)
or more where white fir is a site dominant [<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>], and as many as 220,000 where white fir is a minor overstory component
[<a href="#181">181</a>].

</p>

<p>Seed predation: Insects that feed on cones and seeds
may seriously reduce yield. Seed chalids typically destroy 8 to 10% of white
fir seeds and have destroyed up to 60% of a crop [<a href="#108">108</a>]. Cone
moths, cone midges, and cone maggots also reduce yields [<a href="#119">119</a>]. In
California and Oregon, the Douglas squirrel cuts and caches cones, but generally
takes less than 1% of the cone crop [<a href="#106">106</a>]. 

</p>

<p>Seed dispersal: White fir seeds are released and disseminated by wind as the
cone disintegrates on the tree in the fall. Because white fir seed has a short, broad wing
relative to its weight, if falls more rapidly and travels a shorter distance
from the tree than many of its associated species. Downwind seed spread into an opening
is about 1.5 to 2 times the height of the tree [<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#203">203</a>]. A small percentage of seeds may be transported greater
distances by strong or gusty winds [<a href="#218">218</a>]. 

</p>

<p>Germination: After release in the fall, white fir
seeds overwinter in or under the snow. This cold, moist stratification is
required for germination [<a href="#108">108</a>]. Germination of white fir seeds occurs in the spring
immediately following snowmelt. Where
snowpack is deep, seeds may germinate in, on, and under the snow [<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>].
Of white fir seeds sown in November in white and red fir stands in the Sierra
Nevada, 82 to 86% of all germination occurred by May 9, and 96 to 98% by May 22
[<a href="#39">39</a>]. Only
a small proportion (20-50%) of seeds are viable [<a href="#178">178</a>]. Thus, germination
is low, averaging about 37% . Under controlled conditions,
white fir seeds may be stored for 5 or 6 years, but under natural conditions
seeds do not remain viable over 1 year [<a href="#108">108</a>]. 

</p>

<p>Seedling establishment and survival: White fir seeds that germinate in the snowpack, above the ground, rarely survive,
therefore, seeds that fall before the permanent snow cover are more likely to
produce seedlings [<a href="#119">119</a>]. Germination and early growth are best on bare
mineral soil, though seedlings may establish in soils covered by a litter layer
[<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].
Root systems developed in mineral soil without organic layers are longer,
heavier, and have more mycorrhizal root tips than those grown in soil with
organic layers [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>]. Seedlings generally establish best in partial shade,
and can establish easily under a closed canopy in dense shade [<a href="#178">178</a>].
Shade favors seedling survival in white fir because seedlings are very sensitive
to soil drying and heating. Damping off fungi, cutworms, drought, heat, trampling and browsing are
responsible for most seedling mortality [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>]. White fir seedlings are more susceptible to spring frost damage and deer
browse
than many associated species [<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#219">219</a>].

</p>

<p>Growth: Once established, white fir grows best in full
sun [<a href="#178">178</a>]. Shade-tolerant white fir saplings can, however, endure decades of
suppression under a closed canopy or in dense brushfields. Leader growth is very
slow under these conditions, and suppressed plants may be only 3 feet (0.9 m)
tall at 50 years [<a href="#91">91</a>]. White fir dramatically increases in diameter and
height growth when canopy openings are created, or when its height surpasses
surrounding vegetation [<a href="#100">100</a>,<a href="#181">181</a>].

Because of its wide distribution, white fir is subjected to very different
climates, soils, animals, plant associates and other environmental factors from
place to place [<a href="#186">186</a>].

</p>

<p>Rocky Mountain white fir grows on high mountains with
precipitation ranging from 20 to 35 inches (510-890 mm). California white fir grows
in cold, high elevations and warm-to-hot low elevations with precipitation
ranging from 35 to 75 inches (890-1900 mm), but grows best in the southern Cascades and
western Sierra Nevada, where precipitation is between 39 and 49 inches (990-1240 mm)
[<a href="#178">178</a>]. Within the mixed conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada, white fir
tends to occupy the more mesic sites, such as northern exposures, at lower
elevations, and the more xeric sites at upper elevations [<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#262">262</a>]. In
Utah, white fir typically occupies cool and dry northern exposures [<a href="#201">201</a>,<a href="#344">344</a>].
In the Southwest, white fir occupies numerous topographical settings, and local
conditions can vary from cold and moist to warm and dry [<a href="#83">83</a>]. Winter snowpack provides the majority of the moisture at high
elevations, with fall and early spring rains providing most of the moisture at
lower elevations [<a href="#178">178</a>]. The upper latitudinal limit of white fir may
coincide with a mean maximum January temperature of about 30 to 32 degrees Fahrenheit (-1
to 0 �C) [<a href="#201">201</a>]. White fir is sensitive to both
frost damage and, occasionally sun scald [<a href="#178">178</a>]. White fir is also moderately susceptible to ozone damage
[<a href="#157">157</a>]. White fir is less tolerant of shade than
associated true firs (except red fir), is slightly more tolerant than
Douglas-fir, and is much more tolerant than pines or oaks [<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#219">219</a>].

</p>

<p>California white fir occurs in a wide elevational
range, as low as 3,000 feet (900 m) in the North Coast Ranges to over 10,000 feet
(3000 m) in the San Bernardino Mountains and the Sierra San Pedro M&aacute;rtir of
Baja, California [<a href="#186">186</a>]. Pure white fir forests are common in Oregon and
California and they occupy a narrow elevational band from about 4,600 to 5,250
feet (1400-1600 m) in the southern Cascades and from 5,400 to 5,900 feet
(1650-1800 m) in the Siskiyou Mountains of northwestern California [<a href="#111">111</a>].
In the Sierra Nevada, white fir is a major component of mixed conifer forests
occurring between 4,100 to 7,200 feet (1250-2200 m) [<a href="#262">262</a>]. Rocky Mountain white fir is found most frequently at elevations
ranging from 6,900 to 8,900 feet (2100-2700 m) [<a href="#178">178</a>]. In the mountains of southern Arizona, it
occupies the highest elevations [<a href="#188">188</a>]. Generalized
elevational and precipitation ranges are as follows, by state:

<p>
White fir grows on a variety of slightly to
strongly acid soils from almost every type of parent material [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>,<a href="#201">201</a>]. It is
generally tolerant of a wide range of soil conditions, nutrient availability and
pH values. Growth and development are best on moderately deep and well-drained
sandy-loam to clay-loam soils, regardless of parent material. California white
fir is moderately sensitive to excess soil moisture [<a href="#178">178</a>]. White fir is usually found on frigid soil temperature regimes or the warmest of
the cryic regimes [<a href="#223">223</a>,<a href="#294">294</a>]. In the arid Organ Mountains of southern New Mexico white fir occurs as a topo-edaphic climax on
the cool upper eastern slopes [<a href="#84">84</a>].

</p>

<p>White fir grows from
canyon bottoms and ravines up to ridgetops on gentle, moderate, and steep slopes
of all aspects. It develops best on gentle slopes and level ground [<a href="#178">178</a>].
In the Rocky Mountains, white fir, along with blue spruce and Douglas-fir, often
replaces the dominant deciduous species near middle elevation streams passing through
sheltered valleys or canyons [<a href="#245">245</a>].

</p>

<p>Botanical associates of white fir that may affect its
growth include snowbrush ceanothus, which contains allelopathic chemicals
in its foliage that suppress radicle growth of white fir [<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>]. Mycorrhizal associations are thought to protect white fir roots from
allelopathic chemicals produced by bracken fern [<a href="#178">178</a>].

California white fir is a major climax component throughout the mixed conifer
forests within its range [<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#225">225</a>]. White fir
reproduces abundantly under conditions of dense shade, and it is an aggressive
pioneer species as well [<a href="#201">201</a>]. Successional relationships of
white fir are
complicated by floristic differences over its large range of occurrence [<a href="#188">188</a>].

<p>The white fir series in the Southwest can have
varying mixtures of white
fir, with conifer associates dependent on moisture and temperature relationships
of the site and stage of succession. The more successful reproduction of
white fir is diagnostic of the white fir series [<a href="#188">188</a>,<a href="#232">232</a>]. Mosaics of
contrasting successional stages are considered to be the result of both insects and
past fires [<a href="#223">223</a>]. Within the
mixed conifer type, white fir tends to achieve climax dominance on moist sites [<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#327">327</a>]
and in localized areas with long
fire-free intervals that give white fir the chance to mature to a point where it
is moderately fire-tolerant. In mixed conifer forests with a natural fire regime
of low-intensity surface fires, white fir is kept from attaining climax
dominance because it is more fire sensitive than its coniferous associates
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].
Thus, many white fir habitat types are in mid-successional stages, with various
seral species dominating the overstory and white fir dominating the reproductive
size classes [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>]. Seral associates that
often dominate a site include ponderosa pine [<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#223">223</a>,<a href="#294">294</a>], Douglas-fir [<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#294">294</a>], southwestern white pine
[<a href="#185">185</a>], Gamble oak, New Mexico locust [<a href="#294">294</a>], California black oak [<a href="#113">113</a>], quaking aspen
[<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#223">223</a>,<a href="#230">230</a>,<a href="#245">245</a>], and lodgepole pine [<a href="#245">245</a>].

</p>

<p>White fir will seed into the understory of ponderosa pine stands
or in mixtures of ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, quaking aspen, and southwestern
white pine [<a href="#185">185</a>]. Many
habitat types in the white fir series in the Southwest are dominated by Douglas-fir
and ponderosa pine in mid-seral stages, with white fir steadily gaining dominance
as succession proceeds [<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#294">294</a>]. Lodgepole pine is a common seral species in the white fir
type, with seedlings of
white fir in the understory that are less than a
meter in height but in excess of 100 years old. Both aspen and ponderosa pine are present at
sites where high intensity fires
have occurred or where ground fires have slowed or prevented replacement by white fir and
Douglas- fir [<a href="#223">223</a>]. With fire suppression, white
fir is able to mature
in the understory with a concurrent decrease in pine reproduction and eventually begins to replace the pines as they succumb to
root diseases and bark beetles, resulting in a gradual change in structure and
composition in white fir habitat types [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#184">184</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>,<a href="#257">257</a>]. White fir
will eventually dominate if the fire-free interval is sufficiently long to allow
trees to grow to a fire-resistant size, unless another disturbance event gets
them. In a
Jeffrey pine forest in South Lake Tahoe, California, a disease outbreak killed
the Jeffrey pine overstory, releasing the small white firs in the understory which
went on to become
the predominant species on the site. They then suffered extreme moisture stress form drought
and succumbed to a fir engraver attack causing them to die rapidly [<a href="#269">269</a>].

</p>

<p> It appears that white fir may be an early colonizer of
disturbed sites, gradually increasing in dominance over time [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#262">262</a>]. In northeastern California, overgrazing in big sagebrush- steppe communities allowed for the invasion and establishment of
white fir in an unusually xeric setting for white fir [<a href="#257">257</a>]. White
fir may also be a pioneering species in upper elevation meadows within its type
where it has been observed to invade by growing near older lodgepole pine [<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>]. White fir is an early seral species at the lowest
elevations of the subalpine forest in New Mexico [<a href="#223">223</a>].

</p>

<p>Following overstory removal (logging or
stand-replacement fires) in mixed conifer or white fir forests of the southern
Cascades and Sierra Nevada, sites are often dominated by montane chaparral
shrubs, primarily ceanothus and manzanita, but also
mountain whitethorn, currant and
gooseberry (<i>Ribes</i> spp.), chinquapins, and some oaks [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#149">149</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>]. Seeds of some species may lie
dormant in the forest floor for as long as 300 years and germinate following
removal of overstory. Sierra mountain misery and grasses may also assume significant roles [<a href="#178">178</a>]. Given a nearby seed
source and absence of further burning, white fir seedlings can establish under
shrubs within about 10 to 20 years [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#218">218</a>]. A
30 year delay in tree recruitment was observed after a stand-replacement fire in
the Lake Tahoe Basin [<a href="#263">263</a>]. Given the continued absence
of fire, white fir will eventually overtop the shrubs and dominate the site,
creating pure stands in otherwise mixed conifer areas [<a href="#65">65</a>].

</p>

<p>Following overstory removal in mixed conifer or
white fir forests in the Southwest, herbaceous species usually dominate the
vegetation for the first few years of succession, and diminish in late seral conditions as shading inhibits
their growth [<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#223">223</a>,<a href="#294">294</a>]. Seral shrubs and trees that follow herbs include
aspen, New Mexico locust, Rocky Mountain maple, bush oceanspray, and Gambel oak,
and may dominate the site for the next 40 to 100 or more years [<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#223">223</a>]. Gradually tree seedlings,
including white fir,
become established, although growth is slow under the canopy. Scattered conifers emerge
above the shrubs after 50 to 100 years. This stage persists for another 50 or more
years, with a closed stand of replacement conifers not fully developed until
100-200 years after the fire, the time depending on numerous factors such as shrub
density, climatic conditions, availability of tree-seed sources, soil conditions,
livestock, wildlife, and human use. Old growth is characterized by conifer
overstory and low shrubs in the understory, with possible sparse herbaceous
cover [<a href="#134">134</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#223">223</a>]. White
fir may establish quickly on mesic sites and dominate early seral stages, while conifers such as southwestern white pine, limber pine and ponderosa pine may
dominate the early seral stages on xeric sites [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#225">225</a>,<a href="#294">294</a>].

</p>

<p>Crane [<a href="#69">69</a>] presents successional trends of
white fir habitat types in Colorado that appear reasonable for Utah types as
well. In Utah, white fir becomes the dominant climax
tree on characteristically cool and dry sites that are usually northern
exposures [<a href="#344">344</a>]. These sites are apparently too warm and
dry for subalpine fir
and Engelmann spruce. Although white fir reproduces most abundantly under shade,
it also invades open slopes within the mountain-brush zone [<a href="#201">201</a>]. White fir and Douglas-fir are replacing brush species on some northern
exposures, and, in the
absence of fire, these sites may develop into conifer forests [<a href="#63">63</a>].

White fir requires 2 years to complete its reproductive cycle. Cones are
initiated in mid-May of the 1st year as microscopic primordia within
vegetative buds. Bud differentiation occurs in midsummer and separate seed-cone
and pollen-cone buds develop until each becomes dormant in the fall [<a href="#299">299</a>].
During the spring of the 2nd year, cone buds resume growth and conelets are
recognizable in early May. In Oregon and California, second year reproduction
phenology proceeds with flowering in late May to early June, and fertilization
occurring shortly thereafter [<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>]; cones
reaching full size by early to late August [<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>]; and seed dispersal
beginning in late September
to early October [<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>].




<p>In New Mexico, white fir growing with Douglas-fir completed bud elongation by May
4, and most of its flush extension by the middle of June, and exhibited about
twice the flush growth of Douglas-fir over a 5-year period [<a href="#56">56</a>]. Flowering of Rocky
Mountain white fir may extend into July at higher elevations. Female cones
reach full size in late summer and turn brown when mature. The seed matures in
September, up to 3 weeks before seedfall [<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>].

</p>

<p>
Radial
growth begins before height growth in white fir, and lasts longer. Height growth in white fir
begins 1 to 1.5 months later than in associated conifers and lasts about 6 weeks
[<a href="#178">178</a>]. On the west slope of the Sierra Nevada at 5,200 feet
(1585 m) within the Stanislaus National Forest, white fir leader growth began on
June 24 and was completed by mid-August. New needles emerge from fascicles
after height growth begins [<a href="#104">104</a>]. Old needles are shed primarily in the fall and
winter. In California, most needles drop in October and November [<a href="#46">46</a>].

FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS:</a>

<br />

White fir occurs in a variety of forest and habitat types that evolved with a
variety of fire regimes.

Thin-barked and resin blistered, with drooping lower branches, young white fir
is highly susceptible to fire, and mature trees are only moderately fire
tolerant. White fir is an aggressive,
shade-tolerant species that will seed into the understory of low-elevation ponderosa
or Jeffrey pine stands
or into mixtures of ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, quaking aspen, and southwestern
white pine [<a href="#185">185</a>]. On these sites, its numbers were previously controlled by
frequent surface fires. With fewer fires in the last century, it is becoming a major stand component at elevations and
on sites where historically it was minor [<a href="#178">178</a>]. At mid-elevations in the mixed conifer and
white fir zones, fires
may have burned in a pattern of different severities, including patches where
most of the moderately susceptible trees such as white fir, survived [<a href="#25">25</a>], and patches where white fir stands were completely destroyed
[<a href="#201">201</a>]. This type of fire regime creates a forest mosaic of stands with varied
structures, species compositions, and seral stages. White fir is also a
component of forest communities that evolved with less frequent, stand-replacing
fires. The following discussion provides examples from white fir communities
that evolved with mixed, understory, and stand-replacement fire
regimes.<p>

The primary range of white fir is in the mid-elevation, mixed conifer and white fir zones in
California and the central and southern Rocky Mountains. These forest types may
be characterized by a mixed fire regime, with fires of variable frequency and
severity [<a href="#25">25</a>], with some sites experiencing frequent surface fires [<a href="#7">7</a>], and others experiencing infrequent crown fires. Mean fire intervals are generally intermediate to intervals in understory and
stand replacement regimes, ranging between 30 and 100 years [<a href="#25">25</a>]. Mean
fire intervals in Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forests are estimated to range
between 5 and 30 years, and varied in response to ignition source, fuel
accumulations, fuel moisture and burning conditions [<a href="#332">332</a>]. Any given location within a mixed fire regime could experience some
stand-replacement fires and some nonlethal fires along with a number of fires
that burned at mixed severities, creating mosaic patterns of stand structure and
fuels [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#215">215</a>,<a href="#304">304</a>]. Low severity fires
thin understory regenerating trees, while more severe crown fires may knock
succession back to herbs and shrubs. Thus, past burn mosaics tended to increase the probability that
subsequent fires would also burn in a mixed pattern. Complex mountain topography
also contributed to variable fuels and burning conditions that favored
nonuniform fire behavior [<a href="#25">25</a>]. After decades of fire exclusion, much of
the landscape mosaic has aged and advanced successionally, and patches of late
successional
forests with large accumulations of dead and living fuels have coalesced,
increasing likelihood of fires of unusual size and severity [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#169">169</a>,<a href="#209">209</a>,<a href="#285">285</a>,<a href="#286">286</a>,<a href="#287">287</a>,<a href="#315">315</a>]. This shift toward landscape homogeneity may adversely affect biodiversity,
and may also be perpetuated as the probability of large, high-severity fires increases
with continued fire
suppression [<a href="#338">338</a>]. Much of the living fuels in these forests are small white
firs and other shade tolerant species, filling in the understories with dense
thickets and increasing fuel continuity and fire ladders of resinous foliage,
often in
cylindrical crowns that may lead to crown fires
when they do burn [<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>,<a href="#223">223</a>,<a href="#287">287</a>]. Fuel loadings in this type may vary widely due to
stand history and site productivity [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#330">330</a>].</p>
<p>There is evidence
that a mixed regime may have been important for perpetuation of giant sequoia
groves in the Sierra Nevada [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#295">295</a>]. Giant sequoia groves burned every 2-10 years for the last 3000 years and have not burned in
100-130 years [<a href="#288">288</a>,<a href="#289">289</a>,<a href="#295">295</a>]. The more mesic,
mid-elevation, mixed conifer forests of California formerly experienced low to moderate severity wildfires every15 to 30 years
[<a href="#287">287</a>,<a href="#332">332</a>]. Other areas that may have had mixed fire
regimes include the Marble Mountains of northern
California [<a href="#304">304</a>]; the mixed conifer zone in the montane forests of the
Madrean borderlands; the Animas Mountains of southwest
New Mexico [<a href="#296">296</a>]; mixed conifer forests in the Jemez Mountains, New
Mexico [<a href="#307">307</a>]; the white fir/Rocky Mountain maple habitat type in
Arizona and New Mexico [<a href="#232">232</a>,<a href="#294">294</a>]; the
high elevation, white fir/forest fleabane habitat type [<a href="#294">294</a>];
the lowest elevations of the subalpine forest in New Mexico [<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#223">223</a>]; the mixed conifer zone of the Sandia
Mountains, New Mexico [<a href="#36">36</a>]; and the white fir zone in the
central Siskiyou Mountains, Oregon [<a href="#3">3</a>]. </p>
<p>White fir is also a component of drier ponderosa and Jeffrey pine habitat types
that evolved with an understory fire regime. An understory fire regime is
characterized by relatively frequent, low
severity fires that result in open, uneven-aged stands consisting primarily of
the more fire tolerant species. White fir was not a major component of these
stands under this regime, and existed as scattered individuals or small groups
that managed to survive to a fire resistant age. Open ponderosa pine, larch and Douglas-fir forests at lower elevations in
the west have been extensively harvested and protected from fire resulting in
a compositional shift to an unnaturally dense understory of Douglas-fir, grand
fir white fir, or incense-cedar [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#185">185</a>,<a href="#234">234</a>]. Areas where this fire regime was
important include the ponderosa pine and mixed conifer forests of southern
Arizona and New Mexico [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#296">296</a>]; the
Sacramento and White mountains of New Mexico [<a href="#224">224</a>]; and ponderosa
pine stands in central Oregon [<a href="#252">252</a>,<a href="#297">297</a>]. Because of changes in
fuels during the last century, these areas may now experience crown fires when
they do burn, with
high tree mortality [<a href="#5">5</a>]. </p>
<p>White fir may also be a component in ecosystems with a stand-replacement fire
regime such as western subalpine forests and Douglas-fir/western hemlock forests
[<a href="#25">25</a>]. The more arid Jeffrey pine
forests on the Mojave Desert side of the mountains in southern California may
also have a stand-replacement fire regime due to the slow build up of fuels in
the arid environment [<a href="#287">287</a>]. Evidence of a
stand-replacement fire regime in a white fir-Jeffrey pine forest type in the
Lake Tahoe Basin is presented by Russell and others [<a href="#263">263</a>]. Similarly, the subalpine
forests are limited by cold and are also slow
growing so fires are naturally infrequent and when they do burn it
is usually a stand replacing fire in severe weather [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#287">287</a>].

IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT:</a>
</span>
<br />

White fir seedlings, saplings and poles are thin-barked and resin blistered and
are highly susceptible to
fire damage and kill [<a href="#178">178</a>]. Additionally,
young trees have low-growing branches that can
easily ignite from burning undergrowth, providing a fuel ladder into the crown.
Consequently, young white fir are usually killed by even low-intensity, surface fires
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#168">168</a>,<a href="#302">302</a>].
As trees mature and bark thickens, and some self-pruning of lower branches occurs, they become more resistant to
fire [<a href="#344">344</a>]. However, the tendency to retain some low branches,
the moderately shallow roots, and heavy lichen
growth on the branches of white fir make it only moderately fire resistant [<a href="#55">55</a>].
In larger trees, mortality results from crown scorch, girdled stems
from cambial heating, or damage to moderately shallow roots from soil heating
[<a href="#302">302</a>,<a href="#327">327</a>].

The effects of fire on white fir vary with size and age of tree, stand density, fuel loading and fire conditions.


<p class="subframeContent">
 Prescribed low-intensity summer
surface fires in mixed conifer forests of Crater Lake National Park, Oregon,
resulted in high mortality of small white firs [<a href="#302">302</a>].
Similarly, prescribed, low-intensity fall surface fires in a giant sequoia-mixed
conifer forest in Kings Canyon National Park, California, resulted in
mortality of 91% of trees less than 6 inches (15 cm) dbh, 39% of trees 6-12
inches (15-30 cm) dbh, and 5% of trees larger than 12 inches dbh [<a href="#168">168</a>].
</p>

<p class="subframeContent"> 
Greater reduction in density is obtained in stands with higher prefire
densities. In white fir stands with dense
vegetation, consisting of both young stands of pure
white fir and open stands of white fir with a shrub understory, fires burned
at high intensity and killed most trees in the area studied in the Marble Mountains of
California. In lower density forest stands of white fir with old-growth
characteristics, fires were of low intensity and burned down rotten logs and
standing snags with very little damage to the canopy trees [<a href="#304">304</a>]. Prescribed fires resulted
in an increase in the density of giant sequoia at the expense of white fir [<a href="#164">164</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>,<a href="#169">169</a>].
</p>

<p class="subframeContent">Greater mortality of mature trees could be expected
in stands with a deep litter layer, since smoldering of the duff for long periods after the fire has passed kills
the moderately shallow roots of white fir [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<p class="subframeContent">
<span class="subframeName">
<a name="PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE">
PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Following stand-replacing fires, white fir reestablishes via wind-dispersed
seed. Exposed mineral soil seedbeds created by fire favor initial seedling establishment
in white fir [<a href="#159">159</a>], but seedling survival is better in
partial shade [<a href="#39">39</a>]. Therefore, seedlings establish soon after fire if a canopy remains
[<a href="#170">170</a>], but
may take several years to establish if the canopy has been removed.



<p class="subframeContent">Fire may encourage growth in white fir by eliminating
competition. Evidence from a fire-scarred white fir stump in Oregon shows that after being
scarred as a sapling-sized tree, it had growth release [<a href="#3">3</a>]. However, trees damaged or weakened by fire are also more susceptible to attack by insects and disease.
Fire scars may allow a point of entry for a variety of disease and decay
organisms [<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#336">336</a>], and fire-weakened trees that are attacked by insects can be killed
within a few years [<a href="#302">302</a>].

<br />

The response of white fir to fire is inconsistent and may vary with fire
frequency and severity, associated vegetation in the postfire community, location of seed
trees, postfire insect and disease effects, and postfire browsing by animals.
Mean annual post-fire mortality of 17.8% in white fir was related primarily to
fire-caused crown scorch and possibly fine root mortality in Sequoia National
Park [<a href="#233">233</a>]. White fir is considered more fire resistant than its associated
species at high elevations, but less resistant than associated species at low
elevations [<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#219">219</a>].
Tree associates Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine are favored by more
frequent fires [<a href="#344">344</a>]. If the time between fires is long enough, white fir
seedlings can germinate
and establish under brush cover and thus establish crown
dominance over time [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>,<a href="#211">211</a>]. 



<p class="subframeContent">In the mixed conifer zone of the Sierra Nevada, white
fir seedlings are often abundant under montane chaparral shrubs that form brushfields
after high severity crown fires. Conard and Radosevich [<a href="#65">65</a>] found
white fir reproducing abundantly on shrub-dominated sites, with a combined
seedling and sapling density ranging from 445 to 4,453 per acre (1100-11,000/ha)
where crown fires had occurred 38 to 62 years earlier. Densities of both
snowbrush ceanothus and manzanita were higher on burned than on unburned and on
logged than on unlogged plots [<a href="#328">328</a>]. Fire severity can be an
important determinant of shrub response in white fir stands. Preharvest burning
in a 70-year-old white fir stand in northeastern California resulted in
410,000 snowbrush ceanothus seedlings/ha in moderate-consumption
burns, and 94% seed mortality in more severe burns - killing seeds to a depth
of 10 cm in the soil [<a href="#329">329</a>,<a href="#330">330</a>].

</p>

<p class="subframeContent"> Minnich [<a href="#218">218</a>] studied conifer reproduction on
burned areas in mixed conifer forests in the San Gabriel and San Bernardino
mountains of southern California. He found that seeds originating from outside
the burned area were responsible for abundant white fir production on burns
older than 10 years, but that reproduction was scant on burns less than 5 years
old. Similarly, no white fir seedlings established within 5 years of a crown fire
in the Sierra Nevada, even though several mature trees survived the fire
and thus provided a seed source [<a href="#65">65</a>]. Another Sierra Nevada study found
negligible white fir reproduction 17 years following a stand-replacing
fire, even though a seed source was readily available [<a href="#51">51</a>]. Less than 1 year following
underburning in a giant
sequoia grove, white fir seedling establishment in June was abundant, with 39%
survival in October [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Most mortality in white fir after the 1st year postfire in mixed conifer in southern Oregon was associated with bark beetles [<a href="#302">302</a>].<p class="subframeContent">

FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

The possible uses of fire in white fir communities include the maintenance of
more desirable seral species by thinning small white fir, fuel reduction, seedbed preparation, sanitation against insects and
diseases, improvement of visual
resources in national parks, creating openings for wildlife habitat, and the establishment of semi-natural
processes [<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#154">154</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#300">300</a>,<a href="#308">308</a>,<a href="#349">349</a>],
including nutrient cycling [<a href="#226">226</a>,<a href="#337">337</a>]. 



<p class="subframeContent">

Thinning: Prescribed burning in areas where white
fir is not desired may be useful to control its abundance and promote the growth
of more desirable seral species. Burning in some areas may
create conditions favorable for suckering of aspen or Rocky Mountain maple [<a href="#294">294</a>].
Replacing conifer cover with aspen, shrub, or
herbaceous vegetation can improve water yield [<a href="#55">55</a>]. Prescribed fire has been used to effectively
eliminate fire-intolerant species such as white fir and Douglas-fir and to favor more
fire-tolerant species such as ponderosa pine [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>,<a href="#227">227</a>] and giant sequoia [<a href="#163">163</a>,<a href="#168">168</a>]. A dramatic decline in white fir basal area was observed following
prescribed burning in the Sierra Nevada [<a href="#233">233</a>]. This may be useful in areas
experiencing high levels of mortality  due to stress from competition for water and resources
in overcrowded stands and subsequent vulnerability to insects and disease [<a href="#267">267</a>]. Stephenson and Calcarone
[<a href="#287">287</a>] developed a model to
predict areas of montane conifer forest with overcrowded stand conditions. Areas
predicted to be experiencing high stand densification meet all of the following criteria: vegetation type is a conifer forest, elevation is below 7,500 feet
(2300 m),
mean annual precipitation is greater than 25.6 inches (650 mm), canopy cover is
greater than 60%, and slope is less that 60%. Fuel loads may be too hazardous to secure desired
mortality of white fir while maintaining relatively low mortality of mature trees.
Spring burning in old-growth ponderosa pine at Crater Lake National Park
resulted in 30% mortality of ponderosa pine greater than 9 inches (22 cm) in
diameter [<a href="#297">297</a>].
When fire
prescriptions cannot ensure that young white fir will not ignite the crown of overstory trees, cutting
all trees under a specified size before burning reduces this
fire hazard [<a href="#27">27</a>]. In three different studies, white fir less than 9 inches (23 cm)
dbh [<a href="#170">170</a>], 6 inches (15cm) dbh [<a href="#222">222</a>], and 11 feet tall [<a href="#48">48</a>] were felled before
burning. This method can help to reduce fire damage from future wildfires, as
well [<a href="#5">5</a>]. Cutting without subsequent burning is less effective [<a href="#27">27</a>].
A method of prescribed burning that decreases the probability of damage to
mature white fir is given by Weatherspoon and others [<a href="#331">331</a>]. However, prescribed burning is not recommended as a thinning
tool where true fir is the desired crop tree. In underburned white fir stands in
southern Oregon, 36% of the residual white fir trees had sufficient scorch to
cause partial cambial death that was associated with stained and decayed wood
even 2 years after the burn [<a href="#98">98</a>].

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">Fuel reduction: Heavy fuel loadings and well-developed understories of shade tolerant
conifers like white fir set the stage for stand-replacing crown fires [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#349">349</a>]. By leaving the largest trees
and treating fuels, fire tolerant forest conditions can be created, so that fire
severity can be reduced. These treatments are sensible
where low-severity fire regimes are now supporting high severity fires due to fuel
build ups, but not in areas with stand-replacement fire regimes, where weather
is the driving factor in fire severity [<a href="#5">5</a>]. Prescribed, low-intensity fires will kill large numbers of
small white fir and reduce fuel loading, helping to reduce this threat [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>,<a href="#171">171</a>,<a href="#286">286</a>,<a href="#302">302</a>]. Not all forest floor fuel is consumed in an
initial prescribed burn [<a href="#265">265</a>], and much of the initial volume
reduction may be replaced
by material killed but not consumed in the initial fire [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>,<a href="#168">168</a>,<a href="#302">302</a>]. The fuel ladder is generally broken by the
1st fire, so
that a 2nd fire is generally easier to control, 5-10 years after the 1st [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#171">171</a>].
Fire effects
monitoring in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks reveal an average initial
reduction in fuel load by 71% (93% duff and 56% woody), 1 year after prescribed burning, an increase in total
fuel load from the 1-year postfire to the 5-year postfire inventory and a
total fuel load exceeding prefire levels after 10 years, with woody fuels
nearly double their prefire levels and duff at 28% prefire levels [<a href="#163">163</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>]. Tree density was reduced
from 498 prefire to 295 post; white fir was 60% pre and 56% 1 year post; 10 years post was at 51% and giant sequoia had increased from 7% to 23% [<a href="#163">163</a>,<a href="#254">254</a>]. Between 80 and 90% of shrubs on a site will be top-killed by fire. Those capable of sprouting will do so based on season of burn and degree
of duff consumption or fire severity. Sprouting shrubs are most susceptible to
fire kill under dry conditions in late spring and early fall when fuel
consumption is highest [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>,<a href="#160">160</a>]. Summer and fall burning more effectively reduce white fir and
giant
sequoia fuels than does spring burning [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>]. Fire used for fuel
reduction must be handled carefully to avoid
escape and stand damage [<a href="#349">349</a>].
Fuel accumulations are site specific but can be estimated using prediction
equations based on stand basal area, tree height or diameter or with depth of
forest floor and stand overstory age. Info on production and estimation of fuels
and fuel characteristics are available for Sierra Nevada mixed conifer
[<a href="#312">312</a>,<a href="#313">313</a>,<a href="#314">314</a>], giant sequoia [<a href="#265">265</a>,<a href="#334">334</a>],
ponderosa pine and mixed conifer in the Southwest [<a href="#264">264</a>], and for mixed conifer in
Arizona [<a href="#122">122</a>]. Fire behavior models may be used to
predict how silvicultural and fuels treatments will affect fire behavior [<a href="#286">286</a>]. In areas with high
fuel loadings, dense multistoried stands, and smoke restrictions, it may be
necessary to use silvicultural tools that include prescribed fire [<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#221">221</a>,<a href="#246">246</a>]. 

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">Preharvest underburning/site preparation:
Underburning before timber harvesting with the shelterwood method in mixed conifer
forests can be used to aid natural regeneration, and reduce shrub seed reserves in the
soil [<a href="#55">55</a>]. Prescriptions developed in the
Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon recommend felling all understory trees
less than 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter before burning. The combination of
cutting and burning removes all advanced regeneration, thus sanitizing the
site of heart rot which is present in many 5- to 6-inch diameter (12.5 -15 cm)
white fir (these trees are white fir x grand fir hybrids). Following harvest,
seedling establishment of all conifers was abundant [<a href="#222">222</a>]. In some locations
preharvest underburning is not recommended because it stimulates dormant shrub
seeds to germinate [<a href="#328">328</a>]. In the Siskiyou Mountains, soil erosion can
be a problem following fires that remove duff layers on granitic soils [<a href="#30">30</a>]. Severe fires can eliminate dwarf mistletoe by destroying infected stands
[<a href="#69">69</a>]. In the Blue Mountains of Oregon, prescribed burning was initiated to
sanitize the
sites of heart rot and stagnated understory, prepare the site, and encourage
natural regeneration [<a href="#221">221</a>,<a href="#246">246</a>].

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">Fire can enhance range and wildlife habitats by rejuvenating forage
and browse species [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#221">221</a>,<a href="#237">237</a>,<a href="#246">246</a>]. Use of prescribed fire for fuel management in
California spotted owl habitat
is suggested to reduce the threat of stand replacement fires [<a href="#273">273</a>,<a href="#332">332</a>]. Prescriptions may include leaving snags and
larger size fuels for wildlife habitat [<a href="#221">221</a>,<a href="#246">246</a>]. Additionally, moisture stored
in these logs may expedite forest recovery by providing important refuges for roots and
associated mycorrhizal fungi of pioneering vegetation [<a href="#23">23</a>]. 

</p>
<p class="subframeContent"> Restoring fire to its natural role in Sierra Nevada forests by
prescribed burning at lower and middle elevation types and by allowing
lightning
fires to burn in higher elevation forests is suggested [<a href="#169">169</a>]. Returning fire and natural process to areas that
evolved with mixed fire regimes requires a deliberate approach based on
descriptions of the mosaic of aggregations that constituted the presettlement
forest communities, a determination of the kinds of vegetation changes that it is feasible to make, and
the degree of
success to be expected from different vegetation management techniques, keeping in mind that
that the initial restoration program will determine the character of the
vegetation mosaic for centuries to come [<a href="#52">52</a>]. Structural
maintenance objectives may be biologically infeasible, thereby restricting management
to the pursuit of process maintenance objectives [<a href="#53">53</a>].
This is complicated by the need to return the
forest community to prefire exclusion structure before reintroducing fire to the
ecosystem. Managers need region specific fire
regime data to develop process-based management schemes [<a href="#301">301</a>], and/or determine reference conditions for
key ecosystem functional and structural components that may be used in an
ecosystem management context [<a href="#115">115</a>]. Characteristics for mixed conifer forest reference stands at
Sequoia are given by Riegel and others [<a href="#256">256</a>]. Tools available to fire managers for prescribed
burning planning
include PREFEX, a small expert system for managing fire effect information [<a href="#99">99</a>], and the Fire Monitoring Handbook
[<a href="#254">254</a>]. Smoke production and air quality must be considered [<a href="#58">58</a>]. Water quality was not
adversely affected by prescribed burning in a
ponderosa pine-mixed conifer watershed in east-central Arizona [<a href="#121">121</a>].

White fir dominates in all stands, with an inverse J-shaped size distribution.
Sugar pine is most common in Lower Tharp's and upper Log stands. Red fir (<i>Abies
magnifica</i>) is
present in significant numbers only in the Lower Log stand. Giant sequoia (<i>Sequoiadendron
giganteum</i>), incense-cedar (<i>Calocedrus decurrens</i>), Jeffrey pine (<i>Pinus
jeffreyi</i>) and California black oak (<i>Quercus </i><i>kelloggii</i>) are only minor components
of these stands. Shrub cover ranges form 2% to 20% in the four stands and is
comprised mainly of greenleaf manzanita (<i>Arctostaphylos patula</i>), mountain whitethorn (<i>Ceanothus
cordulatus</i>), bush chinquapin (<i>Chrysolepsis sempervirens</i>), and gooseberry (<i>Ribes</i> spp.). Litter and
duff are the predominant ground cover, with scattered herbaceous vegetation.

The study sites comprise the headwater drainages of Tharp's Creek and Log Creek.
Soils of both watersheds are predominantly pachic xerumbrepts, derived from
granodiorite. Slopes are moderate to steep. The aspect of Tharp's watershed
ranges from south to south-east, and Log watershed aspect is primarily west to
south-west and north-west. Elevations are 6875 to 7150 feet (2097-2180 m) in the
Tharp's watershed and 7080 to 7775 feet (2158-2371 m) in the Log watershed. Mean
annual precipitation in the area is 50 inches (1255 mm), with about half falling as snow.
Mean January and July temperatures are 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0&deg;C) and 64
degrees Fahrenheit (18&deg;C), respectively.

The Tharp's prescribed burn was a 35 acre (14 ha) fire ignited October 23-26,
1990. Ignition occurred primarily in early evening and into the night when
relative humidity was 30-40%. Average fuel moistures for litter ad duff were
28%, for 100 hr fuels 14%, and for 1000 hr fuels 64%. Air temperatures during
ignition ranged from 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit (10-16 &deg;C) and winds were
calm. Fire behavior ranged from a backing fire with flame lengths of 0.2 to 0.5
feet (0.05-0.15 m) and rates of spread up to 0.3 feet (0.1 m)/minute, to a strip headfire
with flame lengths
of 2 to 8 feet (0.6-2.4 m). Areas with heavy fuel concentrations and standing snags
burned with the greatest severity. Total preburn fuel load was 94 tons/acre (210 Mg/ha) and total
reduction was 85%, with the highest reduction in litter/duff (97%) and 1-hr fuels.

The prescribed burn in the Tharp's Creek watershed resulted in a dramatic rise
in mortality rates for 5 years following the fire when compared both with the
prefire mortality rates and with the unburned Log Creek watershed.

Average annual mortality for all trees greater than 4.6 feet (1.4 m) tall in the Lower and
Upper Tharp's Creek plots during the 5 year preburn period was 0.8% and 0.6%,
respectively. Annual mortality rates in the 1st postburn year increased to 35.2% and
49.4%, and declined to 2.6% and 5.0% by the fifth postfire year. While these
rates are well above prefire mortality rates, the 2.6% is within the range of
annual mortality rates recorded for the Log Creek watershed for the same period.
The greatest reduction in white fir numbers was in the intermediate and
subcanopy classes.<br><br>

<p class="subframeContent">Primary factors associated with mortality in both
watersheds during the prefire period and on the Log Creek watershed in general,
were dwarf mistletoe, fir canker, fir engravers and stem/root failure that
caused crushing by another tree. The postfire mortality in the Tharp's Creek
watershed was most directly related to fire-caused crown scorch. There is no
indication of a relationship between pre-existing disease or insect conditions
and fire-induced mortality, since similar percentages of trees that survived the
fire had dwarf mistletoe, and fire engravers associated with them. Fine root
mortality may have also played a role in the death of trees several years after
the fire, since the 97% reduction of litter and duff indicates a particularly
severe fire that would have likely caused substantial fine root mortality.
During the prefire period, the Lower Tharp's stand had a slight decline in total
basal area due primarily to the death of numerous codominant and intermediate
white fir trees, while the Upper Tharp's stand had an increase in basal area
during this period. Both stands had a large decline in basal area after the
burning due primarily to fire-related mortality. The most important change in
size structure in the Log Creek watershed was in the smallest size classes. In
the Tharp's Creek stands, there was a dramatic change in the size structure
during the postfire period with a decline in mean number of trees/ha in most
sized classes, including 75% of the trees <u>&lt;</u> 50 cm dbh killed, and
25% of trees larger than 50 cm dbh killed. The different tree species present
died in proportion to their frequency in the watershed. A large number of
seedlings had established after the burn on Tharp's Creek and had more rapid
height growth relative to seedlings in the Log watershed.

FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Suppression and higher incidence of insects and disease in higher density stands
are cited as primary reasons for mortality in unburned stands. In this study, a
drought during the 1987-1992 time period is thought to have contributed to the
stress that led to mortality in the larger size classes in the Log Creek
watershed. In white fir, the probability of mortality increased with
percentage of crown scorch, and decreased with dbh. This type of information can
help improve the ability of mangers to predict tree morality from prescribed
burning and to plan burning conditions to meet specific mortality objectives.
Differences in mortality between the Upper Tharp's stand and the Lower Tharp's
stand are thought to be due to differences in fire severity between the two
stands, with the more severe fire causing higher rates of initial mortality in
the larger size classes. The large reductions in tee densities and basal areas
in the Tharp's watershed will provide more opportunities for successful
establishment of less shade-tolerant species and will help reduce fuel inputs,
presumably reducing the hazard of uncontrollable wildfire in the future.
However, future burns will likely be necessary to maintain reduced tree
densities and low fuel accumulation rates. Mortality is expected to continue to
decline over the next several years until they reach near pre-burn levels. It is
also expected that the large number of seedlings that established after the burn
will result in substantial amounts of ingrowth within the next 10 years.
