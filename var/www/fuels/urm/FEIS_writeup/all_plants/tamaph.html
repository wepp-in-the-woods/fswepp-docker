<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Tamarix aphylla
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Athel tamarisk wood is used for fuel.  It produces a fragrant odor when
burned [<a href="#16">16</a>].  The wood is fine grained, light colored, and capable of
taking a high polish.  It has been proposed for use in making furniture
and fenceposts [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Tamarix spp. communities in general are less valuable to wildlife than
are native riparian plant communities [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Tamarix spp. are relatively unpalatable to most classes of livestock and
wildlife [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Athel tamarisk foliage contains phenolic acids which may
prevent herbivory [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Athel tamarisk is planted for windbreaks and shade [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  It is
frequently planted in desert areas [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Cuttings root best in
moist, loose, low salinity soil [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Athel tamarisk is planted as an ornamental from California to Texas [<a href="#2">2</a>].
Tamarix spp. flowers provide an important source of pollen for the
European honeybee [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Unlike the deciduous Tamarix spp., which have become serious weed
species in the Southwest, Athel tamrisk seldom escapes cultivation
and, therefore, rarely becomes a problem [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Where it is unwanted, Athel tamairsk can be controlled by cutting stumps
and applying the herbicide Kuron or mechanically excavating stumps
followed by direct treatment of roots with herbicide [<a href="#33">33</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Tamarix aphylla
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Athel tamarisk is a introduced, fast-growing, evergreen tree.  It has a
rounded or irregular, spreading crown of many heavy, stout branches and
long, drooping twigs [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  It attains a height of 33 to 60 feet
(10-18 m) and may attain a diameter of 2.5 feet (0.8 m).  The leaves are
tiny scales 0.06 inch (1.5 mm) long.  The twigs are wiry, very slender,
and jointed.  The bark becomes thick and deeply furrowed into long
narrow ridges on the trunk and smooth on the branches [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].
Athel tamarisk has a deep taproot [<a href="#33">33</a>].




<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte (Mesophanerophyte)


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Athel tamarisk flowers and produces many seeds, but most of the seeds
are sterile [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Its main method of propagation is vegetative.  It
sprouts from the root crown or forms adventitous roots from submerged,
broken or buried stems [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Where established outside of cultivation, Athel tamarisk commonly
occurs on salt flats, springs, and other saline habitats especially
along streams and rivers [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Athel tamarisk has been found along the
saline portions of the lower Colorado and Gila rivers and in the Salton
Sea Basin [<a href="#27">27</a>].  It also grows along irrigation ditches in bottomlands
[<a href="#2">2</a>].

Athel tamarisk is a facultative phreatophyte [<a href="#33">33</a>].  It is drought
resistant and is tolerant of alkaline and saline soils [<a href="#16">16</a>].  The
minimum annual rainfall required for reasonable growth is less than 16
inches (400 mm) [<a href="#26">26</a>].  The elevational range for Athel tamarisk in
California is from below sea level to 5,000 feet (1,524 m) [<a href="#33">33</a>]; in
Texas it occurs from 1,850 to 2,000 feet (564-610 m) [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Information on the successional status of Athel tamarisk is lacking.
It sprouts from on-site surviving root crowns in initial communities
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Although it does not colonize sites by seed, it can colonize
disturbed areas by broken limbs carried by water [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Athel tamarisk generally flowers from March through August [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].
The fruit matures in late summer [<a href="#16">16</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Tamarix aphylla
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Athel tamarisk is a fire-adapted species.  The high ash (30-40%) and
salt content of its foliage make it hard to burn even when dry.  Athel
tamarisk sprouts from the root crown after fire [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Tamarix aphylla
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Athel tamarisk generally survives fire [<a href="#26">26</a>], although severe fire may
destroy the root crown and prevent sprouting.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Athel tamarisk generally sprouts from the root crown after fire
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Because of the fire-resistant qualities of Athel tamarisk foliage, it
is a good species for use in fire shelterbelts [<a href="#26">26</a>].

In very arid regions, Athel tamarisk can be killed by piling cut debris
on the stumps and burning.  This method resulted in 100 percent success
rate in killing Athel tamarisk [<a href="#4">4</a>].
