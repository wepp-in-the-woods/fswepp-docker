<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juncus balticus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Baltic rush is an important forage species for livestock and elk.  It is
used as a hay crop for cattle [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  It is important nesting, hiding,
and feeding cover for shorebirds and waterfowl [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability varies widely for Baltic rush, ranging from low to
excellent for all classes of livestock [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
In vitro dry matter digestibility for Baltic rush on North Dakota
wetland range was 57 percent in late spring and 20 percent in late
summer [<a href="#19">19</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Baltic rush has been rated as good cover for waterfowl, nongame birds,
and small mammals [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Baltic rush has been classified as an excellent streambank stabilizer
because of its thick rhizomes [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Because it increases with
grazing it provides good protection against erosion on severely
overgrazed sites [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Native Americans used Baltic rush for weaving baskets and mats [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Baltic rush increases with grazing [<a href="#12">12</a>].  However, because it is often
found in wet habitats, damage from trampling is possible [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Baltic
rush can increase in percent cover within 5 years following application
of 2,4-D ester [<a href="#1">1</a>].

30-40             2.9/.00      96.1/ .56     49.8/ 6.28


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Baltic rush occurs from sea level to subalpine zones in montane
habitats, as well as in wet areas of Southwestern deserts, in wet
meadows, along streambanks, rivers, lakes, ponds, freshwater and
brackish marshes, and sometimes in dry flats and meadows [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].  It
usually occurs on gentle slopes, and occurs on all aspects [<a href="#35">35</a>].  The
water table in Baltic rush community types ranges from 13 to 39.4 inches
(33-100 cm) below the surface [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].

Soil in Baltic rush communities are poorly drained, sandy to silty
loams, often with a thick organic layer.  Soils orders and suborders
include Mollisols, Entisols, Borolls, Cryaquolls, Haploxerolls,
Fluvaquentic Haploborolls, and aquic or calcic Cryoborolls
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].

Plant associates include other rushes (Juncus spp.), sedges (Carex
spp.), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis), saltgrass (Distichlis
stricta), needle spikesedge (Eleocharis acicularis), redtop (Agrostis
alba), timothy (Phleum pratense), tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia
cespitosa), red fescue (Festuca rubra), smartweed (Polygonum spp.),
dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), alkalai sacaton (Sporobolus airoides),
false Solomon's seal (Smilacina stellata), western aster (Aster
occidentalis), elk thistle (Cirsium scariosum), common silverweed
(Potentilla anserina) [4,12,22,24,27,].

Elevational ranges for Baltic rush have been reported as follows [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>]:

Oregon        from 4,200 to 6,100 feet (1,280-1,859 m)
Wyoming       from 6,400 to 9,700 feet (1,951-2,957 m)
Colorado      from 3,400 to 11,500 feet (1,036-3,505 m)
Montana       from 4,000 to 8,900 feet (1,219-2,713 m)
Utah          from 4,200 to 9,900 feet (1,280-3,018 m)


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Baltic rush is a perennial, native, cool-season species [<a href="#29">29</a>].  It is a
climax component of several western community types and plant
associations.  However, it is usually grazing induced and an indicator
of disturbed sites [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  In Montana pure stands of Baltic rush can
indicate disturbance or wetter phases of the Baltic rush community type
[<a href="#12">12</a>].  In overgrazed areas Baltic rush will replace Kentucky bluegrass,
tufted hairgrass, and Nebraska sedge (Carex nebraskensis) [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  On
sandy, subirrigated rangelands Baltic rush can be replaced by balsam
poplar (Populus balsamifera), quaking aspen (P. tremuloides), and willow
(Salix spp.) [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Flowering dates in some western states have been listed for Baltic rush
[<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>]:

Colorado       May - July
Montana        June - August
North Dakota   June - August
Utah           April - May
Wyoming        May - July

The variety littoralis flowers from May through September, while the
variety stenocarpus flowers from July through September [<a href="#9">9</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juncus balticus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire in wetland communities often only top-kills plants, leaving
rhizomes in moist soil unharmed [<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Baltic rush response to fire can vary.  A September prescribed fire in a
wetland meadow resulted in no significant change in ground cover of
Baltic rush 4 years following the fire [<a href="#13">13</a>].  However, following a May
prescribed fire in subirrigated rangeland dominated by Baltic rush and
Kentucky bluegrass, cover of Baltic rush increased from 35 percent to 60
percent by the fifth postfire year [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Aboveground biomass has been measured for Baltic rush at 572.8 g m-2 dry
weight in August in Ontario [<a href="#11">11</a>].  This was the highest biomass of all
salt marsh species in this community.

<center><h2>FIRE CASE STUDIES</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Juncus balticus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>CASE NAME : </b>
Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, Oregon


<b>REFERENCE : </b>
Young, R. P. 1986 [<a href="#36">36</a>]


<b>SEASON/SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION : </b>
fall burn; information on severity unavailable


<b>STUDY LOCATION : </b>
The fire was conducted on Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, 24 miles (40
km) south of Burns in southeastern Oregon.  The burn was located at
Martha Lake Field (T26S, R28E, S24 SE 1/4, & S25 NE 1/4).


<b>PREFIRE VEGETATIVE COMMUNITY : </b>
The study sites consisted of five wetland habitats dominated by
monotypic communities of emergent macrophytes.  These sites ranged from
deep-water habitats to upland wet meadows.  All dominant species were
rhizomatous and included hardstem bulrush (Scirpus acutus), American
threesquare (S. americanus), alkalai bulrush (S. maritimus), common
cattail (Typha latifolia), burreed (Sparganium eurycarpum), awned sedge
(Carex atherodes), Nebraska sedge (C. nebraskencis), Baltic rush (J. b.
var. montanus), and common spikerush (Eleocharis palustris).


<b>TARGET SPECIES PHENOLOGICAL STATE : </b>
dormant


<b>SITE DESCRIPTION : </b>
Total area of the refuge is 178,456 acres (72,219 ha) and sits within a
basin which forms the northwestern part of the Basin and Range Province
of the western United States.  Two major rivers, the Silvies and the
Blitzen, flow through the refuge.  The climate is semiarid with moderate
to cold temperatures.  Annual precipitation averages between 10 and 12
inches (25 and 30 cm), the majority of which falls in winter and spring.
Growing seasons are shortened by cool springs, dry summers, and freezing
in late August or early September.


<b>FIRE DESCRIPTION : </b>
The fire in the Baltic rush community was conducted on 20 October 1981.
Test fires were used to evaluate fire behavior before burning the main
unit.  Fires were started with drip torches on the downwind boundaries
of all plots.  Strip headfires were used after backing fires created a
wide line.  Firelines were constructed where natural breaks did not
occur.  Prefire fuels, and weather conditions at the time of the fire
were as follows:

        Prefire fuel loading:  591-1,104 gm2
        Fuel height:  29 cm
        Litter height:  12 cm
        Fuel moisture:  3.5 percent
        Temperature:  16-23 deg C
        Relative humidity:  13-17 percent
        Wind speed:  3-16 km/h

Fire behavior and effects on fuels during the prescribed fire were as
follows:
                                                   Postfire
Rate of Spread   Flame Length   Fire Intensity   resid. fuels

Backfire  1-2        1.5            276-516


<b>FIRE EFFECTS ON TARGET SPECIES : </b>
Fire effects were evaluated in terms of vegetative response, including
shoot height, density, weight, and growth rate; aboveground standing
crop; residual organic materials; and reproductive effort.  These
measurements were taken for 2 years following the fore.  Baltic rush
increased in aboveground standing crop and shoot densities.  Shoot
weights decreased, although not significantly.  Organic residues
increased the second postfire year.  All shoots of Baltic rush produced
flowers following the fire.  Shoot height and rate of height-growth
following burning and nonuse treatments for the first postfire growing
season are as follows:

                                Fall fire               Nonuse

<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS : </b>
The purpose of this study was to provide information for wetland fire
management plans.  Fire can play an important role in rejuvenating these
emergent species; however, long-term effects and effects of repeated
burning need further investigation.
