<b>ABBREVIATION : </b>
LEYINN

<b>SYNONYMS : </b>
   Elymus innovatus


<b>SCS PLANT CODE : </b>
   ELIN4


<b>COMMON NAMES : </b>
   boreal wildrye
   hairy wildrye
   hairy wild rye
   fuzzyspike wildrye
   lyme grass
   Northern wildrye


<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The 1985 treatment by Barkworth and Dewey recommends Leymus innovatus
(Beal) Pilger as the scientific name for boreal wildrye [<a href="#1">1</a>].  However,
Elymus innovatus is still commonly used in the literature.  Two
varieties that were recognized under Elymus innovatus were E. innovatus
var. innovatus and E. innovatus var. velutinus [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>LIFE FORM : </b>
Graminoid

<b>FEDERAL LEGAL STATUS : </b>
No special status

<b>OTHER STATUS : </b>
Boreal wildrye is considered rare in northwestern Montana.  It is known
to occur only along the Belly River, 3 miles south of the Canadian
border in Glacier National Park.  This is the southern edge of its range
[<a href="#27">27</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
On ranges where it is a dominant species, boreal wildrye may be grazed
extensively by Stone sheep, elk, and bison [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Overall, it is rated
as poor to fair forage for wildlife and livestock [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Boreal wildrye
was found to be an important part of the diet of feral horses in
Alberta, presumably due to its abundance rather than its palatability.
It was especially important during the winter when other species were
not available [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Morgantini and Hudson [<a href="#18">18</a>] reported that elk
consumption of boreal wildrye in Alberta rose from 1 percent to 15 to 18
percent during hunting season, as use of the surrounding aspen (Populus
tremuloides) forest increased.


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Studies analyzing the percent composition of boreal wildrye in the diets
of elk and bison indicate that it is not a very palatable species.  One
report found that, although boreal wildrye was a major component of the
vegetation and occurred at 33.3 to 81.8 percent frequency in the diet,
it made up only 0.2 to 1.1 percent composition of the diet in bison [<a href="#5">5</a>].
Similarly, another study found that while grass made up 70.6 percent of
elk diet on intermediate season ranges, boreal wildrye accounted for
only 3.6 to 7.8 percent composition in the diet [<a href="#19">19</a>].  In both cases,
boreal wildrye was abundant on the ranges.  It was eaten frequently but
only in small amounts.


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The nutritive value of boreal wildrye is rated as moderate to low.
Percent digestible protein ranged from 0.5 in the weathered stage to 5.8
in the leaf stage.  On a nutritive value index with clipped, dried
alfalfa (Medicago sativa) receiving a score of 100, boreal wildrye had a
mean score of 39.5.  Other grasses in the study rated mean scores from
16.3 to 58.3 [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
On ranges where it forms continuous stands, boreal wildrye may provide
cover for some birds and small mammals.


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Boreal wildrye was a frequent species on several abandoned coal mine
sites in Canada, indicating that it may have good potential for
revegetation at high elevations [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Rhizomatous wildrye grasses are
good soil binders [<a href="#12">12</a>].  It can provide erosion control without
inhibiting the growth of other forbs and shrubs [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Boreal wildrye is rare in Glacier National Park but apparently is not
currently threatened [<a href="#27">27</a>].  At its periphery, a species may be valuable
as an indicator of habitat changes, such as climatic shifts.  For
example, if global warming were to take place, a boreal species may
retreat north.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Leymus innovatus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Boreal wildrye is a perennial, native, cool-season grass.  It is
rhizomatous but tends to form clumps.  It is slightly pubescent below
the nodes and inflorescence.  The culms are mostly 16 to 32 inches
(40-80 cm) tall [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Boreal wildrye will reproduce either sexually or asexually via rhizomes.
La Roi and Hnatiuk [<a href="#15">15</a>] report that it reproduces asexually in low
light.  Pollination and seed dispersal may aided by wind and gravity, as
well as by some animals.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Boreal wildrye grows in sandy meadows, along streambanks, on rocky
hillsides, and commonly in open lodgepole pine or spruce (Picea spp.)
forests.  It grows in soils that have been described as dry to moist,
fresh (slightly moist) to moderately moist, droughty, and rapidly to
well drained [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  It has commonly been reported from upper montane
mesic to submesic sites [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  It has been reported at the following
elevations:

State   elev. (ft)              elev. (m)               reference

AK      540 - 1,440             180 - 480               [<a href="#5">5</a>]
BC      3,000 - 5,040           1000 - 1680             [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>]
AB      3,750 - 5,700           1250 - 1900             [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>]
MT      4,140 - 4,600           1380 - 1530             [<a href="#9">9</a>]

Boreal wildrye is most commonly found in lodgepole pine forests.  Other
common associates include russet buffaloberry (Shepherdia canadensis),
bluejoint reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis), rough fescue (Festuca
scabrella), jack pine (Pinus banksia), and white spruce (Picea glauca).
It is frequently competitive with bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi)
and longtube twinflower (Linnaea borealis) [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Boreal wildrye is a midseral species, since it is more likely to be
growing in areas that have been previously burned or disturbed than
areas that have not [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  It is often found on previously burned
sites [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>] and has been reported on sites 4 to 100 years after a
fire [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Boreal wildrye begins to green in March and April in Alberta [<a href="#28">28</a>].  It
flowers in June and July [<a href="#12">12</a>] and has been reported to remain in flower
until early September in Montana [<a href="#27">27</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Leymus innovatus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Boreal wildrye has underground rhizomes, which may survive fire.  It may
sprout from these rhizomes, taking advantage of sites that have been
opened by the fire [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil
   Tussock graminoid

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Leymus innovatus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
The entire aboveground portion of boreal wildrye is consumed in most
fires.  Belowground rhizomes may escape harm, especially during
fast-spreading fires in light surface fuels where little heat is
projected downward into the soil.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Boreal wildrye reproduces asexually following a fire by sprouting from
its rhizomes.  It is reportedly common in postfire stands ranging from 4
to 100 years [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Apparently, it is able to spread by rhizomes
following a fire and ramain dominant for a long time.  In one case
boreal wildrye made up 48 percent of the understory composition in a
burned subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) forest.  It made up only 10
percent composition in an unburned subalpine clearing [<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Boreal wildrye populations do not seem to be seriously injured by fire.
In fact, fire is probably beneficial to the species.  However, increases
of boreal wildrye may not be desirable as this grass is not very
palatable or nutritious for wildlife and livestock [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].
