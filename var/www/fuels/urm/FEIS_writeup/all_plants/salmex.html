<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salazaria mexicana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bladdersage is a native, perennial, rhizomatous, rounded to straggly,
intricately branched shrub 1 to 3.5 feet (0.3-1 m) tall [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].
It is usually sparsely leaved [<a href="#23">23</a>].  The mature plants form a dense
tangled clump of intertwined living and dead stems [<a href="#4">4</a>].  The branches
are spine tipped with papery bladders scattered over the surface [<a href="#15">15</a>].
The leaves are 0.3 inch (8 mm) wide and 0.2 to 1 inch (5-25 mm) long,
thickish, and leathery [<a href="#23">23</a>].  The flowers are in loose racemes 2 to 4
inches (5-10 cm) long [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  The calyx is pouch shaped and
about 0.37 inch (0.95 cm) long.  At maturity it is bladdery and inflated
(0.5 to 0.75 inch [1.3-1.9 cm] in diameter), enclosing four nutlets
[<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Bladdersage reproduces by seed.  The flowers are animal pollinated and
the seeds are dispersed by wind [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Seeds are highly viable during
the first year after they are produced, but viability decreases by 1.5
years.  The percent germination of bladdersage seeds collected in summer
and late fall of 1973 was as follows [<a href="#22">22</a>]:

                              storage conditions
date observed        warehouse    -15 deg C  4 deg C   room temp.
December 1973            84         N/A         N/A      N/A    
January 1975             92         83          94       91
May 1975                 33         44          44       43


Bladdersage also reproduces by sprouting from rhizomes [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Comstock
and others [<a href="#4">4</a>] described the growth of bladdersage on a Mojave Desert
study site as follows:  Shoots originated from underground rhizomes and
reached a height of 1.6 to 3.3 feet (0.5-1.0 m) in the first year.  For
the next 2 to 5 years whorls of short side branches originated
repeatedly from the uppermost nodes forming short floral shoots and ever
more tangled whorls of old twigs.  Twig lifespans were variable.  Shoots
originating from rhizomes lasted 3 to 5 years and the short floral
side branches often died back during their first drought [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Bladdersage is commonly found on sandy, gravelly, or clayey soils in dry
washes and canyons, on desert hillsides and mesas, and along arroyos
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  It grows best on sunny sites [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Bladdersage commonly
occurs at the following elevations:

Arizona - below 3,000 feet (914 m) [<a href="#11">11</a>] 
California - below 5,000 feet (1,524 m)[<a href="#17">17</a>]
Trans-Pecos Texas - 2,200 to 3,100 feet (670-944 m) [<a href="#20">20</a>]
Utah - 3,083 to 4,593 feet (940-1,400 m) [<a href="#31">31</a>]


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Bladdersage can apparently be found in most stages of succession.  Wells
[<a href="#30">30</a>] described it as a pioneer shrub typically found in disturbed areas.
Bladdersage density was 81 plants per acre (202 plants/ha) and frequency
was 20 percent on a 33-year-old abandoned street system of a Nevada
ghost town [<a href="#30">30</a>].  In the Mojave Desert bladdersage is a long-lived shrub
present in later stages of desert succession [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  According to
Vasek and Barbour [<a href="#27">27</a>] bladdersage prefers undisturbed sites and usually
decreases in relative abundance with soil disturbance.  On a sandy
bajada in California, bladdersage was present in an old, stable
creosotebush scrub community [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Bladdersage generally flowers from March through June [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Its
leaves are drought deciduous [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Salazaria mexicana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Regeneration of bladdersage after fire is not described in literature
currently available.  Because of its sprouting ability, it probably can
regenerate from underground rhizomes if top-killed by fire.  Bladdersage
probably also colonizes burned areas via wind-dispersed seeds.

Fire frequency in the communities where bladdersage occurs depends on
productivity and continuity of fuels.  In creosotebush scrub
communities, fires generally occur in those occasional years when
exceptionally heavy winter rains have produced abnormally high number of
annuals [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Fires are also rare in blackbrush communities; however,
these communities have been known to burn under conditons of high
temperature, high wind velocity, and low relative humidity [<a href="#10">10</a>].
Pinyon-juniper communities historically burned every 10 to 30 years
[<a href="#32">32</a>].  Fires in mountainous areas of the Mojave Desert where bladdersage
occurs usually cover limited areas but may be highly destructive to the
woody tissues of bladdersage plants.  These mountain burns are very
susceptible to erosion and revegetate slowly [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Where livestock
grazing has reduced grass cover and accelerated erosion, fire frequency
has decreased [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Information was not available regarding the immediate effects of fire on
bladdersage.  However, bladdersage is probably top-killed or killed by
fire.  Severe fires may kill belowground rhizomes.
