The scientific name for the sheoak genus is Casuarina (Casuarinaceae) [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  
Three species of sheoak are common in the United States.  All will be treated 
in this report because of their similar status as invader species and 
across-the-board management plans to eradicate the genus from the continent.  
These species are [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>]:

Casuarina cunninghamiana Miq. river sheoak
Casuarina equisetifolia L.  Australian-pine
Casuarina glauca Seiber  gray sheoak

These species hybridize with each other [<a href="#14">14</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Casuarina spp.
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Sheoak wood has many uses, including fuelwood, poles, posts,
beams, oxcart tongues, shingles, paneling, fence rails, furniture,
marine pilings, tool handles, and cabinets [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  The wood, however,
is subject to cracking and splitting [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Sheoak poses a serious threat to some wildlife species.  Nest
sites of three endangered species, the American crocodile (Crocodylus
acutus), the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta ssp. caretta), and the
gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus), are all threatened by Australian
pine invasion [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].  Also, this invader creates sterile foraging and
breeding environments for small mammals [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  It does, however,
provide food for migrating goldfinches which feed on sheoak
seeds [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Tannins in the leaves of sheoak are carcinogenic and could be
fatal to foraging cattle, which sometimes eat the leaves [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Sheoak was once used in the United States for reclaiming eroded
areas, but many land managers condemn its use because it threatens
indigenous plants and animals [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Some African and Asian countries
use it to combat desertification [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Sheoak has various medicinal uses and is also used for dyes, as
an ornamental, and in windbreaks [<a href="#12">12</a>].  C. cunninghamiana (the most
cold-hardy) can be planted in citrus groves to protect fruit trees from
cold [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Sheoak is extremely fast growing, crowding out many native
plants and creating sterile environments for both plants and animals
[<a href="#10">10</a>].  It forms dense roots, which deplete soil moisture and break water
and sewer lines.  It is also susceptible to windthrow during hurricanes
[<a href="#3">3</a>].  Cutting often induces sprouting, so it is not an effective control
method.  Chemicals, such as 2,4,5-T, 2,4-D, or Garlon 3A, can be used to
eradicate sheoak [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Casuarina spp.
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sheoak is a medium to tall evergreen tree.  It has a stout
trunk with rough bark and erect or semispreading main branches and
drooping twigs [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Its leaves are jointed and scalelike.  Its fruits
are round and warty with winged seeds.  Trees can be dioecious or
monoecious; male flowers are borne at the tips of twigs, while female
flowers form on nonshedding branches [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  Sheoak fixes
nitrogen with the aid of Frankia spp. fungi.

Characteristics of individual species are as follows:

C. cunninghamiana - 80 feet (25 m) in height, 2 feet (6 m) d.b.h.,
                    dioecious, nonsprouter.
C. equisetifolia - 50 to 100 feet (15-30 m) in height, 1.0 to 1.5 feet
                   (3-5 m) d.b.h., monoecious, nonsprouter.
C. glauca - 40 to 50 feet (10-15 m) in height, 1.5 feet (5 m) d.b.h.,
            dioecious, agressive sprouter, in Florida, usually does not
            produce fruit [<a href="#12">12</a>].  


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sheoak regenerates by seed as well as vegetatively through
sprouting [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  It is fast growing (5 to 10 feet [1.5-3 m] per
year) [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Seeds average 300,000 per pound.  No pregermination
treatment is necessary.  Seeds can remain fertile for a few months to a
year and will germinate in moist and porous soil, sometimes within 4 to
8 days of dispersal [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Because of its nitrogen-fixing capability, sheoak can colonize
nutrient-poor soils [<a href="#12">12</a>].  It can grow in sloughs, sawgrass (Cladium
jamaicensis) glades, wet prairies, saltmarshes, pinelands, along rocky
coasts, on sandbars, dunes, and islands, and in water-logged clay or
brackish tidal areas [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  C. equisetifolia is found only in
south Florida because of its cold intolerance.  It is resistant to salt
spray but not to prolonged flooding.  C. cunninghaminana grows along
freshwater streambanks and is not salt tolerant [<a href="#3">3</a>].  It is more
resistant to cold temperatures than C. equisetifolia [<a href="#12">12</a>].  C. glauca
grows on steep slopes as well as in intermittently flooded or poorly
drained sites.  It is salt tolerant [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Some associates of sheoak include eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.),
melaleuca (Melaleuca quinquenervia), lovegrass (Eragrostis spp.), muhly
grasses (Huhlenbergia spp.), beard grasses (Andropogon spp.), plume
grass (Erianthus giganteus), saltbush (Baccharis halimifolia), wax
myrtle (Myrica cerifera), willow (Salix spp.), sweetbay (Magnolia
virginiana), redbay (Persia borbonia), and coco plum (Chrysobalanus
icaco) [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Native associates in the Northern Mariana Islands include
Neisosperma, Barringtonia, Terminalia, Heritiera, Cynometia, and Cordia
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Sheoak is listed as a dominant species in some South Pacific
island's vegetation types [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>].  It is a warm weather species, not
native to North America.  It can be a primary or secondary colonizer in
disturbed areas of Florida [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Sheoak can flower and fruit year-round in warm climates [<a href="#3">3</a>].
Its peak flowering time is between April and June, and its peak fruiting
time is between September and December.  The minimum seed-bearing age is
4 to 5 years, and it produces a good seed crop annually.  C.
equisetifolia usually flowers and fruits two times a year:  between
February and April, and September and October.  It produces fruit in
June and December.  The fastest growth occurs in the first 7 years with
maximum growth reached in 20 years.  The maximum lifespan of Australian
pine is 40 to 50 years [<a href="#3">3</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Sheoak less than 3 inches (8 cm) in diameter can sucker
following fire [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex
   off-site colonizer;seed carried by wind; postfire years 1 and 2
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by animals or water; postfire yr 1&2

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Casuarina spp.
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Trees greater than 3 inches (8 cm) in diameter are killed by fire [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
A May wildfire killed 60 to 70 percent of sheoak in Florida [<a href="#10">10</a>].  A 
smoldering controlled burn in Florida killed 90 percent of the sheoaks 
on the study plot [<a href="#14">14</a>].  A second attempt in the same area killed 
all the sheoaks; trunk diameters were between 5 and 8 inches (13-20 cm). 
Another tree, with a d.b.h. of 2 feet (0.66 m), was killed after 
charcoal was left to smolder at its base [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>


Trees less than 3 inches (8 cm) in diameter may sprout following fire.
Trees larger than this usually die [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Periodic fires coupled with the use of herbicides may be an effective
method of controlling sheoak.  However, too frequent, intense
fires that kill overstory native pines may actually encourage Casuarina
species to establish [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Morton [<a href="#14">14</a>] warns that burning Australian
pine in peat soils may be hazardous.  Elfer [<a href="#3">3</a>] suggests that fire may
be an effective control method for trees greater than 3 inches (8 cm) in
diameter and in dense stands.  Burning could be potentially harmful if
the soil pH is changed such that native species cannot establish [<a href="#3">3</a>].
