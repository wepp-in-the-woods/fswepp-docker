<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
American plum is utilized for wildlife habitat and soil stabilization
projects in the West [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Plummer and others [<a href="#24">24</a>] recommend it for use
on wet meadow and mountain brush sites in Utah.  Although seed dormancy
is a problem in almost all species of Prunus, American plum germinates
more consistently following cool, moist stratification at 36 to 41
degrees F (2.2-5 deg C) for 90 to 150 days [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Vories [<a href="#32">32</a>] reported
that stratified seed should be planted 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) deep in
the spring or fall; for nursery culture, seeds should be sown at the
rate of four seeds per square foot.  Seed viability is estimated to be
approximately 5 years [<a href="#10">10</a>].  This species can also be successfully
propagated via stem cuttings.


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
American plum is a commonly cultivated fruit plant thoughout its range.
Fruits are used in making pies, jams, jellies, and desert sauces [<a href="#34">34</a>].
A number of horticultural varieties have been derived from this native
plum.  Rootstocks are utilized for the propagation of plums in northern
climates [<a href="#10">10</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Prunus americana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
American plum is a native, deciduous, sometimes thicket-forming, erect
shrub or small tree.  The growth habit of this species can vary
considerably; plants range from shrubs approximately 3 feet (1 m) in
height to arborescent individuals growing up to 32.8 feet (10 m) [<a href="#12">12</a>].
On the Great Plains this species typically grows from 9.8 to 26.2 feet
(3 to 8 m) tall and is rarely treelike [<a href="#9">9</a>].  In Utah, American plum
forms thickets reaching heights of up to 16.4 feet (5 m), and treelike
individuals are uncommon [<a href="#34">34</a>].  The leaves are somewhat stout with
pubescent, usually glandless petioles; twigs often become somewhat
spinelike at the tips.  White flowers usually appear before the leaves
and are borne in fasicles of two to five on the tip of spur branchlets
or from axillary buds formed the previous season.  Fruits are yellow to
red plums (drupes), at least 0.8 inch (2 cm) long with yellow flesh and
a compressed stone.  Although this species sometimes produces small,
hard plums, the fruits are generally fleshy and highly palatable.
Occassionally trees cultivated for plums escape and persist.
Horticultural varieties can be distinguished from the native species by
their larger petals, smaller flower clusters (one to three per node),
and sometimes by the gland-tipped teeth of the leaves.


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
American plum regenerates sexually and vegetatively.  Although
regenerative strategies have not been widely documented, vegetative
expansion via rhizome initiation is apparently the primary mode of
regeneration.  This shrub typically forms thickets and colonies in the
western portion of its distribution [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].

The fruit of American plum is a yellow to red drupe containing a
compressed stone.  Seeds are approximately 0.6 to 0.7 inch (1.5 to 1.8
cm) long and 0.4 to 0.5 inch (1 to 1.2 cm) wide.  As with all species
within the Prunus genus, seed dormancy is a problem.  In order to
overcome dormancy, seeds must be exposed to an afterripening period in
the presence of oxygen and moisture [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Germination is usually
enhanced following cool, moist stratification for 90 to 150 days at 50
degrees F (10 degrees C); germinative capacity is approximately 60
percent following stratification at 50 degrees F (10 degrees C) for 60
days.  Germination requirements appear to vary geographically.  American
plum seed from northern Minnesota germinated much better at 50 degrees F
(10 degrees C) than at higher temperatures; whereas optimal germinating
temperatures for seeds from Nebraska are from 70 to 80 degrees F (21.1
to 26.6 degrees C) [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Seedbed characteristics are virtually
unstudied in this species.  Although the majority of seeds are presumed
to be deposited beneath the parent plant, frugivorous mammals probably
function as long-distance dispersal vectors.  Rogers and Applegate [<a href="#26">26</a>]
speculated that black bears are one of only a few disperal agents for
large-seeded species such as American plum.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
In the western portion of its range, American plum is locally
distributed on moist to dry sites ranging from the plains to lower
elevations in the mountains [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Although commonly associated with
riparian areas, this species also occupies open to wooded locations such
as prairie ravines, pastures, roadsides, fencerows, ditchbanks, and
natural drainage patterns [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Soils on most sites consist of sandy to
rich loams, but plants are also somewhat tolerant of saline soils in the
West [<a href="#4">4</a>].

 Elevational ranges for several western states is as follows [<a href="#4">4</a>]:

	from 4,600 to 7,500 ft (1,402 to 2,287 m) in UT
             3,500 to 6,000 ft (1,067 to 1,829 m) in CO
             3,500 to 4,500 ft (1,067 to 1,372 m) in WY


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
American plum typically blooms from April to May in the Pacific
Northwest [<a href="#12">12</a>] and on the Great Plains [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Flowers characteristically
appear before the leaves and are borne in fasicles of two to five on the
tip of spur branchlets or from axillary buds formed the previous season.
Seed matures from September and October in Utah [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Flowering data from some western states are presented below [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>]:

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Prunus americana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Presumably this native plum is somewhat resistant to fire due to its
tendency to spread through underground stems [<a href="#34">34</a>].  To a lesser degree,
postburn regeneration probably also involves the germination of off-site
seed dispersed by mammals.  Two other Prunus species indigenous to the
western United States, chokecherry (Prunus virginiana) and bittercherry
(Prunus emarginata), are well adapted to disturbance by fire
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  Although readily top-killed, these shrubs resprout
vigorously from surviving buds located on rhizomes and root crowns in
chokecherry [<a href="#11">11</a>] and from root crowns in bittercherry [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Postfire
recovery in both species is relatively rapid following burning [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].
Apparently buried seed banks can be a significant mode of postfire
regeneration for bittercherry and perhaps chokecherry on moist,
coniferous forest sites in northern Idaho [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  The degree to which
seedbanks contribute to the postburn regeneration of these species in
more xeric habitats such as dry conifer forests and mountain brush
communities is presently unknown.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tree with adventitious-bud root crown/soboliferous species root sucker
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Prunus americana
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
This species is presumed to be somewhat resistant to fire mortality due
to its ability to spread from underground rootstocks [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
The Prunus genus is generally resistant to fire mortality [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Season
of burning and burn frequency appear to have a significant effect upon
the ability of both chokecherry (Prunus virginiana) and bittercherry
(Prunus emarginata) to survive burning.


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Postburn plant response in American plum has not been widely documented.
However, a similar species of native plum, chickasaw plum (Prunus
angustifolia), recovers quite rapidly on grassland sites in Texas [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Ubiquitous seedling establishment following disturbance by fire has been
documented in a number of Prunus species which typically occur as seral
shrubs in forested communities.  These include pin cherry (Prunus
pensylvanica) [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>], black cherry (Prunus serotina) [<a href="#2">2</a>], and
bittercherry [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].
