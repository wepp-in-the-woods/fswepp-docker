<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Torrey wolfberry is characteristic of mesquite (Prosopis
glandulosa)-fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens) vegetation in the
Chihuahuan Desert on deep, fine alluvium near shallow arroyos and on
alluvial fans and bajadas.  Other associated species include
creosotebush (Larrea tridentata), tarbush (Flourensia cernua), prickly
pear and cholla (Opuntia spp.), and agave (Agave scabra).  Torrey
wolfberry is also found in alkali sacaton (Sporobolus airoides)
grasslands in deep, calcareous alluvial deposits near arroyos and in
intermontane habitats along the margins of mesquite communities [<a href="#8">8</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Specific information regarding the use of Torrey wolfberry by livestock
or wildlife is not available in the literature.  Wolfberry (Lycium spp.)
foliage is sometimes browsed by livestock [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Torrey wolfberry
fruits are probably consumed by birds and rodents, as are those of other
wolfberry species [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Dense thickets of Torrey wolfberry presumably provide cover for birds
and small mammals.


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Specific information regarding the use of Torrey wolfberry for
rehabilitating disturbed sites is not available in the literature.
Wolfberry species, however, have been used to rehabilitate abandoned
farmland in Sonoran Desert lowlands and on disturbed sites near Red
Rock, Arizona.  The sites were restored by establishing berms on the
contour and then seeding with wolfberry and other desert shrubs [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Historically, Native Americans have eaten wolfberry berries and have
used the plant for a wide variety of medicinal purposes [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lycium torreyi
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Torrey wolfberry is a spiny to spineless shrub up to 10 feet (3 m) tall
with many spreading branches.  The axillary flowers are funnel-shaped
and are borne in small fascicles.  The fruit is a red, juicy berry with
8 to 30 seeds [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Torrey wolfberry sheds its leaves and
becomes dormant during drought but quickly refoliates when conditions
become more favorable [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Torrey wolfberry often forms dense thickets
[<a href="#19">19</a>].

The roots of wolfberry species are tough and fibrous.  Root systems are
relatively extensive in comparison with the aerial portions, often
extending 25 to 30 feet (7.5-9.0 m) from the plant [<a href="#25">25</a>].



<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Although no specific information is available on Torrey wolfberry
reproduction, it probably regenerates from cuttings, root suckering, and
layering, as do other wolfberry species.  Like other wolfberries, Torrey
wolfberry may sprout from the base when damaged [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Torrey wolfberry seeds are probably dispersed by birds and other
animals, as are seeds of other wolfberries [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Good seed crops are produced by wolfberry species almost every year.
After extraction, seeds should be dried and stored in sealed containers
at 41 degrees Fahrenheit (5 deg C), or stratified in moist sand.
Stratified seeds of some wolfberry species maintain good viability for 6
months.  Dormancy in wolfberry seeds is variable.  Some wolfberry seeds
germinate well without pretreatment, while germination of others is
improved by stratification.  Seeds can be sown in the fall as soon as
the fruits ripen or stratified seed can be sown in the spring and
covered lightly with about 0.25 inch (0.64 cm) of soil.  Two-year-old
seedlings may be outplanted [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Torrey wolfberry is found in washes and arroyos, along streams and
rivers, and on flats [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  It commonly grows in silty, sandy,
or alluvial soils [<a href="#19">19</a>], and often occupies saline or alkaline sites
[<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Torrey wolfberry is generally found below 3,000 feet (900 m)
elevation in Arizona and Texas [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>], below 2,000 feet (600 m)
elevation in California [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>], and at elevations of 2,500 to 3,800 feet
(760-1,160 m) in Utah [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Torrey wolfberry usually flowers from March or April to June
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Flowers may also be produced after fall rains [<a href="#19">19</a>].
Fruits are available from June to September [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lycium torreyi
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Many perennial desert shrubs are not well adapted to fire [<a href="#4">4</a>], but some
may exhibit fire adaptive traits [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Generally, these traits are only
weakly developed [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Because most wolfberries sprout from the root crown after damage, and
Torrey wolfberry probably sprouts after fire [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  However, it may
take many years for desert shrubs to regain their former densities on
burned sites [<a href="#21">21</a>].  The sprouting ability of pale wolfberry is most
likely dependent on fire severity.  Dense clumps of brush containing
Torrey wolfberry may be somewhat impervious to fire, as are clumps
containing Berlandier wolfberry (L. berlandieri) [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Wolfberry species seedling establishment was noted after a fire at a
Sonoran Desert site.  The seeds may have survived the fire in the soil
or on burned plants, or may have been dispersed from adjacent unburned
areas [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tall shrub, adventitious-bud root crown

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lycium torreyi
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Severe fires may kill Torrey wolfberry, but low- to moderate-severity
fires probably only consume its aerial portions.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Specific information on the response of Torrey wolfberry to fire is not
available in the literature.  In general, wolfberry species sprouted
rapidly after controlled June fires in Sonoran Desert scrub vegetation
near Phoenix, Arizona.  The well developed wolfberry root systems
escaped damage from the fire, allowing them to capitalize on increased
water and nitrogen availablity in the postfire environment.  Wolfberries
had established their former density and cover by 35 months after the
fire.  Wolfberry plants had similiar responses in both open shrub and
tree microhabitats [<a href="#16">16</a>].

Wolfberry species sprouted and seedlings established within 3 years
following a June wildfire in a Sonoran Desert scrub community near
Phoenix, Arizona.  No information was given on fire severity or
intensity [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Berlandier wolfberry was reduced by prescribed fires in southern Texas
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>], but the effects were short-lived and canopy diameter had
recovered to prefire levels by the end of the first growing season
following the fire [<a href="#7">7</a>].



<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fires are not prevalent in many desert communities due to wide spacing
between shrubs and sparse ground cover [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].  Unusually heavy winter
rains, however, may produce a cover of annual species dense enough to
carry a fire when cured [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Many perennial desert shrubs are poorly
adapted to fire [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Wolfberries in particular may be susceptible to
repeated burning [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Postfire colonization by desert shrubs is very
slow initially and may take hundreds of years [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Rogers and Steele
[<a href="#21">21</a>] suggested a conservative approach when using fire to manage desert
regions.
