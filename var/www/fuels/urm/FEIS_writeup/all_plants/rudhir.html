<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Black-eyed Susan is found throughout most of North America, particularly
east of the Rocky Mountains [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  It has been sporadically introduced
into the Pacific Northwest [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Black-eyed Susan has also been
introduced in Europe as an ornamental and can now be found growing wild
in seminatural stands [<a href="#57">57</a>].

Rudbeckia hirta var. hirta occurs from Pennsylvania to Georgia and
sparingly north to Maine and west to Illinois [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Rudbeckia hirta
var. angustifolia is in the South [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Rudbeckia hirta var. brittonii
is found in the southeastern United States [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  Rudbeckia hirta
var. floridana is found in central Florida [<a href="#61">61</a>].  Rudbeckia hirta var.
pulcherrima is widespread, especially in disturbed habitats [<a href="#26">26</a>].

<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
In the western Cross Timbers of northern Texas in 1944, black-eyed Susan
was lightly grazed by cattle during the last half of April, heavily
grazed during May, and lightly grazed during the first half of June.  It
was not grazed at any other time [<a href="#20">20</a>].

In southeastern Minnesota white-tailed deer grazed black-eyed Susan
plants which had been transplanted as seedlings into test plots in the
spring of 1983.  Thirty-six percent of black-eyed Susan plants were
grazed in 1983, and 8 percent in 1984.  No plant was grazed more than
once.  Eastern cottontails and thirteen-lined ground squirrels were
observed in the study area, but they did not make use of black-eyed
Susan [<a href="#21">21</a>].

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Black-eyed Susan is recommended for restoration of disturbed areas and
prairies [<a href="#51">51</a>].

Black-eyed Susan seeds are available for restoration and conservation
efforts from the USDA Soil Conservation Service Plant Materials Center
at Corning, New York [<a href="#58">58</a>].

Roadside sites: Black-eyed Susan seeds or plants were used along
highways in Wisconsin as part of a natural tallgrass prairie roadside
restoration project.  Black-eyed Susan gave excellent response to all
attempted propagation methods:  direct seeding on the field site;
transplanting seedlings; and tranplanting year-old plants [<a href="#46">46</a>].

Black-eyed Susan, along with other native wildflowers, was used in
Massachusetts to restore a roadside site that had shallow, infertile
soil, poor moisture retention, and hostile exposure.  After 4 years,
black-eyed Susan was one of few survivors at the site [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Black-eyed Susan was used in the rehabilitation of a sand and gravel
borrow-pit in Greene County, Ohio in 1986 and 1987.  Black-eyed Susan
was inconspicuous and aboveground growth was slow the first summer, but
during the second year (1987) it flowered.  On the drier, less fertile
sites black-eyed Susan flowered in 1988, even though it was still quite
small [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Mine sites:  Black-eyed Susan, along with other native prairie forbs and
grasses, was planted on iron mine tailings in west-central Wisconsin.
The tailings are sandy loam in texture, lack essential nutrients, are
very low in organic matter, and have an average pH of 8.5.  Seed was
broadcast by hand, raked in, and mulched.  No artificial watering or
weeding was done.  Of the black-eyed Susan seeds planted, 6.8 percent
produced seedlings.  Growth was slow, but by the second growing season,
many of the plants were flowering.  Black-eyed Susan showed very little
response to any fertilizer treatment [<a href="#32">32</a>]. 

Prairie sites: Black-eyed Susan was used as a cover crop to protect
other forb and grass seedlings in a north-central Illinois oldfield
prairie restoration project [<a href="#8">8</a>].

Black-eyed Susan was used in a seeding effort on open upland and drier
southwest-facing slopes around groves and draws of hickories (Carya
spp.) and oaks (Quercus spp.) in degraded tallgrass savanna in northwest
Illinois.  In October and November of 1988, seeds were hand broadcast.
By fall, 1991, there were seedlings and mature black-eyed Susan plants
[<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Black-eyed Susan is used as a garden ornamental [<a href="#51">51</a>].

The leaves of black-eyed Susan are used to make a tea that is said to be
a diuretic, with some cardiac stimulation properties [<a href="#45">45</a>].

The Forest Potawatomis treated colds with a tea prepared from the roots
of black-eyed Susan [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Black-eyed Susan may be an indicator of range condition.  In the western
Cross Timbers of northern Texas on fine sandy loam soil, black-eyed
Susan was not present on range in excellent and good condition, had
coverage of 2 percent on range in fair condition, and had coverage of 4
percent on range in poor condition [<a href="#20">20</a>].  The Missouri grass glades were
overgrazed from the late 1800's until the 1960's.  By the 1930's on
overgrazed open range the composition of the once productive prairie
glades had changed to a community of soft chess (Bromus mollis) and
black-eyed Susan [<a href="#42">42</a>].

Tallgrass prairie in north-central Oklahoma was subjected to
short-duration grazing schedules from 1985 to 1988.  Black-eyed Susan
did not respond to different grazing schedules, but did fluctuate in
numbers in response to environmental conditions influencing its
establishment [<a href="#25">25</a>].

Black-eyed Susan was grazed by white-tailed deer in southeastern
Minnesota in 1983 and 1984.  The grazing did not significantly affect
seedling survival in wet years.  However, under drought conditions
grazed plants might not be able to resume growth sufficiently to survive
winter or compete successfully with annuals the following spring [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Herbivory may decrease seed yield from black-eyed Susan.  Black-eyed
Susan plants in a pasture in southern Oklahoma were infested with the
silvery checkerspot butterfly (Nymphalidae) caterpillar during the
summer of 1981.  Heads from infested plants produced 50 percent fewer
seeds than did heads from uninfested plants.  Dispersion of black-eyed
Susan plants may decrease infestation because of the limited distances
the caterpillars can travel [<a href="#47">47</a>].

Fertilization of black-eyed Susan is probably not effective [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].

Black-eyed Susan may be extremely sensitive to ozone exposure.  More
than 50 percent of black-eyed Susan plants showed foliage injury in
response to the ambiant ozone levels which occurred in the Great Smoky
Mountains in 1989.  With ozone exposure twice ambient level, injury was
greater than 90 percent [<a href="#30">30</a>].

Black-eyed Susan may be a good indicator species for soil cadmium.  In
northwestern Indiana urban-industrial regions the soil is contaminated
with cadmium and other heavy metals.  Black-eyed Susan seed germination
was reduced in proportion to additions of soil cadmium [<a href="#62">62</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rudbeckia hirta
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Black-eyed Susan is a native, warm-season, annual, biennial or
short-lived perennial forb [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  It has one to a few stems [<a href="#4">4</a>] 12 to
40 inches (0.3-1.0 m) tall [<a href="#26">26</a>], which are erect and sometimes sparingly
branched [<a href="#33">33</a>].  The lower leaves are 2 to 6 inches (5-15 cm) long [<a href="#28">28</a>],
alternate and petioled [<a href="#34">34</a>].  The upper leaves are mostly sessile [<a href="#26">26</a>].
The inflorescences are few to many flower heads on peduncles 2 to 8
inches (5-20 cm) long [<a href="#34">34</a>].  The fruit is an achene 0.06 inches (1.5 mm)
long; there is no pappus [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Black-eyed Susan has a taproot or a
cluster of fibrous roots [<a href="#28">28</a>].  It is a mycorrhizal species [<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Black-eyed Susan reproduces sexually by seed [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  It is pollinated
by bees and flies [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  It also reproduces vegetatively [<a href="#56">56</a>] by
sprouting from the root crown [<a href="#48">48</a>].

In remnant tallgrass prairie in central Illinois, black-eyed Susan seeds
made up 2.4 percent of germinable seeds found in the seedbank.  Fifty
percent of black-eyed Susan seeds were in the upper 0.8 inches (2 cm) of
soil; the rest were in the next 3 inches (8 cm) of soil.  The seeds
occurred in high-density clumps rather than being randomly dispersed.
Black-eyed Susan was a very minor component of the vegetational cover.
There were more black-eyed Susan seeds in the seedbank than would be
predicted by its importance value [<a href="#38">38</a>].

Black-eyed Susan seed germination varies with area and time of
collection, and with germination conditions.

Black-eyed Susan seeds were collected from wild seed sources in central
Wisconsin in the fall of 1976.  The seeds were given cold, dry
stratification for at least 2 months, before germination testing.
Germination ranges were 0 to 38 percent.  When grown in soil in 1977,
none germinated; in 1978, germination in soil ranged from 10 to 24
percent.  The higher rate in 1978 was probably due to reduction in
dormancy and to higher germination temperatures than in 1977.  Light had
no marked effect on the germination of black-eyed Susan seeds in this
study.  Wild black-eyed Susan had a very wide range of Pure Live Seed
values [<a href="#31">31</a>].

In a germination study of Wisconsin tallgrass prairie plants, seeds were
collected from the southern tier of Wisconsin counties.  With 3 months
cold stratification, black-eyed Susan had a maximum of 46 percent
germination.  However, germination values for seeds collected in
different years fluctuated greatly.  In some years seeds would germinate
even though unstratified [<a href="#29">29</a>].

In trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides)-dominated vegetation in western
Colorado, black-eyed Susan seeds were collected September 2-3, 1981.
Germination tests were conducted within 6 months of collection.
Germination rates were very low in the absence of light and without
stratification.  Germination rates ranged from 24 to 36 percent for
moistened seeds grown in light and stratified 30 to 120 days [<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Black-eyed Susan is found on clayey loam to sandy loam soils.  It has
low to moderate water requirements, and grows in full sun to partial
shade [<a href="#51">51</a>].  It is found in plains and open woods [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>], sunny
roadsides and meadows [<a href="#57">57</a>], sandhills and bogs [<a href="#12">12</a>], and disturbed
places [<a href="#35">35</a>].

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Black-eyed Susan is considered a pioneer species [<a href="#31">31</a>], and can be
dominant in early stages of succession [<a href="#50">50</a>].

Black-eyed Susan is part of the weed stage of abandoned fields in
central Oklahoma and southeastern Kansas [<a href="#59">59</a>].

At the establishment of the Curtis Prairie in south-central Wisconsin
between 1936 and 1941, black-eyed Susan plants were left intact, as they
already occurred in some fields.  They persisted a short time, spreading
opportunistically into other areas.  Areas originally dominated by
black-eyed Susan were invaded extensively by various more aggressive
species [<a href="#52">52</a>].

In a tallgrass prairie establishment effort in southern Wisconsin, begun
in 1974, black-eyed Susan appeared in 1975, though it had not been
seeded.  It was abundant in the surrounding area, however [<a href="#60">60</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Black-eyed Susan is able to flower its first year [<a href="#28">28</a>], but flowers more
prolifically its second year.  By the end of the first year it may begin
vegetative reproduction, and show a distinct "bunching" effect with 2 or
more shoots [<a href="#46">46</a>].  Topgrowth dies back each year [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Biennial and
perennial forms sprout the next spring from the root crown [<a href="#48">48</a>].
Black-eyed Susan initiates growth in late spring and becomes dormant by
early fall [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Black-eyed Susan flowering times are:

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rudbeckia hirta
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Black-eyed Susan probably has good fire tolerance in the dormant state,
since it reproduces vegetatively from the root crown [<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  It
produces numerous small seeds [<a href="#11">11</a>] and can establish on burned sites.
Black-eyed Susan thrives in the open, sunny conditions [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>] created
by fire.  It may be an initial on-site colonizer since its seeds are
found up to 4 inches (10 cm) or deeper in the seedbank [<a href="#38">38</a>].  However,
no information was available on seed tolerance to heat or length of seed
viablility in the seedbank.

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Black-eyed Susan is probably top-killed by fire during the growing
season.  It may survive by sprouting from the root crown [<a href="#56">56</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Black-eyed Susan does not respond uniformly to burning.  Depending on
season of burning and local conditions, it often establishes
successfully; existing populations may either increase or decrease in
abundance.

In south-central New York wildfires burned goldenrod (Solidago spp.)-
poverty oatgrass (Danthonia spicata) fields in the springs of 1962,
1963, and 1964.  Adjacent burned and unburned areas were measured for
vegetative response 10 to 26 months after the fires.  The average
frequency of black-eyed Susan in unburned areas was 29 percent; in
burned areas it was 2 percent [<a href="#54">54</a>].

In southwestern Missouri after a decade of prescribed burning on glade
grasslands black-eyed Susan had decreased in abundance [<a href="#42">42</a>].

Black-eyed Susan seeds were broadcast in the fall of 1988 on sites in
tallgrass oak savanna in northwestern Illinois.  Consecutive spring
prescribed fires were conducted in 1989, 1990, and 1991.  By the fall of
1991 there were both seedlings and mature plants of black-eyed Susan on
burned sites [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Black-eyed Susan decreased with repeated dormant season prescribed fire
on one test plot in south-central Wisconsin, but increased every year in
another field subjected to the same treatment [<a href="#39">39</a>].

In south-central Wisconsin the Curtis Prairie has had a biennial burning
schedule since 1950, one-third being burned one year and the other
two-thirds the following year.  Black-eyed Susan was not present in
1951, but had appeared in small numbers by 1961.  An extended growing
season on the burned prairie appears to enhance presence of black-eyed
Susan.  During the spring, daytime temperatures are substantially warmer
on the burned than on the unburned prairie, where the litter layer
retards soil warming.  The burned surface also cools faster at night.
These effects are most pronounced in May and June [<a href="#2">2</a>]

Black-eyed Susan in tallgrass prairie in eastern Nebraska on silty clay
loam was burned in early May, early July, and mid-September, 1983.
Plots were sampled in the fall of 1983, 1984, and 1986.  Burning,
particularly summer and fall burning in years with adequate
precipitation, resulted in higher black-eyed Susan seedling
establishment than occurred without burning.  In dry years burning
reduced seedling establishment.  Black-eyed Susan cover also increased
with summer and fall burning; cover decreased without burning [<a href="#7">7</a>].

Black-eyed Susan on a poor condition prairie range site in north-central
Oklahoma was burned April 1, 1965-1967, in conditons where the soil was
moist and the fire burned against a 5 to 10 mile-per-hour (8-16 k/h)
breeze.  Matched unburned plots were mowed earlier in the spring, and
the residue removed.  In the spring of 1966, black-eyed Susan flowered
profusely on unburned plots, but was absent on burned plots [<a href="#27">27</a>].
