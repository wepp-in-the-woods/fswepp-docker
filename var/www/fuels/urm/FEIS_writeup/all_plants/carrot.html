<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of beaked sedge is Carex rostrata
Stokes [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Ther are two varieties:  C. r. var. r. and C. r.
var. urticulata (Boott) [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].

Hybrids with Carex rhynchophysa occur [<a href="#21">21</a>].

According to Reznicek [<a href="#26">26</a>], "...the name C. rostrata has been
misapplied in North America.  What has been called C. rostrata Stokes is
C. utricularia Boott.  The very rare C. rostrata described here has
glaucous, involute leaves, and stomata on the upper surface of the
blades while C. utricularia blades are green on both sides with stomata
below."

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carex rostrata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
In the Hudson Bay region and other riparian areas, beaked sedge is an
important component of valuable breeding and feeding grounds for geese
and other waterfowl [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Birds that are commonly associated with
beaked sedge habitats are:  mallard, green-winged teal, common
yellowthroat, red-winged black bird, song sparrow, and tree swallow
[<a href="#11">11</a>].  Beaked sedge stands are usually more important as feeding grounds
than as nesting grounds because of their low stature, structural
diversity, and high water levels [<a href="#46">46</a>].

Beaked sedge is eaten by horses and cattle late in the season [<a href="#46">46</a>].
Beaked sedge and water sedge (Carex aquatilis) make up 70 to 80 percent
of winter forage for bison in Canada [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Beaked sedge stands are often
grazed by elk and moose when awned sedge (C. atherodes) and inflated
sedge (C. vesicaria) are present [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Rhizomes of beaked sedge are
important early and late winter food, and foliage an important summer
forage for reindeer in northern Ontario [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability of beaked sedge varies seasonally.  Beaked sedge provides
good forage in the spring but becomes tough during the summer; however,
palatability in riparian areas is higher late in the growing season.
Elk consume beaked sedge late in the season [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Frosts or hard
freezes on upper elevation meadows make forage unpalatable in the fall
[<a href="#8">8</a>].

In Iceland, beaked sedge is excellent forage for cattle, which will wade
deep into the water to reach it.  Beaked sedge is widespread in Siberia
as aquatic forage and is highly rated as browse [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

Palatability of beaked sedge has been rated as follows [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>]:

                     CO       MT       ND       UT       WY

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Beaked sedge is rated fair in energy and poor in protein value [<a href="#18">18</a>].
Plants growing in riparian areas are generally higher in nutritive
quality than plants in upland communities [<a href="#24">24</a>].  The fresh, aerial part
of beaked sedge contains 166.9 mg/kg carotene and a vitamin A equivalent
of 278.2 IU/g [<a href="#35">35</a>].  The leaf cells are high in silica [<a href="#31">31</a>].  A study
was conducted on beaked sedge from June to October for 4 years.  The
results given below are from a favorable-growth year [<a href="#3">3</a>].

                               June                 October
Calcium:Phosphorous Ratio      1.4:1                 2.6:1
Moisture (%)                    5.46                  4.99
Crude Protein (%)              14.69                  6.36
Crude Fiber (%)                26.70                 31.80
Ether Extract (%)               2.96                  2.02
Nitrogen-Free Extract (%)      42.70                 46.54

The overall calcium-phosphorous ratio was good.  Carotene was highest in
July.  Years of good precipitation resulted in increased moisture
content and carotene levels [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Beaked sedge forms a dense sod on streambanks which when undercut
provides good shade and cover for salminoids [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].

The degree to which beaked sedge provides environmental protection for
wildlife species has been rated as follows [<a href="#10">10</a>]:

                           UT        MT        ND
Elk                       poor      ----      ----
Mule deer                 poor      ----      ----           
Pronghorn                 poor      ----      ----
Upland game birds         fair      poor      ----
Waterfowl                 fair      poor      good
Small nongame birds       fair      fair      ----
Small mammals             good      fair      ----


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Beaked sedge has a high potential for biomass production and long-term
revegetation, and medium potential for erosion control and short-term
revegetation [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Its establishment requirements are medium to high
[<a href="#10">10</a>].

In Iceland, sedge meadows often result from irrigating hummocky moorland
and fens, which become level within a period of 5 years [<a href="#23">23</a>].

Beaked sedge sod rapidly recolonizes disturbed sites by rhizome
expansion.  Its rhizomes form a dense network that are effective in
stabilizing streambanks [<a href="#18">18</a>] and preventing soil erosion [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Eskimos eat the lower part of beaked sedge [<a href="#21">21</a>]. 


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Beaked sedge can withstand moderate grazing.  When cut to a height of
0.6 inch (1.5 cm) to simulate grazing, productivity was least affected
by late season cuts [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Beaked sedge sod is resistant to trampling by
livestock and moose [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].

Beaked sedge can withstand moderate trailing and recreational use [<a href="#17">17</a>].
To reduce pack and saddle stock grazing impact, use should be minimized
until after senescence (late September and October) [<a href="#40">40</a>].  On wet soils,
hikers and packstock often create multiple or parallel trails, resulting
in severe rut formation.  Off-road vehicle use results in serious
long-term damage to beaked sedge communities.  To prevent this, roads
should be maintained, and off-road travel should be discouraged.  New
trails near sedge meadows should be constructed on adjacent uplands
[<a href="#18">18</a>].

Overuse by livestock may cause other species to become codominant with
beaked sedge [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Sedges respond satisfactorally to traditional
grazing systems designed for upland species.  In areas adjacent to
streams, residual cover filters sediments from fall rains and spring
runoff.  Cattle should be excluded for at least 30 days to allow
sufficient residual cover growth [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Stands of beaked sedge protected
from livestock use more than doubled in standing phytomass in 1 year
[<a href="#24">24</a>].

Beaked sedge is tolerant of extreme water level fluctuation in
reservoirs used for hydroelectric power, although shoot size is
affected.  Beaked sedge is vulnerable to aphid infestation in Sweden
[<a href="#22">22</a>].  In some parts of Canada, beaked sedge is a common hay source
[<a href="#37">37</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carex rostrata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Beaked sedge is a large, water-obligate, native, grasslike perennial
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  The culms may be single or grouped together, ranging in
height from 12 to 48 inches (30-120 cm) [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  The leaves are
similar to the stems in height, with 4 to 10 leaves per stem.  The
leaves are flat, glaucous, long, and wide [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].

Beaked sedge has a lifespan varying from 2 to 6 years [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  Shoots
live 2 years in Minnesota, New York, and the Netherlands; 3 years in
central Sweden (longer in arctic and alpine regions); and 4 years in
northern Sweden.  Shoots that grow in summer live longer than those that
grow in spring [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Beaked sedge is a frost-tolerant, prolific seeder.  It forms indisticnt
tussocks that consist of dead or drying, fertile and old, and current
and new shoots [<a href="#21">21</a>].

Beaked sedge is often taller in unshaded areas than in the forest [<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Geophyte
   Hydrophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Beaked sedge reproduces by rhizomes varying from 0.4 inch to 2.75 yards
(1.0 cm-2.5 m) [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  These produce a matted and tufted growth
pattern.  First a long rhizome emerges and a shoot is produced.  Then,
short rhizomes develop to produce a tuft of many shoots [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Dead
shoots with living roots can still establish daughter shoots from
rhizomes.  When shoots first develop, they do not have roots [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Beaked sedge also reproduces with stolons.  Young roots have been
observed developing near stolon tips [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Beaked sedge is a prolific seed producer and flowers from June to July
in Wyoming and North Dakota and from June to August in Montana [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Bud
generation occurs in August and September and shoots flower the
following summer [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Beaked sedge shoots can be spread by fragmentation.  Ice can break off
old shoots with associated roots.  Shoots may be transported by water
and caught by floating mats or end up on the shore.  These shoots can
root from the base and establish [<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Beaked sedge is most common in wet meadows, marshes, edges of lakes,
ponds, and streams, and other riparian areas [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  The surface
may be hummocky or mounded and in trough-shaped or flat-floored valleys
[<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Beaked sedge grows best on gentle slopes [<a href="#10">10</a>].  It is
sometimes a dominant species in floating mats [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].

Beaked sedge is adapted a variety of mineral and organic soils
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  Many soils have large amounts of peat [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Other common
soils may be sandy, silty, clayey, loamy, clayey loam, alluvial, or
granitic [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  Soil pH tolerance ranges from 3.0 to 7.9 [<a href="#37">37</a>].
Beaked sedge shows poor growth on sodic, saline and sodic saline soils
[<a href="#10">10</a>].  Beaked sedge grows in areas where water is as far as 32 inches (80
cm) below the soil surface, as well as in areas with standing water as
deep as 39 inches (1.0 m) [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].

The climate is often cool and semiarid, with a mean annual precipitation
of 12 inches (300 mm) [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].

Beaked sedge has a wide elevational range [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>]:

                      feet              meters
Alberta         3,000 -  5,000        910 - 1,515
California      9,470 -  9,655      2,870 - 2,925
Colorado        6,500 - 11,000      1,970 - 3,335
Idaho           6,000 -  8,300      1,830 - 2,530     
Montana         2,500 -  7,000        760 - 2,120
Nevada          5,800 -  8,250      1,770 - 2,600

Wyoming         6,200 - 10,500      1,880 - 3,180

In Alberta, beaked sedge shoot density was reported to be 4,100 shoots
per square foot (370 shoots/sq m) [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Compared with its riparian associates, beaked sedge occurs on some of
the wettest sites [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  There are three phases of beaked sedge
habitat; the wettest is indicated by codominance with awned sedge and
inflated sedge.  Water sedge and tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia
caespitosa) are indicators of drier sites where beaked sedge grows
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Other associates include willow (Salix spp), sphagnum moss
(Sphagnum spp.), fewflowered spikesedge (Eleocharis pauciflora),
Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis), common willow-herb (Epilobium
ciliatum), water horsetail (Equisetum fluvaiatile), purple cinquefoil
(Potentilla palustrus), and timothy (Phleum pratense) [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Beaked sedge is characteristic of early seral, aquatic habitats [<a href="#7">7</a>].  It
is common in recently formed beaver ponds and on sites with a high water
table [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  Beaked sedge communities have little species
diversity, and invasion is limited by the dense rhizome network
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

Beaked sedge is often succeeded by willows (Salix spp.), rushes (Juncus
spp.), and reed grasses (Calamagrostis spp.) [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  It has
climax ecological status on wet sites of the Cascade Range [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Beaked sedge begins producing new green leaves in early spring [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>];
growth at this time is rapid.  There is a decrease in root biomass, and
most energy is allocated to height increment [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  In July, when
beaked sedge is almost at its full height, energy allocation is shifted
to shoot production [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].

Shoots emerge between July and August but may emerge in autumn also [<a href="#4">4</a>].
Flora primordia develop in August or September.  The shoot flowers the
following summer, generally in June and July [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Shoots that flower
usually die in late August or September [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Beaked sedge stays green
well into fall because of the moist habitat but does turn brown before
winter [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].

Many shoots emerge, overwinter, grow through the next season,
overwinter, flower, and then die in August [<a href="#37">37</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Beaked sedge has deep buried rhizomes which usually survive all but the
most severe fires [<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Carex rostrata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire consumes the aboveground tissue of beaked sedge, top-killing the
plant.  The rhizomes, however, suvive most fires, even those that
consume organic soils [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
After a fire which charred the peat layer, beaked sedge regrew from
rhizomes and appeared dense and lush.  Beaked sedge also occurred as
isolated plants among other forbs and grasses on mineral soils [<a href="#44">44</a>].
Herbage productivity temporarily increases following fires [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].

Information regarding postfire seed production, germination, and
establishment of beaked sedge is lacking.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Beaked sedge communities are difficult to burn [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Prescribed
fires are most effective in late summer, early fall, or during dry years
when the water is below the soil surface [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Peat soils are
flammable when dry.  Hot fires may penetrate the soil and destroy sedge
rhizomes [<a href="#27">27</a>].  It is essential that livestock be excluded during the
year prior to burning [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Caution should be used with fires along
streams because of the excellent erosion protection beaked sedge
provides [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].

Fires do little to change plant composition of beaked sedge habitats
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  This includes fires that remove much of the organic
accumulation [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Fires reduce conifer swamps in succession to open
muskegs and in turn to sedge meadows that support little woody
vegetation.  Fires of these swamps also improve game habitat by
stimulation and increased production of edible growth and fruit and seed
[<a href="#43">43</a>].
