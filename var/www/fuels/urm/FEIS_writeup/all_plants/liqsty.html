<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Liquidambar styraciflua
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Sweetgum is primarily used for lumber, veneer, and plywood.  The lumber
is used to make boxes, crates, furniture, interior trim, and millwork.
The veneer is used primarily for crates, baskets, and interior woodwork.
Sweetgum is also used for crossties and fuel, and small amounts go into
fencing, excelsior, and pulpwood [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Sweetgum has moderate value as a winter browse [<a href="#5">5</a>].  In the Oconee
National Forest of Georgia, sweetgum was lightly to moderately browsed
by white-tailed deer during the fall and winter [<a href="#19">19</a>].  The seeds are
eaten by birds, squirrels, and chipmunks [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Sweetgum is relatively high in protein and caloric content.  Mean
nutrient seasonal values for sweetgum on unburned plots in southern
forests were as follows [<a href="#27">27</a>]:

                      crude    N-free

<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Sweetgum snags are used as breeding sites for a variety of birds and
mammals [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Sweetgum stem cuttings have been successfully planted for streambank
protection and reclamation of sites disturbed by coal strip mining
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].

Sweetgum growth and survival was good when planted on favorable sites
but decreased when seedlings were planted concurrently with ground cover
or in previously established cover of grasses and legumes on mined sites
in southeastern Indiana [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Medicinally, sweetgum is known as "copalm balsam" and the resinous gum
is used extensively in Mexico and Europe as a substitute for storax.
Various ointments and syrups are prepared from the resinous gum and are
used in the treatment of dysentery and diarrhea.  The gum is sometimes
chewed by children, and it is also used as a perfuming agent in soap
[<a href="#45">45</a>].

The beautiful red and yellow color variations of sweetgum's autumn
foliage make it highly prized as an ornamental [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Sweetgum's ability to sprout quickly and persistently makes it one of the
most serious competitors of pine seedlings in southeastern forests.
Silvicultural practices have called for the control of sweetgum in areas
where it competes heavily with pine seedlings [<a href="#49">49</a>].  Basal applications
of Garlon 4 top-killed 81 percent of 2 inch (5 cm) d.b.h or smaller
stems [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Liquidambar styraciflua
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sweetgum is a large, native, long-lived, deciduous tree that reaches
heights of 50 to 150 feet (15-45 m) at maturity [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  It is easily
recognizable by the long-petioled, star-shaped leaves which have five
long-pointed, saw-toothed lobes. The brown bark is deeply furrowed into
narrow scaley plates or ridges.  Young sweetgum trees have long conical
crowns, while mature trees have crowns that are round and spreading.
Sweetgum is monoecious with the male flowers in several clusters and the
female flowers hanging at the end of the same stalk.  The ball-shaped
fruits contain many individual seed-bearing sections, and persist
throughout the winter [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Seed production and dissemination:  Sweetgum produces an abundance of
lightweight seed.  The tree begins to produce seed when 20 to 30 years
old, and crops remain abundant for 150 years.  Fair seed crops are
produced each year, with bumper crops every 2 to 3 years [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Under
conditions of full sunlight and rich moist soil, each fruit may average
as many as 50 sound seeds. Seed is primarily dispersed by wind; the
maximum dispersal distance recorded was 600 feet (183 m) but
ordinarily 96 percent of the seed fall within 200 feet (61 m) of the
point of release [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].

Seedling development:  Sod is not a serious hindrance to seed
germination; however, when additional sweetgum production is desired in
partially cutover stands, exposed mineral soil and abundant direct
sunlight are necessary [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Root development varies with the growing
site.  A deep taproot and numerous horizontal rootlets usually develop
early, but in wet areas the root sytem is shallow and wide spreading,
with little or no taproot [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  On an abandoned field adjacent to a
swamp in Maryland, 5-year-old seedlings averaged 8.7 feet (2.6 m) in
height [<a href="#24">24</a>].  On favorable sites in the lower Mississippi Valley,
seedlings grow as much as 2 feet (0.6 m) during the first year [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Sweetgum is capable of sprouting until it is
approximately 50 years old.  Although sweetgum seedlings reach a height
of 4.5 feet (1.4 m) in 3 to 5 years, sprouts often reach this height in
one growing season.  Ten-year old sprouts frequently have the same size
and appearance as 18- to 20-year-old seedlings in the same stand
[<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sweetgum is very tolerant of different soils and sites but grows best on
the rich, moist, alluvial clay and loamy soils of river bottoms [<a href="#28">28</a>].
Throughout the Piedmont Plateau, sweetgum shows good growth on river and
stream bottoms and shows considerable potential on many upland sites
[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].

Common tree associates of sweetgum include spruce pine (Pinus glabra),
Virginia pine (P. virginiana), red maple (Acer rubrum), box elder (A.
negundo), pignut, shellbark, shagbark, and mockernut hickories (Carya
glabra, C. laciniosa, C. ovata, C. tomentosa), and sugarberry (Celtis
laevigata).  Common understory associates include dogwood (Cornus spp.),
alder (Alnus spp.), and eastern redbud (Cercis canadensis) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Sweetgum is classified as shade intolerant [<a href="#7">7</a>].  In pure stands on
bottomland sites, young sweetgum is able to endure some shade and
crowding.  With increase in age the tree becomes less tolerant of
competition.  Following natural decrease in the canopy, enough sunlight
reaches the ground to permit an understory stand to develop [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].
Although sweetgum is an early invader, it seldom becomes a dominant
species [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Sweetgum flowers appear from March to May, depending on latitude and
weather.  The fruit ripens from September to November; the fruit often
persists through the entire winter [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Liquidambar styraciflua
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fire is one of the major agents of damage to sweetgum.  Its relatively
thin bark make it highly susceptible to fire [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Following top-kill
by fire, sweetgum sprouts from the stump or root crown [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   survivor species; on-site surviving root crown or caudex
   off-site colonizer; seed carried by wind; postfire years 1 and 2

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Liquidambar styraciflua
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire typically top-kills sweetgum.  Hot summer fires may deplete
carbohydrate reserves and eventually kill the tree [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
Fire scars on living trees provide entry points for insects and
diseases.  As long as the sapwood is not killed by fire, basal wounds
are often covered with a gum exudation that protects them.  After
repeated fires, however, a tree is apt to have some sapwood killed and
fungi and insects may become established [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Sweetgum generally sprouts prolifically when top-killed by fire.
Repeated annual summer burns, however, will eventually deplete
carbohydrate reserves and kill the plant [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Fire has been demonstrated to be a good management tool for controlling
sweetgum.  In the Coastal Plain of South Carolina, five consecutive
summer fires killed 85 percent or more of the root stalks of sweetgum.
Winter fires did not kill appreciable numbers of root stalks but did
top-kill most sweetgum 2 inches (5 cm) or less d.b.h. [<a href="#11">11</a>].
