<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Sweet cicely has a patchy distribution throughout the understory of the
northern hardwood and eastern deciduous forests [<a href="#17">17</a>].  It is an
indicator and/or a dominant species in the sugar maple (Acer saccharum)
climax communities of the northern states and Canada [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].
Common codominants in these climax communities with sugar maple are
American beech (Fagus grandifolia), red oak (Quercus rubra), and eastern
hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Sweet cicely is an indicator of
highly productive sites of climax sugar maple-basswood (Tilia americana)
stands and subclimax oak-aspen (Quercus spp.-Populus tremuloides)
[<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  In a Minnesota sugar maple-basswood climax forest, frequency
was six sweet cicely plants per square yard (7.3 plants/sq m) [<a href="#9">9</a>].

Sweet cicely is a minor component in the sugar maple-white ash (Fraxinus
americana) forest zone and in the sugar maple associations with yellow
birch (Betula alleghaniensis), black ash (Fraxinus nigra), or American
elm (Ulmus americana) of eastern Canada [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Osmorhiza claytonii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sweet cicely is a native perennial forb with thickened fibrous roots
extending from a caudex [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Its solitary stem grows from 12 to 35
inches (30-90 cm) high with compound leaves [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  Flower stalks have
very small umbels, producing thin black seeds with stiffly hairy ribs
[<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
New foliage in the fall and annual flower stalks in the spring are
generated from a root stock [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  In mature forests that typically
have long-term disturbance regimes, sweet cicely responds to small scale
disturbances, such as one causing a tree gap, by increasing its cover
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

Sweet cicely seeds are disseminated by dropping from the plant or by
snagging in animal fur, hair, or clothing [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Sweet cicely seeds
require warm stratification followed by cold stratification before
germination will occur [<a href="#3">3</a>].  In laboratory studies, 98 percent of the
seeds germinated after 4 weeks with day temperatures at 86 degrees
Fahrenheit (30 deg C) and night temperatures at 59 degrees Fahrenheit
(15 deg C) followed by 2 weeks at 41 degrees Fahrenheit (5 deg C) days
and nights [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Under field conditions, sweet cicely sheds seed during
the summer or early autumn when temperatures are relatively warm to hot,
which results in high germination rates the following spring.  Baskin
and Baskin [<a href="#3">3</a>] also found that a portion of the seed did not germinate
until the second spring after shedding.  Sweet cicely forms a
short-lived seed bank.

Seeds that are not dropped and remain attached to the plant during the
winter have longer dormancy after being shed.  This seed required 12
weeks warm stratification followed by cold stratification to yield 96
percent germination [<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sweet cicely grows in rich, mesic, mixed-hardwood forests [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  It is
common in woods on shaded hillsides [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  It also occurs on
the forested edges of wet prairies and meadows [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].

Sites on which sweet cicely occurs vary from well-drained gravelly or
sandy loams to poorly drained clay loams [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Occasionally, there
is a top layer of humus, 1 to 4 inches (2.5-10 cm) deep [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Water may
be at or near the soil surface for most of the year [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  The soil
pH is acidic to strongly acidic; calcium and magnesium have generally
been leached out [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Sweet cicely is found on level to very steep (75
percent) slopes [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  It occurs from elevations of 600 feet to 2,200
feet (183-670 m) [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].

The climate is generally characterized by short, mild summers and long,
cold winters [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  At one representative site, average annual
precipitation is about 39 inches (1,000 mm); snowpack, an average of 10
inches (250 cm) per year, may last from November to April [<a href="#27">27</a>].  The
growing season is approximately 200 days over its range [<a href="#37">37</a>].

Associated overstory species are bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa),
yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), and black willow (Salix nigra)
[<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Common associated shrubs are fly honeysuckle (Lonicera
canadensis), red elderberry (Sambucus pubens), and juneberry
(Amelanchier alnifolia) [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Herbaceous associates are enchanter's
nightshade (Circaea quadrisulcata), American pokeweed (Phytolacca
americana), feather Solomon's-seal (Smilacina racemosa), and several
violet species (Viola spp.) [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Climax Species

Sweet cicely is relatively shade tolerant [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].  It is a mature,
approximate climax or climax understory species in deciduous forests
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  In studies of Ohio old field-deciduous forest seres, sweet
cicely was present herb only in 200+ year-old stands as a subdominant or
minor herb [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
In the spring before the canopy closes, sweet cicely initiates foliage
growth and then puts up a flower stalk.  It begins flowering in April
in the southern part of its range [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  In the northern parts, it
flowers progressively later: blooming in May and June in the central
states, and June to August in the far north [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Sweet cicely
seeds mature from June through August.  The seeds are shed primarily in
late autumn and winter; however, they may not be dropped until the
following spring [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Seedlings generally emerge in the spring [<a href="#3">3</a>].
The flower stalk dies in the fall, but new leaves are put out at that
time [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  Sweet cicely overwinters as a rosette [<a href="#9">9</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Osmorhiza claytonii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
In the communities in which sweet cicely grows, fire occurrence ranges
from uncommon in the northern hardwoods to very common in the
Appalachian oak forests [<a href="#23">23</a>].  A covering of soil protects the caudex of
an established sweet cicely plant.  Under moist conditions, a root stock
may survive fire.  Seed buried in soil may be insulated enough to
survive [<a href="#13">13</a>].  However, seeds attached to stalks at the time of burning
will die.

Accumulated dead stalks are a fire hazard to sweet cicely.  Aerial stems
of sweet cicely die each fall and generally remain attached [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].
These old stems make the plant more susceptible to burning.

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Osmorhiza claytonii
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
No fire studies have been done on sweet cicely.  Fire top-kills foliage.
The soil-covered root stock may survive, unless conditions are dry and
duff layers are well-developed [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Under these conditions, fire may
consume the caudex and kill the plant and seed bank.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Fire severity and rooting depth of the caudex control recovery of sweet
cicely.  If burned in late summer or early autumn, surviving root stocks
should sprout, since sweet cicely normally initiates new leaves in the
fall [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  With a persistent seed bank, sweet cicely seeds may
germinate in the first postfire spring [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Off-site regeneration is
possible; seeds can be transported into burned areas.
