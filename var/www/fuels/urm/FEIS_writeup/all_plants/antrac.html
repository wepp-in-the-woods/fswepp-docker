<b>COMMON NAMES : </b>
   raceme pussytoes


<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of raceme pussytoes is Antennaria
racemosa Hook. [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  There are no recognized subspecies,

<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)/pinegrass habitats in central
Idaho, raceme pussytoes cover decreased after clearcutting and
shelterwood cutting followed by mechanical scarification; after
clearcutting followed by broadcast burning; and after clearcutting with
no subsequent site preparation [<a href="#21">21</a>].  It showed a similiar response to
the same silvicultural treatments in Douglas-fir/ninebark (Physocarpus
malvaceus) and Douglas-fir/globe huckleberry (Vaccinium globulare)
habitat types in western Montana [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Raceme pussytoes is moderately resistant to trampling [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Pussytoes
(Antennaria spp.) usually increase in response to grazing [<a href="#25">25</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Antennaria racemosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Raceme pussytoes is a native, perennial forb with creeping, leafy
stolons.  Stems are 4 to 24 inches (10-60 cm) tall.  The inflorescence
is a generally open cyme, but flowers may be more crowded at higher
elevations [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Raceme pussytoes reproduces from seed or spreads vegetatively through
stolons.  Seeds are light and wind dispersed.  They are generally
not stored in soil seedbanks.  Raceme pussytoes seeds germinate on
mineral soil in partial shade; germination and seedling establishment
do not increase dramatically following disturbance.  Vegetative growth
tends to increase following partial removal of the canopy [<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Raceme pussytoes is found on moist, at least partially shaded sites in
cool montane and subalpine forests [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>].  In west-central Montana
it is particularly abundant on north slopes, where it may be found along
roads and in other disturbed places [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Raceme pussytoes is found at
elevations of 5,600 to 11,500 feet (1,700-3,500 m) in Wyoming and 3,500
to 6,800 feet (1,050-2,050 m) in Montana [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Raceme pussytoes is shade tolerant but is often found on disturbed sites
on north-facing slopes [<a href="#15">15</a>].  In central Idaho it is an early seral
species in subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa)/beargrass (Xerophyllum
tenax) habitat types [<a href="#19">19</a>], but is considered late seral in
Douglas-fir/ninebark and Douglas-fir/pinegrass habitat types [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Raceme pussytoes flowers from May through August [<a href="#13">13</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Raceme pussytoes colonizes bare mineral soil from light, wind-dispersed
seed [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Antennaria racemosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Raceme pussytoes is probably killed by most fires.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Raceme pussytoes response to fire varies.  It decreased in cover in the
first years following stand-replacing wildfires in
Douglas-fir/pinegrass, Douglas-fir/ninebark, and Douglas-fir/globe
huckleberry habitat types in central Idaho and western Montana [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].
However, it increased after fires in subalpine fir/beargrass habitats
and was often found in the understory of open lodgepole pine (Pinus
contorta) stands, especially where one or more light surface fires had
recently occurred [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Raceme pussytoes was present in increasing
numbers in the first 10 years following the Pattee Canyon Fire in
western Montana [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Raceme pussytoes was also present within 7 to 9
years following a broadcast burn in a western larch (Larix
occidentalis)-Douglas-fir forest in Montana, although it was not a
component of the prefire community [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Reese [<a href="#18">18</a>] stated that raceme
pussytoes is sometimes present on recently burned sites in the Teton
Wilderness, Wyoming.

Anderson [<a href="#1">1</a>] reported that raceme pussytoes was present "via vegetative
regrowth" in postfire year 1 following moderately severe fires in
lodgepole pine stands in Yellowstone National Park.  No other
information was found on the ability of raceme pussytoes to sprout after
fire.
