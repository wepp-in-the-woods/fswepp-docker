 There are several species of <i>Pueraria</i> throughout the world that are
variously referred to as &quot;kudzu&quot; [<a href="#34">34</a>]. The
currently accepted scientific name for the species of kudzu that has become
widely established throughout the southeastern United States is <i>Pueraria montana</i> (Lour.) Merr. var. <i>lobata</i> 
(Willd.) Maesen &amp;
S. Almeida (Fabaceae) [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>]. Throughout
this summary, the common name &quot;kudzu&quot; refers to the above species.&nbsp;

 Kudzu is designated as a &quot;noxious weed&quot; in Kansas and Pennsylvania,
and a &quot;terrestrial noxious weed&quot; in Florida. West Virginia classifies
kudzu as &quot;noxious weed but with crop value: permit may be issued for
cultivation&quot;, and Oregon cites it as &quot;noxious weed of known economic
importance which occurs in small enough infestations to make
eradication/containment possible; or is not known to occur, but is present in
neighboring states&quot; [<a href="#60">60</a>]. For more information see <a href="https://invader.dbs.umt.edu/">Invaders

<br />

Kudzu originated in China and was brought to the United States from Japan in
the late 1800s [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>]. It is distributed throughout much of the eastern United States and is most
common in the South. It occurs from Nebraska, Illinois, New York, and Massachusetts
south to Florida and Texas.
Kudzu also occurs in Hawaii [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].
Estimated kudzu cover in the Southeast is 7 million acres (2.8 million hectares), with the most extensive infestations in Mississippi, Alabama, and
Georgia [<a href="#51">51</a>]. The <a href="https://plants.usda.gov/">Plants database</a> provides
a distributional map of kudzu.

<p>Kudzu has periodically been reported in areas disjunct from the above
description, but has not become established in any of these
areas as of this writing (2002) [<a href="#66">66</a>]. It has recently been discovered near Portland, Oregon,
and efforts to eradicate the population are underway [<a href="#54">54</a>].

<p>
The following biogeographic classification systems are presented as a guide to
demonstrate where kudzu could potentially be found. Because the
ecology of kudzu in North America has not been extensively studied, precise distribution
information is lacking. Therefore these lists are
somewhat speculative and may not be exhaustive or complete.</p>

<br />

Kudzu is most invasive in the Southeast. Factors that determine occurrence
and invasiveness are most likely climate, light availability, and previous local
establishment. The particular local native plant community probably has little influence on
kudzu distribution and invasiveness. Even core areas of otherwise undisturbed,
insular forest habitat can eventually succumb, as invading kudzu slowly advances
from established populations along a forest perimeter. Any southeastern plant
communities in the vicinity of an existing kudzu population -- from pine plantations to mixed
hardwoods -- are likely to be at risk of
invasion.<br><br>

Kudzu is not a climax dominant or indicator species in habitat type
classifications. However, due to its ability to achieve and maintain dominance on many
sites where it occurs, kudzu might be considered the de facto climax dominant on
these sites, regardless of site potential.

GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Kudzu is a climbing or trailing, herbaceous to semiwoody, nonnative, deciduous, perennial
vine or liana. The compound leaves are 2 to 8 inches (5-20 cm) long
[<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. Flowers are 0.8 to 1 inch (2-2.5 cm) long and are borne on 4- to 8-inch-long (10-20 cm)
axillary racemes [<a href="#37">37</a>]. Seeds are produced in 1.6- to 2-inch (4-5 cm) long
pods [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].

<p> Kudzu exhibits a strong diurnal pattern in leaflet orientation, enabling
plants to adjust the intensity of incident radiation upon exposed leaflets by
altering their axial position relative to the sun. This
trait results in comparatively reduced leaf temperatures and transpirational
water loss during periods of intense mid-day summer sunlight, and may improve
plant water-use efficiency [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>]. This
trait may also improve light penetration in kudzu-dominated tree canopies,
enhancing the specie's ability to maintain high leaf areas. High leaf area in arboreal kudzu maximizes
photosynthesis and
enhances kudzu's ability to compete for light [<a href="#64">64</a>].
</p>

<p> 
Kudzu accumulates and maintains substantial carbon reserves in large woody,
tuberous roots. Roots can grow to 12 feet (3.6 meters) long in sandy soils and can
weigh up to several hundred pounds [<a href="#33">33</a>]. Because of its large and deeply growing taproot, kudzu can withstand
substantial periods
of drought [<a href="#66">66</a>]. Deep roots also enable kudzu to
maintain relatively high xylem water potentials throughout the hottest part of
the day [<a href="#64">64</a>].
</p>

<p> 
Kudzu is considered a semiwoody perennial because it exhibits 2 strategies
for overwintering. The trailing, prostrate stems found in open areas die back to the root crown following
the 1st frost. Stems that climb
vertically, such as those invading a forest edge, often overwinter in the canopy. Overwintering vines develop
thick bark, accumulate annual
rings of vascular tissue, and can attain <u>&gt;</u> 0.8-inch (2 cm) stem diameters [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>]. North American
kudzu apparently produces overwintering stems only on vigorous, climbing plants,
but&nbsp; in Japan kudzu
produces overwintering stems even on prostrate plants [<a href="#57">57</a>].
</p>

<p> 
<font face="Bell MT"><b>Growth habit:</b></font> Vines climb by twining the stem around a
support such as the bole of a tree [<a href="#6">6</a>]. Spread of kudzu through forested areas may be
accelerated by other vines such as Japanese honeysuckle (<i>Lonicera japonica</i>), since
kudzu can more easily twine around smaller diameter vines than around bare tree
trunks [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].&nbsp;

REGENERATION PROCESSES:</a>
</span>
<br />

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Asexual regeneration:</b></font>  
Kudzu commonly spreads by sending down roots
from nearly every node along stems that contact soil. Rooting usually occurs every few
feet along horizontal stems, and new root crowns develop at these nodes. New
ramets develop the following spring,
with new tendrils radiating in all directions from newly established root crowns
[<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].


<p> <font face="Bell MT"><b>Breeding system:</b></font> No information</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Pollination:</b></font> No information</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed production:</b></font>
Kudzu plants do not usually flower until their
3rd year [<a href="#3">3</a>]. Kudzu rarely flowers on prostrate vines and
seeds are only produced on climbing vines [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>]. Generally, a cluster of seedpods
produces only 1 or 2 viable seeds [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Seed production
is substantially limited in North America, especially in areas outside
the Southeast [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed dispersal:</b></font> No information</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seed banking:</b></font>   
Seeds require scarification
before they germinate. Although information on seed longevity is lacking, seed banks can apparently develop
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Germination:</b></font>  
Seeds are unable to
germinate until the seedcoats are rendered water permeable. Dormancy may be
broken by physical scarification of seeds. Prolonged exposure to warm summer
temperatures may promote germination by increasing seedcoat permeability, but
detailed information is lacking [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].</p> 

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Seedling establishment/growth:</b> </font>
Kudzu reportedly sets seed infrequently in North America [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>]. It is speculated that kudzu seedlings are far less competitive
than asexually established ramets, and may be of minor concern regarding
invasiveness [<a href="#64">64</a>]. The ecology of&nbsp; kudzu sexual reproduction in North America is little
studied and more research is needed in this area.</p>

<p> Vines can grow up to 1
foot (30 cm) per day and 33 to 99 feet (10-30 m) in a growing season [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].&nbsp;</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SITE CHARACTERISTICS">
SITE CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Kudzu is typically found in open, disturbed areas such as abandoned fields, roadsides,
and forest edges [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>]. Spread is most rapid in open areas, and is slowed as kudzu encounters the
shade of a forest edge [<a href="#44">44</a>]. Kudzu monocultures typically contain thousands of individual plants
per acre [<a href="#33">33</a>].

<p>Kudzu is most prolific in areas where winters are mild (40 to 60 degrees
Fahrenheit (4-16 �C)), summer temperatures rise above 80 degrees Fahrenheit
(27 �C), the growing season is long, and annual precipitation is &gt; 40 inches (1,000 mm) [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>]. Kudzu thrives in areas that experience 
abundant sunny weather during the
growing season. Growth rates up to 3 times greater have been demonstrated on
sunny days, compared to overcast conditions. Photosynthesis is not inhibited by high temperatures until 86 to 95 degrees
Fahrenheit (30-35 �C) [<a href="#64">64</a>].</p>

<p>Kudzu grows on a variety of soil types [<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>], but
performs best on deep, well-drained, loamy soils [<a href="#61">61</a>]. Because kudzu is a nitrogen-fixing plant, it is likely to be competitive on
nitrogen-deficient sites [<a href="#33">33</a>].</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="SUCCESSIONAL STATUS">
SUCCESSIONAL STATUS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Kudzu is generally considered shade intolerant. A study at the University of
Maryland showed that kudzu had the highest light
requirement of 5 native and 3 exotic vine species of the Southeast, and
establishment appears to be greatly inhibited under shaded, forest floor conditions [<a href="#6">6</a>]. While growth is slowed under shaded
conditions, kudzu does have some ability to tolerate low irradiance levels [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>]. This
trait enables kudzu to maintain a competitively high leaf area index within a
forest canopy, and to grow through several canopy layers before overtopping overstory trees [<a href="#13">13</a>].

<p>

Although kudzu is typically found in disturbed habitats, it can invade along
edges of forested areas, enveloping, suppressing, and eventually killing
mature trees. Kudzu monocultures can arrest successional development of native plant
communities. Although kudzu has been established in North America for nearly a
century, there are no published reports as of this writing (2002) that document
long-term successional patterns in kudzu-dominated communities. Because kudzu spreads largely by asexual means in
North America, populations are generally localized [<a href="#44">44</a>].</p>


<p><span class="subframeName"><a name="SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT">SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:</a>

<br />

Seasonal development varies with latitude and altitude. Leaf emergence occurs in
late spring [<a href="#13">13</a>]. Shoot biomass and leaf area index peak near the end of June in the Georgia Piedmont. Stem elongation and leaf production
are continuous throughout the growing season, but production varies with
conditions [<a href="#64">64</a>]. Flowering occurs from late July through September,
depending on location [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>]. Seeds mature in fall [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. Foliage is generally killed by the 1st fall frost, and plants
are dormant until spring [<a href="#66">66</a>].

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire adaptations:</b></font> 
Kudzu escapes fire damage by maintaining perennating root crowns beneath the soil surface [<a href="#43">43</a>]. Kudzu stems and foliage are
likely to resist fire damage during the growing season because they typically
maintain high water content. Even during drought when nearby plants may be
susceptible to fire due to desiccation, kudzu's deep taproot allows the plant to
maintain a relatively high water content [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>].

<p>  Soil heating as a
result of fire may promote seed germination by scarifying the seedcoat,
allowing water to penetrate into the seed [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>]. In addition, dry kudzu
litter can provide substantial fuel for dormant-season
surface fires, perhaps providing a positive feedback in promoting seed
germination. More research is needed to help understand the role of fire in
promoting kudzu seed germination and postfire seedling establishment.</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Fire regimes:</b></font>  
Because kudzu tends to be
more opportunistic than predictable in its occurrence, it is difficult to ascribe particular fire regimes to it. To the
extent that abundant, moist, green kudzu foliage can inhibit fire, kudzu may alter
historic fire regimes by lengthening fire return intervals. Conversely,
substantial fuel loading from dense mats of kudzu litter may enhance
dormant-season fire potential. Additionally, the presence of kudzu
in forest canopies may provide ladder fuels that enhance the likelihood of crown fires,
particularly in areas where frequent surface fires may otherwise maintain seral
pine or oak dominants. As kudzu invades shrub and forest communities, increases
in standing and ground-layer fuels from dead woody plants that have succumbed to
invasion could also increase fire intensity and severity. These scenarios are speculative. However, if kudzu
continues as an important presence on the landscape, more research is need to
determine how kudzu affects the fire ecology of
native communities and ecosystems.</p>

<p>The following table lists fire return intervals for communities
or ecosystems throughout North America where kudzu may occur. This list is meant as a guideline to illustrate historic
fire regimes and is not to be interpreted as a strict
description of fire regimes for kudzu.</p>

<br />

Dormant-season fire top-kills live, overwintering, canopy-draped vines [<a href="#43">43</a>], and
can also kill root crowns of small, newly established plants [<a href="#33">33</a>]. 

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT">

Green kudzu foliage probably does not burn well due
to high water content.
Growing season fire may top-kill kudzu foliage if enough combustible fuel is
present to carry the burn [<a href="#3">3</a>]. Litter
from vegetation that has recently succumbed to kudzu competition, especially
persistent woody material, could provide substantial fuel. As of this writing (2002), there are no
published descriptions of fire effects on kudzu.

<br><br>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE">
PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Kudzu sprouts from the root crown after fire. It quickly reestablishes following dormant-season fire,
in some cases returning to previous levels of dominance by the 2nd postfire growing season
[<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

<p>
There is speculation that the heat pulse from a ground fire may promote
kudzu seed germination by increasing seedcoat permeability [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>]. Laboratory
experiments have demonstrated that seed dormancy may be broken by exposure to
high temperatures, which promotes seedcoat scarification and allows
permeability to water [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>]. Information on postfire kudzu seedling
establishment is lacking.</p>


<span class="subframeName">
<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE">
DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Because kudzu sprouts rapidly and vigorously after fire, questions
concerning susceptibility of foliage and stems to growing season fire may be
largely moot. Conditions likely to promote a surface fire of sufficient
severity to kill mature, well-developed root crowns, while theoretically
possible, have not been documented as of this writing (2002).

<br><br>

<span class="subframeName">
<a name="FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a></span>
<br />

Because fire may promote kudzu seed germination, managers should be aware of the
potential for emergence of new plants following burning [<a href="#39">39</a>]. Young kudzu plants are
relatively easy to eradicate because
they have not yet developed the extensive taproots of older plants.
Miller [<a href="#33">33</a>] recommends burning after herbicide treatments to
encourage germination of the kudzu seedbank, which can then be eliminated with
a follow-up herbicide treatment. Burning as a follow-up to herbicide treatment
can also bolster rapid recolonization of the site by native plants by removing
litter and increasing light availability [<a href="#61">61</a>]. Dense kudzu litter
remaining after herbicide treatments has been shown to inhibit germination of
the residual native seedbank [<a href="#43">43</a>].<br><br>

Burning may also be used to prepare sites for more efficient herbicide
application, and to reveal size and density of root crowns previously hidden
under dense litter [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>]. Burning kudzu prior to other management activities
can also reveal uneven terrain and other potential hazards previously hidden by
dense mats of vegetation and litter&nbsp;[<a href="#33">33</a>].

Kudzu has potential value as livestock forage [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>]; however, it is easily
overbrowsed, and its utility may not be sustainable [<a href="#66">66</a>]. Moreover, while it has been previously
cultivated for livestock use and grazing can be an effective control measure
(see Biological Control section below), kudzu has been identified as an invasive
pest plant throughout the South. It is not recommended for cultivation for any
purposes [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].

<p>Kudzu seeds are a favored food for northern bobwhite, comprising

<font face="Bell MT"><b>Impacts:</b></font>    
Kudzu invasion can have severe
negative impacts on native plant communities. Because of its rapid growth rate and habit of
growing over objects in its
path, kudzu can outcompete native plants and quickly dominate habitats where it
becomes established [<a href="#61">61</a>]. Kudzu infestations are typified by a
continuous blanket of&nbsp; monospecific foliage resulting in large-scale
alteration of biotic communities [<a href="#51">51</a>]. Patches larger than 100 acres
(40 ha) now exist in some areas of the South [<a href="#36">36</a>]. Plant densities in mature stands may be
1-2 plants per square foot or tens of thousands of plants per acre [<a href="#11">11</a>].

<p>   Spreading kudzu infestations can
eliminate forest cover by enveloping trees along margins of wooded areas. Trees
of any size may succumb to competition from arboreal kudzu vines, whose
prodigious foliage reduces light availability within the canopy.
Infested trees, especially shade-intolerant species such as native pines, are weakened
from reduced carbon fixation. Additionally, the accumulation of several years'
worth of vines draped within tree crowns provides enough downward tension that
even large trees can be pulled to the ground. Once kudzu has gained access to the forest canopy, it is capable of
spreading more quickly and aggressively throughout a contiguously forested area
during subsequent growing seasons [<a href="#33">33</a>].&nbsp;Presence of Japanese honeysuckle and other arboreal vines can exacerbate
kudzu invasiveness. Because kudzu climbs by twining, it can ascend and spread
into a forest canopy faster and more extensively by utilizing smaller-diameter
vines rather than having to twine around larger-diameter tree boles [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].</p>

<p>Kudzu has been characterized as &quot;perhaps the largest nonwoody weed
problem in forest management in the South&quot; [<a href="#36">36</a>]. Kudzu infestation can be costly to commercial timber producers by severely
impacting productivity. While eradication treatments can be expensive, allowing
kudzu to continue spreading only increases the acreage impacted and increases
the difficulty (and expense) of eradicating older, denser, more intractable
infestations [<a href="#35">35</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT"><b>Control:</b></font>   
Because kudzu is so invasive, control is best
equated with kudzu eradication [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>]. To ensure
complete eradication from a site and prevent reinvasion, every root crown must
be killed [<a href="#34">34</a>]. Well-established stands may require as long
as ten years to eradicate [<a href="#61">61</a>].</p>

<p>  Kudzu eradication becomes
increasingly difficult with increasing age of infestation [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>]. Because kudzu develops
large roots that store accumulated starch, older plants may be more resistant to
control efforts and require more persistent or intensive management [<a href="#33">33</a>]. Vines that have spread
vertically into tree canopies are
thought to be more vigorous and to sequester starch reserves more rapidly and in
greater quantity than prostrate-growing vines [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>].</p>

<p>Weakening and eventual eradication of kudzu usually requires frequent defoliation by a
single or several methods [<a href="#11">11</a>]. If managers are limited to a single defoliation treatment per year, it should be conducted in early fall (September
in most areas). Kudzu allocates nearly all its resources to stem and foliar growth during the growing
season, allocating few resources to root
storage until near the end of the growing season. Kudzu recovers from
defoliation by allocating root-stored resources to rapidly resume vigorous
foliage growth. Defoliation activities conducted during the growing
season can help deplete root energy stores and decrease plant vigor. However, fall defoliation is important to reduce
resource allocation to roots, and hopefully gain substantial momentum toward
eventual eradication [<a href="#64">64</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Physical/mechanical:</font> 
Physical or mechanical methods that destroy kudzu
foliage can weaken the plant by simultaneously limiting photosynthesis and
depleting root-stored energy reserves. For these methods to be
effective, especially when used alone, managers should be prepared
to apply them persistently and frequently, often for several years. For
old,&nbsp; well-established stands, these methods are likely to be ineffective or require
many years of intensive application. They are more likely to be effective when
used in combination with herbicides.</p>

<p>The time required for eradication is a function of how long it takes to deplete
root energy stores.&nbsp;Small, recently established patches (&lt; 10 years old) can be eliminated by
persistent weeding or mowing over a period of several (3-4) years [<a href="#61">61</a>].&nbsp;Frequent
mowing or cutting, ideally at 2-week intervals, weakens root crowns and
inhibits photosynthesis [<a href="#51">51</a>]. Frequent mowing can be efficient and effective as long as all root crowns are
in areas that are accessible [<a href="#44">44</a>].
</p>

<p>
Disking or cultivating infestations before and after chemical
control efforts weakens plants and enhances herbicide effectiveness [<a href="#33">33</a>]. Cultivation may be inappropriate
in natural areas or on steep or
rocky terrain.</p>

<p>
 Individual plants may be hand pulled, but the entire root crown must be removed to prevent
 re-establishment [<a href="#29">29</a>]. Root systems of small, initial infestations can
be excavated with a Pulaski or similar digging tool. All plant material
should be removed from the site and destroyed by burning or bagging [<a href="#51">51</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Biological:</font>   
Intensive grazing can be an effective control measure, where appropriate.
Young infestations (&lt; 25 years old) are easier to control with grazing than
older stands that have developed very large roots. Steady aboveground herbivory
will gradually deplete root energy reserves, inhibit accumulation of new carbon
stores by suppressing the amount of photosynthetic tissue, and prevent foliage from
spreading into previously uninfested areas. Grazing kudzu
infestations for 1 to 2 years prior to herbicide application can help to weaken
plants, potentially making chemical control efforts more effective [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Chemical:</font>   
Where appropriate, herbicides may be the most effective means
of eradicating kudzu, whether used alone or in combination with other methods. Below is a list of

<p>Single applications of herbicides can reduce kudzu foliage by up to 2
orders of magnitude. However, continued spot treatment is usually required
for several years for complete eradication
due to recalcitrant root crowns and substantial root-sequestered carbon reserves
that enable kudzu to resprout. Diligent monitoring and follow-up treatments
may be required for 10 or more years on some sites [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>]. Regrowth from surviving root
crowns may often be delayed until 2 years after herbicide treatment, with no signs of
survival during the 1st growing season. Several years of post-treatment monitoring
and retreatment may be needed to ensure 100%
mortality [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].</p>

<p>In general, herbicides are most effective against kudzu when applied after late May [<a href="#32">32</a>], although triclopyr was effective against tree-draped vines when applied
in spring prior to the appearance of new growth [<a href="#35">35</a>]. Herbicides such as those
listed above are likely to be most effective when applied near the end
of the growing season when plants are translocating stem and foliar nutrients
to root systems for dormant season storage [<a href="#61">61</a>]. Dormant-season herbicide application appears to be ineffective in controlling
kudzu [<a href="#48">48</a>].</p>

<p>Higher herbicide application rates may be required for effective control on
clayey or rocky soils or when infestations are older than 10 years [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>]. Kudzu populations growing in a prostrate form, compared with
plants growing vertically, are thought to be less vigorous and may be controlled
using lower application rates [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].</p>

<p><font face="Bell MT">Cultural: </font>
Planting grass in the fall following herbicide treatment has
been recommended in order to stabilize soil and to provide competition against
weakened kudzu plants and other weed species that may be present. Grasses are
not injured by some herbicides that can kill kudzu (e.g., picloram or clopyralid) [<a href="#33">33</a>].</p>

Planting competing vegetation that provides shade to treated sites, such as
dense plantings of pine seedlings, can improve the effectiveness of repeated
herbicide treatments [<a href="#21">21</a>], potentially reducing treatment duration.
