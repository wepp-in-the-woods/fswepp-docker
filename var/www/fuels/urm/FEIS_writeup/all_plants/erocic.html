<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Cutleaf filaree provides seasonal forage for rodents, desert tortoise,
big game animals, and livestock [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>].  The seeds are eaten by
upland game birds, songbirds, and rodents [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The food value of flowering cutleaf filaree in central Arizona is as
follows [<a href="#46">46</a>]:

                         Percent Composition

The seeds provide 5,505 calories per gram, or 8.92 calories per seed [<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Cutleaf filaree generally provides poor cover [<a href="#14">14</a>].  One ecotype in
Glenville, California, forms basal rosettes 16 inches (40 cm) in
diameter, providing fair to good cover for small birds and mammals [<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The presence or absence of cutleaf filaree pollen in fossil records,
sediment lakebeds, and artifacts has been used as a dating technique in
paleobotany and archeology [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Cutleaf filaree was one of the
first exotics to invade North America.  It was appaerently introduced in
California during the early 1700's by passing Spanish explorers [<a href="#51">51</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Range:  Cutleaf filaree is important forage for cattle, horses, and
domestic sheep in California, Nevada, and Arizona [<a href="#47">47</a>].  Annual yields
vary depending upon soil moisture.  Talbot and others [<a href="#43">43</a>] found that
cover of cutleaf filaree in a Tehema County, California range fluctuated
from 70 percent in 1934 to 30 percent in 1935, a drought year.  Other
factors also affect the availability of cutleaf filaree.  The plant is
sensitive to airborne pollutants, especially sulfur dioxide, which
causes extensive leaf and stem burn.  Cutleaf filaree yields are reduced
on some southern California and western Arizona ranges due to this
problem [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Otherwise, cutleaf filaree has excellent range
durability.  The plant is resilient under heavy grazing pressure.  When
developing fruits are consumed by stock, the plant rapidly grows short,
prostrate stems that produce new fruits.  These new stems and fruits are
relatively inaccessible to stock, especially horses and cattle [<a href="#22">22</a>].
When most of the cutleaf filaree within a range assumes this growth
form, the range is overgrazed.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Erodium cicutarium
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Cutleaf filaree is an exotic forb that may be cool- or warm-season,
depending on climate [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  The leaves of young plants form a basal
rosette.  Older leaves grow up to 12 inches (30 cm) long, becoming
decumbent to prostrate.  The persistent styles of this plant are 1 to 2
inches (2.5-5 cm) long and coil together at maturity, enveloping the
fruit at the base.  The fruit is a sharp-pointed, narrow capsule.  The
slender taproot is about 3 inches (8 cm) long [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Therophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Cutleaf filaree reproduces sexually [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Germination is triggered
by seasonal rains and soil temperatures that range between approximately
69 degrees Fahrenreit (21 deg C) during the day to 40 degrees Fahrenreit
(4 deg C) at night [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Light rains result in lower germination rates
than heavier rains [<a href="#5">5</a>].  When moist, the coiled styles enveloping the
seed expand, uncoil, and drive the arrow-shaped fruit into the ground
[<a href="#16">16</a>].  Seed can be driven as deep as 1 inch (2.5 cm), although seed
buried less deeply is more likely to germinate [<a href="#52">52</a>].  Young and others
[<a href="#52">52</a>] report an average germination success rate of 14 percent.  Plants
are sexually mature 2 to 4 months following germination [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Seed
either falls beneath the parent plant or is disseminated by animals.
Rodents frequently bury cutleaf filaree seed in a food cache where
uncomsumed seed later germinates [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Seed also catches on animal fur
and is disseminated in that manner [<a href="#16">16</a>].  Seeds of Erodium spp. can
remain viable for many years, and form extensive seed banks [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Cutleaf filaree occupies a variety of different sites.  Site
characteristics are as follows:

Soil:  Cutleaf filaree grows in well-drained, clayey, loamy, or sandy
soil.  Variations in soil pH have been reported from moderately acid in
Tehema County, California to moderately alkaline in the Great Basin area
of central Utah [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>].

Climate:  Native to the Mediterranean area, cutleaf filaree flourishes in
the semiarid climate of the Southwest and the Mediterranean climate of
California [<a href="#47">47</a>].  It will tolerate a broad range of climates, however,
including the tropical climate of Hawaii and the cold, rainy climate of
the Pacific Northwest.  Cutleaf filaree can grow in areas that
experience harsh, snowy winters because its short growing period allows
it to complete its life cycle before the onset of freezing weather
[<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].

Elevation:  Cutleaf filaree occurs below 7,000 feet (2,134 m) [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Associated species:  The associated species of cutleaf filaree are too
numerous to list because of its global distribution.  Since cutleaf
filaree is mainly of intrest as a range plant, the associated range
species of cutleaf filaree in several western states are listed as
follows:

Arizona:  Saltbush (Atriplex polycarpa and A. lentiformis), mustard
(Cruciferae ssp.), foxtail chess (Bromus rubens), Mediterranean schismus
(Schismum barbatus), canyon grape (Vitis arizonica), blue palo verde
(Cercidium floridum) [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].

California:  Slender oat (Avena barbata), ripgut brome (B. rigidus),
littlehead clover (Trifolium microcephalum), early filaree (Erodium
obtusiplicatum) [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].

Idaho:  St. Johnswort (Hypericum perforatum), downy brome (B.
tectorum), quake-grass (B. brizaeformis), foxtail fescue (Festuca
megalura), western yarrow (Achillea millefolium), bigflower agosersis
(Agosersis grandiflora), spur lupine (Lupinus laziflorus), autumn
willow-weed (Epilobium paniculatum) [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].

Nevada:  Turpentine broom (Thamnosma montana), desert bitterbrush
(Purshia glandulosa), blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima), foxtail chess,
California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum), desert needlegrass (Stipa
speciosa) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

Cutleaf filaree is a pioneer on disturbed sites.  Wagner and others [<a href="#50">50</a>]
reported that cutleaf filaree seedlings were the first to emerge on
lands strip-mined for coal in New Mexico.  Cutleaf filaree may have been
an initial colonizer in open areas of the Mojave Desert [<a href="#51">51</a>].  It is
also a residual or a secondary colonizer, since seedlings can either
establish from on-site seed or from seed carried in by animals [<a href="#16">16</a>].  In
annual grassland communities, cutleaf filaree is an early- to mid-seral
stage plant, being intolerant of the mulch layer that builds up in older
communities [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Cutleaf filaree is replaced in annual grasslands by
ripgut brome and slender wild oat.  Cutleaf filaree will tolerate
partial shade, but vigor is reduced [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Seasonal development of cutleaf filaree varies depending upon climate.
Plant germinate in late fall in California, Nevada, and Arizona but
not start until midsummer of the following year in cold climates [<a href="#5">5</a>].
Plants in warm climates grow vigorously until winter, when growth slows.
Vigorous growth resumes in the spring.  In cold climates, growth is
continuous from spring or summer until plant death in early fall [<a href="#47">47</a>].
Gordon and Sampson [<a href="#18">18</a>] reported the following developmental data for
cutleaf filaree in O'Neal, California:

                       germination - November
                       early leaf stage - December
                       flowers in bloom - March
                       seeds ripe - May
                       seeds disseminated - June
                       plant death - June

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Plant adaptations:  Seed driven into the soil by the styles is usually
protected  from fire [<a href="#52">52</a>].

Fire ecology:  The prostrate stems of cutleaf filaree aid in spreading
groundfire.  Dead plants contribute to fuel loads.

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Erodium cicutarium
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Moderate fire kills mature plants [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Grass fires are typically light
to moderate, and very young seedlings can survive fires of that
severity.  Dennis [<a href="#13">13</a>] found that newly germinated cutleaf filaree
seedlings just beneath the litter layer were not harmed by a moderate
grass fire in Mendocino National Forest, California.  Cutleaf filaree
seed in the litter layer remains viable following light fire, and seed
just under the litter layer remains viable following moderate fire.
Severe fire will kill seed unless it is buried 0.5 inch (1.25 cm) or
more deep [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
During the first postfire growing season, density of cutleaf filaree is
reduced, but biomass increases [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Seed production is highest at
postfire year 1, with cutleaf filaree populations peaking at postfire
year 2.  Callison [<a href="#10">10</a>] reported cutleaf filaree as providing an absolute
cover value of 0.2 percent in an unburned area in the Beaver Dam
Mountains of southwestern Utah.  Following a prescribed burn, the cover
value was 11.1 percent in the first postfire growing season, and 11.5
percent in the second.  Cover value declined from postfire year 3 and
after.  By postfire year 12, cutleaf filaree was no longer visible in
the plant community.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Range:  Frequent prescribed burning favors cutleaf filaree and other
forbs over annual grasses [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].  This is desirable when the climax
grass provides poor forage, such as ripgut brome.  Grassland fire typically
destroys very few seeds or other organic matter in the soil [<a href="#20">20</a>].  It
does destroy the overlying mulch layer that inhibits germination of
cutleaf filaree seeds [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].
