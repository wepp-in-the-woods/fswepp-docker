<b>COMMON NAMES : </b>
   slender wheatgrass


<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of slender wheatgrass is Elymus
trachycaulus (Link) Gould ex Shinners in the tribe Triticeae of
Gramineae [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].  There are at least three subspecies and six
varieties of this species, which differ in awn length, size and degree
of crowding of spikelets, and culm length.  Generally, plants at lower
elevations are tall and slender, bearing long culms, narrow spikes, and
separated spikelets.  Plants at higher elevations have short, thick
culms, dense, shortened spikes, and crowded spikelets.  All possible
gradations between these two growth habits are known to occur [<a href="#55">55</a>].
Recognized subspecies and varieties are as follows [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>]:

     E. t. ssp. latiglumis (Scribn. & J. G. Smith) Barkw. & D. R. Dewey
     E. t. ssp. trachycaulus Bark. & D. R. Dewey
     E. t. ssp. subsecundus (Link) Gould
     E. t. var. andinum (Scribn. & J. G. Smith) Beetle
     E. t. var. ciliatum (Scribn. & J. G. Smith) Gleason
     E. t. var. glaucum (Pease & A. H. Moore) Malte
     E. t. var. majus (Vasey) Fernald
     E. t. var. novae-angliae (Scribn.) Fernald
     E. t. var. unilaterale (Vasey) Malle

Extensive hybridization and introgression occurs in Triticeae.  Slender
wheatgrass produces natural hybrids, some of which are unnamed, with the
following species [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>]:

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Slenderwheatgrass is widely used for revegetating disturbed lands.  It
has been used for rehabilitating mine spoils, oil-drilling sites,
livestock ranges, wildlife habitat, and watershed areas [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>].
There are three commercially-available slender cultivars commonly used
for rehabilitation:  'Primar', 'Revenue', and 'San Luis'.  'Primar' and
'Revenue' are recommended for use in the Great Plains [<a href="#14">14</a>].  'Revenue'
is greatly used for rangeland revegetation.  It has high seed and forage
yields, and is tolerant of saline and alkaline soils [<a href="#34">34</a>].  'Primar' is
also used for rangeland revegetation and has been used in subalpine
range improvement.  It was successfully established in a severely
overgrazed subalpine meadow (elev: 7,400 ft. [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#256">256</a>] m) in central
Nevada [<a href="#16">16</a>].  'San Luis' is recommended for use in Colorado, and is
noted for good seedling vigor, robustness, tall growth, and long life
[<a href="#34">34</a>].  Slender wheatgrass will establish in moist or dryland sites.
Allison [<a href="#1">1</a>] has detailed seeding methods.

Slender wheatgrass is used for rehabilitating alpine meadows and
other high elevation habitats [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Cultivars are not recommended for
this use; seed must be collected from alpine sites in late summer or
early fall.  Fall plantings yield higher rate of germination at high
elevation than do spring plantings.  Surface mulching is recommended
[<a href="#8">8</a>].

Slender wheatgrass has been used in a variety of watershed projects,
including reclaiming logged-over watershed areas, improvement of
subalpine watershed, and streambank and streambottom improvement
[<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>].  A watershed rehabilitation project in New Mexico increased
available water run-off by 40 percent following seeding with slender
wheatgrass and other grasses [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Slender wheatgrass is planted using a seed mix selected for the
particular rehabilitative purpose.  The mix consists of other grasses,
and may contain forb seed as well.  Possible companion seeds are too
numerous to list.  A selected few which have been used successfully
include western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii), intermediate wheatgrass
(Thinopyrum intermedium), blue wildrye (Elymus glaucus spp. glaucus),
tall oatgrass (Arrhenatherum elatius), and Parry clover (Trifolium
parryi).  Slender wheatgrass seedlings have also been successfully
transplanted onto disturbed sites [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Heavy metal and hydrocarbon tolerances:  Slender wheatgrass does well
in soils containing high levels of boron (10-20 p/m).  Some research
suggests that this species tolerates heavy and lead bitumen-contaminated
soils.  It did not establish well, however, on alkaline tailings in
Quebec that were contaminated by unidentified heavy metals [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Slender wheatgrass is cultivated on haylands of the northern Great Plains [<a href="#55">55</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Range:  Slender wheatgrass will maintain vigor indefinitely under
moderate grazing [<a href="#47">47</a>].  It is a decreaser on overgrazed cattle ranges
because its short rootstocks cannot withstand heavy grazing as well as
species with well-developed rhizomes [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  Ellison [<a href="#17">17</a>] reported
slender wheatgrass as scarce on overgrazed cattle ranges of the Wasatch
Plateau, Utah, but plentiful in areas inaccessable to livestock.
Slender wheatgrass has increased on some mountain ranges following heavy
use by sheep, however, because sheep will only lightly graze the leaves
of coarser ecotypes [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Slender wheatgrass cover at five different
levels of livestock grazing in Riding Mountain National Park, Manitoba
was as follows [<a href="#53">53</a>]:

                        Mean Foliage Cover (%)                          
                         slight use     11.0
                         light use       8.7
                         moderate use   16.9
                         heavy use      28.5
                         severe use      2.0 

Slender wheatgrass populations decrease when livestock are allowed to
graze during flowering and seed set [<a href="#42">42</a>].

Slender wheatgrass has been used to inhibit the highly unpalatable Rocky
Mountain iris (Iris missouriensis) on ranges overtaken by the iris [<a href="#16">16</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Elymus trachycaulus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Slender wheatgrass is a perennial, cool-season, short-lived, coarse,
tufted bunchgrass.  Leaves are from 3 to 13 inches (8-33 cm) long and
0.25 to 0.5 inch (0.6-1.3 cm) wide, with basal leaves longer than upper
leaves.  The culms are erect, ranging from 6 to 48 inches (8-120 cm) in
height, and bear terminal, erect spikes [<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].  The root system is
dense, consisting of coarse and fine fibrous roots which extend beyond
12 inches (30 cm) in depth.  One author has reported this species as
having short rhizomes [<a href="#23">23</a>].  The dense root system makes this species
moderately drought tolerant [<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Slender wheatgrass is a self-pollinated or wind-pollinated
species with heavy seed production [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Seed is disseminated by
transport on animal hides.  The seed, stored in seed banks, remains
viable for 3 to 6 years, with a germination capacity of 80 to 90
percent.  This species requires 1- to 2-month short night/long day
stratification prior to germination.  The temperature and light regime
required for optimal germination fluctuates from a daily minimum of 59
degrees Fahrenheit (15 deg C) for 16 hours without light to a maximum of
77 degrees (25 deg C) for 8 hours with light [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Slender
wheatgrass requires a moderately moist bare mineral or lightly mulched
seedbed.  It is a good competitor on disturbed sites for the first 2 to
3 years.  Seedling establishment is often poor in older communities
because seedlings to not grow well in thatch or other heavy litter [<a href="#40">40</a>].
Generally, seed dispersal and seedling establishment is the primary
method of reproduction in this species [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Considerable variation,
however, has been noted among northern ecotypes in both seed production
and vegetative reproduction.

Vegetative:  Slender wheatgrass reproduces asexually by tillering [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Widely distributed, slender wheatgrass has numerous ecotypes that occur
in widely differing climates.  Slender wheatgrass is found on semiarid
ranges, in temperate and boreal forests, and in subalpine, alpine, and
subarctic habitats [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  More detailed site characteristics are as
follows:

Soil:  Slender wheatgrass grows in dry to moist, medium-textured soil.
It tolerates silt and clay but does best on sandy loam.  This species
has a high salt tolerance.  Soil pH usually ranges from moderately acid
to moderately alkaline, although it has been reported growing in soils
with a pH as high as 8.8 [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

Precipitation:  Slender wheatgrass requires from 10 to 20 inches (25 -
50 cm) of annual precipitation [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Elevation:  The following ranges in elevation have been reported for
slender wheatgrass in several western states [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>]:

AZ: 5,000-12,000 ft (1,370-3,660 m)
CA: below 11,000 ft (3,330 m)
CO: 4,500-12,000 ft (1,370-3,600 m)
UT: 4,500-12,200 ft (1,370-3,660 m)


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

Slender wheatgrass is a pioneer in primary and secondary succession.  It
is among the first grasses to establish in gravelly pockets of soil on
talus slopes of the Wasatch Plateau, Utah, and has colonized abandoned
coal mine spoils in Alberta, Canada [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  Slender wheatgrass is
often dominant in early seral grassland communities due to its high seed
production, and is also a dominant or codominant understory species in
early seral forest and woodland communities [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Populations
decrease in all three community types at later stages.  Slender
wheatgrass planted with crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum) on a
disturbed grassland range in Alberta declined from 69.5 percent of total
herbage production in the first year to 2.6 percent after 4 years [<a href="#23">23</a>].
Litter buildup in older communities reduces flowering and seedling
establishment in this species [<a href="#41">41</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  It is somewhat shade tolerant
and persists in the community as a minor plant associate through the
climax stage [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Development varies depending upon latitude, elevation, and time of
snowmelt.  Generally, slender wheatgrass develops as follows [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>]:

                       Northern Range         Southern Range
growth starts          following snowmelt     early spring
flowers                July-Aug               May-Oct
seeds ripe             Aug-Sept               June-Nov
seeds disseminated     Sept-Oct               Sept-Nov

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Slender wheatgrass is a short-lived species that is favored by summer or
fall fires [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  The dense roots survive, and plants establishes from
tillers and soil-stored seed in the seed bank.

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Elymus trachycaulus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Moderate-severity fire will top-kill slender wheatgrass and kill some
tillers [<a href="#59">59</a>].  Fire effects upon this species differ according to the
growth habit of the variety.  Elymus trachycaulus spp.  trachycaulus,
for example, has moderately to densely clustered long leaves and stems.
Studies show that bunchgrasses of this form generate high temperatures
at the soil surface because fire burns down into the clump, resulting in
tiller and root damage [<a href="#64">64</a>].  Tall, decadent plants with many dead basal
leaves sustain the most fire damage.  E.  trachycaulus spp. latiglumis,
having a short, sparse growth form, is least likely to sustain damage to
the root system during fire [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Plant response varies with season and fire severity.  Slender wheatgrass
is most sensistive to spring fire that coincides with its active growing
period [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].  Three months following spring fire in a bracken
fern-grassland community in northeastern Wisconsin, slender wheagrass
frequency was reduced by 19.6 percent [<a href="#57">57</a>].  Moderate-severity summer
and fall fires usually do not affect the frequency of slender wheatgrass
[<a href="#31">31</a>].  Postfire recovery of this species is rapid.  Biomass production
is lowered the first year, but original biomass is equalled or exceeded by
postfire year 2.  Biomass production is usually highest at postfire year
3.  By postfire year 4 production has usually reuturned to prefire
levels.  Moderate-severity fire causes the greatest increase in biomass.
Variations in biomass production according to fire severity were noted
in western Wyoming at postfire year 3 [<a href="#4">4</a>]:

                  Biomass Production (air-dry kg/ha)              
                
                before     light     moderate     severe
                burning    burn        burn        burn
                  49        57         139          60

Flower production usually increases following fire, especially on
sites already disturbed prior to fire [<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Frequent spring fire coinciding with the active growing period can be
used to control slender wheatgrass [<a href="#2">2</a>].  In mixed stands, summer or fall
burning favors slender wheatgrass by removing the thatch or litter layer
that inhibits seedling establishment [<a href="#41">41</a>].
