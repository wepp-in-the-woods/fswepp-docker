<center><h2>DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Abies procera
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Noble fir occurs in the Cascade Range from Stevens Pass, Washington,
south to southern Oregon and the Klamath Mountains in northern Calfornia
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  Scattered populations occur on isolated peaks in the
northern Coast Ranges of Oregon and in the Willapa Hills of southwestern
Washington [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].  A few sources indicate that noble fir does not
occur in the Olympic Mountains [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  It is cultivated in Hawaii [<a href="#50">50</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Noble fir is often dominant in young, mixed stands [<a href="#21">21</a>].  It occurs
primarily in the Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis) zone [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>] and
less frequently in the western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and mountain
hemlock (T. mertensiana) zones [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Noble fir occurs with
Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and replaces it in the upper half of
the Pacific silver fir zone [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Occasionally, noble fir occurs in
small pure stands [<a href="#17">17</a>].

Noble fir is listed as a minor or associated species in the publications
listed below:

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Abies procera
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
The soft wood of noble fir is lightweight and has good form
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  It is the strongest wood of the true firs [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  The
wood is suitable for light construction and pulping [<a href="#16">16</a>].  High-quality
noble fir wood is used for moldings, sash and door stock, venetian
blinds, and veneer [<a href="#42">42</a>].  The wood of noble fir is also a specialty wood
used for ladder rails and airplane construction because of its high
strength to weight ratio [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Noble fir wood is exported to
Japan for home building [<a href="#16">16</a>].


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Noble fir provides cover and thermal protection for wildlife [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
On sizeable clearcuts or burned areas, noble fir can quickly establish;
however, actual data varies with site [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Noble fir brings a substantial price as a Christmas tree [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].
It is also utilized as ornamental greenery [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].

Noble fir is also important in watershed protection [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Noble fir is a preferred species for planting or seeding within its
range [<a href="#37">37</a>].  Based on 10-year performance, noble fir is acceptable for
reforestation of high-elevation stock in British Columbia with variable
results in productivity [<a href="#40">40</a>].  In the Pacific silver fir zone, noble fir
maintains good growth in dense stands and is appropriate where summer
frost is likely to occur but should not be planted in severe frost
pockets of clearcuts [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Noble fir is not recommended for planting on
sites with a slope of less than 15 degrees [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

Noble fir roots deeply making it resistant to wind damage [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>].  It has
a high frost tolerance and low drought tolerance [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].

Generally, noble fir does not suffer major losses from pests [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].
Noble fir bark beetle (Pseudohylesinus nobilis) is often associated with
root-diseased trees and can kill the tree [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Dwarf mistletoe may
be a problem requiring management action in some areas [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Abies procera
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Noble fir is a native, long-lived conifer [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  It usually lives
up to 400 years, with a maximum of 600 to 700 years [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Mature
noble fir can reach 230 feet (70 m) in height and 45 to 60 inches
(114-152 cm) in d.b.h. [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].

The trunk is self-pruning and pillarlike [<a href="#1">1</a>].  The crown is often open
and dome-shaped with short, horizontal branches [<a href="#1">1</a>].  The bark of young
noble fir is thin but becomes thick with age [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Cones are erect
and generally 11 to 18 inches long [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Noble fir begins producing seed at 25 to 30 years of age, but
large-volume crops are not produced until age 35 to 50 [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Good
seed crops are produced at 3- to 6-year intervals [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].

Seed quality is often poor [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Cone crops need to be medium size or
better for sound seed to exceed 10 percent [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Cone and seed
collection, drying, and storage techniques are discussed in the
literature [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Insects that cause some losses are also discussed [<a href="#45">45</a>].
Seeds are disseminated by wind.  Seeds can be dispersed up to 2,000 feet
(367 m) from the source, but most fall within one or two tree height of
the parent [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].

Seeds usually germinate in the spring after they are shed [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  Seeds
remain viable for only 1 year.  A mineral seedbed in relatively open
areas is favorable for seedling establishment and growth [<a href="#22">22</a>].
Competing vegetation and frosts deter regeneration of noble fir [<a href="#18">18</a>].

As with other firs, initial juvenile growth is slow [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Noble
fir requires 5 to 12 years to reach breast height, depending on site
condition [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Growth from a sapling stage to maturity is rapid,
allowing noble fir to attain site dominance [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  As the tree ages,
growth slows [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Where they occur together, noble fir growth exceeds
Douglas-fir after 100 years [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Noble fir does not reproduce vegetatively [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Noble fir occurs in a maritime climate with cool summers and mild, wet
winters [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Annual precipitation is between 72 and 106 inches
(1,960-2,650 mm) [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Most of the precipitation occurs between
October and March, resulting in snowpacks of 3 to 10 feet (1-3 m)
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  The growing season in the Pacific silver fir zone averages 40
to 50 days [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Noble fir grows well on a variety of sites.  It occurs on steep slopes
but grows best on gentle slopes and warm southern aspects [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].
Shallow or moderately deep loams support good growth [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Inceptisols
and Spodosols are common.  Soils are typically developed in volcanic
parent materials [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Water supply is apparently more important
than soil quality [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].
  
In the northern Cascades, noble fir is most common between 3,000 and
5,500 feet (900-1,650 m) in elevation.  It can occur below 2,500 feet
(706 m) but is sparse [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  Farther south near Crater Lake
National Park, Oregon, noble fir occurs from 5,500 to 8,000 feet
(1,670-2,425 m) [<a href="#1">1</a>].

Canopy associates not listed in Distribution and Occurrence are western
larch (Larix occidentalis), Brewer spruce (Picea breweriana), and
Alaska-cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis) [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  Understory
associates include huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.), vine maple (Acer
circinatum), devil's club (Oplopanax horridum), beargrass (Xerophyllum
tenax), dogwood bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), coolwort foamflower
(Tiarella unifoliata), vanillaleaf (Achlys triphylla), queencup beadlily
(Clintonia uniflora), and fairybells (Disporum hookeri) [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Noble fir is a seral or pioneer species [<a href="#18">18</a>].  It is the most shade
intolerant of the American true firs [<a href="#18">18</a>] and cannot regenerate under a
closed forest canopy [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Noble fir often establishes with
Douglas-fir [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  It establishes after disturbances such as
wildfire that create major stand openings [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  Even-aged stands are
common [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  Noble fir is classified as intermediate in shade
tolerance.  Overtopped seedlings of noble fir occasionally persist, and
in the Oregon Coast Ranges, seedlings sometimes establish in partial
shade [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Noble fir is eventually replaced by shade-tolerant species
such as Pacific silver fir and western hemlock [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Male and female bud burst occurs in May and early June, and is followed
by pollen shed in June and early July [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].  Pollen shedding
and female receptivity are well synchronized in noble fir [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].
Cones ripen in mid- to late September, and seed dispersal begins in
early October [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>]. Seed dissemination requires wind action or
other branch movement to disturb the cone [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  Height growth is
greatest in July [<a href="#27">27</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Abies procera
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
The bark of young noble fir is relatively thin [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Fire resistance of
larger, thicker barked trees is reported to be low [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>] to moderate
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>].  The foliage of noble fir is moderately to highly flammable
[<a href="#35">35</a>].

Noble fir prunes well in closed, dense stands [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Stands dominated
by noble fir have the smallest quantites of forest floor material
(compared with stands dominated by other western conifers that occur in
its range), and accumulation of fuel is low [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].

After stand-destroying fires, noble fir and Douglas-fir are initial
colonizers [<a href="#43">43</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Tree without adventitious-bud root crown
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Specific information regarding fire-related mortality is lacking.
Because of its thin bark, however, it is assumed that young and immature
noble fir would likely be killed by moderate to severe fire.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
After a clearcut, seedling density was greater on unburned or
low-intensity burned areas compared to areas that burned at moderate to
severe intensity [<a href="#27">27</a>].
