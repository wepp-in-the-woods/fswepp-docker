<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
New Jersey tea is a major understory dominant in the jack pine/scrub oak
(Pinus banksiana/Quercus spp.) forests in northern Wisconsin [<a href="#19">19</a>].  It
is also dominant in mesic areas of mixed-grass prairies of the Midwest
[<a href="#18">18</a>].  Understory associates of New Jesey tea include wintergreen
(Gaultheria procumbens), hazelnut (Corylus cornuta), mockernut hickory
(Carya tomentosa), serviceberry (Amelanchier spp.), low sweet blueberry
(Vacciniuim angustifolium), Canada blueberry (V.  canadense), bracken
fern (Pteridium aquilinum), Virginia strawberry (Fragaria virginiana),
striped maple (Acer pensylvanicum), northern bedstraw (Galium boreale),
raspberry (Rubus spp.), and rose (Rosa spp.)  [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ceanothus americanus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>



<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
New Jersey tea is browsed by white-tailed deer throughout the growing
season.  It is preferred browse in the spring and fall in central
Pennsylvania (5.0 to 21.8 percent relative utilization) [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Deer in
the Missouri Ozarks browse the twigs extensively in winter [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Many species of the genus Ceanothus, including New Jersey tea, are well
suited for use in rehabilitation because of rapid growth rates and an
ability to improve soil fertility through nitrogen fixation [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The root of New Jersey tea is astringent.  An alkaloid from the root has
been used for increasing blood coagulability, especially for the
prevention of hemorrhage from surgery [<a href="#35">35</a>].  The leaves were used as a
substitute for imported tea during the American Revolution [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ceanothus americanus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
New Jersey tea is a small- to medium-size shrub from 1.5 to 3.5 feet
(0.5-1.0 m) tall with numerous, slender, ascending branches. It has
shallow, fibrous root hairs near the surface and thick, burllike, deep,
woody roots.  Root crown diameter can be quite large after repeated
fires [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  The flowers are in small clusters on long axillary
peduncles.  The fruit is a three-lobed, dry, dehiscent capsule [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
New Jersey tea reproduces from seed and by sprouting.  It is propagated
from stem or root cuttings [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
New Jersey tea is widespread and can be found on dry open plains and
prairielike areas, on sandy or rocky soils in clearings at the edge of
woods, on riverbanks or lakeshores, in woodlands, and on hillsides
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

New Jersey tea is an early- to mid-seral species [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  It can
rapidly colonize disturbed sites where its nitrogen-fixing ability gives
it a competitive edge over other species [<a href="#7">7</a>].  New Jersey tea declines
as successional communities mature [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  New Jersey tea has
disappeared from a dry sand prairie in Indiana where it was observed in
1897.  Fire exclusion, woody plant invasion, and possibly pollution have
altered the structure and species composition in the area [<a href="#9">9</a>].  New
Jersey tea is found in greatest abundance at high light intensities
[<a href="#25">25</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
New Jersey tea flowers from May through July.  Its fruit ripens from
August to early October [<a href="#23">23</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Ceanothus americanus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
New Jersey tea is well adapted to fire [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>]. After being top-killed by
fire, it sprouts from rootsocks [<a href="#5">5</a>].  Where frequent fires occur it
becomes a conspicuous dominant forming clusters among prairie grasses.
It also occurs in oak woods of New York where fires have occured
frequently [<a href="#31">31</a>].  In black oak woodlands of nortwestern Indiana, New
Jersey tea was present in 2 areas with slightly different fire regimes.
New Jersey tea cover and frequency were greater where low-severity fires
occurred at mean intervals of 5.2 years than where more severe fires
occured less often (mean fire return interval=11.1 years) [<a href="#16">16</a>].  In
northern Minnesota it withstood grass fires better than any other shrub
[<a href="#28">28</a>].



<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Small shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
New Jersey tea is typically top-killed by fire [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
New Jersey tea responds positively to fire.  DeSelm and Clebsch [<a href="#8">8</a>]
reported that it showed a net increase in cover in both annual and
periodic burn treatments in Tennessee.  In oak woodlands of central New
York, the average frequency of New Jersey tea was higher on burned than
unburned sites (33% vs 17%) [<a href="#31">31</a>].  These accidental spring burns killed
or severely injured 16 percent of the oak trees present.  In an oak
savanna in east-central Minnesota, New Jersey tea was classified among
the "true prairie shrubs" that tended to increase in percent cover
following fire [<a href="#32">32</a>].
