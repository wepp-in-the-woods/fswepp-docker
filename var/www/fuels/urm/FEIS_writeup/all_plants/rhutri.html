<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Skunkbush sumac occurs as an indicator of climax in a number of plant
communities.  It has been identified as a codominant with the following
species:  bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata), big bluestem
(Andropogon gerardii var. gerardii), Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis),
true, true mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus), and little bluestem
(Schizachyrium scoparium).

Skunkbush sumac is listed as a habitat type indicator in the following
publications:

Grassland and shrubland habitat types of the Shoshone National Forest [<a href="#41">41</a>]
Grassland and shrubland habitat types of western Montana [<a href="#31">31</a>]

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Because the fruit of skunkbush sumac persists through the fall and
winter, this species can provide a ready food source for birds and small
mammals when other foods are scarce or unavailable [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Birds
utilizing skunkbush sumac fruit include the prairie chicken, wild
turkey, pheasant, sage grouse, ruffed grouse, many species of quail, and
numerous songbirds [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Squirrels, mice, and other small mammals also
consume large quantities of the fruit [<a href="#39">39</a>].

Skunkbush sumac provides some browse for deer, elk, and pronghorn when
other more preferred forage is unavailable [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>].  In most
locations, big game use tends to be heaviest during the winter when food
supplies are most limited.  Skunkbush is reported to be an important
summer food for mule deer in the Missouri Breaks of Montana [<a href="#38">38</a>].
However, east of this area in the North Dakota Badlands, very little
mule deer use was reported for any season [<a href="#38">38</a>].  The foliage and twigs
of skunkbush sumac are browsed by rabbits in many areas and to a more
limited extent by porcupines in the North Dakota Badlands [<a href="#38">38</a>].

In certain locations, livestock use skunkbush sumac to some degree, but
it is not a preferred species [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Skunkbush sumac is most palatable
to livestock in Colorado and the Southwest [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Domestic goats
consume fairly large amounts of skunkbush sumac in some areas [<a href="#9">9</a>].  It
is described as "well-used" by horses in parts of Colorado [<a href="#38">38</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The palatability and degree of use shown by livestock and and wildlife
species for skunkbush sumac in several western states has been rated as
follows [<a href="#12">12</a>]:

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Skunkbush sumac is rated fair in energy value and poor in protein value
[<a href="#12">12</a>].  The fruits are reported to provide a good source of vitamin A
during the winter [<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Skunkbush sumac often forms dense thickets that provide good hiding
cover for many small birds and mammals.  This species also furnishes
excellent nesting sites for many species of songbirds.  The degree to
which skunkbush sumac provides environmental protection during one or
more seasons for wildlife species has been rated follows [<a href="#12">12</a>]:

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Skunkbush sumac has low potential for short-term revegetation but high
to moderate potential for long-term revegetation [<a href="#12">12</a>].  This
low-maintenance species may have value for erosion control [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>]
and dune stabilization [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Skunkbush sumac has been used for roadside
plantings in disturbed areas [<a href="#42">42</a>].

Var. trilobata has been successfully transplanted onto phosphate mine
spoils in Idaho [<a href="#29">29</a>].  'Bighorn,' a cultivar from Wyoming, has been
widely planted on pinyon-juniper sites and is reported to have good
rehabilitation potential for many parts of the Southwest [<a href="#17">17</a>].
Skunkbush sumac has been successfully transplanted in aspen (Populus
tremuloides)- maple (Acer spp.), pinyon-juniper, and mountain-brush
zones [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

Skunkbush sumac can be readily propagated from root cuttings and
transplanted onto disturbed sites [<a href="#6">6</a>].  Properly treated seed can be
planted in the fall without stratification or in the spring if the seed
is treated and then stratified before planting [<a href="#39">39</a>].  However, fall and
winter plantings produce the best results [<a href="#42">42</a>].  The presence of seeded
grasses has reduced the survival of skunkbush sumac at some sites [<a href="#14">14</a>].
Smooth sumac exhibits a moderate growth rate [<a href="#34">34</a>] and generally takes 10
to 20 years to reach maturity [<a href="#27">27</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Skunkbush sumac, first cultivated in 1877, has been used as an
ornamental and for windbreaks and shelterbelts [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  It has been
widely planted at recreation sites and rest areas [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Skunkbush sumac
is relatively unpalatable and has been planted in some locations as a
deterrent to grazing animals [<a href="#42">42</a>].

Native Americans valued the skunkbush sumac and made use of the fruit,
twigs, leaves, and shoots.  The fruits were used in foods and medicines,
and in the preparation of lemonadelike beverages [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Pliable young
stems were woven into durable baskets, and the leaves were smoked by the
Comanches [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Skunkbush sumac was also used in making dyes for
clothing [<a href="#1">1</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
The morphologically and ecologically diverse skunkbush sumac exhibits
variable responses to grazing.  It is generally reported to be tolerant
of heavy grazing [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Mueggler and Stewart [<a href="#31">31</a>] reported that in
Montana, continued livestock overgrazing can cause skunkbush sumac to
increase, while winter overuse by big game often causes it to decrease.

Although skunkbush sumac is generally tolerant of drought,
water-stressed seedlings may be stunted for several years and sometimes
fail to recover [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Seedlings are intolerant of crowding, even under
optimal conditions, and competition with other species can be
detrimental to the growth of young seedlings [<a href="#27">27</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Rhus trilobata
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Skunkbush sumac is a native, perennial, cool-season shrub which grows 2
to 8 feet (0.5-2.5 m) in height [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Height as well as growth form
varies by geographic location:  skunkbush sumac is more branched and
compact in the Southwest and taller in the north [<a href="#17">17</a>].  The growth form
of this thicket-forming shrub [<a href="#39">39</a>] may be rounded, moundlike, or upright
[<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Crown diameter is often greater than the height of the plant
and may reach up to 30 feet (9.2 m) [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Many ecotypes are known to
occur.  Varieties are distinguished by morphological characteristics
such as growth form, height, leaf shape and size, fruit shape and
pubescence.

Branches are alternate and have been described as "ill-scented" [<a href="#40">40</a>].
Fine slender stems spread from the woody branches [<a href="#44">44</a>].  The compound,
alternate leaves are green above but pale below and are unpleasantly
aromatic when crushed [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Leaflets grow in groups of three and are
waxy, and soft-textured [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  The leaves turn a bright red or orange
in the fall.

Numerous small, yellowish-green to cream-colored flowers are borne on
spikelike panicles near the tips of branches [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  The fruit is a
small, red or reddish-orange drupe containing a single nutlet [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].
The fruit is highly acidic [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Honeybees and other insects promote
cross-pollination of sumac flowers [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Skunkbush sumac has a moderate growth rate [<a href="#34">34</a>]; growth is most rapid
during the first 3 to 5 years [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Growth rates are strongly
influenced by soils and other site characteristics.  Longevity of this
species is not known; healthy rhizomes have been aged at more than 30
years [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Windbreak plantings have remained healthy and vigorous for
more than 20 years.

The roots of skunkbush sumac are deep and extensively branched.  The
woody rhizomes are shallow and spreading [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Rhizomes may extend
underground connecting shrubs more than 30 feet (9.2 m) apart [<a href="#38">38</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Skunkbush sumac produces some seed nearly every year [<a href="#6">6</a>].  The
number of flowers that produce fruit is relatively low.  It was
estimated that only 5 to 15 percent of skunkbush sumac flowers in a
North Dakota shrub community actually produced fruit [<a href="#38">38</a>].  In this
study, the successful flower-to-fruit ratio ranged from 0 to 27.4
percent, with branches from 6 to 10 years of age producing the most
viable fruit [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Similar documetation for other areas is lacking.

Germination of skunkbush sumac seed is variable.  Many researchers
report poor or erratic germination [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>], while others report fairly
good results [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Ecotypic variability probably accounts for at
least some of the differences in germination response noted.

Seeds are usually dispersed by birds and mammals.  Roadside
establishment is frequently attributable to germination of seed in
caches of mice and squirrels [<a href="#42">42</a>].

Vegetative:  Skunkbush sumac has spreading woody rhizomes and sprouts
readily from both the root and crown after disturbance [<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Skunkbush sumac occurs in a variety of habitats including dry rocky
slopes, along streams and canyon bottoms, waste places, pastures,
roadsides, and on sand dunes [<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  It also grows as a secondary
species in plains sandhills where it often forms dense thickets [<a href="#44">44</a>].
Var. arenaria grows primarily on sand dunes of the Great Lakes region
[<a href="#1">1</a>].

Skunkbush sumac is drought resistant; it is intolerant of flooding and
high water tables [<a href="#44">44</a>].  It typically grows where maximum annual
precipitation ranges from 10 to 20 inches (254-510 mm) [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Skunkbush
sumac grows well in sun or partial shade [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].

Skunkbush sumac is tolerant of a wide range of soils from nearly bare
rock to sand and heavy clay [<a href="#24">24</a>].  It grows well on medium to coarsely
textured, moist to dry, acidic to slightly alkaline soils [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].
Skunkbush sumac can continue to grow even when partially covered by sand
or when roots are exposed by wind.  Growth is optimal in fairly deep
soil [<a href="#43">43</a>].  Skunkbush sumac grows well on depleted soils [<a href="#39">39</a>].

Elevational ranges are as follows [<a href="#12">12</a>]:

        from 4,500 to 7,000 feet (1,373-2,135 m) in Arizona
             3,500 to 9,000 feet (1,068-2,745 m) in Colorado
             1,900 to 4,800 feet (580-1,464 m) in Montana
             1,900 to 7,200 feet (580-2,196 m) in Utah
             4,400 to 7,700 feet (1,342-2,349 m) in Wyoming

Skunkbush sumac grows well in the mountain-brush and pinyon-juniper
zones, and in the central grassland and Rocky Mountain chaparral [<a href="#35">35</a>].
In streambottoms, sumac commonly grows in association with alders (Alnus
spp.), serviceberries (Amelanchier spp.), and chokecherries (Prunus
spp.)  [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Common plant associates in pinyon-juniper woodlands
include pinyon (Pinus edulis), Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma),
rubber rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus nauseosus), broom snakeweed
(Gutierrezia sarothrae), Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), blue grama
(Bouteloua gracilis), and galleta (Hilaria jamesii) [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Skunkbush
sumac also occurs with the mountain-mahoganies (Cercocarpus spp.), big
sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), silver sagebrush (A. cana),
buffaloberries (Shepherdia spp.), shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla
fruticosa), and many perennial grasses [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Skunkbush sumac sometimes
grows in nearly pure stands [<a href="#39">39</a>].



<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Skunkbush sumac is a climax indicator in a number of shrub and grassland
communities.  It readily sprouts after fire or other disturbance and is
also a prominent species in many early seral communities.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
In many areas, annual growth of skunkbush sumac begins in April or May.
Growth begins in May in the North Dakota Badlands, slows during April,
and is completed by early July [<a href="#38">38</a>].  Flowers of skunkbush sumac develop
early in the spring prior to leaf emergence [<a href="#21">21</a>].  Fruit generally
ripens from August to October [<a href="#39">39</a>].  In Utah, berries mature from June
20 to October 10 [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Fruit persists throughout the winter [<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].
Leaves generally fall after the first frost [<a href="#9">9</a>].

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Skunkbush sumac generally sprouts vigorously from the root crown and
rhizomes following fire [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Crown width and overall coverage
often increase in response to fire [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].  Skunkbush sumac may have the
ability to delay sprouting for up to a year following fire [<a href="#38">38</a>].  This
adaptation may significantly enhance survival in some harsh
environments.

Although vegetative reproduction is the primary mode of reestablishment
after fire, skunkbush sumac may also reproduce through seed.  Evidence
suggests that some species of Rhus are effective seedbankers, with seed
stored in the humus layer [<a href="#33">33</a>].  These seeds germinate when fire creates
conditions favorable for growth [<a href="#33">33</a>].  It is not known if skunkbush
sumac is a seedbank species. Postfire recovery time of skunkbush sumac
has not been well documented.

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Skunkbush sumac is rarely killed by fire even when all aboveground
vegetation is removed [<a href="#27">27</a>].  The presence of woody rhizomes, and its
propensity for sprouting, minimize the effect of fire on skunkbush sumac
[<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Skunkbush sumac sprouts vigorously from rhizomes or from the root crown
when aboveground vegetation is consumed by fire [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].
Overlying soil apparently protects these reproductive structures from
most fires.

Postfire recovery time has not been well documented for this species.
However, only 2 years after a fire in an Arizona chaparral community,
the number of sprouts was five times the number of original branches
[<a href="#38">38</a>].  This suggests that skunkbush sumac may have the ability to
recover quickly following most fires.

Little documentation exists on potential differences in response
according to season of burn or fire severity.  Few published accounts
note response by season, although researchers have reported increases in
skunkbush sumac after mid to late spring burns in South Dakota [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Skunkbush sumac typically increases after fire.  Gartner and Thompson
[<a href="#18">18</a>] reported the following percent composition and frequency of
skunkbush sumac on burned and unburned sites in the Black Hills of South
Dakota:

                1970               1970               1971
          composition (%)       frequency (%)       frequency (%)   
      control       burn       control    burn     control    burn
        0.0          2.2          0         2         2        2

Cover of skunkbush sumac typically increases after fire, although
average plant size is reduced for a time.  In a Black Hills ponderosa
pine forest, average heights and crown widths were significantly less
after prescribed burns.  Results were as follows {3]:
