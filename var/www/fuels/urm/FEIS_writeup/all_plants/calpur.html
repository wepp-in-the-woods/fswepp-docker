<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Early in the season this grass is grazed readily by all classes of
livestock, but after midsummer it is grazed only lightly or moderately
by cattle and horses.  It is also consumed by bighorn sheep [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The relish and degree of use shown by livestock for purple pinegrass in
Utah is rated as good for cattle, fair for sheep, and good for horses
[<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Purple pinegrass has been rated as fair in energy value and poor in
protein value [<a href="#9">9</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The degree to which purple pinegrass provides environmental protection
during one or more seasons for wildlife species is as follows [<a href="#9">9</a>]:

Waterfowl                ----     ----     Poor


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Reclamation of disturbed subalpine and alpine ecosystems is almost
totally dependent upon the use of adapted native species such as purple
pinegrass [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Fibrous roots as well as the ability to colonize hostile
sites makes this species a good soil builder and an effective tool in
erosion control [<a href="#14">14</a>].  This grass recovers well after oil spills and is
a useful species for reclamation of these sites [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Purple pinegrass
has been found on spoil heaps of abandoned subalpine coil-mined land
[<a href="#27">27</a>].  It has some potential for use in reclamation in the Rocky
Mountains of Alberta, but further research on genetic variability, seed
handling, and early management is needed [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Seeds of this grass
should be planted on disturbed sites in autumn in order to maximize the
opportunity for natural stratification.  Seeds should be stored at low
temperatures [0 deg F (-18 deg C)] to maximize their longevity [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Calamagrostis purpurascens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Purple pinegrass is an erect, densely tufted, native perennial grass
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  The culms, which are rough and rather stiff, generally
grow 1 to 3 feet (30-100 cm) tall.  Old blades are typically persistent
at the base of the plant [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].  The roots are fibrous and the
rhizomes are short and thick [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual reproduction:  Purple pinegrass compact heads are wind
pollinated, [<a href="#28">28</a>], and the seeds are wind dispersed [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Seed viability
varies each year because of the severe and unpredictable nature of its
environment [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Seeds collected from the Beartooth Plateau, Montana,
had a mean viability of 79 percent [<a href="#5">5</a>].  No significant response to
light conditions has been observed, but seeds have been found to
germinate better under wet-cold conditions than dry-cold conditions [<a href="#5">5</a>].

Vegetative reproduction:  Purple pinegrass will regenerate vegetatively
from underground rhizomes [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Purple pinegrass typically grows near or above timberline on open
ridges, dry rocky hills, and dry woods, as well as in moist parks and
meadows [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  It generally occurs from 8,000 to over 13,000
feet (2,591-3,962 m) in elevation [<a href="#9">9</a>].  This grass grows on sandy to
coarse textured soils [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  It mostly occurs on basic soils and will
tolerate mildly saline sites and drought conditions.  Purple pinegrass
grows best in full sunlight but will survive at reduced vigor under
partial shade [<a href="#14">14</a>].

Plant associates:  Purple pinegrass is commonly associated with the
following species:  limber pine (Pinus flexilis), lodgepole pine (P.
contorta), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), Ross sedge (Carex
rossii), timberline bluegrass (Poa rupicola), western yarrow (Achillea
millefolium var. lanulosa), oatgrass (Helictotrichon mortonianum), Rocky
Mountain selaginella (Selaginella densa), and upland bluegrass (P.
glaucantha) [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Purple pinegrass is an initial off-site colonizer of alpine communities
and will frequently persist in early to late seral stages [<a href="#5">5</a>].  This
grass also occurs among climax and successional fell-field vegetation
[<a href="#3">3</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Spring bud break of purple pinegrass in Colorado occurs in early to
mid-May [<a href="#1">1</a>].  In Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming, flowering generally
begins in early June to July and ends in August [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Autumn die-back
occurs October 10 to 15 [<a href="#1">1</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Calamagrostis purpurascens

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Purple pinegrass can establish on burned sites by wind-dispersed seeds
[<a href="#8">8</a>].  It can also sprout from on-site surviving rhizomes after fire.


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Rhizomatous herb, rhizome in soil
   Initial-offsite colonizer (off-site, initial community)

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Calamagrostis purpurascens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Purple pinegrass mortality following fire has not been widely
documented.  Fire, however, will presumably kill aboveground vegetation
of purple pinegrass.  Severe fires may kill belowground rhizomes.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Purple pinegrass will typically colonize sites after fire through
wind-dispersed seeds [<a href="#8">8</a>].  After low-severity fires this grass will
presumably sprout from on-site surviving rhizomes.  In the Rockies of
Alaska, purple pinegrass typically invades dry south-facing slopes after
fire.  This grass will persist here until the canopy closes; this
process, however, appears to be very slow in many places [<a href="#8">8</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
In subalpine and alpine habitats where purple pinegrass commonly occurs,
vegetation recovers slowly from disturbance because of the cold climate
and short growing season [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>].  The exposed nature of these sites may
increase the possibility of lightning strike, but the lack of fuels
reduces the likelihood of fire spreading through the stand.  The
subalpine grasslands that form the early successional stage may last a
century or more [<a href="#7">7</a>].
