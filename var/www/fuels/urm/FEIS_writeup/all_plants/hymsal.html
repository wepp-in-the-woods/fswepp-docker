<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
White burrobrush is found in the Sonoran, Mojave, and Colorado deserts
of Baja California, southern California, southern Nevada, extreme
southwest Utah, Arizona, and northwest Mexico [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  A small,
relict population occurs in the southern end of the Central Valley of
California [<a href="#12">12</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
White burrobrush is commonly found in creosotebush (Larrea tridentata),
shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia), and saltbush (Atriplex spp.) scrub,
Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia) woodlands, and pinyon-juniper woodlands
[<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  Johnson [<a href="#15">15</a>] describes a white burrobrush community type in
the desert washes of the Mojave Desert characterized by white
burrobrush, desert saltbush (Atriplex polycarpa), desert rabbitbrush
(Chrysothamnus paniculatus), and catclaw acacia (Acacia greggii).  Hanley
and Brady [<a href="#14">14</a>] describe a paloverde (Cercidium spp.)-white burrobrush
community type in Sonoran Desert washes.

In addition to the above mentioned species, white burrobrush is commonly
associated with smoke tree (Dalea spinosa), white bursage (Ambrosia
dumosa), brittle bush (Encelia farinosa), jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis),
sweetbush (Bebbia juncea), desert agave (Agave deserti), ocotillo
(Fouquieria splendens), range ratany (Kramerica parvifolia), teddybear
cholla (Opuntia bigelovii), desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), and
rubber rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus nauseosus) [<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].

A publication listing white burrobrush as a codominant species in desert
wash communities is listed below:

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
The Seri Indians of Sonora, Mexico, use white burrobrush twigs and stems
in several remedies.  The twigs or leaves are mixed with all-thorn
(Koeberlinia spinosa) twigs, boiled, and the tea taken to treat skin
rashes.  Seri also drank the tea to relieve pain in the lungs and
trachea, and to reduce swelling.  Additionally, they use white
burrobrush as a remedy for rheumatism [<a href="#10">10</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Hymenoclea salsola
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
White burrobrush is a native, short-lived, drought-deciduous, perennial
shrub 3 to 8 feet (1-2.5 m) tall and two- or three-fold as wide
[<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  It is rounded and often straggly with slender, puberulent
branches and narrow, often threadlike or needlelike leaves to 0.7 to 3
inches (2-7.5 cm) long [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  The flower heads are small and
numerous [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  White burrobrush has a shallow root system
consisting of a relatively short taproot with prominent laterals [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
White burrobrush reproduces mostly by seed but can also reproduce by
sprouting [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  Flowers are borne on 2-year-old branches which,
following fruit development, die back to the ground.  Flowers are wind
pollinated [<a href="#21">21</a>].  White burrobrush fruits contain only one seed and are
disseminated by wind or water [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>].

The seeds have high viability and germination rates compared to other
desert shrubs [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  In a 16-day germination study, they had one of
the highest rates of germination (57 percent) of seven species of desert
shrubs.  White burrobrush seedlings emerged well from 0.39- and
0.79-inch (1- and 2-cm) plantings but not from depths of 1.5 inches (4
cm) or more [<a href="#41">41</a>].  Stratification has been shown to have no effect on
germination rate.  Seed treatments used to increase white burrobrush
germination in the laboratory, and their results, have been described by
Graves and others [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
White burrobrush is commonly found in sandy washes, alluvial fans, and
rocky slopes [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  It generally grows on well-drained, sandy,
alkaline soils [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>], and is found at elevations between 2,200 and
2,950 feet (670-900 m) [<a href="#39">39</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species 

White burrobrush is a short-lived pioneer or invader species.  It is
common and often very abundant on disturbed sites [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  White
burrobrush is often the primary short-lived pioneer species found in
small desert washes [<a href="#36">36</a>].  It may be present in very low numbers in
stable, old creosotebush communities [<a href="#36">36</a>].  The life span of white
burrobrush is not known but is estimated at only a few decades [<a href="#34">34</a>].

White burrobrush was the most abundant pioneer shrub on a disturbed
pipeline construction site in creosotebush scrub vegetation of the
Mojave Desert.  In some disturbed areas white burrobrush made up as much
as 85 percent of the vegetative cover 12 years after the original
vegetation had been removed [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Another Mojave Desert study of
disturbed creosotebush scrub, at three military camps abandoned for 40
years, found that white burrobrush was dominant in the majority of
disturbed sites.  It also had percentage cover values similar to or
greater than controls in most areas where substrate alterations were
significant [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
White burrobrush flowers from March through June [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  New leaf
and twig growth is initiated after summer and winter rains.  Both leaf
and twig tissues are thus present during the periods of peak seasonal
productivity [<a href="#6">6</a>].  At one site in southern Nye County, Nevada, the range
of beginning dates of phenophases over a 6-year period was as follows
[<a href="#1">1</a>]:

     leaf- March through April
     flower bud- mid-March through mid-April
     flower- early April through early May.

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Hymenoclea salsola
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fires are infrequent in communities where white burrobrush occurs
because of low productivity and discontinuous fuels [<a href="#23">23</a>]; nevertheless,
fire is a natural component of these communities [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  White
burrobrush establishes after fire via off-site seeds and sprouting
(sprout origin unspecified) [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  Because it seeds prolifically,
white burrobrush can quickly colonize burned sites [<a href="#38">38</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Hymenoclea salsola
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
White burrobrush is often top-killed by fire.  Most white burrobrush
plants were burned to ground level by a severe summer fire in the Snow
Creek area of Riverside County, California [<a href="#23">23</a>].  In a canyon in the San
Ysidro Mountains, California, a July wildfire in the chaparral-desert
ecotone top-killed nearly all white burrobrush plants.  Occasional small
pockets of plants in protected areas were not harmed [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
White burrobrush populations recover quickly after fire via off-site
seeds and sprouting [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  Five years after the Snow Creek fire,
white burrobrush frequency and cover were greater on burned than
unburned sites [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Following the July fire in the San Ysidro
Mountains, more than 90 percent of white burrobrush plants survived by
sprouting.  Some white burrobrush started sprouting within 2 months
after the fire.  Regrowth is summarized below [<a href="#29">29</a>]:
