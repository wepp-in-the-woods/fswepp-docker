<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Pink corydalis occurs in Alaska, throughout Canada, in the Pacific
Northwest, northern Rockies, north-central Midwest, the Northeast, and
Southeast.  It is distributed from Alaska south to British Columbia and
east to the Atlantic Coast extending from Newfoundland to Georgia.  In
the western United States, it is found only in Glacier National Park
[<a href="#15">15</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Pink corydalis has a high nutrient content because it rapidly takes up
nutrients in the soil that are made available following a fire [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Pink corydalis has potential for use in rehabilitation of disturbed
sites.  It grows well on disturbed sites and provides erosion
protection, yet it is not competitive, thus allowing natural succession
to proceed.  Germination characteristics and requirements have not been
tested in this species [<a href="#26">26</a>], but it is likely that the seeds would
require a heat treatment before seeding [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Cushwa, Martin, and
Miller [<a href="#27">27</a>] found that seeds with fire-enhanced germination would show
excellent germination results (75% after 3 days and more than 95%
cumulative) after being heated at 176 degrees F (80 degrees C) in an
atmosphere saturated with water vapor.  Mechanical scarification also
increased the germination rate.


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Pink corydalis has a disjunct population in Glacier National Park.
Additional populations may be discovered on recently burned areas.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Corydalis sempervirens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Pink corydalis is a native, bienniel or annual forb.  The flowers are
pink and yellow-tipped, perfect, and sympetalous with a single spur
[<a href="#10">10</a>].  It grows 8 to 30 inches (20-80 cm) tall, and the leaves are 0.1
to 0.2 inch (2.5-5 mm) wide [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Pink corydalis reproduces sexually.  It will flower in either the first
or second year.  It is pollinated by wind or ants [<a href="#12">12</a>].  The fruit is a
simple, dry, dehiscent capsule with 25 seeds [<a href="#10">10</a>].  There is evidence
that the seeds require heat before germination [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Pink corydalis grows in boreal forests and occurs almost exclusively on
disturbed areas [<a href="#1">1</a>].  It grows best in full light [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Pink corydalis
grows in dry, gravelly soil and in open to thin woods from low to fairly
high elevations [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].  It has been reported in climates with cold
winters and cool summers (mean January temperatures of -15 to 18 degrees
F [-26 to -8 C] and mean July temperatures of 63 to 66 degrees F [17-19
deg C]) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].

Pink corydalis often occurs in communities with the following overstory
dominants:  black spruce (Picea mariana), aspen (Populus tremuloides),
paper birch (Betula papyrifera), white spruce (Picea glauca), jack pine
(Pinus banksia), balsam fir (Abies balsamea), or tamarack (Larix
laricina).  Pink corydalis is most often found associated with other
postfire pioneers such as cranesbill (Geranium bicknellii), fireweed
(Epilobium angustifolium), bindweed (Polygonum cilinode), moosebrush
(Viburnum edule), and some sedges (Carex spp.)
[4,6,8,12,13,17,20,21,23,25].

In Glacier National Park, pink corydalis is found at Lake McDonald,
along Sperry Glacier Trail, at Many Glacier, Sun Camp, Mt. Altyn, and
along the west side of the Waterton River one-half mile south of
Waterton Lake [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

Pink corydalis is a pioneer species in secondary succession,
particularly after fires; it is generally present for 3 to 6 years
following fire [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  It develops best in full light and is
characterized by rapid invasion and growth [<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Vegetative growth occurs from May through August [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Flowering occurs
in July in Montana [<a href="#15">15</a>].

<pre>
<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Corydalis sempervirens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Pink corydalis is favored by fire.  Its long-lived, fire-resistant seeds
are stored in the soil seed bank, and germinate following fire
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Viable seed was found in an 80-year-old
spruce-pine stand in Alberta [<a href="#8">8</a>].  The plant grows quickly and rapidly
takes up nutrients made available after fire [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Ground residual colonizer (on-site, initial community)
   Secondary colonizer - on-site seed
   Secondary colonizer - off-site seed

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Corydalis sempervirens
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire generally kills pink corydalis.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Pink corydalis frequently invades recently burned areas [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Seeds
stored in the soil often germinate following fire [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  Pink
corydalis biomass generally peaks the second growing season after fire
[<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].

The species is generally not found in areas that have not been recently
burned, although seed may be present in the soil [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  Pink corydalis
has been reported to increase in lightly, moderately, and heavily burned
areas [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>].  In one case, it grew better after a summer fire (on a
warm, dry forest floor) than after a spring fire (on a cool, wet floor)
[<a href="#17">17</a>].  In another case, seedlings of pink corydalis and of Carolina
geranium (Geranium carolinianum) emerged soon after a severe fire in the
Appalachian Mountains of New Jersey and were well established 1 year
later [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Pink corydalis requires fire to thrive.  Since the species declines 3 to
5 years after a fire, it is likely to become uncommon in areas where
fires are suppressed.  Controlled burning in areas where this species
was formerly present would likely cause it to increase if viable seed
were still present in the soil.  Recently burned areas may be monitored
for this species to determine whether the potential for viable
populations remains.
