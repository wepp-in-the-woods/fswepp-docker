<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Fetterbush is a principal shrub in the understories of pocosins
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>], bayheads [<a href="#23">23</a>], and cypress (Taxodium spp.) heads [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>]
(all synonyms of "evergreen shrub bog" [<a href="#27">27</a>]).  Other fetterbush sites
include conifer swamps, seasonally wet flatwoods and savannas,
cypress-gum (Nyssa spp.) ponds, depressions, and broadleaf seepage areas
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  It is a principal understory species in the Big Cypress
[<a href="#7">7</a>] and Okeefenokee [<a href="#1">1</a>] swamps, and one of the more abundant and
constant shrubs in saw-palmetto (Serenoa repens) prairie [<a href="#35">35</a>].
Occasionally, fetterbush grows on more xeric sites such as gallberry
(Ilex glabra) flatwoods and dry prairies [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Austin and others [<a href="#2">2</a>]
describe it as a scrub "indicator", although Godfrey [<a href="#14">14</a>] considers it
occasional in scrub communities.

Overstory associates include Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis
thyoides), various southern pines (Pinus spp.), sweet bay (Magnolia
virginiana), red bay (Persea borbonia), loblolly bay (Gordonia
lasianthus), cypress, and tupelo (Nyssa spp.) [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  Understory
associates include gallberry, shrubby oaks (Quercus spp.), sweetbells
leucothoe (Leucothoe racemosa), highbush blueberry (Vaccinium
corymbosum), sweet pepperbush (Clethera alnifolia), titi (Cyrilla
racemiflora), laurelleaf greenbrier (Smilax laurifolia), and honeycup
(Zenobia pulveralenta) [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lyonia lucida

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Because fetterbush is related to several other toxic plants in the
Ericaceae family, Kingsbury [<a href="#18">18</a>] suspects that it may be toxic to
livestock as well.  Specific use of fetterbush by wildlife has not been
reported although evergreen-shrub-bog habitats (see Site
Characteristics) are important to a variety of southeastern wildlife
species including the black bear, white-tailed deer, bobcat, marsh
rabbit, eastern gray squirrel, eastern diamond-back rattlesnake,
American alligator, pine barrens tree frog, and the endangered
red-cockaded woodpecker [<a href="#27">27</a>].

Cattle find fetterbush unpalatable [<a href="#30">30</a>].

<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Because of fetterbush's sprouting response, clearcutting reduces cover

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lyonia lucida
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Fetterbush is a slow-growing, common, showy, evergreen shrub.  It varies
in height from 8 inches (20 cm) to 13 feet (4 m).  Large shrubs have
robust, branchy bases with crowns that are as broad as the height of the
plant.

Leaves are simple, alternate, and leathery.  They are borne on green
twigs which are flecked with dark, loose, deciduous scales.  The small,
pink flowers are borne on fascicles.  The fruit is a capsule containing
amber-brown, wedge-shaped seeds.

Fetterbush has extensive, interconnected rhizomes which sprout and form
dense clonal thickets [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
The primary mode of fetterbush regeneration is vegetative:  Fetterbush
sprouts from rhizomes.  In nutrient-poor environments, it devotes its
energy stores to vegetative growth instead of sexual reproduction and
does not flower [<a href="#31">31</a>].  Information on seedling establishment and growth
is lacking.


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Fetterbush occurs on sites where flooding is common [<a href="#14">14</a>].  Typically,
these sites flood during the spring and dry out during the fall.  Water
tables fall well below the soil surface for the better part of the
growing season.  Seasonal flooding eliminates upland competitors, and
summer dessication eliminates more hydric competitors [<a href="#14">14</a>].  

Fetterbush commonly grows on soils that are strongly to extremely
acidic, poorly drained, peaty, and organic (Histisols) [<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  It may
grow on the accumulated mats of peat and root fibers that collect around
the bases of cypress trees in cypress swamps [<a href="#24">24</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Fetterbush is a mid-seral species.  It follows the establishment of
deciduous shrubs after disturbance in southern swamps. [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].
Although an understory species, it does well in full sunlight [<a href="#8">8</a>] and is
one of several shrubs that prospers in lightly or infrequently burned
pine flatwoods [<a href="#5">5</a>].
  


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Fetterbush has been reported to flower from April to June [<a href="#9">9</a>], from
February to April [<a href="#4">4</a>], or beginning in January [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Leaf production
begins in June and continues through September.  Most leaves are lost in
the November of their second year [<a href="#31">31</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Lyonia lucida

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fetterbush survives fire by resprouting from rhizomes and dormant basal
buds [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : </b>
   Small shrub, adventitious-bud root crown
