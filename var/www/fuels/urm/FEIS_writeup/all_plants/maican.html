<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Wild lily-of-the-valley is a dominant understory species in the
sub-boreal and boreal hardwoods, mixed hardwood-conifer, and conifer
forests of the United States and Canada [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#114">114</a>].  It occurs
under all tree species present in the upland boreal forests [<a href="#35">35</a>].  Wild
lily-of-the-valley is usually a minor species in wetland associations
[<a href="#31">31</a>].

Wild lily-of-the-valley is named as a dominant or indicator species in
the following classifications:

(1)  Field guide:  Habitat classification system for Upper Peninsula of
       Michigan and northeast Wisconsin [<a href="#21">21</a>]
(2) Effects of environment and land-use history on upland forests of
       the Cary Arboretum, Hudson Valley, New York [<a href="#51">51</a>]
(3)  Classification of quaking aspen stands in the Black Hills and Bear
       Lodge Mountains [<a href="#103">103</a>].

Shrub species associated with wild lily-of-the-valley and not mentioned
above are bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), highbush cranberry (Viburnum
edule), and leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata) [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>].
Associated herbaceous species include sedges, twinflower (Linnaea

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Maianthemum canadense
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Wild lily-of-the-valley has persistent fruits that provide food during
spring for birds such as ruffed grouse [<a href="#117">117</a>].  It is one of the most
common understory plants found at great grey owl nest sites [<a href="#112">112</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The current year's growth of wild lily-of-the-valley collected in July
and August in southeastern Manitoba had 8.7 percent crude protein, 29.7
percent acid detergent fiber, and 69.6 percent dry matter digestibility
[<a href="#101">101</a>].  The concentrations of 11 elements have been analyzed from its
aboveground tissues [<a href="#106">106</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Wild lily-of-the-valley provides good groundcover in partially or deeply
shaded areas [<a href="#111">111</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Wild lily-of-the-valley populations usually recover from overstory
harvest methods that do not severely disrupt its rhizomes.  Wild
lily-of-the-valley was not found in areas harvested with grappler
skidders that caused moderate to severe ground disturbance [<a href="#77">77</a>].  One
year following winter or spring clearcutting, wild lily-of-the-valley
was significantly (p<0.05) less dense; at 2 years, it had recovered and
there were no differences in density from the control [<a href="#94">94</a>].  Size of
patch cut or amount of canopy removal (33 or 66 percent) did not
significantly (p>0.05) affect the frequency of wild lily-of-the-valley
[<a href="#98">98</a>].  During years 1 through 4 following three different harvest
methods, wild lily-of-the-valley biomass remained constant at less than
0.24 pounds per square foot (10 g/sq m) dry weight [<a href="#32">32</a>].

Methods of site preparation can decrease wild lily-of-the-valley
populations.  Two years after clearcutting, wild lily-of-the-valley
occurred at 10 percent frequency on V-bladed sites and was absent from
sites prepared by toothed brush rake or disking [<a href="#65">65</a>].  Balsam fir (Abies
balsamea)-birch stands were mulched with various straws following
clearcutting.  Wild lily-of-the-valley growth was suppressed in all
treatments and had an average frequency of 1.1 percent [<a href="#66">66</a>].

Measurements on wild lily-of-the-valley were included in the development
of multiple regression equations for understory indicators of site
productivity, quality, and biomass estimations [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>].

Planting techniques for wild lily-of-the-valley have been discussed in
detail [<a href="#111">111</a>]. 

Wild lily-of-the-valley leaves were significantly (p<0.005) less able to
neutralize simulated acid (pH 3.8 and 5.6) rain compared with other
boreal forest plants [<a href="#47">47</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Maianthemum canadense
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Wild lily-of-the-valley is a native, evergreen perennial forb that grows
3.1 to 7.9 inches (8-20 cm) tall [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#73">73</a>].  It has extensive,
creeping, slender rhizomes with occasional, tuberous enlargements
[<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  Most rhizomes are rooted in the litter layer with shallow
(e.g., 0.4 inch [1 cm]) extensions into the mineral soil [<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].
Annual rhizome growth can be 5.9 to 11.8 inches (15-30 cm) [<a href="#33">33</a>].  One to
three leaves accompany the 10- to 40-flowered raceme [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#84">84</a>].  Berries
have one to four seeds [<a href="#84">84</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Wild lily-of-the-valley forms extensive patches of vegetative shoots;
branching rhizomes can produce ramets up to 3.9 feet (1 m) apart
[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>].  A single clone can be up to 19.7 feet (6 m) in diameter and
about 30 to 60 years old [<a href="#33">33</a>].  There is no correlation between
production of wild lily-of-the-valley vegetative and sexual reproductive
buds [<a href="#100">100</a>].

Wild lily-of-the-valley has little to no seed rain or seedbank.  Some
seeds are dispersed by birds, which contribute to its patchy
distribution [<a href="#33">33</a>].  Wild lily-of-the-valley seed set is dependent on
insect pollinators such as solitary bees, bee flies, and syrphids [<a href="#8">8</a>].
In a boreal spruce-fir forest in central New Brunswick, it had very low
levels of fruit set.  Eleven percent of flowers bore fruit, and 50
percent of the developing fruits aborted [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Wild lily-of-the-valley
had 10 to 35 percent fruit set over 3 years in mesic woods in
Massachusettes [<a href="#84">84</a>].

No wild lily-of-the-valley seed germinated in soil samples collected
before disturbance from a mature northern hardwood forest.  Immediately
following canopy removal, no wild lily-of-the-valley seeds were in seed
traps; 1 year later, an average of 0.8 seeds were collected from seed
traps.  At 3 years after clearcutting, wild lily-of-the-valley was only
in areas where it had been before disturbance [<a href="#62">62</a>].  Wild
lily-of-the-valley seeds in soil cores taken from 11 sites aged 3 to
approximately 75 years since disturbance did not germinate after
stratification [<a href="#3">3</a>].  There was little evidence of successful wild
lily-of-the-valley seedling recruitment, despite relatively high amounts
of seed production in several sites in the boreal forest zone of central
Alberta [<a href="#100">100</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Wild lily-of-the-valley has a wide ecological amplitude and is found in
diverse habitats from maritime forests on beachfronts and sand plains to
subalpine meadows at elevations to 5,330 feet (1,625 m) [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#101">101</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>].
Additionally, it occurs in bog forests, ecotonal swamp forests, and is
common on fen uplands; however, it is intolerant of acidic soils with pH
values below 4.5 to 5.5 [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  Wild lily-of-the-valley
may be numerous on drier, raised rims of nonsorted circles [<a href="#88">88</a>].  It has
been found on ridgetops, steep to gentle slopes, rolling hills, and
bottomlands [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].

Wild lily-of-the-valley is found on a variety of soil types [<a href="#33">33</a>].  It
can occur on organic soils such as found on sphagnum hummocks or heath
mats [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>].  Nutrient conditions may be minerotrophic [<a href="#122">122</a>].  While
soil moisture is often moderate, wild lily-of-the-valley can occur on
well-drained to saturated sites [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#126">126</a>].

The climate in which wild lily-of-the-valley occurs may be maritime to
continental and has north to south transitions from boreal to temperate
conditions with long, cold winters and short, warm to cool summers
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#94">94</a>].  Precipitation across its range is moderate to heavy and
distributed throughout the year [<a href="#5">5</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Wild lily-of-the-valley is predominantly a late successional species;
however, it has been found in the understory of forest stands of all
ages [<a href="#100">100</a>].  In the White Mountains of New Hampshire, wild
lily-of-the-valley was uncommon on early and mid-successional sites
created by landslides [<a href="#106">106</a>].  It occurred with approximately 20 to 90
percent frequency in nine mixed-hardwood stands aged 7 to 37 years in
New Brunswick [<a href="#81">81</a>].

Wild lily-of-the-valley is shade tolerant and has been found in a wide
range of sunlight levels [<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#89">89</a>,<a href="#104">104</a>].  It was present in intermediate
amounts in partially cut and uncut jack pine (Pinus banksiana) stands in
north-central Minnesota where light intensities varied from 23 to 80
percent of full sunlight [<a href="#105">105</a>].  Wild lily-of-the-valley increased its
cover in a northern hardwood stand in northwestern Pennsylvania under
both closed canopy and single tree and multitree gap sites [<a href="#22">22</a>].
However, 4 years after a shelterwood cut in a black cherry (Prunus
serotina) stand, heavy raspberry cover eliminated wild
lily-of-the-valley [<a href="#36">36</a>].

Wild lily-of-the-valley occurred in seral communities such as bur
oak-quaking aspen (Quercus macrocarpa-Populus tremuloides), pure quaking
aspen, and jack pine [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].  In mesic northern hardwood forests of
lower Michigan, it was restricted to mature (greater than 50 years)
stands [<a href="#99">99</a>].  Wild lily-of-the-valley was found only in the oldest of
eight old-field sites aged 1 to 60 years on the Piedmont Plateau of New
Jersey [<a href="#7">7</a>].  In Vermont, it was found in 35-year-old eastern white pine
(Pinus strobus) stands [<a href="#60">60</a>].  It occurred commonly in every part of
climax sugar maple-American beech (Acer saccharum-Fagus grandifolia)
forest on Isle Royale, Michigan [<a href="#25">25</a>].

In the succession of sand dunes in southern lower Michigan, wild
lily-of-the-valley came in under black oak (Quercus velutina) at 200 to
350 years [<a href="#93">93</a>].  It occurred in the final fen to forest stages of bog
succession, whether subclimax or climax associations [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Wild lily-of-the-valley flowers from the end of May to the end of June
or July, depending on geographic location [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>].  The leaves
remain through winter, and new leaves are produced after flowering [<a href="#12">12</a>].
Fruit matures within 30 days [<a href="#56">56</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Maianthemum canadense

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Wild lily-of-the-valley sprouts following fire; very few plants come in
as seed [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>].  Wild lily-of-the-valley recovery may be affected by
the season of burning due to the amount of nutrient reserves in its
roots and rhizomes.  It had reduced recovery after spring burning,
apparently due to reserves depleted during leafing out [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].
However, it has been rated as an increaser after fire, including after
spring burning [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#118">118</a>].  Wild lily-of-the-valley survives fire because
its meristems grow in the damp litter and ground [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Wild
lily-of-the-valley located in damp depressions survived a wildfire on
Isle Royale, Michigan, and had 12 stems per square foot (1.2 stems/sq m)
[<a href="#28">28</a>].  Its rhizomes can withstand low- to moderate-severity fires
[<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  After fire has opened forest canopies, wild lily-of-the-valley
can cover large areas where it was previously sparse under the closed
canopy [<a href="#27">27</a>].  In the upland boreal mixed woods that wild
lily-of-the-valley is a part of, the natural fire return intervals are
betweeen 20 and 340 years [<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>].

Wild lily-of-the-valley rhizomes can tolerate brief exposures to high
temperatures.  Its rhizomes were collected spring, summer, and fall and
subjected to wet heat treatments.  Maximum shoot growth and number of
stems occurred after spring-collected rhizomes were placed at 131
degrees Fahrenheit (55 deg C) for 5 minutes.  Growth also continued
after 143 degrees Fahrenheit (60 deg C) treatments; however, summer- and
autumn-collected rhizomes died after this high temperature treatment
[<a href="#43">43</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Maianthemum canadense

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire top-kills wild lily-of-the-valley.  Surviving rhizomes grow, and
flowers are initiated the first growing season following a fire [<a href="#27">27</a>].
Wild lily-of-the-valley flowered in June following low-severity fires
(i.e., surface litter layer was consumed) during October and April.
Flowering began 22 days earlier on the fall-burned than on the
spring-burned plants, and fruit developed on fall-burned but not on the
spring-burned plants [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Wild lily-of-the-valley sprouted within 2
weeks after a prescribed fire and was common in all stands; however,
cover had decreased [<a href="#108">108</a>].  In stump-prairies of northeastern Wisconsin
that were burned in the spring, it sprouted by summer and increased in
frequency [<a href="#121">121</a>].  Seven soil core samples were collected 1 week
following a low- to moderate-severity ground wildfire in April in a
boreal mixed conifer-hardwood forest.  In the soil samples, most wild
lily-of-the-valley developed from surviving rhizomes; however, five
seeds germinated from three of the samples [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Wild lily-of-the-valley recovers slowly after fire [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].  Its
recovery rate may be variable due to the severity of burning or to
successive annual fires.  Wild lily-of-the-valley can be one of the
first species reported on a fresh burn [<a href="#124">124</a>].  In a boreal mixed wood in
New Brunswick, it had widely variable reponses during different seasons
of burning (spring, summer, or fall); therefore, averaged responses
among seasons was similar [<a href="#45">45</a>].  In western Maine following a severe
fire where the organic soil was consumed, surviving wild
lily-of-the-valley sprouted after 1 month [<a href="#109">109</a>].  However, it occurred
infrequently 2 years after a severe summer burn in which all the litter
and humus were destroyed and the mineral soil was exposed [<a href="#82">82</a>].  In a
jack pine stand in northeastern Minnesota under various silvicultural
and prescribed burning treatments, there was a 20 percent decrease in
wild lily-of-the-valley 1 year following prescribed burning when
temperatures were less than 900 degrees Fahrenheit (482 deg C).  Its
frequency decreased by 70 percent where temperatures mostly exceeded 900
degrees Fahrenheit (482 deg C) [<a href="#1">1</a>].  There was a significant (p<0.05)
decrease in wild lily-of-the-valley biomass 2 years after a winter
clearcut and summer prescribed burning in northern Minnesota [<a href="#94">94</a>].

Wild lily-of-the-valley took 4 to 10 years to seed in from nearby areas
following prescribed fires on clearcuts seeded with jack pine [<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>].
Soil samples were taken from burned and unburned areas 3 years after a
fire in an old-growth red pine (Pinus resinosa) stand.  Wild
lily-of-the-valley germinated only in soil from the unburned area [<a href="#4">4</a>].
It was less frequent in open, burned areas than in unburned areas in
oak-pine woods [<a href="#13">13</a>].

Following two successive annual, low-severity fires where the duff was
not consumed, wild lily-of-the-valley remained a dominant species with
increases in relative densities or frequencies at postfire years 1 to 3
[<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#86">86</a>,<a href="#91">91</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>].  It decreased in frequency from pretreatment levels of
42 percent down to 1 percent following logging with 2 successive years
of prescribed burning [<a href="#55">55</a>].  In cutover areas aged 2 to 40 years since
fire, it had only 0 to 2 percent cover [<a href="#83">83</a>].  Following prescribed
spring fires in boreal mixed woods, wild lily-of-the-valley frequency
declined from 40 to 16 percent.  Its frequency further declined to 8
percent following another fire 6 years later on this area [<a href="#79">79</a>].

Wild lily-of-the-valley had lower frequencies (53 and 57 percent) than
the control (97 percent) 11 and 14 years after fires in mixed
conifer-hardwoods in northeastern Minnesota [<a href="#70">70</a>].  It was one of the
most abundant species present 13 years following a severe wildfire in
mixed conifer stand in Minnesota and Ontario [<a href="#2">2</a>].  In different burns
aged 9 to 50 years in Ontario, wild lily-of-the-valley had the highest
density on burns aged 25, 29, or 50 years [<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#110">110</a>].  At postfire year
33, it had similar frequencies (25 to 33 percent) and cover (1 to 2
percent) in four different forest communities of aspen-birch, birch,
jackpine-birch, and jack pine [<a href="#90">90</a>].  In moist mixed woods in North
Dakota, its relative cover 80 years following fire was not different
from unburned areas [<a href="#95">95</a>].  Fuel loadings were variable in fire-prone
forest stands in Michigan where wild lily-of-the-valley was a typical
understory species; it was present in low frequency (0.3 percent) 84
years following fire [<a href="#79">79</a>].

There was no significant (p>0.05) difference in the occurrence of wild
lily-of-the-valley under five shade treatments (0 to 100 percent shade)
following a low-severity prescribed spring fire [<a href="#57">57</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Measurements on wild lily-of-the-valley were used to develop regression
equations for predicting changes in forest floor moisture in upland pine
communities [<a href="#20">20</a>].  There were no seasonal trends in change of moisture
content for wild lily-of-the-valley during a study to assess understory
flammability in Great Lakes coniferous forests for use in the National
Fire Danger Rating System [<a href="#78">78</a>].  Spring burning may be the most
effective control for wild lily-of-the-valley during site preparation
because carbohydrate reserves are lowest, potentially reducing plant
vigor [<a href="#42">42</a>].
