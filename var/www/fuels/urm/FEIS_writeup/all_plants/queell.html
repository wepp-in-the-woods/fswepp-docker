<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus ellipsoidalis

<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Northern pin oak has a limited range; it is largely confined to the
middle and western parts of the Great Lakes region.  It occurs from
central Michigan east to noth-central Wisconsin, eastern Iowa, northern
Illinois, and northern Indiana.  Disjunct populations occur in northern
Ohio, Arkansas, and extreme southeastern North Dakota [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Northern pin oak is a common component in central upland deciduous
forest.  It is pure or comprises a majority of the stocking in varying
mixtures with white oak (Quercus alba), black oak (Q. velutina), scarlet
oak (Q. coccinea), bur oak (Q. macrocarpa), or northern red oak (Q.
borealis) [<a href="#10">10</a>].

The following published classifications list northern pin oak as a
dominant or codominant species:

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus ellipsoidalis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
Like several other oaks, northern pin oak can be used to make furniture,
flooring, and interior finishing.


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Northern pin oak acorns provide food for a variety of wildlife species
including gray squirrels, white-tailed deer, and blue jays [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].
Wood ducks, eastern kingbirds, and the federally endangered Kirtland's
warbler utilize trunk cavities of northern pin oak as nesting sites
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Northern pin oak is useful for rehabilitating disturbed sites.  It has a
deep root system, xeromorphic leaves, low water potential thershold for
stomatal closure, and the ability to adjust osmotically.  Northern pin
oak can maintain high rates of photosynthesis during drought and
survives on nutrient-poor soils [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Depending on the manager's objectives, a number of silvicultural methods
are appropriate for the regeneration of northern pin oak.  Clearcutting
is a good method to use if advanced reproduction is adequate to replace
the harvested stand.  The shelterwood system should be used if advanced
reproduction is inadequate [<a href="#28">28</a>].

Northern pin oak is susceptible to oak wilt caused by the fungus
Ceratocystis fagacearum.  The disease is spread from tree to tree
through root grafts and by sap-feeding beetles (Nitidulidae spp.)
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus ellipsoidalis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Northern pin oak is a small to medium-sized, native, deciduous tree,
typically reaching heights to 70 feet (21 m) [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].  It has an
irregularly shaped crown and low-hanging branches that persist for long
periods as dead stubs, giving a ragged appearance to the trunks [<a href="#9">9</a>].
Northern pin oak has a deep taproot and deep widespreading lateral roots
[<a href="#4">4</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Sexual:  Northern pin oak is monoecious.  Seed production begins when
the tree is about 20 years old.  Good seed crops are not produced every
year and in the off years many of the acorns are destroyed by weevils
[<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>].  Seed dissemination is by squirrels, blue jays, and gravity
[<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].

Vegetative:  Northern pin oak sprouts from the root collar or stump if
top-killed or cut [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Northern pin oak is an upland xeric species that commonly grows on dry,
acid, sandy soils with a very thin organic layer.  It most often occurs
on sandy plains and sandstone hills, and develops into extensive pure
populations only on such sites [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].

Northern pin oak is the most drought tolerant of all black oaks [<a href="#2">2</a>].

Common tree associates not listed in Distribution and Occurrence include
eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), pignut hickory (Carya glabra),
shagbark hickory (C. ovata), and pin cherry (Prunus pensylvanica).
Common shrub associates include American green alder (Alnus crispa),
lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium), chokecherry (Prunus
virginiana), hawthorns (Crataegus spp.), American hazel (Corylus
americana), serviceberry (Amelanchier spp.), snowberry (Symphoricarpos
spp.), wintergreen (Gaultheria procumbens), and willow (Salix spp.)
[<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Faculative Seral Species.

Northern pin oak is very intolerant and does not reproduce under its own
shade [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  The other oaks with which it is commonly associated are
less light demanding and thus tend to succeed it.  Successsion is toward
a white oak-black oak-northern red oak and bur oak communities.  In
central Wisconsin, eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) is encroaching on
northern pin oak communities.  In parts of eastern Minnesota where pine
is absent, northern pin oak forms an edaphic climax on poor sandy soils
[<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Flowering occurs from March to May.  Staminate flowers develop from leaf
buds of axils of the previous year, whereas the pistillate flowers
develop from buds formed during the current year.  The fruit ripens in 2
years; dispersal occurs from late August to early December [<a href="#23">23</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus ellipsoidalis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Northern pin oak is well adapted to fire.  The thermal insulating
properties of the bark of mature trees allow it to survive even annual
burning [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Smaller trees are easily damaged by surface fires but
will sprout vigorously from the root collar or stump after top-kill
[<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#9">9</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Quercus ellipsoidalis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire has very little effect on pole-sized or larger northern pin oak.
In eastern Kansas annual prescribed burning had very little effect on
trees larger than 10 inches (25 cm) d.b.h. [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>].  However, 13 years
of annual burning in Minnesota greatly reduced northern pin oak
populations, primarily by killing smaller diameter stems [<a href="#33">33</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Northern pin oak is generally favored by fire.  After an early spring
fire in northeastern Wisconsin, northern pin oak sprouted vigorously and
maintained the preburn density of 30 trees per acre (74/ha) [<a href="#31">31</a>].
