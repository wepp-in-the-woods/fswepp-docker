<b>COMMON NAMES : </b>
   low sweet blueberry


<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of low sweet blueberry is
Vaccinium angustifolium Ait. (Ericaceae) [<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>].  Autopolyploidy and
allopolyploidy are common in Vaccinium spp. [<a href="#137">137</a>] and contribute to the
taxonomic complexity of this group [<a href="#34">34</a>].  Most researchers recognize low
sweet blueberry as a single, highly polymorphic, species.  Thus, earlier
treatments that recognized many varieties and forms of low sweet
blueberry are now considered misleading and inappropriate [<a href="#157">157</a>].

Low sweet blueberry hybridizes with many species, including highbush
blueberry (V. corymbosum), velvetleaf blueberry, bog blueberry (V.
uglinosum), hillside blueberry (V. pallidum), ground blueberry (V.
myrsinites), downy blueberry (V. atrococcum), and V. caesariense
[<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>,<a href="#155">155</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>].  Interspecific hybrid swarms have been reported [<a href="#137">137</a>].
The entity formerly known as V. angustifolium var. hypolasium Fernald
(var. integrefolium Leepage) may be a natural hybrid of velvetleaf
blueberry, sweet hurt's blueberry (Vaccinium boreale), and low sweet
blueberry [<a href="#137">137</a>].  Hybrids of low sweet blueberry and highbush blueberry
have been designated as V. atlanticum Bicknell [<a href="#150">150</a>].

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Browse:  The black bear, eastern cottontail, and white-tailed deer feed
on the foliage of low sweet blueberry [<a href="#71">71</a>].  In spruce-fir forests of
north-central Maine, it is preferred deer browse [<a href="#112">112</a>].  In central
Pennsylvania, deer use is light year-round [<a href="#30">30</a>]; deer often eat
overwintering shoots during the early spring [<a href="#17">17</a>] and browse plants
during fall and winter [<a href="#131">131</a>].  Low sweet blueberry is an important moose
browse in parts of Maine [<a href="#112">112</a>] but is rarely eaten in northeastern
Minnesota [<a href="#85">85</a>].  Domestic sheep commonly avoid low sweet blueberry
browse [<a href="#72">72</a>].

Fruit and flowers:  Fruit is readily eaten by a wide variety of birds
and mammals [<a href="#70">70</a>].  In some areas, it is a particularly important late
summer-early fall ptarmigan food [<a href="#158">158</a>].  Flower buds are readily eaten
by ruffed grouse during the winter and are considered a major food
source during February in some areas [<a href="#131">131</a>].  

Wildlife species that feed on the fruit include:  mammals - black bear,
red fox, raccoon, red-backed vole, and many species of mice
[<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>]; birds - American robin, common crow, and eastern
bluebird [<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>].  Wildlife species that eat the fruits of Vaccinium
spp. in general include:  mammals - white-footed mouse, fox squirrel,
red squirrel, eastern spotted skunk, gray fox, and many species of
chimunks [<a href="#100">100</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#160">160</a>]; birds - wild turkey, ruffed grouse,
spruce grouse, gray catbird, brown thrasher, rufous-sided towhee,
northern mockingbird, black-capped chickadee, red-cockaded woodpecker,
starling, cardinal, scarlet tanager, Canada goose, herring gull,
whimbrel, quail, and thrushes [<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#160">160</a>].

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
The food value of berries and browse varies seasonally, and with site
characteristics, geographic location, and fire history [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>].

Fruit:  Fruit is an excellent source of vitamin C, natural sugars,
niacin, and manganese [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>].  Berries are relatively high in
carbohydrates and soluble solids but contain little sodium or fat
[<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>]. Fruit averages approximately 41 calories per 0.5 cup
[<a href="#123">123</a>], with sugar concentration ranging from 0.03 to 0.34 percent [<a href="#168">168</a>].
Overall nutrient value is rated as moderately low [<a href="#164">164</a>].  Average
vitamin and mineral content of low sweet blueberry fruit on a wet weight
basis is available [<a href="#31">31</a>].

Browse:  Nitrogen typically decreases from July 22 to September 22
during crop years but increases during years in which no fruit
production occurs [<a href="#147">147</a>].  Levels of phosphorus, calcium, manganese,
potassium, and magnesium also exhibit seasonal fluctuations [<a href="#147">147</a>].
Nutrient content of low sweet blueberry leaves is as follows [<a href="#72">72</a>]:

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Low sweet blueberry may have potential use for rehabilitating certain
types of disturbed sites.  It is tolerant of metals and grows in stunted
form on industrially damaged sites near Sudbury, Ontario [<a href="#165">165</a>].  Plants
have recolonized strip-mined areas in West Virginia [<a href="#79">79</a>] and reclaimed
mined peatlands of the Northeast [<a href="#53">53</a>].  Rhizomes can sometimes aid in
preventing soil erosion on steep slopes [<a href="#72">72</a>].

Low sweet blueberry can be readily propagated from hard, semihard, and
softwood cuttings, and from rhizome segments [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].  Side-shoot
cuttings can be used to supplement regular cuttings where rapid
propagation is desired [<a href="#90">90</a>].  Cuttings generally root within 6 weeks
[<a href="#4">4</a>]; those taken in fall and winter often root best [<a href="#82">82</a>].  Detailed
information on vegetative propagation techniques is available
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>].

Low sweet blueberry can also be propagated by seed [<a href="#124">124</a>]. Cleaned seed
averages 1,972,174 per pound (4,344/g) [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Seedlings can be
transplanted to flats after 6 to 7 weeks [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Traditional uses:  Native Americans traditionally valued low sweet
blueberry fruit.  Berries were eaten fresh, dried, baked and added to
soups, or mixed with venison and other meats [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>].  Early
European settlers ate the fruit fresh or used it to make jams, jellies,
and preserves [<a href="#157">157</a>].

Modern uses:  Low sweet blueberry is the most important commercial
blueberry in the northeastern United States and Canada [<a href="#34">34</a>].  It is
grown commercially in Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, and
Maine [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>].  A major portion of the crop is gathered from managed
wild stands [<a href="#157">157</a>].
  
Most fruit is used in processed foods such as pie or muffin mixes,
pastries, jam, ice cream, and yogurt [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>].  Berries are also
used to make wine and various juice products [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].  Low sweet
blueberry is the blueberry most commonly used for commercial canning
[<a href="#123">123</a>].  Fruit is also freeze-dried.  The development of the frozen food
industry in the 1940's promoted rapid expansion of low sweet blueberry
cultivation [<a href="#157">157</a>].

Recreation use:  Throughout its range, the low sweet blueberry is prized
by recreational berry-pickers.  Blueberry picking is an important
recreational activity in many areas [<a href="#93">93</a>].  In the early 1980's, an
estimated 20 percent of all summer tourists engaged in blueberry picking
in parts of the Great Lakes region [<a href="#132">132</a>].

Horticultural value:  Plants are ornamental and can be used as
shrubbery, hedges, or as fruiting ground cover [<a href="#123">123</a>].  The cultivar
'Tophat' is used only for ornamental purposes and is well suited for
bonsai [<a href="#123">123</a>].  Low sweet blueberry has potential for use in breeding
northern fruit-producing stock [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>] and is well suited to small
farms, since 5 to 10 acres is sufficient to produce a significant
quantity of fruit [<a href="#7">7</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Competition:  In some areas, low sweet blueberry is described as a
"troublesome" brush species that can interfere with red pine
regeneration [<a href="#52">52</a>].  In other areas, however, jack pine regenerates
better in monotypic stands of low sweet blueberry than in mixed stands
of sweet-fern, bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum), and fireweed
(Epilobium angustifolium) [<a href="#41">41</a>].

Herbicides:  Low sweet blueberry can be controlled by 2,4-D, and 2,4,5-T
[<a href="#124">124</a>].  Herbicides such as hexazinone and Terbacil have been widely used
in commercial fields to eliminate weeds that compete with low sweet
blueberry [<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#137">137</a>,<a href="#172">172</a>].

Environmental Considerations:  Low sweet blueberry is tolerant of acid
rain (pH < 3.5) [<a href="#129">129</a>].  Studies indicate that plants can survive at
least shortterm exposure to acid rain with a pH of 2.5.  Low sweet
blueberry could increase in response to acid rain in boreal forests
[<a href="#129">129</a>].  It is apparently resistant to emissions produced by zinc
smelters [<a href="#91">91</a>].

Wildlife:  The reproductive success of black bears has been correlated
to annual blueberry crops.  Poor blueberry crops can limit black bear
reproductive success as well as overall survival in aspen-birch-conifer
forests of northeastern Minnesota.  In Wisconsin bears depredations
such as damage to crops and beehives and livestock losses typically
increase during poor berry years [<a href="#125">125</a>].

Timber harvest:  Although opening a closed stand can improve the growth
and vigor of low sweet blueberry, clearcutting and postharvest burning
does not ensure the development of a lush stand of blueberry [<a href="#65">65</a>].  Hall
[<a href="#65">65</a>] observed that after growing in the heavy shade of a closed forest
canopy, many plants were killed by postharvest burns.  Survival may be
greater if plants are allowed to grow and increase in vigor before
burning [<a href="#65">65</a>].  Thinning for pulpwood cuttings can result in vigorous
growth of low sweet blueberry [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>] as plants spread by rhizomes into
opened areas.  Response to various types of timber treatments has been
reported [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>].

Fruit production:  Low sweet blueberry fruit production is strongly
influenced by weather conditions, climate, pollinator availability,
light intensity, genetic factors, and nutrient levels at the time of bud
initiation [<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>].  Fruit production is limited under low light
intensity [<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>]; production is virtually nil at 50 to 500
foot-candles [<a href="#67">67</a>].  Shade produced by competing weeds can often reduce
fruit yields [<a href="#67">67</a>].

Cross-pollination by insects is necessary for good fruit set
[<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#103">103</a>,<a href="#168">168</a>].  Aalders and Hall [<a href="#1">1</a>] observed that fruit set ranged from
approximately 81 to 90 percent in cross-pollinated plants but from only
0 to 52 percent in self-pollinated plants.  Yields tend to be lower in
fields containing both velvetleaf blueberry and low sweet blueberry than
in fields containing only low sweet blueberry [<a href="#1">1</a>].  In some areas, the
widespread use of insecticides has decimated wild bee populations.
Although honeybees are less effective pollinators than wild bees,
growers often add honeybees in an effort to improve fruit set
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#166">166</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vaccinium angustifolium
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Low sweet blueberry is an erect, low-growing, variable shrub that
reaches 2 to 24 inches (5-60 cm) in height [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>].  It
typically forms dense, extensive colonies [<a href="#157">157</a>].  Roots are shallow and
fibrous but may possess a taproot, which can extend to 3 feet (1 m) in
depth [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].  Woody rhizomes average 0.18 inch (4.5 mm) in diameter
and 2.4 inches (6 cm) in depth [<a href="#56">56</a>].

Flowers are borne in short, few-flowered terminals or axillary racemes
[<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>].  Fruit is a globular berry averaging 0.12 to 0.4 inch
(4-11 mm) in diameter [<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>]; some cultivars produce fruit up to 1
inch (2.5 cm) in diameter [<a href="#7">7</a>].  The berries are very sweet [<a href="#150">150</a>].  Each
contains numerous nutlets averaging approximately 0.04 inch (1.2 mm) in
length [<a href="#157">157</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Low sweet blueberry reproduces vegetatively and by seed [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#111">111</a>].

Seed:  Plants generally first flower at approximately 4 years of age
[<a href="#72">72</a>].  Researchers have reported a range of 56 to 64 seeds per berry
[<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>].  Viability ranges from 30 to 50 percent [<a href="#153">153</a>].  Some clones
are self-fertile, others self-sterile [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Flowers are generally
pollinated by wild bees [<a href="#119">119</a>].  Shrubs with relatively few flowers may
fail to attract pollinators, and shrubs with fewer than 30 flowers
rarely produce fruit.  Productive plants may bear more than 400 flowers
[<a href="#156">156</a>].

Seed dispersal:  Seeds of low sweet blueberry are dispersed by various
birds and mammals [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>].  In New England and the Maritime Provinces,
the American robin and black bear are particularly effective long
distance dispersal agents [72,100,,126,154].  Deer mice, chipmunks, and
the red-back vole are important local dispersers [<a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>].

Seedbanking:  Seedbanking has not been documented, but researchers
have reported the presence of seeds within the top layers of soil [<a href="#65">65</a>].
Seed can remain viable for up to 12 years when properly stored [<a href="#124">124</a>],
and limited seedbanking may occur.

Germination:  In laboratory tests, germination ranged from 30 to 80
percent [<a href="#153">153</a>].  Seed germinates best when exposed to light [<a href="#72">72</a>].  Fresh
seed germinates readily at 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 deg C) under a
regime of 16 hours light per 24-hour period [<a href="#72">72</a>].  Germination generally
begins within 3 to 4 weeks and continues for 6 to 8 weeks [<a href="#48">48</a>].
Stratification and pretreatment with gibberellin can speed germination
[<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#125">125</a>].

Seedling establishment:  Seedling establishment appears variable.
Seedlings are commonly observed in parts of the Maritime Provinces and
in northern Maine [<a href="#157">157</a>], where seeds germinate on open sites with high
moisture availability [<a href="#119">119</a>].  Seedlings are sometimes observed in
clearcuts, on burned sites, and in abandoned fields [<a href="#119">119</a>].  However,
seedlings are rare in eastern Ontario and in many other parts of this
species' range [<a href="#153">153</a>].  In Ontario, seedling establishment is unlikely
unless the following conditions occur: (1) a cool spring follows
dispersal, (2) August and September are wet, (3) the winter is mild or
there is a good snow cover, and (4) the spring is wet.  These conditions
have been observed only once during a 40-year period [<a href="#153">153</a>].  Poor
seedling establishment is generally attributable to unfavorable soil
temperatures and water stress [<a href="#142">142</a>].

Vegetative regeneration:  In many areas, vegetative expansion is the
primary mode of regeneration [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#153">153</a>].  In the absence of disturbance,
clones increase by expansion of rhizomes [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>].  After fire or
other types of disturbance, plants often sprout from the stem base, from
underground rhizomes [<a href="#157">157</a>], or from unburned belowground portions of
aerial stems [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Rhizomes subjected to heat treatment often develop
significantly greater numbers of shoots than do untreated rhizomes [<a href="#56">56</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Low sweet blueberry grows in a wide variety of habitats [<a href="#105">105</a>].  It
occurs in mixed conifer and hardwood forests, in headlands, high moors,
upland bogs, peaty barrens, along sandy riverbanks, and on exposed rocky
outcrops of the Canadian Shield [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>].  Low sweet blueberry is
a prominent component of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) barrens, maple
groves, oak savannas, and poplar regeneration forests [<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#145">145</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>].  It
is common in abandoned pastures and clearcuts, and along roadsides
[<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>].

Climate:  Low sweet blueberry is tolerant of a wide range of
temperatures [<a href="#154">154</a>].  It grows in areas having a dry, sunny, continental
climatic regime receiving an average of 20 inches (500 mm) of
precipitation annually, as well as in areas having cloudy maritime
climates receiving 61 to 79 inches (1,560-1,950 mm) of precipitation
annually [<a href="#83">83</a>].

Shade:  Shade is detrimental to the growth of low sweet blueberry in the
Atlantic Provinces but is necessary for optimal growth in Manitoba's
dry, sunny continental climate [<a href="#83">83</a>].

Soils:  Low sweet blueberry is most commonly associated with light,
well-drained acidic soils [<a href="#124">124</a>].  Soils generally have a high organic
content but may be relatively low in available mineral nutrients
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>].  Soils are often shallow and discontinuous [<a href="#152">152</a>].  Low sweet
blueberry grows on loam, sandy loam, gravelly loam, and silt or clay
loam developed from sandstone, shale, or glacial drift [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>].
Parent materials vary but include granite, quartzite, gneiss, shale, and
sandstone pavement [<a href="#152">152</a>].  In much of eastern Ontario, soils have formed
over Precambrian bedrock [<a href="#137">137</a>].  Low sweet blueberry grows on acidic
soils with pH ranging from 2.8 to 6.6 [<a href="#157">157</a>] but reportedly thrives on
soils with a pH of 4.2 to 5.2 [<a href="#70">70</a>,<a href="#97">97</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>].  Plants generally grow better
on undisturbed rather then tilled soil [<a href="#96">96</a>].  Low sweet blueberry occurs
at elevations from sea level to 4,950 feet (1,500 m) [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>].



<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Low sweet blueberry is an important recolonizer [<a href="#57">57</a>].  Its sprouts are
prominent on disturbed sites such as clearcuts, burns, fields, and
pastures [<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>].  Cover is typically higher on fields derived from
hayfields than those derived from woodlots [<a href="#68">68</a>].  Low sweet blueberry is
an important seral species during the transition from field to forest in
various eastern oldfield communities [<a href="#72">72</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Phenological development of low sweet blueberry varies according to
geographic location and specific weather conditions [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>].
Temperature and day length are important regulatory influences [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#76">76</a>].
Initial floral development begins in the year prior to flowering and
fruiting [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Floral bud primordia appear during June and early July
[<a href="#22">22</a>] when day length reaches approximately 15 hours [<a href="#3">3</a>].  Development
may continue until late October if air temperatures remain above 32
degrees Fahrenheit (0 deg C) with long periods above 50 degrees
Fahrenheit (10 deg C) [<a href="#72">72</a>].  Leaves harden by mid-July, color by late
August, and abciss by late October [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>].

Plants are dormant in fall [<a href="#157">157</a>] and overwinter in a leafless state
[<a href="#72">72</a>].  Active annual growth can begin as early as March or April [<a href="#22">22</a>],
but in many areas, both vegetative and flower bud development begins in
early May after air temperatures have exceeded 50 degrees Fahremheit (10
deg C) for a least 3 to 4 consecutive days [<a href="#72">72</a>].  Vegetative shoots
grow until midsummer [<a href="#83">83</a>]. 

Plants generally flower in May or June of their 2nd year [<a href="#72">72</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>].  A
few flowers may open as early as March in unusually good years, and some
plants occasionally flower as late as September or October [<a href="#154">154</a>].
Flowering may be delayed by 2 or 3 weeks in cool, coastal areas [<a href="#72">72</a>].
Fruit generally ripens from midsummer to late summer, approximately 50
days after anthesis [<a href="#171">171</a>].  In an Ontario study, seed dispersal began
from June 11 to June 20, peaked in early July, and ended in September
[<a href="#153">153</a>].  Generalized flowering and fruiting dates for various locations
are as follows:

Location        Flowering               Fruiting         

VA              May-June                July-August [<a href="#150">150</a>]

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Low sweet blueberry is well adapted to fire [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>].  It generally
sprouts from the rhizomes or root crown after aboveground vegetation is
removed or damaged by fire.  Some seed may be transported on-site by
birds and mammals, but seedling establishment is generally limited to
favorable sites in good years and appears to play a minimal role in
postfire reestablishment.  Fire removes decadent aboveground vegetation
and promotes vigorous growth [<a href="#29">29</a>].  In parts of the Maritimes and the
northeastern United States, peatlands, lakes, and rocky outcrops serve
as natural fire breaks [<a href="#59">59</a>].  Fires in these areas are frequently
patchy, creating forest openings into which low sweet blueberry can
rapidly expand.  Plants within these openings receive sufficient light
for good vigor and fruit production.

Fire frequencies vary across its wide range, but low sweet blueberry
appears well adapted to survive in many fire regimes.  In Acadian
forests, fire frequencies range from 60 to 1,000 years [<a href="#55">55</a>].  In parts
of southeastern Labrador, fire occurs an average of once every 500 years
[<a href="#59">59</a>], and in parts of New Brunswick, an average of once every 370 years
[<a href="#55">55</a>].  In drier inland areas, fire-free intervals are much shorter.
Fire is important in maintaining jack pine communities in which low
sweet blueberry occurs as an understory dominant [<a href="#59">59</a>].  In jack pine
communities of Minnesota, fire frequency has been estimated at 100 years
[<a href="#172">172</a>].  Fire frequencies in Wisconsin pine barrens have been estimated
at 20 to 40 years [<a href="#163">163</a>].  Occasional fires maintain the open character
of these communities and allow for the continued prominence of low sweet
blueberry.

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vaccinium angustifolium
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Low sweet blueberry is tolerant of heat [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Underground portions of
the plant generally survive wildfires or prescribed fires [<a href="#157">157</a>], even
even when all aboveground vegetation is consumed [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#41">41</a>].  In jack pine
barrens, rhizomes have survived brief exposure to fires producing soil
surface temperatures up to 1,013 degrees Fahrenheit (545 deg C) [<a href="#140">140</a>].
However, exposure to temperatures of 1,295 to 1,513 degrees Fahrenheit
(702-823 deg C) for 80 sec apparently resulted in some rhizome mortality
[<a href="#111">111</a>].

Fire effects vary with fire severity and intensity, and season of burn
[<a href="#136">136</a>].  Rhizome mortality increases as heat penetration into the soil
increases [<a href="#136">136</a>].  In a northern Wisconsin muskeg, survival was poor
after hot fires burned out layers of sphagnum [<a href="#161">161</a>].  Plants are
generally most severely harmed by hot summer fires which occur when food
reserves are low [<a href="#55">55</a>].  Seedlings that lack a well-developed rhizome
system are often killed by recurring fires [<a href="#96">96</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Low sweet blueberry generally sprouts from rhizomes and the root crown
after aboveground vegetation is consumed by fire [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>].  Plants may
also sprout from buds located on the stem base [<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>], but stems that
arise from underground rhizomes are generally more vigorous than those
that develop from partially burned aboveground stems [<a href="#107">107</a>].  Rhizome
sprouting is much slower than crown sprouting [<a href="#148">148</a>].  Some
reestablishment via seed germination may occur under favorable
conditions [<a href="#117">117</a>].

Fire intensity and severity, season of burn, community type, and soil
are important factors influencing postfire response [<a href="#138">138</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#161">161</a>].
Cover and stem density commonly increase rapidly [<a href="#55">55</a>], and recovery may
be well underway within 4 to 5 postfire months [<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].  Low sweet
blueberry was well represented within 4 months after an intense fire
destroyed all aboveground vegetation in a spruce stand in Manitoba [<a href="#84">84</a>].
In many areas, including parts of Nova Scotia and Ontario, low sweet
blueberry regains prominence 2 to 3 years after fire [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#144">144</a>].
Although initially reduced after fire in jack pine and black spruce
communities, low sweet blueberry increased beyond prefire levels after 5
years [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>].  Recovery may be delayed after hot fires.  Low sweet
blueberry was present within 13 years after a severe wildfire in a red
pine-white pine forest [<a href="#11">11</a>]. Hall and others [<a href="#72">72</a>] reported that V. a.
forma nigrum tends to increase more rapidly than does V. a. forma
angustifolium in fields that are burned regularly.

Fruit is not produced the year of the burn but is produced in abundance
during the next 3 postfire years [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#161">161</a>].  In general, young
healthy plants regenerate more successfully than older, decadent ones
[<a href="#93">93</a>].  Where clones are extremely decadent, it may take three seasons of
postfire growth before fruit production and vigor reach "satisfactory
levels" [<a href="#131">131</a>].  Some researchers report that burning too frequently can
cause fruit yields to decline [<a href="#25">25</a>].

Increases in low sweet blueberry after fire may be due in part to the
stimulatory effect of nutrients added by ash deposition or changes in pH
[<a href="#70">70</a>].  Blackened ground absorbs heat and may promote earlier fruit
ripening [<a href="#28">28</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
Season of burn:  In general, low sweet blueberry is most reduced by
summer fires [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Flinn and Wein [<a href="#58">58</a>] reported higher stem densities
after burning in fall, when plants had completed photosynthate storage
and had reserves available for new growth.  Smith [<a href="#138">138</a>] reported no
increases in density or productivity after plants were burned in summer
in northern Ontario.  Eaton and White [<a href="#50">50</a>] observed that the number of
sprouts and flowers was greatest after spring fires.  Plants burned
after July 1 did not sprout until the following year [<a href="#110">110</a>].  Plants
burned in August, September, October, or November, do not sprout until
the following spring [<a href="#50">50</a>].  Spring fires typically promote fewer
competitors than do fall fires [<a href="#139">139</a>].  In commercial blueberry fields,
increases in dry matter and percent cover have been noted after both
spring and fall fires [<a href="#139">139</a>]. 


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Prescribed fire:  Prescribed fire can be used to improve fruit yields
[<a href="#77">77</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>].  In order to remove decadent aboveground foliage without
damaging rhizomes, hot fires should be avoided [<a href="#124">124</a>].  

Fuels and flammability:  Fuel loads are low and discontinuous in xeric
jack pine-red pine forests dominated by low sweet blueberry, common
juniper (Juniperus communis), lichens, and mosses [<a href="#24">24</a>].  Fires in these
communities tend to be of irregular intensity.  The probability of crown
fires increases in later successional stages in more mesic stands [<a href="#24">24</a>].
In northeastern New York, Stergas and Adams [<a href="#145">145</a>] reported that
"fire-line intensities greater than 1500 kW/m can easily develop into
crown fires."  Low rates of spread may be necessary to keep a prescribed
fire under control given the potential fuel loading and heat content of
the aboveground understory vegetation, which is dominated by low sweet
blueberry, black huckleberry, and lichen [<a href="#143">143</a>].  Ash content of low
sweet blueberry ranges from 4.20 to 4.54 percent, high heat content from
20,134 to 20,298 KgJ/kg, and ash-free high heat content from 21,040 to
21,084 kJ/kg [<a href="#143">143</a>]:

Wildlife considerations:  In central Wisconsin, prescribed fires are
recommended at 4-year intervals where management aims include limiting
shrub growth and providing habitat for white-tailed deer, sharp-tailed
grouse, and prairie chickens [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Fire can be used to aid the
restoration of sand barren vegetation [<a href="#27">27</a>].  Vogl [<a href="#163">163</a>] reported that
burning at 10-year intervals would allow low sweet blueberry to reach
maximum fruit yields and allow time for maximum fuel accumulations to
reduce competing oaks, aspen, and birch.  Prescribed fire can be used to
increase grouse numbers in Pennsylvania hardwood forests with a low
sweet blueberry understory [<a href="#131">131</a>].

Disease:  Regular burn pruning can limit the spread of red leaf disease
[<a href="#113">113</a>] and blueberry leaf spot [<a href="#12">12</a>].  However, some diseases such as
powdery mildew and rust (Pucciniastrum myrtilli) tend to increase with
the proliferation of the host plant [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Nutrients:  Nutrient content of low sweet blueberry foliage is altered
by burning [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>].  Leaf tissue from burned plants is typically
higher in nitrogen and phosphorus [<a href="#78">78</a>].  Comparative values are
available [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#116">116</a>].

<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS : </b>
Both burning and mechanical pruning increased stem numbers.  However,
mechanically pruned plants produced more flower buds than the
burn-pruned plants.  Tests indicated that mulch should not be applied to
recently pruned plants.  Fertilizers proved to be most effective on
mechanically pruned and untreated plants.  They had little effect on
recently burned plants.  Best results were observed when plants were
mechicanically clipped or fire pruned in April or November.  This
experiment suggests that semicultivated stands of low sweet blueberry in
Minnesota may need to be pruned every 4 to 5 years rather than every
other year as is most common in parts of the Northeast.
