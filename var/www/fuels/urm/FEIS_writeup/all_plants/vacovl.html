<b>TAXONOMY : </b>
The currently accepted scientific name of ovalleaf huckleberry is
Vaccinium ovalifolium Sm. [<a href="#38">38</a>].  

Ovalleaf huckleberry readily hybridizes with a number of species,
including Alaska huckleberry (V. alaskaense) [<a href="#47">47</a>], and forms
intermediate to ovalleaf and Alaska huckleberry have been widely
reported.  Ovalleaf huckleberry-dwarf huckleberry (V. caespitosum) and
ovalleaf huckleberry-grouse whortleberry (V. scoparium) hybrids also
occur and may have contributed genetic material to blue huckleberry (V.
membranaceum) [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>].  Intermediates between ovalleaf huckleberry and
dwarf huckleberry (V. caesoitosum) have been reported in parts of
eastern North America [<a href="#8">8</a>].

<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Ovalleaf huckleberry grows from Alaska to the Cascades of Washington and
Oregon, eastward to Idaho and Montana [<a href="#34">34</a>].  This shrub also occurs
across much of the Pacific Rim, from the Aleutians to Japan, and reaches
parts of mainland eastern Asia [<a href="#63">63</a>].  Disjunct populations are common
throughout eastern Canada and the Great Lakes Region [<a href="#4">4</a>].  In eastern
North America, ovalleaf huckleberry occurs sporadically from northern
Quebec, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland, southwestward to northern Michigan
[<a href="#34">34</a>].

<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
In the West, ovalleaf huckleberry occurs in coastal montane or interior
forests dominated by western redcedar (Thuja plicata), western hemlock
(Tsuga heterophylla), mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), Sitka spruce
(Picea sitchensis), Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis), and
yellow-cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis).  Common understory
codominants include blue huckleberry (V. membranaceum), Alaska
huckleberry (V. alaskaense), Oregon oxalis (Oxalis oregana), western
swordfern (Polystichum munitum), and bog Labrador tea (Ledum
glandulosum).  In the East, ovalleaf huckleberry occurs in montane
forests dominated by such species as balsam fir (A. balsamea) and paper
birch (Betula papyrifera) [<a href="#49">49</a>].

<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Browse:  Ovalleaf huckleberry provides at least some browse for elk,
deer, and mountain goats [<a href="#26">26</a>].  On the Olympic Peninsula of Washington,
it is considered a moderately important elk browse [<a href="#50">50</a>].  In many areas,
elk feed on the leaves and twigs year-round, but this shrub is generally
of greatest importance during winter and summer [<a href="#59">59</a>].  In parts of
eastern North America, deer browse buds and tender young twigs in early
spring, but use is often heaviest in winter [<a href="#8">8</a>].  In western Washington,
ovalleaf huckleberry is a preferred browse of black-tailed deer, with
greatest utilization reported in April, May, and October1w.  This food
source may be unavailable for winter use wherever foliage is heavily
browsed in summer [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Livestock use of ovalleaf huckleberry appears
limited although domestic sheep and goats feed on this shrub in some
locations [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].

Fruit:  Fruits of ovalleaf huckleberry are eaten by many birds and
mammals [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  In Alaska, both leaves and berries are important fall
foods of the spruce grouse [<a href="#17">17</a>].  The scarlet tanager, thrushes,
thrashers, towhees, ptarmigans, ring-necked pheasant, ruffed, blue, and
sharp-tailed grouse all consume huckleberry (Vaccinium spp.) fruit
[<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].  Many mammals including chipmunks, black bear, red fox, skunks,
squirrels, gray fox, and raccoon also eat Vaccinium berries [<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].
Ovalleaf huckleberry fruit is an important grizzly bear food in parts of
British Columbia [<a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Palatability of ovalleaf huckleberry browse apparently varies with site
[<a href="#7">7</a>] and seasonal development.  However, overall palatability to big game
is generally described as moderate [<a href="#28">28</a>].  It is preferred by
black-tailed deer in parts of western Washington during the winter
months [<a href="#7">7</a>] and tender buds and twigs are readily consumed by
white-tailed deer during early spring or late winter in parts of the
East [<a href="#8">8</a>].  Palatability of ovalleaf huckleberry browse to elk in
Washington is rated as good [<a href="#59">59</a>].  Fruit is preferred by many birds and
mammals.


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Browse:  Huckleberry (Vaccinium spp.) foliage is relatively high in
carotene, manganese, and energy content [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>].  The nutrient content
of ovalleaf huckleberry browse varies seasonally.  A composite analysis
of ovalleaf and red huckleberry (V. parvifolium) browse in western
Washington revealed the following values [<a href="#7">7</a>]:

crude      ether     crude    N-free    total    Ca       K      PO4
protein    extract   fiber    extract   ash                     
                                (percent)

7.57       3.56      35.71    46.90     4.38     1.032    0.535  0.434

Fruit:  Fruits of Vaccinium spp. are sweet and contain high
concentrations of both mono- and di-saccharides [<a href="#62">62</a>].  Berries are rich
in vitamin C and energy content but contain little fat [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>].


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Ovalleaf huckleberry presumably provides cover for a variety of wildlife
species.  Taller plants, which grow in forest openings, may serve as
favorable hiding places for large mammals.


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Species within the genus Vaccinium can be propagated from hardwood
cuttings or by seed.  Ovalleaf huckleberry averages 1,606,200 cleaned
seeds per pound (3,538/g).  Seedlings grown in the greenhouse can be
transplanted 6 to 7 weeks after emergence.  Seed collection and storage
techniques have been examined in detail [<a href="#11">11</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Berries of ovalleaf huckleberry are tart but flavorful [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Fruit
is eaten fresh, cooked, or dried [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>].  Berries also make
excellent jelly and wine [<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Fruit of the ovalleaf and Alaska
huckleberries are the most commonly gathered wild berries along the
Pacific Coast of Alaska [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Approximately 8.5 ounces (250 ml) of fruit
can be harvested within a 10-minute period [<a href="#70">70</a>].

The ovalleaf huckleberry was traditionally an important food source for
Native peoples of present-day Alaska and British Columbia [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>].
Berries were eaten fresh or preserved for winter use [<a href="#70">70</a>].  Preserved
fruit provided a good source of vitamin C during the winter months.

Ovalleaf huckleberry was first cultivated in 1880 [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Many species of
huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.) have value as ornamentals or as
fruit-producers in backyard gardens.  However, Schultz [<a href="#58">58</a>] reports that
ovalleaf huckleberry does not appear well-suited for horticultural
breeding purposes.


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Chemical control:  Huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.) exhibit variable
susceptibility to herbicides such as 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, glyphosate,
karbutilate, and picloram [<a href="#6">6</a>].

Timber harvest:  Ovalleaf huckleberry commonly persists on cutover sites
[<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  On thinned stands in southeastern Alaska, ovalleaf huckleberry
seedlings were scattered where trees were spaced at 7.9 by 7.9 foot (2.4
x 2.4 m) intervals [<a href="#26">26</a>].  However, where trees were spaced at 16.5 by
16.5 foot (4.9 x 4.9 m) intervals, ovalleaf huckleberry seedlings were
much more abundant and produced flowers [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Wildlife:  Huckleberries are an extremely important food source for
grizzly bears [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Both black and grizzly bears typically exploit
areas with dense concentrations of berries.  The habitat value of
huckleberry shrubfields to grizzly bears can be increased by permanent
or at least seasonal road closures, by coordinating timber harvest dates
to have minimal impact on habitat use patterns, and by considering the
cumulative effects of habitat modification across a broad area.  In
general, site preparation should include minimizing soil compaction,
using cooler broadcast burns rather than hot slash burns, or by
eliminating site preparation entirely wherever possible.  Grizzly use
can be favored where hiding cover is retained by treating small,
irregular patches instead of large contiguous areas, and by leaving
stringers of timber within larger cuts [<a href="#68">68</a>].

Seasonal trail closures have been implemented in major ovalleaf or blue
huckleberry fields in British Columbia's Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park
in an attempt to reduce the likelihood of hiker-grizzly encounters [<a href="#46">46</a>].
In many areas, bear-human conflicts are much more likely to occur during
years of huckleberry crop failure [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>] as wider-ranging hungry bears
encounter recreationists or wildland residents.  Damage to crops and
beehives, and livestock losses also typically increase during poor
huckleberry years [<a href="#56">56</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vaccinium ovalifolium
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Ovalleaf huckleberry is a stout, erect or spreading, diffusely branched
deciduous shrub [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>], which grows from 1.3 to 12 feet (0.4-4 m)
in height [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Plants often become low and broomy in response to
repeated browsing or under arctic and subarctic conditions where snow
depth limits height [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Height is also reduced under a dense
forest canopy where little light reaches the forest floor; tallest
individuals are generally found under openings in the forest canopy
[<a href="#33">33</a>].  Maximum annual growth rates in Alaska reportedly average 12
inches per year (30 cm) [<a href="#26">26</a>].

The slender, yellowish-green, glabrous twigs of ovalleaf huckleberry are
conspicuously angled [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Twigs turn a bright red when exposed to
sunlight [<a href="#58">58</a>].  Bark of older branches is grayish or grayish-brown
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  The thin, alternate leaves are entire or have inconspicuously
serrate margins [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>].  Leaves are oval to elliptical but rounded
at the base and tip [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  Leaves are glabrous and generally light
and glaucous below [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].

Pink, urn-shaped flowers are borne singly in the axils of leaves
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  Flowers are generally pollinated by long-tongued bees, such as
bumblebees [<a href="#29">29</a>].  The floral morphology of ovalleaf huckleberry has been
examined in detail [<a href="#53">53</a>].  Fruit of the ovalleaf huckleberry is a
bluish-purple, dark blue, or black berry with a distinct whitish bloom
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].  The relatively large berries are round, spherical, or slightly
oblate, and seedy [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>].  Each berry contains an average of 26
seeds [<a href="#76">76</a>], but individual berries may contain up to 150 seeds [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>

<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Ovalleaf huckleberry is capable of reproducing vegetatively or through
seed.  Vegetative regeneration appears to be of primary importance in
most western huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.) [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Vegetative regeneration:  Ovalleaf huckleberry commonly sprouts from
dormant basal buds after repeated browsing or disturbances which damage
the crown [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].  Layering, which occurs in the absence of
disturbance, has also been reported [<a href="#52">52</a>].  Ovalleaf huckleberry is
rhizomatous and sprouting of these structures is reportedly the primary
means by which colonies expand [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Germination:  Seeds of ovalleaf huckleberry have a short dormant period
and exhibit good germination when exposured to 15 days of warm
temperatures followed by 15 days of chilling [<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].  Properly stored
seeds exhibit good germination under a regime of 14 hours of light at 82
degrees F (28 degrees C) followed by 10 hours of darkness at
temperatures averaging 55 degrees F (13 degrees C).  Fresh seeds also
germinate successfully under these conditions, or when alternately
exposed to temperatures of 71 degrees F (22 degrees C) and 41 degrees F
(5 degrees C) [<a href="#76">76</a>].  Huckleberry seedlings first emerge in approximately
1 month and continue to emerge for long periods of time in the absence
of cold stratification [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Ovalleaf huckleberry exhibits 50 to 60
percent germination under favorable conditions and up to 93 percent
germination has been observed under optimal laboratory conditions [<a href="#26">26</a>].

A minimum of only 2 percent full light is required for germination and
seedlings can develop beneath a forest canopy.  Seeds germinate on a
variety of substrates including decaying wood, humus, moss, and mineral
soil.  Ovalleaf huckleberry typically produces seed annually, but large
amounts of seed are generally produced only in relatively open areas
such as in clearings or at forest margins [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Seeds are readily
dispersed by a wide variety of birds and mammals [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Seedbanking:  Seedbanking does not appear to be an important
regenerative strategy in ovalleaf huckleberry.  Although seeds can
remain viable for up to 12 years in storage, longevity under natural
conditions is believed to be limited [<a href="#26">26</a>].  In montane balsam fir (Abies
balsamea)-paper birch (Betula papyrifera) forests of Quebec, an average
of 6.25 ovalleaf huckleberry seeds per square meter was found within the
top 1.2 inches (3 cm) of soil, but none of the seeds were viable [<a href="#49">49</a>].

Seedling morphology and establishment:  Seedling morphology of species
within the section Myrtillus is poorly known.  In the ovalleaf
huckleberry, transition from immature to mature foliage can be either
abrupt or gradual [<a href="#76">76</a>].  Seedlings which develop gradually may be easily
confused with seedlings of the closely related Alaska huckleberry [<a href="#76">76</a>].

Evidence suggests that ovalleaf huckleberry is a "seedling banker."
Seedlings are capable of surviving in the forest understory until
disturbance creates conditions favorable for development.  Large numbers
of slow-growing seedlings are commonly observed.  Growth is typically
slow beneath a forest canopy, and seedlings often remain in the
cotyledon stage for more than two growing seasons.  Best seedling
survival occurs in open old growth stands and in clearcuts.  Survival is
often poor in immature forests [<a href="#26">26</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Ovalleaf huckleberry grows in cool, moist, submontane to subalpine
forests, on open slopes, and at the edges of bogs, meadows, and swamps
[<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#78">78</a>]. It often occurs on elevated microsites in poorly
drained areas [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Ovalleaf huckleberry is commonly absent from major
valley bottoms but does occur on subhydric, colluvial, and morainal
sites in smaller valley bottoms [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>].

Soil:  Most huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.) require acidic conditions and
can grow on infertile soils which have relatively small amounts of many
essential elements [<a href="#40">40</a>].  Ovalleaf huckleberry thrives on soils low in
nitrogen [<a href="#78">78</a>].  Ovalleaf huckleberry grows well on well-drained,
nutrient-poor to nutrient-rich soils with a pH of 4.0 to 5.0 [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#51">51</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].
Soils are derived from a wide variety of parent materials [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Climate:  Sites range from dry to moist, but ovalleaf huckleberry is
generally most abundant on moderately moist sites [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>].  Along the
coast of British Columbia, this shrub is associated with a cool
mesothermal climatic regime [<a href="#78">78</a>].

Elevation:  Ovalleaf huckleberry grows from sea level to timberline [<a href="#26">26</a>]
with elevation ranging from 0 to 5,500 feet (0-1,678 m) [<a href="#14">14</a>].  In many
parts of the Northwest, it is particularly common at middle elevations
[<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  Elevational range by geographic location is as follows
[<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>]:

              from 0 to 4,500 feet (0-1,364 m) Cascades
                   2,000 to 5,000 feet (606-1,515 m) w OR


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Ovalleaf huckleberry is shade tolerant and can persist in undisturbed
forests dominated by species such as western hemlock or white spruce
(Picea glauca) [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#72">72</a>].  It is a common constituent of climax old growth
Douglas-fir-western hemlock, Pacific silver fir, and moist western
hemlock forests of the Pacific Northwest [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#33">33</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#70">70</a>], and of western
hemlock-western redcedar-Sitka spruce forests of southeastern Alaska
[<a href="#75">75</a>].  Seedlings grow in open, old growth stands or in clearcuts, but
often do poorly in dense, immature forests [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Ovalleaf huckleberry commonly appears soon after disturbance in parts of
western Washington [<a href="#7">7</a>] and elsewhere.  Sprouts were observed on mudflow
surfaces in scorch and blowdown areas soon after the eruption of Mount
Saint Helens [<a href="#73">73</a>,<a href="#74">74</a>].  Ovalleaf huckleberry is also one of the first
"forest species" to colonize bog margins in parts of southeastern Alaska
[<a href="#51">51</a>].  This shrub often persists on cutover sites throughout its range
and frequently forms a "nearly continuous layer" on newly harvested
sites [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].

Ovalleaf huckleberry is prevalent in young stands which develop in
avalanche zones in parts of the northwestern Cascades of Washington.
Plants pioneer these sites through layering and sprouting after
aboveground portions of the parent plants are damaged.  The ability to
sprout gives species such as ovalleaf huckleberry a competitive
advantage during early succession in these shrub communities.  Stem
numbers of ovalleaf huckleberry reportedly reach a minimum 60 to 150
years after the initial disturbance.  Advance regeneration subsequently
develops and replaces initial pioneers, producing a subsequent increase
in stem density [<a href="#52">52</a>].

Establishment of ovalleaf huckleberry may be slow where parent plants
were absent prior to disturbance.  Clement [<a href="#71">71</a>] observed ovalleaf
huckleberry in mature climax forests and in young seral stands on
floodplain gravel bars along the west coat of Vancouver Island.
However, it was absent in early seral stands.  No parent plants were
present prior to disturbance and establishment on the newly exposed
gravel bars proceeded slowly from offsite seed.


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
In coastal Alaska, bud burst of ovalleaf huckleberry begins in May.
Growth proceeds rapidly, and most vegetative elongation is completed by
mid-June.  Stem diameters continue to increase until mid-July, and leaf
senescence usually occurs by September.  Along the coast of central
British Columbia, leaf senescence can begin in early September, although
some leaves remain on the shrubs until the end of October [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Ovalleaf huckleberry flowers before leaves reach one-half of their full

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Plants presumably sprout from the stem base or underground rhizomes
[<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>] after aboveground vegetation is destroyed by fire.  Limited
seedling establishment may occasionally occur from offsite seed
dispersed by birds and mammals.  However, seedling establishment is of
limited importance in most western huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.)  [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Fire may occur infrequently on some moist sites occupied by ovalleaf
huckleberry.  Martin [<a href="#44">44</a>] notes that "the role of fire in establishing
populations of western species [of huckleberry] or in maintaining new
ones, is not well-documented."

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Vaccinium ovalifolium
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Basal portions of the stem sometimes survive after aboveground
vegetation is damaged by fire.  Underground rhizomes [<a href="#26">26</a>] are presumably
afforded some protection by overlying soil and may survive fires which
consume the crown.  As with many other species of huckleberry (Vaccinium
spp.), plants are most likely to be killed by hot, duff-consuming fires
[<a href="#44">44</a>].  Seeds of most huckleberries are susceptible to heat and onsite
seed is typically eliminated by fire [<a href="#44">44</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Vegetative response:  Ovalleaf huckleberry often sprouts from the stem
base [<a href="#31">31</a>] after aboveground vegetation is consumed by fire.  Rhizome
sprouting may occur after fires remove or damage all aboveground
vegetation, including the stem base [<a href="#26">26</a>].  In related species of
Vaccinium, sprouting is much less likely after hot, duff-consuming fires
[<a href="#44">44</a>].

Seedling establishment:  Limited postfire seedling establishment may
occur on some sites.  Seedbanking does not appear to be an important
regenerative strategy in ovalleaf huckleberry [<a href="#26">26</a>].  Seeds of most
huckleberries appear to be of short viability and are readily killed by
heat [<a href="#44">44</a>].  Birds and mammals may transport some seed from offsite [<a href="#29">29</a>].

Rate of postfire recovery:  The postfire recovery rate of ovalleaf
huckleberry appears variable.  In many areas recovery is very slow [<a href="#79">79</a>].
Ovalleaf huckleberry was absent during the first growing season after a
moderate fire in southwestern British Columbia, and plants had not
regained preburn vigor by the third growing season [<a href="#26">26</a>].  However, in
parts of the Cascades, this shrub may be common on recently burned sites
[<a href="#50">50</a>].  Recovery has been documented as follows on two burned sites in
coastal British Columbia [<a href="#42">42</a>]:

<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Wildlife:  Evidence suggests that fire suppression may be having an
adverse impact on bear habitat in some areas [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>].  Once productive
seral berry fields are being invaded by conifers.  Since plants beneath
a forest canopy generally produce few berries, fruit production has been
steadily declining [<a href="#47">47</a>].  Logging treatments which include severe soil
scarification or slash burns may also reduce berry production.  Even
where timber harvest favors berry production, lack of cover in early
years can limit bear use.  Wildfires often create diverse habitat
mosaics which incorporate elements of hiding cover and favor bear use
[<a href="#68">68</a>].

Prescribed fire:  Prescribed fire has long been used to increase yields
in commerical low sweet blueberry (V. angustifolium) fields of the East
by naturally pruning decadent shoots [<a href="#47">47</a>,<a href="#77">77</a>].  Flower buds generally
tend to be more numerous on new shoots and periodic removal of old
shoots can increase fruit yield as well as enhance overall vigor [<a href="#47">47</a>].
Spring burns, conducted when the soil is moist, tend to be most
effective in promoting fruit production [<a href="#77">77</a>].  In the Great Lakes
Region, where disjunct populations of ovalleaf huckleberry occur, Krautz
[<a href="#77">77</a>] recommends burning huckleberry (Vaccinium spp.) stands with 4 to 5
years fuel accumulation during the early afternoon on warm, clear, sunny
days with average windspeeds of 5 to 10 miles per hour (6-8 km/hour).
Fast-moving fire fronts which burn aboveground parts but leave
underground regenerative structures intact generally produce best
results.  Therefore, when increased huckleberry fruit production is a
primary management objective, head fires are preferable to backing
fires.  Supportive ignition (repeated ignitions) is generally required
when burning huckleberry stands in the East.  In the Great Lakes Region,
areas to be burned should be rotated over a 4- to 5-year interval to
maintain adequate berry production for recreationists and wildlife [<a href="#77">77</a>].
Minore [<a href="#47">47</a>] has considered the effects of prescribed fire on the blue
huckleberry (V. membranaceum) in the Northwest [see VACMEM], but little
is known about the specific effects of prescribed fire on fruit
production in ovalleaf huckleberry.

Berry production:  Berry production in most western huckleberries is
generally reduced for at least 5 years after fire [<a href="#44">44</a>].  On some sites,
berry production may be significantly reduced for 20 to 30 years or more
[<a href="#44">44</a>].  Reduced initial berry production is probable after fires in
ovalleaf huckleberry fields of western North America.  Abundance is
often reduced after fires used for site preparation in British Columbia
[<a href="#79">79</a>].
