<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Fringed brome occurs in a wide variety of habitat types including
pinyon-juniper (Pinus spp.-Juniperus spp.), quaking aspen (Populus
tremuloides), fir-spruce (Abies spp.-Picea spp.), subalpine fir (Abies
lasiocarpa), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), lodgepole pine (P.
contorta), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), maple (Acer spp.),
sagebrush, grassland, and riparian [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  It is an indicator
of aspen and riparian community types in the Intermountain region
[<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].

Fringed brome occurs in coniferous forest, in both climax and seral
communities.  A Douglas-fir/fringed brome habitat type has been
described for northern New Mexico and northern Arizona [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].
Fringed brome is a member of the single-leaf pinyon-Utah juniper (Pinus
monophylla-J. osteosperma) association of northern Arizona [<a href="#13">13</a>].
Fringed brome is a dominant understory species in subalpine fir,
lodgepole pine, white fir (Abies concolor), and blue spruce (Picea
pungens) habitat types of Arizona and New Mexico [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>].  It is a
common understory species in subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce (P.
engelmannii) habitat types of Idaho and western Wyoming [<a href="#11">11</a>].

Fringed brome also occurs in a number of other communities.  It is found
in seral aspen community types, including the aspen/fringed brome
community typed described for Utah [<a href="#48">48</a>] and aspen-dominated community
types in Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico [<a href="#45">45</a>].  Fringed brome is a
member of the sedge-goldenrod (Carex spp.-Solidago spp.) wet prairie
community in Michigan [<a href="#33">33</a>].  It also occurs in peatlands of
north-central Minnesota in minerotrophic fens [<a href="#60">60</a>].

In Canada, fringed brome is an understory species in a 100-year-old
black spruce (Picea mariana) forest in southeastern Manitoba [<a href="#14">14</a>].  It
also occurs in stagnant plantations of prethicket white spruce (P.
glauca) on oldfield sites in Ontario [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Fringed brome is a member
of the western snowberry (Symphoricarpos occidentalis) shrub community
in Alberta [<a href="#5">5</a>].

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Bromus ciliatus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Fringed brome is a good source of forage on western forest ranges.  In
Montana and Wyoming, fringed brome is browsed by livestock and is
considered one of the best range grasses in Wyoming [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  In Arizona
and New Mexico, fringed brome is an important forage species for
livestock, deer, and elk throughout the summer [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  Seeds are eaten
by small mammals, turkeys and other birds [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>].  The aspen/fringed
brome habitat type of central Colorado is ideal for pocket gophers [<a href="#48">48</a>].



<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Fringed brome is highly palatable to deer, elk, and all classes of
livestock [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Energy rating is fair and protein content is poor for fringed brome
[<a href="#10">10</a>].  


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
The white fir-Arizona walnut habitat type of Arizona and New Mexico, in
which fringed brome occurs, provides excellent cover for rodents,
turkeys, and quail.  The Douglas-fir/fringed brome habitat type provides
nesting cover for band-tailed pigeons [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Erosion control and short-term revegetation potential are rated medium,
and long-term revegetation potential is rated high for fringed brome
[<a href="#10">10</a>].  


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
The effects of clearcutting on wildlife habitat were studied in a moist
subalpine forest in central Colorado.  Fringed brome cover increased 1
year after harvest, and then fluctuated in postharvest years 2 to 5.
Percent understory cover of fringed brome before and after clearcutting
were [<a href="#15">15</a>]:

       before logging            years after logging (1978-1982)
          (1976)                     1    2    3    4    5

           2.9                      3.3  1.0  1.6  2.5  1.5

Fringed brome is highly palatable, so it is often grazed too closely.
Humphrey [<a href="#31">31</a>] recommended that about 33 percent of the seedstalks be
left ungrazed each year and a grazing deferment every third year be
instituted for continuous availability of fringed brome.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Bromus ciliatus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Fringed brome is a nonrhizomatous, native perennial that is generally
tufted [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  Culms are slender, usually 1.7 to 4 feet (0.5-1.2 m)
tall, but up to 5.2 feet (1.6 m) tall in the Great Plains [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  The
blades are flat, 0.12 to 0.6 inch (3-15 mm) wide and 6 to 10 inches
(15-25 cm) long [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  The panicle is narrowly elongate, 2.8 to 7.2
inches (7-18 cm) long with branches ascending to drooping [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].
Fringed brome has a well-developed root system [<a href="#25">25</a>].  
  


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Fringed brome reproduces exclusively from seed [<a href="#25">25</a>].  Seeds are
nondormant and can show high germination rates.  Tests were conducted by
Hoffman [<a href="#30">30</a>] on herbaceous plants common in aspen understories of
Colorado.  Fringed brome exhibited a wide range of germination capacity.
Tests were conducted with light and dark regimes, with or without
stratification, and with a variety of thermoperiods.  In 9 tests out of
14, fringed brome had 100 percent germination.  The lowest germination
rate recorded was 60 percent in a test in which light followed
stratification [<a href="#30">30</a>].

Fringed brome is wind pollinated [<a href="#25">25</a>].  


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Fringed brome occurs in a variety of habitats including woodlands,
forest openings, thickets, grasslands, shrublands, prairies, meadows,
marshes, bogs, fens, and stream and lake margins [24,31,40,48,51,].  It
is commonly found in moist places such as wet meadows, benches, and
along streams [<a href="#46">46</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>].  Fringed brome also occurs on moist to seasonally
dry, open or densely shaded habitats in valleys and montane zones
[<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].

Fringed brome grows best on moist to semiwet soils, but is tolerant of
poorly drained and subirrigated conditions [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].  It grows best on
loam, silty loam, and sand, but occurs on stony or bouldery substrates
as well [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>].  Soil pH ranges from 4.8 to 7.9 in Yellowstone
National Park [<a href="#40">40</a>].

Elevations for fringed brome for several states and provinces are as
follows:  

       Arizona           6,000-11,000 feet     (1,800-3,300 m) [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#43">43</a>]

<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Fringed brome occurs in seral and climax communities.  It is shade
tolerant, but also grows in some open habitats [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#40">40</a>].  It is a
facultative wetland species in Montana [<a href="#10">10</a>].  The aspen/fringed brome
community type is successional to coniferous climax types in subalpine
forests of Utah [<a href="#47">47</a>].  After major disturbances on Douglas-fir/fringed
brome habitat type sites of New Mexico and Arizona, fringed brome
quickly dominates the understory under aspen [<a href="#1">1</a>].  In heavily shaded
microsites in white fir/screwleaf muhly (Muhlenbergia virescens) habitat
types, fringed brome may become the dominant understory species [<a href="#20">20</a>].
In the Rocky Mountains of New Mexico, fringed brome is found in
old-growth, intermediate-aged, and young-growth forests [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Fringed brome flowers from July to August in California, the Upper Great
Plains, and New York [<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#46">46</a>].  It flowers in August in Tennessee,
North Carolina, and West Virginia [<a href="#49">49</a>].  In Utah, fringed brome flowers
in August and September [<a href="#3">3</a>].  It flowers from July to October in Arizona
[<a href="#32">32</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Bromus ciliatus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Fringed brome has low tolerance to fires of moderate and high intensity
[<a href="#6">6</a>].  The seeds of most plants can survive grass fires [<a href="#67">67</a>], so it is
likely that seeds of fringed brome in grasslands survives fire.  Seed
survival is increased if the seeds are covered by soil [<a href="#67">67</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE EFFECTS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Bromus ciliatus
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fringed brome is probably top-killed by most fires, as are most grasses.
In northwestern Wyoming, fringed brome was "harmed" by fires of moderate
and high intensity.  Moderate intensity fires killed most surface
vegetation but did not remove all litter and duff and killed less than
90 percent of mature aspens.  After 3 years, fringed brome did not show
"appreciable recovery" from the fires [<a href="#6">6</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Frequency and cover of fringed brome increased the third year following
a spring prescribed fire in a western snowberry shrub community in
central Alberta.  The increase was greater on the unburned plot than the
burned plot [<a href="#5">5</a>].  

At Breakneck Ridge, Wyoming, a prescribed fire was conducted on August
29, 1974.  Fringed brome and slender wheatgrass were the two most
abundant grasses on the site.  Fire intensities were classed as follows:
light (<20% of vegetation consumed and very few overstory trees killed),
moderate (21-80% of fine fuels and lesser vegetation consumed by fire
and up to 90% of the mature trees killed), and high (81-100% of fine
fuels consumed and over 90% of overstory trees killed) [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>].  On the
moderate-intensity burn site, grass cover decreased from 15 to 10
percent by postfire year 3; on the high-intensity burn site, a 66
percent drop occurred by postfire year 3.  Fringed brome was affected
most by the fire.  By the end of postfire year 3, fringed brome had not
shown an appreciable recovery on moderate or high intensity burn sites
[<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>].  Production (air-dry kg/ha) of fringed brome before burning and
in postfire year 3 on plots burned at three levels of intensity were as
follows [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#64">64</a>]:

 before burning  light intensity   moderate intensity   high intensity 
  
     217              267                 181                 87

In southern Ontario, a low-intensity prescribed surface fire in an aspen
(Populus spp.) woodland was conducted on two plots on May 8, 1972 and
two more were burned on April 24, 1973.  All plots were sampled in
August of 1973.  Fringed brome only occurred on the control sites, at
2.5 percent frequency [<a href="#54">54</a>].
 


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Grass fires in Douglas-fir/Arizona fescue habitats of which fringed
brome is a member reduced the density of conifer seedlings and
maintained grass cover, although specific effects on fringed brome were
not described [<a href="#20">20</a>].  

Aspen/fringed brome stands in subalpine forests of Utah have a moderate
probability of being successfully prescribed burned, but only if
livestock grazing is deferred for at least one season before burning.
Postfire communities "quickly resemble prefire ones" [<a href="#48">48</a>].
