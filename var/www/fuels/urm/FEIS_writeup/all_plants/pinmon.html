<br />


Pinyon-juniper
woodlands cover more than 55.6 million acres in the western U.S. [<a href="#153">153</a>]. Singleleaf pinyon has a large area of distribution and,
therefore, probably a large degree of genetic variation [<a href="#120">120</a>]. It is the
predominant tree species in the isolated mountain ranges of the Great Basin,
ranging from southern Idaho, western Utah and northwestern Arizona, through most
of Nevada (it's Nevada's state tree) and eastern and central California to northern
Baja California [<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#92">92</a>,<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#133">133</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>]. There is about 2.5 billion ft<sup>3</sup> of singleleaf pinyon
in Nevada, and about 5 billion
ft<sup>3</sup> in Utah [<a href="#162">162</a>]. It is also found in the Mojave Desert borderlands of southern
California and in small, fragmented populations in a belt across
Arizona south of the Mogollon Rim into southwestern New Mexico [<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>]. The U.S.
Geological Survey provides a <a href="http://climchange.cr.usgs.gov/data/atlas/little/">distributional map</a>
for singleleaf pinyon.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p> The distribution of
singleleaf pinyon has undergone many changes in both prehistoric and historic
times [<a href="#35">35</a>], and Everett [<a href="#59">59</a>] points out that any assessment
of pinyon and juniper woodland distribution is only a snapshot of a woodland in
motion. Historic changes in distribution are reported by
several authors [<a href="#79">79</a>,<a href="#172">172</a>,<a href="#199">199</a>,<a href="#244">244</a>]. Much has been written on the evolutionary
distribution of singleleaf pinyon
[<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#128">128</a>,<a href="#138">138</a>,<a href="#161">161</a>,<a href="#194">194</a>,<a href="#198">198</a>,<a href="#207">207</a>,<a href="#213">213</a>,<a href="#219">219</a>,<a href="#220">220</a>,<a href="#231">231</a>]
and pinyon in general [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>], and may provide
information pertinent to predicting potential changes in distribution resulting
from climate change.</p>
<p>Hybrids of Colorado and singleleaf pinyon occur in 3 geographical zones along the margin where their distributions
overlap. The most
extensive zone is that along the eastern margin of the Great Basin in central
Utah. Another zone is in the canyons of the Colorado River in
southern Utah, and a 3rd zone is among the scattered pine groves south of the
Mogollon Rim in central Arizona [<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>]. Hybrids of Parry
pinyon and singleleaf pinyon are reported in southern and Baja California
[<a href="#246">246</a>,<a href="#247">247</a>]. Hybrids of singleleaf pinyon and Sierra Juarez
pi&ntilde;on are found in scattered places in northern Baja [<a href="#118">118</a>].</p>

Pinyons (<i>Cembroides</i>) typically grow in association with
juniper (<i>Juniperus</i>  spp.), with juniper dominating the lower elevations of
their range and pinyons the
upper. In fully stocked pinyon-juniper stands, understory species comprise a
very small portion of the total biomass, though they may be important forage
species and the plants most likely to reclaim the site following disturbance [<a href="#62">62</a>]. In general, coverage of understory vegetation associated with
singleleaf pinyon woodlands varies with geographic area, site quality, and successional stage.
Singleleaf pinyon occurs in 3 general regions: the Great
Basin, southern California and northern Baja, and parts of Arizona and New
Mexico south of the Mogollon Rim.

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">In the Great Basin, singleleaf pinyon is found primarily with Utah
juniper (<i>J.
osteosperma</i>), sagebrush (<i>Artemisia</i> spp.), rabbitbrush (<i>Chrysothamnus
</i>spp.), Arizona joint-fir (<i>Ephedra</i>  <i>fasciculata</i>), antelope bitterbrush (<i>Purshia tridentata</i>),
granite
pricklygilia (<i>Leptodactylon pungens</i>), and a variety of other shrubs, herbs,
and cryptobiotic or cryptogamic crusts [<a href="#78">78</a>,<a href="#88">88</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>,<a href="#164">164</a>,<a href="#199">199</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>]. The pinyon-juniper type lies between desert
shrub or grassland below and
ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>) associations above, with broad ecotones
[<a href="#57">57</a>]. Utah juniper is
absent from some singleleaf pinyon stands in extreme western and southern Nevada and adjacent California
[<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>]. In southern Nevada, singleleaf pinyon shares a broad lower ecotone with
blackbrush (<i>Coleogyne
ramosissima</i>), where creosotebush (<i>Larrea tridentata</i>) and white
bursage (<i>Ambrosia
dumosa</i>) occupy the lower slopes and valley floors, and an upper ecotone with
ponderosa pine communities with white fir (<i>Abies concolor</i>), limber pine (<i>P.
flexilis</i>) and quaking aspen (<i>Populus tremuloides</i>) [<a href="#130">130</a>,<a href="#131">131</a>]. Curlleaf mountain-mahogany (<i>Cercocarpus ledifolius</i>)
is associated with singleleaf pinyon in many areas, particularly near its upper
elevational limit [<a href="#57">57</a>].

</p>
<p class="subframeContent">Codominants of singleleaf pinyon found throughout the
Great Basin include mountain big sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i> ssp. <i>vaseyana</i>),
Wyoming big sagebrush (<i>A. t.</i> ssp. <i>wyomingensis</i>), low sagebrush (<i>A. arbuscula</i>),
blackbrush, antelope bitterbrush, desert bitterbrush
(<i>P. glandulosa</i>), curlleaf mountain-mahogany, desert snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos
longiflorus</i>), Utah snowberry (<i>S. oreophilus</i> var. <i>utahensis</i>),
rubber rabbitbrush (<i>Chrysothamnus nauseosus</i>), low
rabbitbrush (<i>C. viscidiflorus</i>), pale serviceberry (<i>Amelanchier pallida</i>),
greenleaf manzanita (<i>Arctostaphylos patula</i>), Gambel oak (<i>Quercus
gambelii</i>), shadscale (<i>Atriplex confertifolia</i>), green ephedra (<i>E.
viridus</i>), bluebunch wheatgrass (<i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i>), Idaho
fescue (<i>Festuca idahoensis</i>), Thurber needlegrass (<i>Achnatherum
thurberianum</i>), desert needlegrass (<i>A. speciosum</i>), Indian
ricegrass (<i>A. hymenoides</i>), Sandberg bluegrass (<i>Poa secunda</i>), mutton
grass (<i>P. fendleriana</i>), blue grama (<i>Bouteloua gracilis</i>),
bottlebrush squirreltail (<i>Elymus elymoides</i>), bullgrass (<i>Elymus simplex</i>), arrowleaf balsamroot (<i>Balsamorhiza sagittata</i>),
and cheatgrass (<i>Bromus tectorum</i>) [<a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>,<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#106">106</a>,<a href="#132">132</a>]. Singleleaf pinyon reaches the
northern extent of its range at the northern end of the Great
Basin, in southern Idaho, where it occurs in rare communities with the following species: Utah juniper,
curlleaf
mountain mahogany, mountain big sagebrush, black
sagebrush (<i>Artemisia nova</i>), Sandberg bluegrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass [<a href="#175">175</a>]. Singleleaf pinyon is
codominant with narrowleaf cottonwood (<i>Populus angustifolia</i>), big sagebrush,
red-osier dogwood (<i>Cornus sericea</i>), narrowleaf willow (<i>Salix exigua</i>), and
rabbitbrush species in some of the riparian ecosystems in Great
Basin National Park, Nevada [<a href="#184">184</a>].

</p>
<p class="subframeContent">Everett and Koniak [<a href="#62">62</a>] describe several other important understory
species found with singleleaf pinyon in the Great
Basin of Nevada, and note that annual forbs are best adapted to coexist with the
singleleaf pinyon and associated juniper species in fully stocked stands. Because
of the ephemeral nature of this group, understory
cover tends to be variable and response to disturbance less predictable.
Understory vegetation varies with microsites, being most
abundant in the transition zone between the duff under the tree canopies and the
space between trees. Goodrich and others [<a href="#77">77</a>]
describe endemic and endangered plants of pinyon-juniper communities in
Utah.

</p>
<p class="subframeContent">In the Inyo and White mountains of
eastern California, Utah
juniper occurs with singleleaf pinyon primarily at lower elevations, with Utah
juniper density decreasing at upper elevations. The shrub layer is sparse and
composed primarily of big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush and desert bitterbrush, intermixed with
<i>Ephedra </i>spp.,
rubber and low rabbitbrush, and cactus (<i>Opuntia</i> and <i>
Echinocereus</i> spp.). Singleleaf pinyon is bordered by Great Basin bristlecone pine (<i>P.</i> <i>longaeva</i>) and limber pine
at higher elevation [<a href="#157">157</a>]. Singleleaf pinyon is also found with
Great Basin bristlecone
pine on several
mountain ranges in Nevada, and in the San Francisco Mountains of southwestern Utah
[<a href="#142">142</a>]. On the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada singleleaf pinyon is
found with western juniper (<i>J. occidentalis</i>), Utah juniper,
Jeffrey pine (<i>P. jeffreyi</i>), ponderosa pine, big sagebrush, curlleaf mountain-mahogany, rubber
rabbitbrush, antelope bitterbrush, desert bitterbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, and bottlebrush squirreltail
[<a href="#43">43</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>,<a href="#224">224</a>]. Singleleaf pinyon may also be found with bigcone
Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga macrocarpa</i>) at upper elevations in southern California [<a href="#140">140</a>].

</p>
<p class="subframeContent">In southern California, singleleaf pinyon is a common component
of the desert montane landscape on arid slopes [<a href="#187">187</a>], and is most commonly found with California
juniper (<i>J. californica</i>) [<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>]. In the Mojave Desert
mountain ranges, it intergrades at higher elevations with white fir or Great
Basin bristlecone pine forest, and at lower elevations with California juniper
and Joshua tree (<i>Yucca brevifolia</i>) woodland with creosotebush and white
bursage. Here it occurs with big sagebrush, curlleaf
mountain-mahogany, blackbrush, Stansbury cliffrose (<i>Purshia mexicana</i> var.
<i>stansburiana</i>), Nevada ephedra (<i>Ephedra nevadensis</i>), shrub live oak
(<i>Quercus turbinella</i>), rubber rabbitbrush, low rabbitbrush, blue sage (<i>Salvia pachyphylla</i>), Wright
buckwheat (<i>Eriogonum wrightii </i>var.<i> trachygonum</i>), hollyleaf gilia (<i>Gilia latiflora</i>), and
cheatgrass [<a href="#87">87</a>,<a href="#93">93</a>]. In the San Bernardino Mountains singleleaf
pinyon occurs primarily with California and western juniper, curlleaf mountain-mahogany, and big sagebrush [<a href="#94">94</a>,<a href="#150">150</a>]. Singleleaf
pinyon may also be found in redshanks (<i>Adenostoma sparsifolium</i>)
chaparral communities with desert ceanothus (<i>Ceanothus greggii</i>)
[<a href="#135">135</a>]. In the Sierra Ju&aacute;rez in northern
Baja, singleleaf pinyon forms extensive forests in association with California juniper, sugar sumac (<i>Rhus ovata</i>),
Palmer oak (<i>Quercus dunnii</i>), Muller oak (<i>Q. cornelius-mulleri</i>),
redberry buckthorn (<i>Rhamnus crocea</i>), Mojave yucca (<i>Yucca schidigera</i>),
and chaparral yucca (<i>Y. whipplei</i>), with Parry pinyon dominant on the wetter western margin and singleleaf
pinyon dominant on
the eastern rim [<a href="#151">151</a>]. Singleleaf pinyon may also be found with Jeffrey pine and peninsular oak (<i>Quercus peninsurlaris</i>)
[<a href="#120">120</a>,<a href="#156">156</a>].
On the eastern
flank of the Sierra San Pedro M&aacute;rtir, singleleaf pinyon forms extensive forests with desert chaparral
understory dominated by
peninsular manzanita (<i>Arctostaphylos peninsularis</i>) and peninsular oak and
bordered by Parry pinyon at upper elevations. Elsewhere in Northern Baja, near the southern end of its distribution,
singleleaf pinyon occurs in scattered patches on high
ridges and northern aspects [<a href="#151">151</a>].

</p>
<p class="subframeContent">In the southern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico,
singleleaf pinyon occurs at mid-elevations with ponderosa pine above and oak woodlands below.
In the Hualapai Mountains of western Arizona, singleleaf pinyon is dominant at upper elevations with occasional occurrence of Utah
juniper and ponderosa pine, and is codominant with Utah juniper at lower
elevations. Understory plants include green ephedra, red barberry (<i>Mahonia
haematocarpa</i>), broom snakeweed (<i>Gutierrezia sarothrae</i>), turpentine
bush (<i>Ericameria laricifolia</i>), kingcup cactus (<i>Echinocereus triglochidiatus</i>
var. <i>melanacanthus</i>), greenflower nipple cactus (<i>Mammillaria
viridiflorus</i>), prickly-pear (<i>Opuntia</i> spp.), shrub live oak, ceanothus
(<i>Ceanothus</i> spp.), skunkbush sumac (<i>Rhus aromatica </i> var.<i> trilobata</i>),
banana yucca (<i>Y. baccata</i>), yerba de pasmo (<i>Baccharis
pteronioides</i>), and perennial grasses including grama (<i>Bouteloua</i>  spp.),
fringed brome (<i>Bromus ciliatus</i>), California brome (<i>B. carinatus</i>),
New Mexico feathergrass (<i>Hesperostipa neomexicana</i>), and purple threeawn (<i>Aristida purpurea</i>)
[<a href="#30">30</a>]. In Arizona and New Mexico singleleaf pinyon is
codominant with shrub live oak, Emory oak (<i>Q. emoryi</i>), pointleaf
manzanita (<i>A. pungens</i>), blue grama, crucifixion thorn (<i>Canotia holacantha</i>),
and banana yucca, and also occurs with Utah juniper,
alligator juniper (<i>J. deppeana</i>), mimosa (<i>Mimosa aculeaticarpa </i> var.<i> biuncifera</i>), sumac (<i>Rhus</i> spp.),
silktassel (<i>Garrya</i> spp.), curlymesquite (<i>Hilaria

Wood of singleleaf pinyon is used primarily for fuel wood and fence posts
[<a href="#95">95</a>,<a href="#115">115</a>]. It is not suitable for
lumber because of its small size, irregular shape, and lack of self-pruning
[<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>]. It may be used for particle board and cement board [<a href="#71">71</a>,<a href="#159">159</a>]. The old wood burns hot and served as an important fuel source
for railroads and a major charcoal source for silver smelters in
the late 1800s [<a href="#110">110</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>].

Pinyon-juniper woodlands provide shelter and forage for numerous species of wildlife, some of which
may be obligate to these
woodlands such as pinyon mice and woodrats [<a href="#142">142</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#182">182</a>].
These forests have value as habitat for several large mammals such as mule deer, white-tailed deer,
pronghorn, desert bighorn sheep, elk, wild horses, mountain lions, and bears
[<a href="#143">143</a>,<a href="#157">157</a>,<a href="#182">182</a>,<a href="#192">192</a>,<a href="#206">206</a>]. Gray foxes, bobcats, coyotes, weasels,
skunks, badgers, and ringtails search for prey here [<a href="#182">182</a>,<a href="#248">248</a>].
Many species
of birds [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>,<a href="#171">171</a>,<a href="#229">229</a>] and reptiles [<a href="#157">157</a>] find food and shelter here. Pinyon-juniper forests are important wintering
areas for Clark's nutcrackers [<a href="#223">223</a>]. The quantity and variety of
species using the pinyon-juniper woodlands changes with succession [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#182">182</a>]. <p class="subframeContent">Pinyon
mice, deer mice, woodrats, squirrels, chipmunks, deer, black bears, and desert
bighorn sheep eat singleleaf pinyon seeds [<a href="#23">23</a>], as do scrub, Steller's, and
pinyon jays and
Clark's nutcrackers [<a href="#64">64</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>]. Many of these animals cache
seeds for winter use and are critical for regeneration of singleleaf pinyon
[<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#180">180</a>,<a href="#211">211</a>]. Although it is not favored, mule deer eat pinyon foliage [<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>],
using the foliage moderately in
winter, spring, and summer [<a href="#117">117</a>]. Singleleaf pinyon comprised 1 to 2% of the
winter diet of pronghorn in Utah, while cattle and domestic sheep did not use it [<a href="#183">183</a>]. Cows may feed on
pinyon in the
winter, and it is thought that this can cause them to abort [<a href="#121">121</a>]. The inner bark is a major food of
porcupines, and is also eaten by squirrels, raccoons,
rabbits, ringtails, coyotes, and gray foxes [<a href="#182">182</a>], as well as the larvae of the mountain pine beetle and the fungus
causing pinyon blister rust [<a href="#121">121</a>]. Limbs are attacked by pinyon dwarf-mistletoe (<i>Arceuthobium divaricatum</i>). The pitch is
a staple food of pitch midges and is used by <i>Dianthidium </i>bees to build
their nests. Sawflies feed on needles and pollen. Gall midges live in the
needles by causing 2-needle fascicles to develop and living in the fascicle crotch
[<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>].

Pinyon nuts have outstanding nutritional value. Shelled nuts of singleleaf pinyon
have approximately 9.5% protein, 23% fat, and
54% carbohydrate. They are comparable in nutritional value to pecans. They
contain all 20 amino acids, with 8 of the 9 essential amino acids are more abundant
in pinyon nuts than in amaranth (<i>Amaranthus</i> spp.), another important food plant of Great Basin
Native Americans. Singleleaf pinyon seeds are especially rich
in tryptophan and cystine [<a href="#121">121</a>]. They have a large amount of oleic
and linoleic unsaturated fatty acids, comprising 42.5%
and 42% of the fatty acid total, respectively. Eighty percent of the fatty acids are
polyunsaturated [<a href="#125">125</a>]. The nuts also provide significant amounts
of vitamin A, thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin [<a href="#114">114</a>].

Singleleaf pinyon has not been regarded historically as a species to be used for
rehabilitation of disturbed sites, but more often as a disturbance agent and an
invasive species [<a href="#34">34</a>]. Some literature recommends rehabilitating pinyon-juniper sites by
managing for old-growth structure with an emphasis on pine nut production [<a href="#110">110</a>].

Pinyon-juniper ecosystems have had subsistence, cultural, spiritual, economic,
aesthetic and medicinal
value to Native American peoples for
centuries [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#148">148</a>,<a href="#149">149</a>], and singleleaf pinyon has provided food, fuel, medicine and shelter to Native Americans
for thousands of years [<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#99">99</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>,<a href="#210">210</a>,<a href="#249">249</a>]. The
pitch of singleleaf pinyon was used as adhesive, caulking material, and a paint
binder [<a href="#6">6</a>]. It may also be used medicinally and chewed like gum
[<a href="#210">210</a>]. Pinyon seeds are a valuable food source for humans [<a href="#52">52</a>,<a href="#95">95</a>], and a valuable commercial crop

<a name="OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Past management of singleleaf pinyon has ranged from heavy use to planned
eradication. Continued removal of old-growth trees could potentially
eliminate them and
promote reverse genetic selection by diminishing the quality of the trees left
[<a href="#110">110</a>]. Multiresource management
of pinyon-juniper woodlands for sustained production of a variety of products including tree products,
forage
for livestock, habitat for wildlife species, watershed protection, recreation,
and archeological values is gaining support [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#100">100</a>]. 

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">
 Singleleaf pinyon can be managed for tree products such as fuel, fenceposts,
resins, and pine nuts. Production of these resources requires healthy functioning of whole
ecosystems, providing economic incentive
for sustainable ecological practices. Management of woodlands for nut
production will yield 100 times more income than will management for livestock forage, and
the 2 can both be done on the same land and not interfere with one another
[<a href="#110">110</a>].
Fisher and others [<a href="#72">72</a>] give management suggestions for improving nut
crops in pinyon. 

</p>

<p class="subframeContent"> Some authors report no appreciable increase in spatial distribution of singleleaf pinyon in
California [<a href="#136">136</a>] and the Great Basin. In fact, its range in the Great Basin has substantially decreased since 1987
due to a large die-off of singleleaf pinyon in Utah [<a href="#21">21</a>]. However, most authors
have reported increases in spatial extent and tree dominance
and reductions of
understory cover and diversity in pinyon-juniper
woodlands
[<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#39">39</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#62">62</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#96">96</a>,<a href="#167">167</a>,<a href="#180">180</a>,<a href="#199">199</a>,<a href="#204">204</a>,<a href="#218">218</a>,<a href="#235">235</a>]. These changes may be attributed
to the
interactions of many variables such as seed distribution by birds, centuries of
domestic livestock grazing, changes in fire frequency, and
climate change [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#48">48</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#90">90</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#197">197</a>,<a href="#204">204</a>]. Some managers have been concerned about the subsequent loss of
forage for livestock and big game and have
supported efforts to remove trees and seed non-native grasses to create
artificial grasslands [<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#102">102</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>,<a href="#134">134</a>,<a href="#149">149</a>,<a href="#232">232</a>]. Removal of trees tends to
result in increased growth of understory species (e.g., see [<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#66">66</a>,<a href="#67">67</a>,<a href="#216">216</a>]); however, many &quot;control&quot; operations
fail to meet their
objectives or fall short of projected increases in forage production [<a href="#40">40</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>,<a href="#169">169</a>,<a href="#188">188</a>,<a href="#244">244</a>].
Furthermore, tree removal can have serious impacts on hydrology, nutrient cycling, soil fertility
[<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#204">204</a>], and wildlife and archaeological resources [<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#122">122</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>]. Often
the resulting slash from these operations is piled and burned, resulting in
high heat levels that leave some areas sterilized and free of vegetation for over 20 years [<a href="#165">165</a>].
  

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">While tree encroachment may adversely affect habitat by reducing
forage for
some wildlife species, the total removal of trees may not be an effective alternative.
Periodic removal of some singleleaf pinyon trees using prescribed fire or silvicultural
treatments, while leaving areas of trees close by, creates more effective
habitat for wildlife [<a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#182">182</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>,<a href="#206">206</a>]. It is important that a variety of age classes be represented on the landscape, since each
successional stage supports
different species in different amounts. Old growth pinyon-juniper woodlands, for
example, are home to many species of
reptiles, and any changes in woodland tree density may have an effect on lizard
populations [<a href="#157">157</a>]. Also, while exotic grasses may be
more successful than native species at regeneration after tree removal,
seeding exotics may &quot;break the chain&quot; successionally by replacing
early successional hosts of mycorrhizae shared by later successional species [<a href="#206">206</a>].
Singleleaf pinyon
removal
and woodland conversion projects have the potential to increase cover of
undesirable exotic species such as cheatgrass at the expense of the more
desirable native forage species [<a href="#193">193</a>]. 

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">It remains unclear what type of stand structure
provides the most desirable watershed conditions in pinyon-juniper woodlands.
Some managers suggest that a high density of trees causes erosion, while
others suggest that centuries of grazing and destruction of cryptobiotic crusts
have caused erosion in these woodlands. No studies support the claim that deforestation reduces erosion and protects watersheds
[<a href="#48">48</a>].  

</p>

<p class="subframeContent"> Insects and diseases affecting singleleaf pinyon include
pinyon needle scale, which weakens trees and subjects them to killing
attacks by bark beetles (pinyon ips) [<a href="#215">215</a>,<a href="#240">240</a>]. Pinyon pine sawfly can also be a
serious
defoliator [<a href="#215">215</a>]. Singleleaf pinyon is parasitized by the pinyon dwarf-mistletoe
[<a href="#91">91</a>]. Black stain root disease causes extensive mortality in single leaf
pinyon in
portions of the San Bernardino Mountains in southern California [<a href="#187">187</a>]. Cone and seed
insects associated with singleleaf pinyon, such as the pinyon cone beetle (<i>Conophthorus monphyllae</i>), coneworms (the larval stage of <i> Dioryctria</i>
moths), and the pinyon cone borer may need to be considered if nut production is
an objective [<a href="#38">38</a>,<a href="#147">147</a>,<a href="#160">160</a>]. Variability of stand
conditions within a forest or region may reduce the risk of widespread mortality
due to insect pests and diseases and may be achieved by reintroduction of fire to reduce biomass and fuel
loads in some areas [<a href="#51">51</a>]. Removal of all pinyon slash larger than 3 inches (8
cm) will usually prevent
pinyon ips
populations from reaching epidemic proportions [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. 

</p>

<p class="subframeContent"> Nearly 70 taxa of narrow endemic plants,
many of which are listed as threatened, endangered, or sensitive, or have been
considered for listing, are found in pinyon-juniper communities in Utah, and may
be somehow dependent on the pinyon-juniper association. An understanding of the
habitat (geology, soils, hydrology) and biology of these protected species is also an important
aspect of management decisions [<a href="#77">77</a>]. Cryptobiotic crusts are important features of
pinyon-juniper ecosystems, as they are thought to increase infiltration, reduce erosion,
contribute to soil organic matter, and fix nitrogen [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#233">233</a>]. It is important to
consider impacts of management activities on these crusts, as they are fragile
and recover slowly [<a href="#82">82</a>]. Slash management is also an important consideration in
the nutrient-poor environment typical of singleleaf pinyon communities [<a href="#58">58</a>], and the culling of dead and dying trees through fuel wood and
salvage operations removes nutrients as well as habitat for
insects and wildlife [<a href="#42">42</a>]. However, Thran and Everett [<a href="#208">208</a>] found little change in soil nutrients after complete tree removal in
Nevada. 

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">Management of singleleaf pinyon involves a complex ecosystem,
sometimes requiring landscape-scale objectives [<a href="#110">110</a>]. Because stand characteristics of singleleaf
pinyon woodland vary with geography, topography, local
site conditions, understory community and general climate, effective management must work
within the community ecology of the woodland sites of interest, including all the
species present and the history of use and change on the site, as well as its
current ecological status [<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#204">204</a>]. Gottfried and Severson [<a href="#81">81</a>] provide a detailed review of past management
objectives and procedures and an evaluation of their relative successes. Ellenwood
[<a href="#53">53</a>] suggests some generalized management objectives
commonly applied to pinyon-juniper forests (sustaining grassland, sustaining
woodland, and sustaining woodland savannah), and silvicultural systems that may be used to achieve these
objectives. Other silvicultural recommendations for singleleaf pinyon woodlands are
available [<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#178">178</a>]. Miller [<a href="#148">148</a>] presents examples of holistic woodland management
which take into account the human element and cultural and spiritual
requirements of the Native peoples who live in pinyon-juniper ecosystems. He
also suggests &quot;community forestry&quot; practices as good templates for woodland
planning [<a href="#149">149</a>].

<br />

Mature singleleaf pinyon is typically a short tree (20-40 feet (6-12 m) tall), with
a rounded to flat-topped crown
and multiple, upswept branches due to lack of self-pruning. It may occasionally be multi-stemmed from
simultaneous establishment from seed caches [<a href="#213">213</a>]. It generally
forms open
woodlands [<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>]. Bark is smooth and thin (0.4-0.8 inch (1-2 cm)) on young trees,
forming deep, irregular fissures and ridges
with thin
scales, and is up to an inch thick with age [<a href="#83">83</a>]. The wood is light
and soft, not strong or resinous&nbsp;[<a href="#168">168</a>]. Singleleaf pinyon has an
extensive lateral root system, giving it the ability to penetrate into open areas between tree canopies and extract water and nutrients.
Its ability to invade adjacent shrublands may also be related to
the tree's ability to maintain a seasonally stable xylem water potential
and thereby to endure drought better than the associated shrubs [<a href="#58">58</a>].&nbsp;<p> The needles
of singleleaf pinyon are solitary, rigid, and 1 to 1.4 inches (2.5-3.5 cm) long.
The sheaths deciduous
[<a href="#232">232</a>]. The single needle (leaf) is unique among pines of the world [<a href="#121">121</a>]. Singleleaf
pinyon needles are long-lived (5-12 years) [<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>]. Their longevity is considered an extreme
expression of &quot;evergreenness,&quot; giving the tree the ability to conserve
nutrients to take advantage of short favorable conditions within a
generally unfavorable period [<a href="#139">139</a>]. The allelopathic effects of
singleleaf pinyon needle litter on germination and growth of herbaceous
plants has been documented [<a href="#60">60</a>], and
is attributed to terpene hydrocarbons [<a href="#241">241</a>]. These compounds also
impede decomposition, are highly flammable, and are readily volatilized by fire
[<a href="#239">239</a>].</p>
<p>Singleleaf pinyon bears ovulate cones, 1.4 to 2.2 inches (3.5-5.5 cm)
long, with thick scales. Cones bear large (0.4-0.7 inch (10-17 mm) long), heavy
(0.01 oz (400 mg)), moderately
thin-shelled, edible, wingless seeds
[<a href="#137">137</a>,<a href="#211">211</a>,<a href="#232">232</a>]. Cones that
dry and open in the fall drop to the ground in winter or spring and may form a
conspicuous litter layer [<a href="#83">83</a>,<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<p>Singleleaf pinyon is long- lived.
On fire-safe sites, large trees can
monopolize site resources over a life span of 350 years or more [<a href="#63">63</a>]. Dominant
pinyons are often 400 years old and have been known to reach 800 to 1000 years [<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#174">174</a>]. Mature singleleaf pinyon trees (over 200 years) are
relatively uncommon [<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#98">98</a>]. Of the 20 million acres of pinyon-juniper stands in Nevada and Utah, about half are estimated to be between 40 and 120 years old,
with almost 20% in Utah
and 9% in Nevada over 200 years of age [<a href="#162">162</a>,<a href="#163">163</a>].&nbsp;Biomass
estimates for singleleaf pinyon are available for Nevada [<a href="#36">36</a>,<a href="#37">37</a>,<a href="#146">146</a>].</p>

<p>Hybrids are diagnosed by frequency of monophylly and leaf resin canal number
[<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#119">119</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>].&nbsp;Hybrids of singleleaf and Colorado pinyon have a mixture of 1- and 2-needle fascicles on
the same branchlets, fewer resin ducts than singleleaf pinyon but more than&nbsp;Colorado
pinyon, and intermediate cone size [<a href="#121">121</a>].</p>

Reproduction in singleleaf pinyon is by seed and does
not occur naturally by vegetative means [<a href="#142">142</a>]. It is monoecious and wind pollinated [<a href="#58">58</a>].
Cone and seed development require 3 seasons and
about 26 months [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>]. Strobili or cone primordia are initiated the growing
season prior to their appearance the following spring, undergoing a period of
dormancy through the winter prior to opening. Pollen release is controlled by local
conditions. Once pollinated, growth of the pollen tube undergoes another winter
dormancy period prior to fertilization. After fertilization, seeds develop rapidly, mature, and
disperse about 6 months later, the 2nd autumn after pollination. With so much
time between so many stages, cone and seed crops are exposed to a number of&nbsp;
variables that affect the seed crop, such as weather, predation, and internal competition for
resources between the previous and current year's cones; therefore, seed production is highly variable from tree to tree, year to year, and place to
place [<a href="#105">105</a>].&nbsp; 

</p>

<p class="subframeContent"> Singleleaf pinyon generally begins bearing cones
at about 35 years of age, begins producing good seed crops at about 75 to 100
years, and reaches maximum production at about 160 to 200 years [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>]. Singleleaf pinyon exhibits region-wide synchrony in cone production,
masting every 2 to 3 years [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#215">215</a>]. Some seeds
may be produced every year [<a href="#99">99</a>], and good seed crops occur somewhere over
a geographical area (e.g. the Great Basin) nearly every year [<a href="#142">142</a>]. A 5-year study reported per acre cone production as follows: 1975, 765
cones; 1976, 0 cones; 1977, 2,560 cones; 1978, 2,325 cones; 1979, 585 cones
[<a href="#99">99</a>]. Mast years in singleleaf pinyon may be related to the
polar front jet stream [<a href="#161">161</a>]. Singleleaf pinyon is said to be more
productive and predictable than Colorado pinyon, with seed production
being predicted fairly accurately 2 years in advance and more accurately 1 year in
advance [<a href="#99">99</a>].&nbsp;Seed production and survival may be affected by several insect
pests of
cones and seeds. For example, the pinyon cone beetle can destroy more than 50%
of the crop of its host pinyon, while coneworms
tunnel in cones and shoots but are of minor importance [<a href="#38">38</a>]. For
other pests, such as the pinyon cone borer, the magnitude of the effects is unknown
[<a href="#147">147</a>]. 

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">Because singleleaf pinyon seeds are totally wingless,
seed dispersal is dependent on vertebrate dispersers that store seeds in food
caches, where unconsumed seeds germinate. This dispersal mechanism is a good example of a
co-evolved, mutualistic,
plant-vertebrate relationship [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#213">213</a>]. The cone scales
of singleleaf pinyon have a membranous tissue that holds the seed in place
after the cones open, protecting them from ground-foragers and keeping them
available to avian dispersers. Several corvids are responsible for dispersal of singleleaf
pinyon seeds
over distance. Scrub and Steller's jays forage alone or in
pairs, carrying 1 to a few seeds less than a mile before burying them. Pinyon jays forage in flocks of hundreds, carrying about
40 nuts each up to 5 miles (8.3 km) before caching them in the soil. Clark's nutcrackers
forage in somewhat smaller
flocks, each carrying several dozen seeds a distance of up to 13 miles (22 km) and burying
1 to 15 seeds per
cache, 1 to 3 cm deep in gravelly soil, mineral
soil, or duff [<a href="#122">122</a>,<a href="#123">123</a>,<a href="#211">211</a>]. Seed caching by Clark's nutcrackers
begins late August to early September [<a href="#211">211</a>]. In a good seed crop year, an individual Clark's nutcracker may
scatter-hoard 17,900 singleleaf pinyon seeds [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#211">211</a>]. The large range of singleleaf
pinyon may be
attributable, in part, to seed dispersal by these birds [<a href="#137">137</a>].&nbsp;Seed
dispersal by humans in the past has also been suggested [<a href="#126">126</a>]. Chipmunks, squirrels, deer mice,
pinyon mice,
Great Basin pocket mice, and Panamint kangaroo rats all scatter-hoard singleleaf
pinyon seeds locally [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>].
These animals consume most of the seed, but some is left to germinate.
Quantitatively, these rodents are less effective than avian
dispersers, since it is only in mast years that large numbers of seeds fall to
the ground and become available to rodents. The seed characteristics and the microhabitats in which seeds are placed are
important
in determining their fate after dispersal.
Rodents are qualitatively effective dispersers of singleleaf pinyon seed since they tend to bury seeds under and adjacent to shrubs, whereas
avian dispersers tend to cache seeds in interspace environments, a less
suitable environment for singleleaf pinyon seedlings [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#180">180</a>].&nbsp; 
<br><br>
In general, pinyon seeds are short-lived with little innate dormancy and
thus form only a temporary seed bank [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. Fresh seeds have 85 to 95% viability, but this decreases in a year
or less [<a href="#58">58</a>]. Most seeds germinate the spring following dispersal [<a href="#35">35</a>], requiring
28 to 90 days&nbsp;of cold stratification for germination
[<a href="#125">125</a>].
Germination and establishment are most likely when favorable moisture conditions
follow a mast year. Seeds may germinate in the
open, but seedling establishment in the open is rare [<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>].&nbsp;

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">Singleleaf pinyon seedling establishment is episodic.
Population age structure is 
affected by drought, which differentially reduces seedling and sapling 
recruitment more than other age classes [<a href="#185">185</a>].&nbsp;Top-growth of seedlings is slow
(1.0 inch (2.5 cm) per year in
height, and 0.012 inch (0.3 mm) per year in diameter). Root growth is more rapid,
with the taproot reaching 6 inches (15 cm) 10 days after germination [<a href="#142">142</a>]. Seedlings can thereby withstand soil water below the wilting point for about 2
weeks. However, field drought conditions
are often more severe than this, and so seedlings only survive in the most favorable
microenvironments [<a href="#58">58</a>].&nbsp;Singleleaf pinyon seedlings survive best in the microhabitat provided by nurse plants,
where organic matter, nutrient concentrations, relative humidity, water
infiltration, and water holding capacity tend to be higher, and irradiance and soil
temperatures tend to be
lower [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#105">105</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. However, nurse plants also compete for water and
nutrients, so the trade-off
is slower seedling growth rate [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>]. Seedlings maintain a more favorable
water status and have greater drought avoidance than shrub nurse plants [<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>]. The complex interaction between
seedlings and nurse plants is a balance between facilitation and competition on moisture and light
gradients [<a href="#33">33</a>].&nbsp;

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">The ecotones between singleleaf pinyon woodlands and adjacent shrublands
and grasslands provide favorable microhabitats for singleleaf pinyon seedling establishment since
they are active zones for seed dispersal, nurse plants are available, and singleleaf pinyon
seedlings are only affected by competition from grass and
other herbaceous vegetation for a couple of years. This facilitates
expansion of woodlands along these ecotones, with singleleaf pinyon seedlings eventually overtopping
and shading out the shrubs. Conversely, singleleaf pinyon seedlings
establishing under adult trees have little chance of maturing unless the adult tree
is removed or dies [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">Singleleaf pinyon is slow growing.
A dominant tree requires about
60 years to reach 6.6 feet (2 m) in height, and
about 150 years to attain 28 feet (8.5 m) in height and a stump height diameter of about
12 inches (30 cm) [<a href="#142">142</a>,<a href="#143">143</a>]. Average annual height
and diameter growth of immature dominants is about 2 inches (5 cm), and 0.04 to 0.20
inch (1 to 5 mm), respectively. Growth rates
vary considerably even among trees on identical sites, and are greatly influenced by competition for severely limited water supplies.
Dominant trees may maintain constant diameter growth rates for more than 200 years. Observed reductions in
growth rates with age are likely caused by increasing competition as stands develop,
and no definite age of culmination of growth has been determined [<a href="#141">141</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>].

<a name="SITE CHARACTERISTICS">
SITE CHARACTERISTICS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Singleleaf pinyon is adapted to a wide variety of sites. It usually grows on pediments, dry, rocky slopes,
ridges, and alluvial fans and is rarely
found on valley floors [<a href="#124">124</a>,<a href="#187">187</a>]. It is frost resistant,
tolerant of drought, and requires full sunlight for maximum growth [<a href="#122">122</a>].
On favorable sites where past mismanagement
has not been severe, the woodland may form a dense cover with trees 30 to 40 feet (9-12 m) tall. On drier sites spacing widens and
tree size diminishes [<a href="#120">120</a>]. Old-growth or climax stands
of singleleaf pinyon often occupy rocky hillslopes where the sparse
understory will not carry fire [<a href="#110">110</a>]. At the northern end of its range, singleleaf pinyon
is found primarily on
south-facing slopes and outcrops of decomposed granite. At the southern end of
its range it occurs only on north-facing slopes [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#151">151</a>].&nbsp;

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">Elevational range of singleleaf pinyon is generally
3,280 to 9,186 feet (1000-2800 m). In Baja and parts of southern California it may be found below
3,280 feet (1000 m).
The lower elevational limit in the high desert of
the Great Basin is just above the elevation of the adjacent valleys,
varying
from 4,987 to 6,988 feet (1520-2130 m). The upper limit of singleleaf pinyon varies with
climate and competing tree species, but it has been found as high as 10,000 feet
(3050 m) in the White
Mountains of California [<a href="#124">124</a>]. The frequency of monophylly was found to be inversely related to
elevation in Zion National Park, with a narrow elevational range up to about
5,600 feet (1860 m); Colorado pinyon occurred at higher elevations and hybrids of the
2 species were distributed throughout the elevational ranges of both [<a href="#75">75</a>,<a href="#127">127</a>]. The relationship of monophylly to elevation was
also observed in the New York Mountains in California and was interpreted as a
variation of character along a moisture-temperature gradient [<a href="#243">243</a>], with
Colorado pinyon occupying higher elevation sites and singleleaf pinyon lower
sites [<a href="#214">214</a>].

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">Singleleaf pinyon is the most xeric pine in the United
States. Its mean annual precipitation range is 8 to 18 inches (200-460 mm), with most
precipitation falling December through April. Its mean annual air temperature
is 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 &deg;C), ranging from 21 degrees Fahrenheit (-6 &deg;C) in January to 86 degrees
Fahrenheit (30 &deg;C) in July
[<a href="#142">142</a>]. Annual stem growth, needle length and percentage of double-needled
fascicles all had significant positive correlations (p&lt;0.05) with annual
precipitation received prior to the completion of each year's growth [<a href="#202">202</a>].
Mature singleleaf pinyon is not shade tolerant; however, water
rather than light is the limiting factor in survival and growth of this species
[<a href="#143">143</a>].
Results of a Nevada study suggest that the ability of
singleleaf pinyon to exist on a wide range of environmental conditions is&nbsp;not a
function of variable ecophysiological responses, but an opportunistic response to
the availability of resources and conditions suitable for growth [<a href="#97">97</a>].

<p class="subframeContent">Pinyon-juniper woodlands occur on many types of soils
and parent materials. Singleleaf pinyon typically grows on shallow, well-drained, low
fertility soils, although it has been found on
more productive soils as well [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#80">80</a>,<a href="#81">81</a>]. Singleleaf pinyon in shallow soils tend to grow more slowly than
those in deeper soils [<a href="#215">215</a>]. Surface soil pH usually is
between 6.0 and 8.0 [<a href="#80">80</a>]. A study in the Great Basin
found singleleaf pinyon was most common on granitic
parent material (33% cover), followed by alluvial parent material (9.5% cover), and finally limestone
parent material (0.3% cover). It was not found on
quartzite or sandstone. Singleleaf pinyon was most commonly found on soils that contained
15-35% skeletal material by volume [<a href="#89">89</a>].&nbsp;

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">While singleleaf pinyon can grow on a wide variety of soil
types and environmental conditions, composition and distribution of
associated understory species may be driven by the plants' position relative to
the tree crown [<a href="#69">69</a>], soil type [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#237">237</a>], the
seasonality and effectiveness of precipitation [<a href="#234">234</a>], and/or the
distribution of nutrients [<a href="#209">209</a>]. Summerfield and others
[<a href="#191">191</a>] found that soils supporting singleleaf pinyon stands in western Nevada commonly had
mollic epipedons, argillic
horizons, shallow depth to bedrock, mesic temperature regimes, and low available
water capacities. These soils are well suited for producing woodlands, but have
low potential for forage production. A study in the Great Basin in Nevada found that singleleaf pinyon was absent from sites with
hydrothermally altered andesite parent material. Researchers concluded that the
absence of singleleaf pinyon was more likely
due to the absence of big sagebrush nurse plants than to substrate-induced nutrient limitations,
since it was able to grow on this soil in the greenhouse [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>,<a href="#177">177</a>].&nbsp;

<br />

The pinyon-juniper woodland is generally a climax vegetation type throughout its
range, reaching climax about 300 years after disturbance [<a href="#58">58</a>], with an
ongoing trend toward increased tree density and canopy cover and a decline in understory species
over time [<a href="#59">59</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>,<a href="#182">182</a>,<a href="#201">201</a>,<a href="#236">236</a>].
Woodlands may also expand into adjacent grass and shrublands over time
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#201">201</a>,<a href="#236">236</a>]. The woodland type often occurs in a mosaic, with
trees
occupying the stonier soils where fires spread poorly and competition from
shrubs
and grass is minimal [<a href="#1">1</a>]. Fire may have kept trees out of
grasslands in the past [<a href="#200">200</a>], and it is debated whether the lack
of fire is now allowing woodlands to invade true grasslands [<a href="#81">81</a>,<a href="#82">82</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>]. A variety of natural and anthropogenic processes can lead to changes in the
spatial distribution of pinyon-juniper woodlands over time. Among these are 1)
tree seedling establishment during favorable climatic periods, 2) tree mortality
(especially seedlings and saplings) during periods of drought, 3) expansion of
trees into adjacent grassland in response to overgrazing and/or fire suppression,
and 4) removal of trees by humans [<a href="#101">101</a>], fire, or
other disturbance episodes. Specific successional pathways after disturbance in
singleleaf pinyon stands are dependent on a number of variables such as plant species present at the time of disturbance and their
individual responses to disturbance, past
management, type and size of disturbance, available
seed sources in the soil or adjacent areas, and site and climatic conditions
throughout the successional process.

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">A general successional pattern in pinyon-juniper
after overstory removal may be as follows: grasses and forbs dominate for the
first 10 years;
shrubs are well established within 20 years and dominate at 30 years;
between 10 and 20 years, tree seedlings appear, their presence becoming important after about 50 years; site is again woodland with low
understory
cover after 70 to 80 years [<a href="#200">200</a>,<a href="#201">201</a>]. A fire
chronosequence study in the Great Basin followed this general pattern for grasses, forbs, and
shrubs
over time, although grass and shrub cover was maintained
as late as 115 years following fire, and singleleaf pinyon had less than 10%
cover 115 years after fire [<a href="#186">186</a>]. After fire disturbance, several successional
pathways from annual to shrub dominance are possible, including initial postfire
dominance by shrubs [<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">Successional stages in pinyon-juniper woodlands often follow the model of initial floristics, having the same species
present in different amounts and dominance on the
landscape over time [<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#68">68</a>]. Singleleaf pinyon may be present in early to
mid-succession, but slow growth and establishment preclude early dominance
[<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>]. Postfire succession may be to native species present in the preburn community or
seed bank, or may be to invasive exotics such as cheatgrass that subsequently inhibit shrub and
tree establishment [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>].
 Early
successional stages following fire or tree harvesting are often dominated
by several weedy annuals and sprouting
shrubs. Disturbed sites may also see the establishment of non-sprouting shrubs [<a href="#142">142</a>].
Later successional stages from shrub to tree dominance have
been studied in a few specific sites [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#203">203</a>,<a href="#205">205</a>]. Variability in tree- and shrub-dominated communities complicates extrapolation of these results to sites of different growing
conditions [<a href="#196">196</a>].

</p>

<p class="subframeContent"> Once
trees establish, they continually increase their dominance of the site. Trees
start
competing with the understory when they are approximately double the size of the
shrub
nurse plant [<a href="#60">60</a>], and can exclude the understory within
a 100-year period [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#113">113</a>]. The litter of singleleaf pinyon inhibits
establishment of understory species through allelopathy, especially affecting
Idaho fescue and Sandberg bluegrass, with cheatgrass and bottlebrush
squirreltail being the least affected. An understory may be maintained
by periodic fire, reducing tree density [<a href="#60">60</a>].
</p>

<p class="subframeContent">Because a number of variables may affect succession,
following a standard successional model to predict stand development may be unwise [<a href="#60">60</a>]. Most
successional projections come from stands that have been grazed [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>], and response on
grazed and ungrazed sites will be floristically different [<a href="#61">61</a>]. Seed reserves in soil under singleleaf
pinyon may also decrease in
number and species diversity from early to late succession [<a href="#113">113</a>]. Koniak
[<a href="#112">112</a>] found
that aspect and elevation influenced postfire community after fire in a Great
Basin singleleaf pinyon stand, with north and east slopes supporting a higher cover and
occurrence of shrubs,
perennial grasses and perennial forbs, while south and west slopes generally had
high cover and occurrence of annual forbs and annual grasses. Goodrich and
others [<a href="#77">77</a>] provide a general overview of succession in pinyon-juniper woodlands, and its application to management for
different uses based on successional stage.

SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:</a>
</span>
<br />

The growing season of singleleaf pinyon is affected by winter cold, summer heat, and severe water
deficits [<a href="#105">105</a>].
Tree growth usually starts in April and ceases in September or October.
During most of this time, trees depend on moisture stored by winter
precipitation [<a href="#142">142</a>]. Male and female strobili emerge from buds formed the previous
summer in
late spring or early summer. Conelets emerge during this period of elongation and
spread their scales. Staminate cones usually begin to shed pollen by
mid-June, when the ovulate cones are receptive to pollination. Wind-borne pollen sifts into the
ovules, and the pollinated conelet then closes its scales, sealing the pollen grains
within. Cones develop
slowly the 1st growing season, being 1/4th their mature size by September, and
pass the winter this way. The following spring, the yearling cone starts to grow
again, the
pollen grains inside fertilize the egg cells, and the process of seed formation
begins, about 1 year after pollination. Cones
grow rapidly throughout the summer of the 2nd growing season, the seeds
maturing in late summer. Cones mature and dry in
early September and turn from green to brown. The scales part and the seeds are
displayed in September to November,
depending on environmental conditions and elevation [<a href="#121">121</a>,<a href="#142">142</a>].

Because singleleaf pinyon occurs in a variety of habitat types with varying
productivity, historic fire frequency is also varied. In the Great Basin, there
is evidence of both frequent, low-severity fires carried by once-abundant perennial
grasses, and less frequent, localized stand-replacement fires during extreme
conditions. Fires burned in irregular patterns, producing a mosaic of burned
and unburned landscape. On high-productivity sites where sufficient fine fuels existed,
fires burned every 15 to 20 years, and on less productive sites with patchy fuels, fire intervals
may have been in the range of 50 to 100 years or longer. Fire frequency in singleleaf
pinyon communities varies with fuel loads and ignition source that, in turn, vary with habitat type, aspect,
topography, stand
history, and climatic conditions [<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#165">165</a>]. <p>Singleleaf pinyon occurs in many xeric sites with infertile, shallow, rocky soils,
where fires are infrequent and unpredictable and depend
on exceptional rainfall years that lead to herbaceous growth sufficient to carry
fire. In southern California the vegetation structure in singleleaf pinyon communities
does not carry fire well, and fire return intervals of several hundred years are
considered typical [<a href="#187">187</a>,<a href="#227">227</a>]. For
example, singleleaf pinyon communities in the San Bernardino Mountains have experienced
long-interval
stand-replacement fires both before and during suppression with an estimated
fire interval 
of 450 years, resulting in a
mosaic of small scattered patches within uniform old-growth stands across the
landscape [<a href="#152">152</a>,<a href="#227">227</a>]. Thin bark and lack of self pruning makes
singleleaf pinyon very susceptible to intense fire [<a href="#105">105</a>], and
the sharp ecotone between pinyon-juniper and mixed conifer communities
may be due to the inability of singleleaf pinyon to withstand the frequency and
intensity of surface fires in mixed-conifer communities [<a href="#152">152</a>].</p>
<p>In more mesic areas, north slopes, and canyon bottoms fires may have occurred at 15- to 90-year intervals, some
through ignition by Native Americans, maintaining open or patchy stands [<a href="#1">1</a>]. This fire frequency favored
older stands,
since there is little recruitment and seedlings and saplings are more susceptible to fire. Older trees in open canopy
structures are able to withstand surface fires that would have occurred with the
fine fuel loads presumed to have been present before the huge influx of domestic livestock [<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#197">197</a>]. Higher densities of
young trees have been observed at upper elevations, suggesting that singleleaf pinyon may not reach
maturity on these sites because of susceptibility to periodic stand-replacement fires [<a href="#115">115</a>]. </p>
<p>Burning in pinyon-juniper woodlands requires at least 600 to 700 lb/acre of fine fuel [<a href="#58">58</a>]. In the absence of fire and the presence of grazing, tree densities have increased and
undergrowth is
so sparse in many areas that surface fuels do not support fire
[<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#139">139</a>,<a href="#226">226</a>]. Increased tree density and subsequent buildup of hot
burning fuels causes a shift from low-severity to severe fires burning under extreme conditions of hot, dry weather and strong
winds [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>]. When stands are burned under these conditions, singleleaf
pinyon tends to be eliminated from the
site and recolonizes very slowly. In some areas, expansion of aggressive annual exotic
grasses, such as cheatgrass, serve as fine fuels in a differently structured ecosystem,
further
altering the fire regime [<a href="#111">111</a>].<br><br>

<br />

 Thin bark and lack of self pruning make
singleleaf pinyon very susceptible to intense fire [<a href="#105">105</a>]. Mature singleleaf pinyon can survive
low-severity surface fires but is killed by more
severe
fires [<a href="#1">1</a>]. Most tree seedlings are killed by fire, but cached seeds may
survive [<a href="#35">35</a>,<a href="#63">63</a>].

<p class="subframeContent">
<span class="subframeName">
<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT">
DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT:</a>
</span>
<br />

The ability of singleleaf pinyon to survive fire is dependent on the size of the tree, intensity and severity of fire, and resulting damage to
individual trees. Generally, as tree size increases, mortality
decreases [<a href="#115">115</a>], and as fire severity increases,
mortality increases.  

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">Because mature singleleaf pinyon trees are short with open
crowns, full of long-lived, highly flammable foliage, and do not self-prune their dead
branches, individual trees are susceptible to fire [<a href="#22">22</a>]. On Nevada sites with prefire cover of 6 to 29%
trees, 23 to 56% shrubs, and
trace grasses and forbs, a spring prescribed fire killed all trees in all age
classes&nbsp; [<a href="#228">228</a>]. The effectiveness of tree kill depends on fire
severity, which is largely determined by the amount of grass that carries the
fire [<a href="#158">158</a>]. Low-severity fires in a mature pinyon-juniper stand will usually remove trees in the
understory and a few overstory trees, while moderate-severity fires remove more of the
overstory. In open stands with
grass understories, trees less than 4 feet (1.2 m) tall (about 50 years
old) are very susceptible to being killed by fire [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#58">58</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>,<a href="#245">245</a>]. However, low-severity fire in open, pole-size stands may leave
scattered
individuals [<a href="#22">22</a>]. Trees taller than 4 feet (1.2 m) are difficult to kill unless there are heavy accumulations of fine fuel
beneath the trees [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>]. Fire
scars have been observed on mature singleleaf pinyons, indicating survival [<a href="#203">203</a>], but are uncommon. This indicates that in
some fire regimes, singleleaf pinyon is either killed outright or does not live long after being
scarred because heart-rotting fungi enters the scar and hastens mortality [<a href="#82">82</a>].   

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">

Weise [<a href="#230">230</a>] found mortality of singleleaf pinyon varied with damage class and
site after 2 wildfires in California in 1987. One year after wildfire, mortality of undamaged and
slightly damaged trees differed between the 2 sites. It appears that singleleaf pinyon
tolerates a small portion of crown
scorch (&lt;33%), while all trees with over 66%
crown scorch and some crown consumption died within the 1st postfire year.
Tree size did not appear to be a factor in initial
survival, but may have been critical to long-term survival.   

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">
<span class="subframeName">
<a name="PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE">
PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:</a>
</span>
<br />

Reestablishment of singleleaf pinyon after fire requires seed survival or
seed dispersal by birds or rodents into the burn area. Seedlings then require nurse
plants (primarily sagebrush) for establishment, so initial postfire
establishment may be delayed for 20 to 30 years until the establishment of the shrub layer
[<a href="#152">152</a>].
Seedlings have been observed under the canopies of mature trees but they eventually die out unless the overstory is removed. Ward [<a href="#228">228</a>] found that singleleaf
pinyon seedlings emerging under
burned
tree canopies died by the 2nd year. No singleleaf pinyon seedlings were
recorded on prescribed burns for 5 years following fire in Nevada woodlands
[<a href="#63">63</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>]. Moderate establishment was observed on
24-year-old burns, and singleleaf pinyon density was still low (5-10%) 115 years after fire
in the Great Basin [<a href="#186">186</a>].  

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">
<span class="subframeName">
<a name="DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE">
DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE:</a>
</span>
<br />

The response of singleleaf pinyon to fire is a function of initial postfire
damage and survival, postfire seed dispersal, and postfire succession of
associated plant species. Response also varies by size, season, and type of burn
[<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>].
Singleleaf pinyon grows very slowly, so the return to mature woodlands requires
more than a century [<a href="#186">186</a>,<a href="#227">227</a>].
Where stands are closed or dense, the undergrowth declines
significantly; fires become less and less common because fuels are scarcer
[<a href="#22">22</a>] and require extreme conditions of hot, dry weather and strong
winds to carry fire [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#85">85</a>]. When stands are burned under these conditions, singleleaf
pinyon tends to be eliminated from the
site and recolonizes very slowly. 

</p>

<p class="subframeContent"> Perennial grass surface fires in mature pinyon-juniper woodlands result in
light to moderate tree mortality and recovery to prefire conditions in less than
5
years, while woodlands with shrub understories commonly experience canopy fires that result
in heavy tree mortality and require more than 100 years for recovery to prefire conditions
[<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>,<a href="#227">227</a>].  

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">
Singleleaf pinyon seeds that are cached on the prefire site may survive [<a href="#35">35</a>]. Clark's nutcrackers have been observed
caching seeds of whitebark pine in recently burned areas [<a href="#212">212</a>]; it is possible that
pinyon seeds may also be
cached in burn areas by these and other birds and rodents. On large burns, return of
singleleaf pinyon may be slow due to greater distance from seed sources [<a href="#12">12</a>]. 

</p>

<p class="subframeContent"> Wildfire and prescribed burning in singleleaf pinyon stands result in an initial increase
in
understory vegetation [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>,<a href="#20">200</a>]. 
The species represented, their relative coverage,
and patterns of succession are variable. Early (1-year) postfire succession in
the Great Basin is generally dominated by annual and perennial
forbs, giving way to shrubs and annual grass dominance in mid-succession (15-17
years), and to tree, shrub, and perennial grass dominance in late succession
(22-60 years) [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#112">112</a>]. In the San Bernardino Mountains
in California, postfire succession to mature woodlands proceeds over a span of
a century, beginning with the colonization of shrubs that increase in cover and
density for 30 to 50 years and are joined by singleleaf pinyon recruits at 25
to 40
years. After 50 years, increases in singleleaf pinyon densities accompany a decline in the shrub
layer, and mature woodlands with
sparse understories return at 100 to 150 years [<a href="#227">227</a>]. Pinyon generally has
a lower survival rate and slower establishment than juniper after a fire, but given time and more
mesic site conditions, pinyon may dominate after about 60 years [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#203">203</a>]. 

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">
<span class="subframeName">
<a name="FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS">
FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br />

Prescribed fire may be used in singleleaf pinyon stands to reduce overstory trees and
reestablish understory species in
the successional cycle [<a href="#25">25</a>,<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#107">107</a>,<a href="#109">109</a>], to prevent invasion of trees into
adjacent grass and shrublands [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#108">108</a>,<a href="#186">186</a>], to reduce the effects of allelopathic chemicals
in the litter [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#239">239</a>,<a href="#241">241</a>], to improve big game winter
range (mule deer, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, and elk) [<a href="#108">108</a>], to create mosaics of
woodland and openings [<a href="#165">165</a>], to remove slash [<a href="#58">58</a>], to reduce
fuel loads [<a href="#85">85</a>], and to control new tree regeneration [<a href="#165">165</a>].
Some primary considerations for prescribed burning in singleleaf pinyon stands are the number and species of trees
present, nature of the understory vegetation, and weather conditions [<a href="#58">58</a>]. These elements determine if and how a stand will burn, and may help
predict the ecological effects of burning.   

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">Burning in singleleaf pinyon woodlands requires an
understory adequate to carry a ground fire or extreme conditions to carry a
crown fire. Pinyon-juniper stands most likely to burn have small scattered trees with abundant
herbaceous fuel between them, or have a high density of mature trees capable of carrying crown fire during dry, windy conditions. More
widely spaced trees with little understory are unlikely to
burn [<a href="#22">22</a>]. It usually requires 600 to 700 pounds/acre (672-784 kg/ha)
of fine fuels, or 20% sagebrush with 300 pounds/acre (336 kg/ha) of fine fuels, to carry a fire
in the Great Basin [<a href="#242">242</a>]. Many singleleaf pinyon stands in the Great Basin are not
productive enough to yield this amount of fine fuel, particularly if they have an
overstory of trees [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a>]. Periodic
growth of annual grasses in response to favorable weather conditions has become the
primary fuel source in some
rangelands that previously experienced low fire frequencies [<a href="#111">111</a>].   

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">Research in the Great Basin suggests prescribed burning
is likely to succeed on sites with scattered trees (9-23% cover) and in dense
(not closed) stands (24-35%
cover) [<a href="#25">25</a>]. Blackburn and Tueller [<a href="#15">15</a>] found that
scattered and dense stands with 9 to 35% canopy cover burned well, whereas closed
stands (&gt;35% cover) were difficult to burn out of fire season. Many pinyon-juniper woodlands have advanced
to a stage of succession where prescribed fire is no longer a viable option due to
low
fuel loads and large trees in open sites that are susceptible to weed invasion and
erosion. Since pinyon burns more readily than juniper,
stands burn better as the proportion of pinyon to juniper increases [<a href="#22">22</a>].  

</p>

<p class="subframeContent"> Crown fuels are typically around 3.6 tons/acre
(8.1 t/ha) for foliage and 1.8 tons/acre (4.0 t/ha) for 0- to 0.25-inch branchwood in
Colorado pinyon in Arizona [<a href="#165">165</a>]. Fuel biomass estimates in singleleaf pinyon using aerial
photography are presented by Meeuwig and others [<a href="#144">144</a>]. Heat and ash content values,
physical properties of woody fuel particles, and fuel bed characteristics for
singleleaf pinyon in the Sierra Nevada are available [<a href="#221">221</a>,<a href="#222">222</a>].   

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">A detailed site evaluation is critical in predicting the successional effects of
fire in singleleaf pinyon stands. Qualitative prediction of postfire response is possible
when we consider aspect, elevation, and the known response of individual species
in the prefire community, but accurate predictions are difficult because of unknown soil seed
reserves, species immigration potential, and postfire weather [<a href="#60">60</a>,<a href="#65">65</a>,<a href="#69">69</a>]. A low increase in
forage production may be expected in sites that have greater than 20% canopy
coverage of trees, while stands with fewer trees and high amounts
of perennial grass cover respond quickly. Stands with high levels of tree coverage
are often invaded by annuals following fire if perennials do not quickly occupy the site
[<a href="#26">26</a>].
Response on grazed and ungrazed sites will be floristically different [<a href="#61">61</a>]. Current conditions
in many pinyon-juniper stands may have little understory ground cover, seed production and
soil seed reserves [<a href="#60">60</a>]. Burning a site with few desirable understory species may
worsen
the ground cover situation and only serve to destroy valuable wood [<a href="#165">165</a>]. Trees
may be eliminated for 50 years
[<a href="#5">5</a>],
and it may take over 300
years for a climax stand to establish [<a href="#55">55</a>]. Prescribed burning to remove slash may damage residual trees and
kill seedlings, sterilize soils where slash is piled, and remove valuable nutrients
form the site [<a href="#58">58</a>]. Postfire seeding appears to be
detrimental to many naturally occurring species [<a href="#112">112</a>]. 

</p>

<p class="subframeContent">Lack of native understory vegetation and presence of cheatgrass or other invasive
plants within or adjacent to stands creates
new postfire community types following fire in singleleaf pinyon communities [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#173">173</a>]. Seeding burns with native species may be the only
means of restoring the grass successional stage to many overgrazed
woodlands, and has had variable success in the past [<a href="#26">26</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>,<a href="#173">173</a>]. Where understory is already composed of annual
species, fire may only increase the cover
of annuals
and thus increase the fire hazard, resulting in more frequent fires that will
prevent reestablishment of shrubs and trees [<a href="#26">26</a>]. For example, stands with good growth of cheatgrass are at higher risk for large
fires that will likely result in increased yields of cheatgrass [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>]. Several large fires in
singleleaf pinyon stands in southern
California and a reburn several
years after a crown fire suggest that the spread of
cheatgrass may be responsible for carrying these fires. This could have serious
negative effects by shortening the fire return interval and thereby preventing
tree establishment [<a href="#187">187</a>]. Severe burning in singleleaf pinyon communities in the San
Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains of southern California can convert these
woodlands to chaparral [<a href="#86">86</a>]. Burning areas invaded by cheatgrass
with fires hot enough to remove litter and any stored seed may give
managers a window of opportunity the 1st year after burning to plant more
desirable perennial species [<a href="#58">58</a>].
