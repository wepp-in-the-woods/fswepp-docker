<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Weeping lovegrass is used as a pasture grass [<a href="#31">31</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].

Weeping lovegrass forage value is fair for livestock; it is relatively
poor for wildlife [<a href="#50">50</a>].

In central Arizona, Angora goats were introduced to the Tonto National
Forest in hopes that they would trample weeping lovegrass seeds into the
soil.  However, they pulled up and ate a high percentage of the
seedlings within 3 weeks after seeding [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Weeping lovegrass is most palatable in the spring, when it is actively
growing [<a href="#29">29</a>]; palatability to livestock is rated fair at that time [<a href="#56">56</a>].
Weeping lovegrass becomes unpalatable with maturity, and may be grazed
very little from flowering in early summer through dormancy in the fall
[<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].

In Arizona, livestock frequently prefer weeping lovegrass to many native
grasses in the spring.  On some Arizona ranges, it is highly productive
and moderately palatable [<a href="#30">30</a>].  However, in northwestern Oklahoma,
weeping lovegrass was judged to be the least palatable of 57 species
tested.  It was relatively more palatable in the winter because it
greens up earlier in the spring and continues growth later in the fall
than native warm-season grasses [<a href="#47">47</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
In Woodward County, Oklahoma, weeping lovegrass protein content declined
from April to January and showed a slight increase the following March [<a href="#47">47</a>].

In Lubbock County, Texas, the crude protein content of weeping lovegrass
aboveground phytomass was evaluated 1 year after establishment.  Protein
content dropped from 12.0 percent in May to 3.4 percent in September in
uncut plots.  During the same time period, crude protein of 30-day-old
regrowth in cut plots remained between 8.7 and 12.3 percent [<a href="#35">35</a>].

<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Weeping lovegrass has been planted for soil conservation.  It has been
used as ground cover on bare, disturbed, and burned areas, on areas
around airports and landing strips, and on steep slopes.  It has been
planted for siltation control on drainageways and for erosion control on
roadsides, drainage ditches, and dikes [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#49">49</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>,<a href="#57">57</a>].  There are no
long-term studies evaluating the efficacy of weeping lovegrass for soil
conservation [<a href="#63">63</a>].

Weeping lovegrass has been used for grassland revegetation in the
southern United States [<a href="#28">28</a>], particularly after invasion by woody shrubs
[<a href="#10">10</a>].  It is used on sandy soils in the Southern Great Plains because of
excellent seed production and ease of establishment [<a href="#55">55</a>].  Garcia [<a href="#20">20</a>]
stated that weeping lovegrass provides excellent soil protection on the
High Plains of New Mexico [<a href="#20">20</a>].

Some severely degraded southwestern grasslands may never be able to
return to their original condition; in these areas weeping lovegrass can
help stabilize soils, prevent further erosion, and provide some wildlife
habitat.  However, weeping lovegrass plantations have much lower plant
and animal species richness than do undisturbed native grasslands [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Weeping lovegrass has been seeded in central Arizona chaparral after
brush removal in order to increase annual stream flow.  Heavily
transpiring, deep-rooted evergreen shrubs were replaced with weeping
lovegrass and other shallow-rooted vegetation.  Streamflow increased,
and the increase has lasted for 18 years with maintenance [<a href="#26">26</a>].

Weeping lovegrass is suitable for quick, temporary cover for erosion
control on minesoils while other more persistent perennials are
developing.  It is relatively short lived (2-4 years) on minesoils in
the eastern United States unless mowed, burned, or grazed to retard
senescence.  Even then, weeping lovegrass gradually gives way to other
perennial species.  It is tolerant of extremely acid minesoils, on which
it establishes easily and quickly.  It is best used in a mixture with
other perennial grasses and legumes, especially in mid- to late-spring
seedings [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#53">53</a>,<a href="#54">54</a>].

Excellent stands of weeping lovegrass were established by no-till
planting in early June on sloping, eroded, acidic soils in the Piedmont
region of Virginia [<a href="#58">58</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
Weeping lovegrass is cultivated as an ornamental grass [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#31">31</a>].


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Information on weeping lovegrass culture and cultivars is available
[<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#55">55</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].

Effective management for productivity in seeded stands of weeping
lovegrass in northwestern Oklahoma includes (1) removing old growth; (2)
fertilizing conservatively; (3) deferring grazing in spring until plants
are 6 inches high; (4) practicing rotation grazing; (5) mowing or
grazing to a 4-inch stubble throughout the summer; (6) resting from
September 1 to December 1, and then grazing in winter with supplements
for cattle.  Weeping lovegrass nutritional value can be optimized by
using it with other seasonal forages and native rangelands [<a href="#56">56</a>].

Cattle can be grazed productively on weeping lovegrass, even without
irrigation [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#16">16</a>].  Cattle gain relatively well on weeping lovegrass
without rotation during spring but do poorly the remainder of the
growing season [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Fall grazing is detrimental because grazing
initiates plant growth, which reduces carbohydrate reserves and
predisposes weeping lovegrass to freeze damage.  Dormant winter
lovegrass leaves make excellent winter forage when supplemented with
protein [<a href="#12">12</a>].

In 1951, weeping lovegrass was aerially seeded after wildfire in the
Pinal Mountain area of east-central Arizona.  Annual use by cattle of 50
to 70 percent of current growth resulted in a decrease in weeping
lovegrass cover [<a href="#41">41</a>].

Weeping lovegrass can be successfully established on rangelands in
chaparral and some pinyon (Pinus spp.)-juniper (Juniperus spp.) types in
the Southwest.  However, stands in these areas may be short lived [<a href="#55">55</a>].
Long-term establishment is restricted to irrigated sites, moist sites
such as swales, and areas where annual rainfall exceeds about 15 inches
(381 mm) [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Establishment of weeping lovegrass depends on moisture availability and
winter temperatures.  In the southeastern part of the southern High
Plains of New Mexico, weeping lovegrass is favored for ease of
germination during the hot, dry summers.  However, in the extreme
temperatures of the Chihuahuan Desert, supplemental irrigation or
mulching is necessary for successful seedling establishment [<a href="#20">20</a>].
Stands of weeping lovegrass have been established in southern Arizona,
eastern New Mexico, and West Texas during atypically wet summers; they
have persisted for 10 or more years.  Weeping lovegrass will persist in
western Oklahoma and northwestern and north-central Texas if not
fertilized or defoliated prior to freezing winter temperatures.  It will
not persist in southern Kansas and southeastern Colorado [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Plant and animal populations were sampled between June 1984 and August
1985 in semidesert grasslands on mesas in Santa Cruz County, Arizona.
Some areas had been seeded to weeping lovegrass and Lehmann lovegrass
(Eragrostis lehmanniana); other areas had native grasses, forbs, and
shrubs.  The stands of exotic grasses differed consistently from native
grasslands in terms of indigenous plants and animals.  The exotic
African lovegrasses covered more than 50 percent of the ground where
they had been planted; they grew in tall, nearly monospecific stands.
At these sites the native grass cover was reduced by nearly 60 percent
compared to unseeded stands.  Total native herb canopy, herb species
richness, shrub density, and shrub canopy were significantly reduced on
plots dominated by weeping lovegrass and Lehmann lovegrass. The hispid
cotton rat was more abundant in stands of African lovegrasses than in
native grasslands.  Ten native plant species, five bird species, three
rodent species, and eight grasshopper species were significantly more
common in native grasslands [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Grasshoppers, leafhoppers, and other forage-eating insects, even in
light populations, are very destructive to weeping lovegrass seedlings.
Rabbits and rodents are sometimes damaging [<a href="#56">56</a>].

<pre><center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Eragrostis curvula
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Weeping lovegrass is an introduced, perennial, warm-season, densely
tufted bunchgrass [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#36">36</a>].  It is a C-4 carbon fixer [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Culms can
be pith-filled to hollow; they are erect [<a href="#23">23</a>] and 24 to 60 inches
(60-150 cm) tall [<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>].  Leaves are primarily basal [<a href="#42">42</a>] and
abundant [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Culm leaves are 8 to 12 inches (20-30 cm) long [<a href="#27">27</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>];
basal leaves can be much longer [23,27,30,42, 50].  The inflorescence is
a panicle 4 to 16 inches (10-40 cm) long [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#42">42</a>].  Spikelets are five-
to twelve-flowered [<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>]; the lemma is unawned [<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#56">56</a>].  The fruit is
a caryopsis [<a href="#23">23</a>].  Weeping lovegrass has an extensive fibrous root
system [<a href="#56">56</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Weeping lovegrass reproduces by seeds; it does not have rhizomes or
stolons [<a href="#2">2</a>].  Apomixis is facultative [<a href="#55">55</a>].  The seedstalks produce
approximately 300 to 1,000 seeds per head [<a href="#39">39</a>].  Rate of spread by seeds
is slow under the best conditions [<a href="#2">2</a>].  In most places weeping lovegrass
does not actively colonize adjacent nonplanted sites [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Seed dormancy is broken after 5 to 6 months in storage [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Time to
initial germination in a laboratory test was 50 to 52 hours [<a href="#19">19</a>].  Best
field germination occurs with year-old seed; most seeds germinate in 7
days under favorable conditions [<a href="#56">56</a>].  Rainfall pattern is important for
successful weeping lovegrass seedling emergence.  Less than 20 percent
of germinated weeping lovegrass seeds survived 1 day of desiccation
after germination.  No weeping lovegrass seeds survived 3 days of
desiccation [<a href="#19">19</a>].  If the soil is dry, adequate moisture within 4 to 7
days after emergence is necessary for seedling survival [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Seedlings
are vigorous under favorable conditions [<a href="#47">47</a>].  Weeping lovegrass can
make good cover the first year after seeding.  With good moisture
conditions some plants head out the first year [<a href="#56">56</a>].

Weeping lovegrass produces tillers which grow outward from the edge of
the clump.  Dead stems prevent production of new tillers to the inside.
After a few years without grazing or burning, the only live shoots in
the decadent plant are in an outside ring enclosing dead material [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Weeping lovegrass grows on dry to moist sites [<a href="#15">15</a>] in pastures [<a href="#50">50</a>],
fields [<a href="#42">42</a>], roadsides [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>], and disturbed areas [<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#50">50</a>,<a href="#61">61</a>]. 

Weeping lovegrass grows and produces well on a wide variety of soils.
It grows well on low fertility soils, but it does best on fertile soils
[<a href="#12">12</a>].  It is best adapted to and most persistent on sandy and sandy loam
soils [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  It is not well adapted to clayey, salty, or wet soils
[<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#12">12</a>].  Silty loam, clay, and clayey loam soils reduce or inhibit
germination, seedling emergence, shoot growth, and root growth [<a href="#10">10</a>].
Weeping lovegrass was tested on the High Plains of western Texas on
three soil types.  Growth was rated good on sandy soil, fair on silty
soil, and poor on clayey soil [<a href="#13">13</a>].  In the Santa Cruz Basin in
southeastern Arizona, weeping lovegrass established poorly on silty clay
loam.  However, weeping lovegrass seeds sown in sandy to sandy loam
upland soils germinated and produced plants that persisted for at least
15 years [<a href="#11">11</a>].  Weeping lovegrass requires a 150- to 180-day summer
growing season to spread on sandy soils [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Weeping lovegrass does well on acid soils in the southeastern United
States [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Lower pH limit is usually considered to be 4.0, but it
has grown well on some minesoils with pH 3.8 [<a href="#54">54</a>].  Weeping lovegrass
also grows on highly basic soils.  It will grow on soils of pH 8.0, but
severe chlorosis usually occurs as the growing season progresses [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Weeping lovegrass is adapted to summer rainfall [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Established
stands persist where annual rainfall varies from 15.7 to 39.4 inches
(400-1,000 mm) [<a href="#10">10</a>].  In critical rainfall areas occasional prolonged
droughts may kill well-established stands [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Plant production
declines where summer rainfall exceeds 29.5 inches (750 mm) because of
fungal infections, mites, nematodes, and interference from forbs and
other grasses [<a href="#10">10</a>].

Established stands of weeping lovegrass persist where mean minimum and
maximum temperatures vary annually from 32 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (0-
30 deg C) [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Weeping lovegrass does not tolerate extended periods of
temperatures below 14 degrees Fahrenheit (-10 deg C) [<a href="#50">50</a>].

Weeping lovegrass has been reported at the following elevations:

                        Feet              Meters

  Arizona           4,921-6,500        1,500-1,981  [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#38">38</a>]
  Colorado             5,000              1,524     [<a href="#15">15</a>]
  Oklahoma          1,975-2,300          602-701    [<a href="#47">47</a>]

  West Virginia     below 3,000        below 914    [<a href="#54">54</a>]

Weeping lovegrass persistence in western Oklahoma and northwestern and
north-central Texas is limited to elevations from 984 to 3,281 feet
(300-1,000 m) [<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Weeping lovegrass can establish in disturbed areas and also persist in
open grasslands.

During the 1940's and 1950's, upland mesas at the Appleton-Whittell
Research Sanctuary in Santa Cruz County, Arizona, were seeded with
weeping lovegrass and Lehmann lovegrass.  In 1984, these mesas remained
dominated by the exotic lovegrasses.  Nearby unseeded areas supported
native perennial grasses, forbs, and shrubs [<a href="#4">4</a>].

Basal cover and production of seeded weeping lovegrass in east-central
Arizona tended to be inversely proportional to turbinella oak cover.
Turbinella oak in chapparal was burned by wildfire in 1952.  Where
turbinella oak canopy was reduced less than 50 percent, weeping
lovegrass cover remained approximately the same over 3 postfire years.
Where turbinella oak cover was reduced more than 50 percent, basal cover
of weeping lovegrass increased "markedly" over the 3 years observed [<a href="#40">40</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
An established weeping lovegrass plant begins growth in spring when mean
minimum temperatures rise above 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 deg C).
Productivity peaks when mean minimum and maximum temperatures range
between 59 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit (15 and 30 deg C).  Growth declines
in mid-summer when mean maximum temperatures exceed 86 degrees
Fahrenheit (30 deg C) and soils dry [<a href="#10">10</a>].  Weeping lovegrass growing
season in northwest Oklahoma is March to November [<a href="#47">47</a>].

Tillering begins 4 to 6 weeks after a seed germinates.  Under favorable
conditions several hundred closely packed culms are produced the first
year [<a href="#39">39</a>].

Weeping lovegrass susceptibility to frost increases if there is a rapid
temperature drop when the grass is growing.  Injury is also likely
during severe cold coupled with dry soil.  Fall growth initiated by
rainfall, irrigation, fertilization, or grazing seems to predispose
weeping lovegrass to freeze damage [<a href="#12">12</a>].

Weeping lovegrass flowering times are:

     California               August-October     [<a href="#36">36</a>]             
     Florida                  April-May          [<a href="#8">8</a>]
     South Carolina           May-June           [<a href="#42">42</a>]
     Great Plains             May-August         [<a href="#23">23</a>]   
     Southern Great Plains    late spring and    [<a href="#56">56</a>]

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Weeping lovegrass culms and blades are probably killed by fire.  Burned
clumps tend to retain about 2 inches of densely packed, unburned stems
at the soil surface [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Weeping lovegrass numbers generally increase [<a href="#59">59</a>] or remain stable after
burning.  Weeping lovegrass does not decrease after fire in sandy areas
in Oklahoma shortgrass prairie [<a href="#60">60</a>].  In western Texas, neither high nor
low fireline intensities caused a negative impact on weeping lovegrass
burned in both headfires and backfires during late winter in 1982 and
1983.  Vegetation response was not correlated with fireline intensity or
any of the environmental parameters measured [<a href="#44">44</a>].

A central Arizona chaparral watershed was burned by wildfire in June
1959.  The watershed was seeded with weeping lovegrass in May 1960, and
herbicides were used to remove shrubs to increase forage and water
yields, reduce fire hazard, and "improve" wildlife habitat.  The
watershed was prescribed burned in the winter of 1971 to kill returning
shrubs; weeping lovegrass frequency increased slightly on burned plots
and decreased on unburned plots.  In other areas in central Arizona,
weeping lovegrass in mixed bunchgrass stands and in pinyon-juniper areas
converted to grassland decreased when protected from grazing and fire.
Pase and Kruse [<a href="#37">37</a>] hypothesized that weeping lovegrass decreases would
continue due to the "smothering" effect of old growth on new growth.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
From February 2 to April 15, 1982, and from March 14 to April 28, 1983,
17 plots were burned in headfires and 10 plots were burned in backfires
in western Texas.  Plots were located in a relatively homogeneous,
ungrazed, decadent weeping lovegrass stand established in 1976.  Fires
were ignited at different times and under a variety of weather
conditions to obtain a wide range of fireline intensities.  Headfires
generated from 67 kW/m to 12,603 kW/m; backfires generated from 117 kW/m
to 474 kW/m.  Weeping lovegrass plant yield, plant height, and number of
seedstalks were measured after one growing season to evaluate the
effects of different fireline intensities.  There was no significant
relationship between fireline intensity and subsequent plant response
[<a href="#44">44</a>,<a href="#45">45</a>].

In June 1956, a wildfire burned over rough mountainland in central
Arizona chaparral between 5,000 and 6,500 feet (1,524-1,981 m)
elevation.  The area was aerially seeded with weeping lovegrass after
the fire.  Below 6,000 feet (1,830 m) weeping lovegrass quadrat
frequency increased from 3.7 percent in 1956 to 12.1 percent in 1961.
Above 6,000 feet weeping lovegrass frequency increased from 0.5 percent
in 1956 to 6.0 percent in 1961.  Weeping lovegrass herbage production
also increased over that time [<a href="#38">38</a>].


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Weeping lovegrass production is stimulated by periodic burning. Winter
burning can be used to maintain dominance by weeping lovegrass in
chaparral [<a href="#37">37</a>].  A fast-moving fire with long flame lengths will not
damage weeping lovegrass any more than a slow moving fire with short
flame lengths.  A prescribed fire can be conducted under conditions
favorable for a variety of intended effects without reducing weeping
lovegrass yield or vigor [<a href="#44">44</a>].

Weeping lovegrass should probably not be seeded after fire if management
objectives include establishing or maintaining native grasses.  Weeping
lovegrass declines in palatability if not grazed or burned, but it does
not usually disappear from a site.  As it becomes less palatable,
livestock shift grazing pressure to other species, which then decline.
Increases in weeping lovegrass after fire can be impeded under very
careful management of grazing allotments, however [<a href="#63">63</a>].

In the Pinal Mountain area, weeping lovegrass was aerially seeded
following a 1951 wildfire that killed aboveground vegetation.  A
relatively vigorous stand of lovegrass grew among the sprouting shrubs
during the first summer; seed was produced, germinated the following
year, and thickened the stand.  An exclosure was constructed in the
stand in 1952; grazing occurred around the exclosure.  Percent basal
area of weeping lovegrass was as follows [<a href="#41">41</a>]:

                          1952        1956        1958

            Grazed        0.51        0.46        0.08
            Ungrazed      0.68        1.25        0.39

To renovate a decadent weeping lovegrass stand, the plants can be burned
just prior to spring green-up to remove most of the old material.  If
the plants are shredded before being burned, burning is more effective
in removing dead plant centers [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Weeping lovegrass in Oklahoma
showed consistently improved forage yields when burned annually with
damp to wet soil conditions just before spring green-up between February
26 and March 10 [<a href="#24">24</a>].

Weeping lovegrass was planted on the Tonto National Forest in central
Arizona after the Boulder Mountain Fire of June 1959, in which wildfire
swept over steep, broken chaparral habitat.  Weeping lovegrass was
broadcast planted with a hand seeder on the fresh burn before loose
surface ash had been disturbed by rain.  Weeping lovegrass maintained a
fair stand with good to excellent vigor during the 1959 and 1960 growing
seasons.  However, drought in 1961 killed many of the plants, and vigor
of those remaining was listed as fair [<a href="#34">34</a>].

Weeping lovegrass cover is actually many times the basal area of the
plant because of its long, spreading leaves.  Five years following the
1956 Pinal Mountains wildfire, weeping lovegrass made up 97.6 percent of
the vegetation cover on the burn [<a href="#7">7</a>].  Weeping lovegrass cover was
decreasing on grazed areas by then, but still increasing in exclosures.
By 1958, basal area on both sites had dropped below that of 1952 and
many of the weeping lovegrass plants were dead.  Weeping lovegrass died
out in ungrazed areas as chaparral crown cover approached that of
unburned areas [<a href="#41">41</a>].

A wildfire in 1987 in southeastern Arizona completely burned 11 native
grass plots and 11 plots seeded to weeping lovegrass and Lehmann
lovegrass.  The fire reduced grass and shrub cover, and increased forb
cover, for 2 postfire years in both plot types.  Bird numbers increased
greatly on burned plots in both habitats for 2 autumns, probably in
response to increased seed production and availability.  Fire improved
weeping lovegrass areas for some summer birds in the short run by
reducing otherwise heavy accumulations of litter.  There was no evidence
that fire can permanently restore the diverse native flora to
species-poor plantations of weeping lovegrass [<a href="#5">5</a>].
