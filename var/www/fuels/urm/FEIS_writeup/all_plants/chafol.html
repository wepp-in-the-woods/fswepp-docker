<b>HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES : </b>
Sierra mountain misery clones form a low-growing layer in open ponderosa
pine (Pinus ponderosa) and mixed coniferous forests [<a href="#29">29</a>].  Stands occur
in patches, providing from 20 to 90 percent cover [<a href="#30">30</a>].  In the Challenge
Experimental Forest of the Plumas National Forest, density in the mixed
coniferous forest is as high as 17,068 stems per acre (42,175 stems/ha)
[<a href="#15">15</a>].

In California black oak (Quercus kelloggii) forests, Sierra mountain
misery frequently codominates the understory with whiteleaf manzanita
(Arctostaphylos viscida) and greenleaf manzanita (A. patula) [<a href="#25">25</a>].

Publications listing Sierra mountain misery as a dominant understory
species are as follows:

     Profiles of California vegetation [<a href="#7">7</a>]
     Montane and subalpine vegetation of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade
       Ranges [<a href="#28">28</a>]

<center><h2>MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Chamaebatia foliolosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Sierra mountain misery is usually considered unpalatable browse of low
nutritional quality [<a href="#8">8</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  The resinous oils of the foliage have a
penetrating odor throughout the growing season that repels most animals.
In winter, when rains have washed the glutinous leaves, wildlife utilize
the plant in varying degrees.  Black-tailed deer consume more of the
foliage than other wildlife.  Deer eat it while migrating, and in some
localities it comprises a great portion of their winter diet.  On the
Jawbone Ridge winter deer range of Tuolumne County, where Sierra
mountain misery has a frequency occurrence of 75 percent, stomach
analysis shows that Sierra mountain misery provides 37 percent by volume
of the deer's winter feed.  This degree of ingestion is more striking
when compared to the volume percentage consumed of better known browse
species.  Wedgeleaf ceanothus (Ceanothus cuneatus) makes up only 12
percent by volume of winter diets of deer on Jawbone Ridge.

Livestock find Sierra mountain misery unpalatable even after winter
rains [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
The value of Sierra mountain misery as browse is good to fair for
black-tailed deer, fair to poor for domestic goats, poor to useless for
sheep, and useless for cattle and horses [<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Nutritive value is reported to lessen in winter months [<a href="#29">29</a>], but
quantitative nutritional studies of Sierra mountain misery were not
found in the literature.


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
Sierra mountain misery has high value for watershed protection because
it checks runoff, prevents erosion, and maintains the moisture
absorption capacity of soils [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Timber:  Sierra mountain misery greatly reduces survival and growth of
conifer seedlings [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  The deep roots are strong competitors
for limited water resources.  Tappeiner and Radosevich [<a href="#30">30</a>] examined its
effect on ponderosa pine seedlings on a good site at the Blogett
Research Station of El Dorado County.  Treatments were: (1) untreated
Sierra mountain misery, (2) Sierra mountain misery sprayed with a
mixture of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T prior to tree planting, and (3) Sierra
mountain misery eliminated by a combination of herbicides, clipping, and
grubbing to stop root and rhizome invasion.  After 3 years, ponderosa
pine seedling survival was only 13 percent on untreated plots.  Spraying
prior to planting resulted in 71 percent survival, and complete control
resulted in 97 percent survival of trees.  After 19 years, tree heights
averaged 5.2 feet (1.6 m) with no treatment, 6.2 feet (1.9 m) with the
herbicide mixture, and 18.7 feet (5.7 m) with the combination of
treatments.  When this loss is extended to 50 years, net wood production
would have been reduced an estimated 75 percent as a result of Sierra
mountain misery competition.

Control:  Sierra mountain misery is sensitive to intermediate in
response to foliar spraying of phenoxy herbicides and is susceptible to
such applications of dicamba and tricolpyr [<a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#18">18</a>].  Aerosol application
of tricolpyr temporarily reduced Sierra mountain misery canopy volume by
94 to 96 percent on the Tahoe National Forest [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Sierra mountain
misery may sprout vigorously following herbicide treatment, and one
application probably will not provide adequate contol.  Plants may
actually be rejuvenated by a single treatment.  Thorough site
proparation, which controls Sierra mountain misery before planting and
permits good establishment of conifer seedlings, followed by sraying of
Sierra mountain misery sprouts is recommended.  Growth of conifer
seedlings and competing Sierra mountain misery should be evaluated for
at least 10 years after planting [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Best results are obtained when
herbicides are applied in spring or early summer during the period of
new leaf initiation [<a href="#18">18</a>]. Sierra mountain misery can also be controlled
by grubbing.

Plywood, used as an unusual mulch for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
menziesii) seedlings on a plantation in the central Sierra Nevada,
killed Sierra mountain misery beneath it and increased soil moisture
available to seedlings in midsummer [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Control of Sierra mountain misery is problematic for forest managers.
Although it greatly inhibits growth of young conifers, it is of
considerable value as a slope stabilizer of watersheds and because it is
a host species for nitrogen-fixing bacteria [<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#35">35</a>].  Additionally,
Sampson and Jesperson [<a href="#29">29</a>] believed that heavy black-tailed deer use on
some winter ranges should be taken into consideration when managing this
species.

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Chamaebatia foliolosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sierra mountain misery is a low, erect, native evergreen shrub from 0.5
to 2 feet (0.2-0.6 m) in height [<a href="#29">29</a>].  The multibranched stems arise at
intervals of a few inches from a complicated and sometimes matlike
system of roots and rhizomes [<a href="#32">32</a>].  Individual rhizomes have been
measured at over 82 feet (25 m) in length (Munn, in [<a href="#31">31</a>]) and extend
from 4 to 16 inches (10-40 cm) beneath the soil surface.  Roots are
found as deep as 4.9 feet (1.5 m) belowground [<a href="#30">30</a>].  Masses of
multilobed nitrogen-fixing nodules have been found on roots of plants
near Pollock Pines.  Examination of roots in areas where soils have
thick surface horizens (Ao), however, revealed no root nodulation in
that horizen.  Roots in lower horizens were not examined [<a href="#35">35</a>].  The
fernlike, viscid, aromatic leaves are pinnately dissected into tiny
crowded segments.  Each segment is tipped with a resin gland.  Flowers
are glutinous.  The fruit is an achene about 0.5 inch (5 mm) long,
containing a single seed [<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Phanerophyte
   Chamaephyte
   Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
The primary method of reproduction is vegetative.  Sierra mountain
misery produces clones from its rhizomes, roots, and root crown [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#21">21</a>].
Sexual reproduction is less frequent.  Methods of seed dissemination
were not reported in the literature.  Seeds require from 1 to 3 months
of cold stratification (35 to 41 degrees Fahrenheit [1.7-5.0 deg C])
prior to germination [<a href="#20">20</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Sierra mountain misery grows in a Mediterranean climate, characterized
by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  At one representative site
in the central Sierra Nevada, annual precipitation averages 68 inches
(173 cm), with about 98 percent falling between October and May.  The
top 12 inches (30.5 cm) of soil is dry from June to September.

The most common soil series supporting Sierra mountain misery has a
loamy texture in surface horizons, grading to a clayey loam with depth.
Soil pH is acid to moderately acid [<a href="#21">21</a>].  

Plants occur at elevations between 2,000 and 7,000 feet (610-2,134 m)
[<a href="#20">20</a>].

Associated overstory species not listed under Distribution and
Occurrence include sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), incense-cedar
(Libocedrus decurrens), Pacific dogwood (Cornus nuttallii), and sequoia
(Sequoiadendron giganteum).  Understory associates include bush
chinquapin (Chrysolepsis sempervirens), mountain whitethorn (Ceanothus
cordulatus), deerbrush (C. integerrimus), wedgeleaf ceanothus, Mariposa
manzanita (Arctostaphylos manzanita), greenleaf manzanita, whiteleaf
manzanita, and gooseberry (Ribes spp.) [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#34">34</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Facultative Seral Species

Sierra mountain misery is moderately shade tolerant, growing under open
tree stands but not under closed canopies [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].  When fire or other
disturbance occurs at regular intervals, it attains subcanopy dominance
within 3 to 4 years and remains dominant until the next disturbance
[<a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#13">13</a>].  Sierra mountain misery is a climax understory species in
ponderosa pine forests, which are fire-climax in California [<a href="#2">2</a>].
Without fire or other disturbance, it will decline as the overhead
canopy closes [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
New leaf initiation begins in spring, with flowers opening from May
through July [<a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#20">20</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>].  Growth usually stops in midsummer, probably
limited by inadequate soil moisture [<a href="#12">12</a>].  Seed is disseminated in fall
[<a href="#32">32</a>].  Leaves are retained for 12 to 19 months before abscission [<a href="#27">27</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Chamaebatia foliolosa
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
The resinous, finely divided leaves of Sierra mountain misery are highly
flammable, especially when draped with fallen pine needles and other
forest debris.  Sierra mountain misery will carry surface fire, and the
species is an important element of fuel loads in California's mixed
coniferous and ponderosa pine forests.  Expert opinions on natural fire
frequencies in these forests vary.  Fire scar studies show average
frequencies of 8 years [<a href="#4">4</a>].  Some authorities, however, feel this method
gives results that are too conservative.  Van Wagtendonk and Biswell [<a href="#4">4</a>]
estimated a natural fire occurrence of about every 4 years in mixed
coniferous forests.  Biswell [<a href="#4">4</a>] believed ponderosa pine forests of
California burned approximately every 2 to 3 years.  Prior to fire
suppression, fires in mixed coniferous and ponderosa pine forests were
almost always surface fires, carried in large part by highly
concentrated fine fuels composed of Sierra mountain misery and
coniferous needles, cones, and twigs caught in its foliage and tangled
woody stems [<a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].

Sierra mountain misery survives fire by sprouting from the rootcrown,
roots, and rhizomes following top-kill [<a href="#15">15</a>].  It reestablishes on burns
almost exclusively from sprouting [<a href="#16">16</a>].

   Rhizomatous shrub, rhizome in soil
   Geophyte, growing points deep in soil

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Chamaebatia foliolosa

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire top-kills Sierra mountain misery [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Recovery from fire is rapid.  Three years following top-kill by a
wildfire of unreported severity on the Tahoe National Forest, Sierra
mountain misery sprouts were 1.6 to 16 inches (24-40 cm) tall, and
occupied 1,612 square feet per acre (370 sq m/ha) [<a href="#18">18</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Sierra mountain misery will carry prescribed ground fire when present in
the understory [<a href="#11">11</a>].  It is difficult and time-consuming to construct
fire breaks within its growth, however, because the numerous, tangled
woody stems, rhizomes, and shallow roots must be removed in order to
expose mineral soil [<a href="#32">32</a>].

If managers wish to decrease Sierra mountain misery cover through the
use of prescribed fire, late spring/high consumption prescriptions
appear to be most effective.  Early spring/moderate consumption fires
reduce densities the least [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Prescribed burning, however, is only a
temporary method of controlling this vigorous sprouter.

Sierra mountain misery regrowth affords good soil protection in burn
areas [<a href="#32">32</a>].
