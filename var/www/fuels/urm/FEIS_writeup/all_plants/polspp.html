<b>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION : </b>
Smartweed is a cosmopolitan genus found in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the
Americas.  In North America it is distributed from the Northwest
Territories south through Mexico and from coast to coast [<a href="#15">15</a>].  It is
found in Alaska and all the contiguous United States; it is probably
found in Hawaii also, although there is no specific reference to its
occurrence there.

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Polygonum spp.
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Smartweed is an important wildlife food for deer and waterfowl
[<a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#29">29</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>].  In northwest Missouri, smartweed accounts for 85 percent
of mallard diets in certain habitats [<a href="#18">18</a>].  Smartweed ranks third of all
plants consumed during fall in other parts of Missouri [<a href="#13">13</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>
Some species of smartweed provide poor to good forage for cattle, sheep,
and horses in the western states [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>COVER VALUE : </b>
Some species of smartweed provide poor to good cover for upland game
birds, waterfowl, nongame birds, and small mammals [<a href="#12">12</a>].


<b>VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Many species of smartweed are considered undesirable weeds [<a href="#20">20</a>].
Smartweed invades cultivated raspberry patches and agricultural fields.
It can be controlled with chemicals such as Roundup, Casoron, Princep,
and Gramoxone [<a href="#9">9</a>].  Smartweed tends to be eliminated when wetlands are
converted into agricultural land [<a href="#25">25</a>].  To maintain smartweed for
waterfowl food in irrigated desert playas of the southern high plains,
soil must be moist during early April.  These playas must also be kept
moist from mid to late June and early August.  From November to January,
1 foot of water should be maintained in the playa [<a href="#19">19</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Polygonum spp.
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Smartweed is a highly variable genus, which includes annual or perennial
forbs and shrubs [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Some species are viney.  The leaves are usually
simple and alternate.  The pink, green, or white flowers have jointed
stalks and stems have swollen nodes [<a href="#17">17</a>].  Flowers can be either perfect
or imperfect.  The fruit is a three- or four-angled achene [<a href="#20">20</a>].  Some
species have rhizomes or taproots [<a href="#35">35</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Chamaephyte
   Cryptophyte: Geophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Smartweed reproduces by seed and by rhizomes.  The average number of
seeds for P. hydropiperoides collected on the Texas Gulf Coast was 581
pounds per acre (650 kg/ha) dry weight [<a href="#32">32</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Smartweed species are mostly found in wetlands, sandy beaches, saline or
brackish ponds and marshes, and in inundated swales and marshes [<a href="#15">15</a>].
They can also be found in cultivated fields, thickets, swampy woods,
clearings, wastelands, along roadsides, in prairies, and on rocky, dry
or cool and damp slopes.  Some species grow in alpine or subalpine
meadows and on rocky summits [<a href="#15">15</a>].  P. careyi is reported to occur on
recent burns.  Elevational ranges for some western species of smartweed
have been listed as follows [<a href="#12">12</a>]:

Utah:     from 4,200 to 12,300 feet (1,280-3,750 m)
Colorado: from 3,500 to 13,400 feet (1,067-4,085 m)
Wyoming:  from 3,500 to 12,000 feet (1,067-3,660 m)
Montana:  from 2,800 to 10,500 feet (853-3,200 m)


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Many smartweed species are introduced, while others are native to North
America.  Most are shade intolerant [<a href="#15">15</a>].  P. cilinode appears to be
dominant on severely burned forested areas of northern Minnesota for the
first three postfire seasons [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Some species of smartweeed are
dominant in the nonpersistent emergent marsh communities of the Savannah
River in South Carolina [<a href="#27">27</a>].  P. coccineum is an indicator of fire in
wetlands [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Other species of smartweed are early seral species which
dominate sites for the first 5 to 7 postdisturbance years [<a href="#2">2</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Flowering dates for smartweed species vary.  Most of the southern
species flower in May and June, while their northern counterparts flower
from July through November.  Some species in Texas, Arkansas, and
Oklahoma can flower as late as November [<a href="#15">15</a>].

<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Polygonum spp.

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>
Fire top-kills smartweed.


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Smartweeds usually sprout from seeds following fire.  They tend to
reproduce more after severe burns than after light burns [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>].


<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : </b>
P. cilinode, an annual, has been known to colonize severely burned sites
in the forests of northeastern Minnesota [<a href="#1">1</a>].  August wildfires in the
pine forests of northern Minnesota resulted in an increase of P.
cilinode from zero percent cover on the unburned sites to 36 percent
ground cover on the burned sites [<a href="#4">4</a>].  P. bistortoides was present
following wildfires in krummholz and alpine meadows of the central Rocky
Mountains [<a href="#7">7</a>].  P. convolvulus sprouted from seed following a May
prescribed burn in shrub communities of central Alberta.  However, this
species was only prevalent for the first postfire year [<a href="#3">3</a>].

Fire was simulated in northern Alberta wetlands to monitor its potential
effects on the plant community.  Here, P. amphibium was almost equal in
percent cover for the three treatments: no burn, "light burn," and
"deep" burn in willow (Salix spp.) savanna zones [<a href="#21">21</a>].  ("Deep burns"
had the first 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm) of soil removed and the new
surface burned with a propane torch for 1 minute; "light burns" had some
soil removed and the new surface lightly burned with a propane torch).
In the pinegrass (Calamagrostis spp.) zones of these same Alberta
wetlands, P. amphibium was found in trace amounts on the unburned and
lightly burned sites, and not at all on the "deeply" burned sites.

Prescribed fires on sagebrush (Artemesia spp.)-grass (Poaceae) ranges in
northern Idaho showed significant differences in P. douglasii cover
between the light to moderately burned and severely burned sites [<a href="#8">8</a>].
Only 7 pounds/acre (7.83 kg/ha) of this species was found on unburned
sites, while 26 pounds/acre (29 kg/ha) were found on severely burned
sites.  Smaller differences in cover were shown for light and moderately
burned areas compared to unburned sites.


<b>FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Where smartweed is a desired waterfowl food fire can be used to
stimulate the growth of smartweeds while reducing competition from sedge
(Carex spp.), cattail (Typha spp.), and giant reed (Phragmites spp.)
[<a href="#23">23</a>].
