<b>WOOD PRODUCTS VALUE : </b>

<b>IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : </b>
Wild hollyhock was highly preferred by sheep and cattle in recently
burned quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) stands in Wyoming and Idaho
[<a href="#6">6</a>].  It was also utilized heavily by elk and mule deer in recently
burned areas of Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks [<a href="#14">14</a>].


<b>PALATABILITY : </b>

<b>NUTRITIONAL VALUE : </b>
Crude protein percentage of wild hollyhock in aspen stands in Idaho
ranged from 12.1 to 22.4 from July to September. In-vitro digestible dry
matter ranged from 64.9 to 84.4 percent during the same time period [<a href="#4">4</a>].

<b>OTHER USES AND VALUES : </b>

<b>OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : </b>
Wild hollyhock may become abundant following clearcutting in grand fir
(Abies grandis) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) habitats in
central Idaho.  It may also appear after mechanical site preparation,
but is not as well represented [<a href="#22">22</a>].  In Douglas-fir/pinegrass
(Calamagrostis rubescens) habitats in central Idaho, wild hollyhock
showed no change following clearcutting, but declined after shelterwood
cutting and clearcuting followed by mechanical site preparation.  It
increased drastically after clearcutting followed by burning and after
stand-destroying wildfires [<a href="#23">23</a>].

<center><h2>BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Iliamna rivularis
</b></font><hr size="3">


<b>GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Wild hollyhock is a perennial forb with one to several stems arising
from a woody caudex.  It reaches 24 to 80 inches (60-200 cm) in height
[<a href="#10">10</a>].  Flowers are on stout stalks in dense axillary or terminal
clusters [<a href="#17">17</a>].


<b>RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : </b>
   Hemicryptophyte


<b>REGENERATION PROCESSES : </b>
Wild hollyhock reproduces by seed and is not rhizomatous [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Seeds
have no dispersal mechanism and are stored in the soil, remaining up to
91 percent viable for long periods of time.  The majority of the seeds
(around 75 percent) are buried 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm) below the soil
surface, with the remainder buried in the top 2 inches (0-5 cm).  One
study reported 8 to 137 viable wild hollyhock seeds per square foot
(84-1,470 seeds/sq m) in mature grand fir habitats in central Idaho.
Seeds have a smooth, hard coat and require a heat treatment for
germination.  This fact, in addition to high seed density, depth of
burial, and high viability, provides for long-term survival in the
seedbank [<a href="#15">15</a>].  Wild hollyhock seeds remain viable for at least a few
hundred years [<a href="#28">28</a>].  Germination takes place in full sun, most often
following fire [<a href="#23">23</a>].


<b>SITE CHARACTERISTICS : </b>
Wild hollyhock commonly grows on forested slopes, in meadows, along
streambanks, and in disturbed areas [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#17">17</a>].  It occurs on mesic sites
in deep, moist, but well-drained soil [<a href="#17">17</a>].  It has been found to 11,500
feet (3,490 m) elevation in Colorado [<a href="#10">10</a>], and 9,570 feet (2900 m)
elevation in Utah [<a href="#30">30</a>].


<b>SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : </b>
Obligate Initial Community Species

Wild hollyhock is a shade-intolerant, early seral species [<a href="#15">15</a>,<a href="#27">27</a>].  It
becomes abundant following disturbance such as clearcutting, broadcast
burning, and wildfire, and flowers profusely in full sun [<a href="#22">22</a>].  Wild
hollyhock is quickly eliminated from post-disturbance communities when
overtopped by other vegetation [<a href="#15">15</a>].


<b>SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : </b>
Wild hollyhock flowers from June to August in the Pacific Northwest [<a href="#17">17</a>].

<center><h2>FIRE ECOLOGY</h2></center>
<font size="+1" color="red"><b>SPECIES: Iliamna rivularis

<b>FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : </b>
Wild hollyhock is a seedbanking species that survives even severe fire
by germination of dormant, fire-activated seeds [<a href="#19">19</a>].  It flowers during
early postfire stages.  Seeds survive in the soil and remain viable for
long periods of time [<a href="#22">22</a>].

<b>IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : </b>

<b>DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : </b>
NO-ENTRY


<b>PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : </b>
Wild hollyhock is a residual colonizer that is prominent in initial
postfire communities, even after holocaustic fires [<a href="#26">26</a>].  It becomes
abundant following severe wildfire and hot broadcast burning,
particularly when slash has been piled [<a href="#22">22</a>].

Wild hollyhock dominated the postfire vegetation after moderate to
severe fire in quaking aspen and quaking aspen-mixed conifer habitats in
Idaho.  It formed dense stands within the first postfire growing season,
but was absent from the preburn vegetation.  It continued to dominate
the site for several seasons, producing an average of 2,000 pounds per
acre (2,260 kg/ha) in postfire year 2, and 835 pounds per acre (940
kg/ha) in postfire year 3.  By postfire year 4, production had further
declined, and wild hollyhock foliage appeared chlorotic.  It disappeared
from the site by the sixth growing season following the fire.  In
postfire year 2, wild hollyhock produced an average of 1,329 seeds per
square foot (14,300 seeds/sq m) [<a href="#3">3</a>].

In Douglas-fir habitats in central Idaho, wild hollyhock was prominent
in postfire communities but was absent from preburn vegetation.  It had
the following frequencies in postfire growing seasons:  year 1, 52
percent; year 2, 36 percent; year 3, 52 percent; year 4, 52 percent;
year 5, 56 percent; year 6, 52 percent; and year 7, 48 percent.  Wild
hollyhock had a frequency of 4 percent in an adjacent 20-year-old burn.
By postfire year 3, it dominated the site along with fireweed (Epilobium
angustifolium).  Together, they comprised 40 percent of total vegetal
cover.  In successive years, they made up 20 percent of total cover, but
were not as abundant after postfire year 6 [<a href="#18">18</a>].

In general, wild hollyhock flowers profusely and becomes very abundant
for a short period following fire but is eventually replaced by other
vegetation [<a href="#13">13</a>,<a href="#24">24</a>,<a href="#28">28</a>].  It has shown this response after fires in grand
fir [<a href="#31">31</a>], ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) [<a href="#21">21</a>], aspen (Populus spp.)
[<a href="#4">4</a>], and Douglas-fir [<a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#5">5</a>] habitats in the Northwest.
