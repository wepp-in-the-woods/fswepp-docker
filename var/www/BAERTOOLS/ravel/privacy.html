   <blockquote>
    For site management, information is collected as the 
    <font color="crimson">standard logging</font> done
    by the web server software. These records are
    used to create summary statistics for such analysis as assessing web site popularity,
    and identifying system performance and problem areas.
    <br><br>
    We keep a
    <font color="crimson">log file of Dry&nbsp;Ravel model runs</font>.
    These log files record
    the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the machine which initiated the run,
    the date and time of the run, the specified bounding coordinates, and
    the uer-specified run description.
    We use these logs to assess the interest in and distribution of use of the software
    and to aid users.
    <br><br>
    At times there are input and output files for the model runs stored on the server.
    These are flushed out but may be captured during routine backups.
