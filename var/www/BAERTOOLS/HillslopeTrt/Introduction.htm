<h3>Introduction</h3>

 Wildfires continue to be a major land management concern in the United States and throughout the world.
 The number and severity of wildfires in the United States has increased during the past decade and the rise is likely to continue, especially in the western U.S., where drought and other effects of climate change are exacerbating wildfire conditions.
 At the same time, the number of people living in the wildland-urban interface continues to grow, putting human life and safety, infrastructure, homes, buildings, and natural areas that support livelihoods (grazing, timber, etc.) at risk from wildfire and secondary fire effects such as increased runoff, flooding, erosion, and debris flows.
 Mitigating these fire effects has resulted in increasing use of post-fire treatments.
