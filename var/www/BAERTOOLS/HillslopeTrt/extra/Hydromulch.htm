<h3>Hydromulches</h3>

 Hydromulches are combinations of various short, bonded organic fibers (wood shreds, paper, cotton, flax, etc.),
 tackifiers, suspension agents, seeds, etc., that are mixed with water and applied to the soil surface. 
<br><br>
 The matrix formed by the hydromulch holds moisture and seeds on steep slopes, which fosters seeded plant germination
 while holding the soil in place.
 Since hydromulch binds to the soil surface, it is very wind-resistant; however, the smooth dense mat has little
 resistive force against the shear force of concentrated flow. 
<br><br>
 There are numerous tackifiers, polymers, bonded fiber, seeds, etc., that can be included in hydromulch mixes.
 Generally, the tackifier (the "glue" that bonds the fiber to the soil), mulch material, and seeds are selected
 separately and mixed with water just prior to application.
