<h3>EROSION BARRIER TREATMENTS</h3>

 Erosion barriers, made from natural and engineered materials, have been used for decades to mitigate
 post-wildfire runoff and erosion.
 These structures are designed to slow runoff, cause localized ponding, and store eroded sediment. 
 Common post-wildfire hillslope erosion barriers include contour-felled logs (LEBs) (fig. 1);

 straw wattles (10 in [0.25 m] diameter, 13 to 20 ft [4 to 6 m] long nylon mesh tubes filled with straw) (fig. 2);

 contour trenches (hand or machine dug trenches), and straw bales (blocks of straw bound with twine) (fig. 3).

 To eliminate long uninterrupted flow paths, erosion barriers are generally installed in staggered tiers with the center of each erosion barrier directly downslope from the gap between the two erosion barriers above it (fig. 4).
