          <br>
          The Unified Rock Classification System (URCS) provides a reliable and 
          rapid method of communicating detailed information about rock conditions 
          pertinent to design and construction of civil engineering projects. 
          The URCS consists of four fundamental physical properties: 1) weathering, 
          2) strength, 3) discontinuities and 4) density. A general assessment 
          of rock performance is then based on a grouping of the four key elements 
          to aid in making engineering judgments. These individual properties 
          are estimated in the field with the use of a hand lens, a 1-pound ballpeen 
          hammer, a spring-loaded &quot;fish&quot; scale and a bucket of water. 
          Each property is divided into five ratings which convey uniform meaning 
          to engineering geologists, design engineers, inspectors and contractors 
          as well as contract appeal board members.<br>
          <bR>
          Subjective terminology, such as &quot;slightly weathered, moderately 
          hard, highly fractured and lightweight,&quot; varies widely in meaning, 
          depends on individual and professional experience, and cannot be quantified 
          with any reliability. The URCS is not intended to supplant existing 
          geologic classifications but it does offer a suitable alternative to 
          ambiguous descriptive terminology.</font><br>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">INTRODUCTION<BR>
          <br>
          The Unified Rock Classification System (URCS) allows rapid preliminary 
          assessments of rock conditions by simple field tests that establish 
          basic engineering properties. The URCS is useful for all earth-associated 
          design and construction projects. Pertinent natural conditions related 
          to design parameters are documented in a convenient manner which can 
          be understood at a glance.<br>
          <Br>
          The URCS is engineering shorthand which can be used to convey maximum 
          information. With the URCS, rock is classified in simple, easily understood 
          terms that convey evidence of strength and behavior. The URCS terms 
          convey uniform meaning to engineering geologists, design engineers, 
          inspectors. contractors and contract appeal board members.<br>
          <br>
          Geotechnical field reports or drill logs sometimes Lack uniformity of 
          notation to assure that sufficiently identical interpretations will 
          be made by designers. A working classification system based on simple 
          field tests which can be refined by laboratory test results can provide 
          this needed uniformity. The URCS is not intended to replace existing 
          geologic classifications but rather to supplement them with engineering 
          design parameters.<br>
          <br>
          The URCS was conceived in 1959 in simplified form in conjunction with 
          investigations and explorations for design and construction of major 
          flood-control dams by the Portland District of the U.S. Army Corps of 
          Engineers. Use of the URCS was found to materially increase efficiency 
          and produce</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">reliable 
          rock information that resulted in successful design and construction 
          as well as post-construction evaluations. The URCS in its present form 
          dates from 1975 and is used by the U.S. Forest Service in Region 6 and 
          parts of Regions 1 and 5. It has been found to be a reliable method 
          of communicating rock conditions (including those in quarries. retaining 
          walls, and extensive rock excavations) for the design of forest access 
          roads.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PURPOSE 
          AND NEED</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          purpose of the URCS is to establish a means of making rapid initial 
          assessments of rock conditions related to design and construction by 
          simple field tests that permit direct estimation of natural strength 
          parameters. The purpose of this report is threefold: 1) to present a 
          rock classification for use in engineering geology and geotechnical 
          investigations, 2) to outline field procedures that require simple equipment, 
          and 3) to establish the relationship between the classification and 
          design and performance.<br>
          <br>
          Experienced professionals who deal with rock can, and often do. apply 
          the principles of rock mechanics without any formally accepted rock 
          classification. Organizations comprised of employees of many experience 
          levels commonly have a designated rock classification system. Rock information 
          is frequently collected in the field by geologists but utilized in design 
          by engineers. The URCS is intended to supplement, not supplant, existing 
          geologic classifications; its specific goal is to provide a means by 
          which the inherent confusion of subjective terminology can be eliminated 
          when applied in civil engineering.<br>
          <br>
          Classification is not the chief aim of geotechnical investigations, 
          but a uniform working classification is necessary to effectively supply 
          the needs of a large organization of diverse professional disciplines. 
          The assertion that there is no need for another classification is easily 
          discounted wIth the statement that a classification is always needed 
          until one is found that meets general approval and acceptance and is 
          used.<br>
          <br>
          The following statements are unfortunately still true: &quot;There are 
          as many classifications as there are geologists,&quot; and &quot;No 
          two geotechnical investigators will give the same name to the same rock.&quot; 
          </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Because of 
          the number of geotechnical personnel working in the field, it is vital 
          that some uniformity of data exist. Even now, when one reads geotechnical 
          reports, drilling logs, or contract documents, it is not possible to 
          be sure that two different geotechnical specialists who are discussing 
          the same rock are describing sufficiently identical design characteristics. 
          A working classification requires uniform symbols. abbreviations, notations, 
          and definitions that are established to be acceptable procedures.<br>
          <br>
          The URCS fulfills basic needs of any classification:</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASIC 
          ELEMENTS<BR>
          <br>
          The URCS consists of four basic elements which are major physical properties 
          of rock material and are related to design and construction. The elements 
          are: 1) degree of weathering, 2) estimated strength, 3) discontinuities 
          or directional weaknesses, and 4) unit weight or density.<br>
          <br>
          By establishing limiting values of these four basic elements by using 
          uniform field tests and observations, terminology, notations, and abbreviations, 
          the URCS provides a means for recording and communicating reliable indications 
          of rock properties and performance. The URCS permits a useful estimate 
          of compressive strength, permeability and shear strength-the three primary 
          properties of rock masses. When combined with other geotechnical information 
          (stress history and water table location), the URCS permits an estimate 
          of rock performance such as foundation suitability, excavation methods, 
          slope stability, material use, blasting character and water transmittal.<br>
          <br>
          The equipment used for the field tests and observations is simple and 
          available: one's fingers, a 10-power hand lens, a 1-pound (0.5-kg) ballpeen 
          hammer, a spring-loaded &quot;fish&quot; scale of the 10-pound (5 kg) 
          range, and a bucket of water. Fingers are used in determining the degree 
          of weathering and the lower range of strength. The hand lens is used 
          in defining the degree of weathering. The ballpeen hammer is used to 
          estimate the range of unconfined, compressive strength from impact reaction. 
          The spring-loaded scale and bucket of water are used to measure the 
          weight of samples for determining apparent specific gravity.</font><br>
          <br>
          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The URCS design notation 
          consists of underlined groups of four letters ranging from A through 
          E which represent the five categories or design-limiting conditions 
          of each of the basic elements of the system. The limiting conditions 
          of the basic elements are described below in the order that they appear 
          in the symbol.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          degree of weathering in the URCS is restricted to chemical processes. 
          The five design-limiting conditions of weathering are: 1) micro fresh 
          state (MFS) designated by <u>A</u>, 2) visually fresh state (VFS) designated 
          by <u>B</u>, 3) stained state (STS) designated by <u>C</u>, 4) partly 
          decomposed state (POS) designated by <u>D</u>, and 5) completely decomposed 
          state (CDS) designated by <u>E</u>. These five weathering states are 
          listed in the top line of Figure 1.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Micro 
          Fresh State (MFS)<br>
          <br>
          MFS is determined in the field by examining rock samples with the aid 
          of a 10-power hand lens. This condition is characterized by absence 
          of oxidation alteration of any mineral components. MFS will generally 
          apply only to crystalline rocks, some volcanic rocks, and chemical sedimentary 
          rocks. Investigations of crushed rock and concrete aggregate sources 
          may require MFS rock, but ordinary rock-design evaluations usually do 
          not require such high quality rock.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Visually 
          Fresh State (VFS)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VFS 
          is determined in the field by examining rock samples with the unaided 
          eye. This condition is characterized by a uniform color of the rock 
          material. VFS will apply to all rock types including some clastic sedimentary 
          rocks. VFS samples commonly exhibit maximum unit weight, maximum specimen 
          strength and least water absorption for the site from which comparisons 
          to STS are made. The VFS is generally representative of the standard 
          quality acceptable for all foundation and excavation designs.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stained 
          State (STS)<br>
          <br>
          STS is determined in the field by examining rock samples with the unaided 
          eye. This condition is characterized by partial or complete discoloration 
          due to oxidation alteration of mineral components, but the specimen 
          cannot be remolded with finger pressure. STS will apply to all rock 
          types and commonly is the highest weathering state of Cenozoic clastic 
          sedimentary rocks. STS specimen strength may or may not vary from that 
          of VFS specimens: unit weights are usually lower and water absorptions 
          are usually higher than VFS specimens.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Partly 
          Decomposed State (PDS)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PDS 
          is determined in the field by applying finger pressure to discolored 
          specimens. The material is solid rock when in place but can be disaggregated 
          into gravel or larger size rock fragments in a matrix of soil. Decomposed 
          granite is an example of PDS weathering. The relative percentage of 
          rock fragments is estimated and the quality of individual fragments 
          is assessed with URCS. The soil fines are determined to be plastic or 
          nonplastic.<br>
          <br>
          The in-place strength is estimated by manual consistency values or by 
          size, shape, and gradation of the remolded aggregate (Terzaghi and Peck, 
          1948). The remolded aggregate is tested for dilatency,. dry strength, 
          and toughness and classified according to field procedures of the Unified 
          Soil Classification System (USCS) (Casagrande, 1948).</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CDS 
          is determined in the field by applying finger pressure to discolored 
          specimens in a manner similar to that for PDS specimens. CDS specimens 
          disaggregate or remold to soil without gravel or larger size fragments 
          of intact rock. The remolded material is determined to be plastic or 
          nonplastic, and dry strength, dilatency, and toughness tests are performed. 
          The in-place strength is estimated by manual consistency values. Both 
          URCS and USCS symbols are recorded. Note that the URCS boundary separating 
          rock from soil is the No. 4 sieve which is the gravel/sand division. 
          Most investigators, as well as lay persons, generally accept that gravel 
          is composed of rock fragments but sand is composed of mineral grains.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Estimated 
          Strength</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A reasonable 
          estimate of specimen strength can be made by striking a sample, piece 
          of rock core, or outcrop with the round end of a ballpeen hammer (or 
          with the rounded head end of a 20-penny nail if the specimen is to be 
          preserved). The resulting characteristic impact reaction indicates a 
          range of unconfined compressive strength (Williamson, 1961). The rock 
          specimen or outcrop is struck several times to permit evaluation of 
          uniformity of response, and a quality is assigned based on the distinct 
          reaction. The five kinds of reaction are illustrated in <a href="#Fig_2">Figure 
          2</a>.<br>
          <br>
          The reaction of a rock specimen to the impact of a ballpeen hammer is 
          distinct and characteristic depending on the range of unconfined compressive 
          strength. The nature of the reaction, not the magnitude of the reaction 
          is used to assign a strength quality to the specimen. Therefore. the 
          reaction is independent of the intensity of the blow within the limitations 
          of the tool used and the investigator's strength.<br>
          <br>
          The five design-limiting conditions of strength based on impact reaction 
          are: I) rebound quality (RQ) designated by <u>A</u>, 2) pit quality 
          (PQ) designated by <u>B</u>, 3) dent quality (DQ) designated by <u>C</u>, 
          4) crater quality (CQ) designated by <u>D</u>, and 5) moldable quality 
          (MQ) designated by <u>E</u>. These five strength states are listed in 
          the second line of <a href="#Fig_1">Figure 1</a>. The range of unconfined 
          compressive strength in terms of pounds per square inch (psi) and megapascals 
          (MPa) for each of the strength states is also listed in Figure 1.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rebound 
          Quality (RQ)<br>
          RQ rock material shows no reaction under the point of impact and is 
          a true brittle-elastic substance in a mechanical sense. The estimated 
          unconfined compressive strength of RQ material is greater than 15,000 
          psi (103 MPa). The exact strength value is seldom significant in typical 
          civil engineering applications once the strength reaches this magnitude. 
          RQ rock material produces free-draining fill that is suitable for road 
          aggregate; however, it is often sharp and angular due to its brittleness 
          and therefore may produce a less desirable material than PQ material. 
          RQ rock material has a very high energy transfer in response to blasting 
          and may be difficult to drill and break in the absence of planar separations.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pit 
          Quality (PQ)<br>
          PQ rock material produces a shallow rough pit under the point of impact 
          due to explosive departure of mineral grains. This quality of specimen 
          has an estimated unconfined compressive strength ranging from 8,000 
          to 15,000 psi (55 to 103 MPa) and is considered to be hard rock by the 
          construction industry. PQ rock material produces free-draining fill 
          and is suitable for road surfacing material. It has high energy transfer 
          in response to blasting which produces generally good fragmentation 
          and satisfactory excavation slopes. No special blasting design procedure 
          is generally necessary.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dent 
          Quality (DQ)<br>
          DQ rock material produces a dent or depression under the point of impact 
          indicating the presence of pore spaces between mineral grains. This 
          quality of specimen has an estimated unconfined compressive strength 
          ranging from 3,000 to 8,000 psi (21 to 55 MPa) and is approximately 
          equivalent to the strength range of concrete. DQ rock material usually 
          does not meet absorption specifications for road ag. gregate and has 
          a relatively low energy transfer in response to blasting. Special blasting 
          design may be necessary to avoid creating over-size blocks. DQ material 
          is usually not suitable for road fill or surfacing and is not free-draining.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Crater 
          Quality (CQ)<BR>
          CQ rock material produces a shearing and up-thrusting of mineral grains 
          surrounding the point of impact resulting in a depression which resembles 
          a moon crater. This quality of specimen has an estimated unconfined 
          compressive strength ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 psi (7 to 21 MPa). 
          CQ material can usually be recovered during diamond-core drilling operations, 
          has high absorption, and will respond to freeze-thaw stresses by at 
          least cracking and checking. It has very low energy transfer when blasted 
          and can be excavated by means of machinery, produces poorly drained 
          embankments, and is not suitable for road fill or surfacing material.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moldable 
          Quality (MQ)<br>
          MQ rock is in a condition which can be molded by finger pressure but 
          retains the fabric of intact rock. The unconfined compressive strength 
          for this quality of specimen is less than 1,000 psi (7 MPa). MQ material 
          must be examined and tested as a soil and a dual classification (URCS 
          and USCS) is given. The material usually cannot be recovered by diamond-core 
          drilling, can be excavated by machinery, and must be evaluated as a 
          soil for design purposes.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Discontinuities<br>
          Directional weaknesses of a rock mass or rock material are termed planar 
          or linear features. Planar separations are open separations that already 
          exist in the rock mass and are defined by relative capacity to transmit 
          water. Linear features are directional weaknesses due to visible or 
          nonvisible alignments of mineral grains in an otherwise solid rock mass 
          or material that usually require blasting or mechanical crushing to 
          produce a separation.<br>
          <br>
          For purposes of design evaluations, linear features are defined by breakage 
          characteristics. Planar features or open planes of separation are defined 
          by the scale dimension of the rock mass examined and by the geometric 
          determination that defines a plane or shape.<br>
          <br>
          The five design-limiting conditions of discontinuities are: 1) solid 
          random breakage (SRB) designated by <u>A</u>, 2) solid preferred breakage 
          (SPB) designated by <u>B</u>, 3) latent planar separations (LPS) designated 
          by <u>C</u>, 4) two-dimensional open planar separations (2-D) designated 
          by <u>D</u>, and 5) three-dimensional open planar separations (3-D) 
          designated by <u>E</u>. These five discontinuity states are listed in 
          the third line of Figure 1.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Solid 
          Random Breakage (SRB)<br>
          SRB represents ideal design conditions in which planar and linear features 
          have no effect within the dimensions of the rock mass examined. The 
          specimen strength equals the mass strength so that the strength value 
          of any individual sample tested is directly representative of the entire 
          rock-mass strength. Needless to say, this is seldom the case, except 
          in very limited foundation dimensions.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Solid 
          Preferred Breakage (SPB)<br>
          SPB indicates that a nonvisible alignment of mineral grains has resulted 
          in a directional weakness in the rock mass or material. The rock breaks 
          consistently along a uniform angle or direction. SPB rock material may 
          produce an undesirable shape or size for rock aggregate or may prevent 
          the achievement of a desired slope in an excavation. It may be an adverse 
          quality in the production of dimension stone.<br>
          Latent Planar Separations (LPS)<br>
          <br>
          LPS indicates a visible alignment of mineral grains or infilling material 
          which may or may not affect the strength or breakage character of the 
          rock mass or material during excavation or crushing. The latent planes 
          may be stronger or weaker than the rock mass. The reaction of LPS material 
          to impact defines the strength estimate. Latent planes occur in patterns 
          or at random and are continuous or discontinuous; the planes may be 
          of measurable thickness. In all cases, the infilling material in the 
          latent plane of separation has an unconfined compressive strength greater 
          than 1,000 psi (7 MPa).<br>
          <BR>
          LPS material is usually not a foundation design consideration because 
          the material is. for practical purposes, a solid. In consideration of 
          rock slope design or road aggregate source, blasting energy will. in 
          most cases, be reflected by the latent plane and produce a separation 
          and breakage at right angles to the plane alignment.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two-Dimensional 
          Open Planar Separations (2-D)<br>
          The 2-D category indicates the presence of one or more parallel open 
          planes of separation that pass through the rock mass at the point of 
          examination. The 2-D planar separations may vary in frequency and spacing 
          but do not intersect. The attitude, relief, and continuity of the plane 
          or planes are fundamental elements of design analysis. Water transmission 
          along the open planes can be determined by observations of the drilling 
          operation or by water testing.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Three-Dimensional 
          Open Planar Separations (3-D)<br>
          The 3-D category indicates the presence of two or more intersecting 
          planar discontinuities or open planes of separation that pass through 
          the rock mass at the point of examination. The planar separation may 
          form patterns or may be random in occurrence. Internal planar separations 
          (IPS) terminate within the rock mass; mass planar separations (MPS) 
          pass entirely through the rock mass and are infinite in extent in terms 
          of design.<br>
          <br>
          By geometric definition, three dimensions form a shape. This shape is 
          often referred to as a joint block which has an average size and weight 
          that can be estimated. The degree of interlock between joint blocks 
          can be used to estimate the strength-of-foundation or the stability-of-excavation 
          factor.<br>
          <br>
          In the case of MPS, the attitude of the planes with respect to the slope 
          or excavation is the chief design factor. The ability of the planes 
          to transmit water is estimated or measured as in the 2-D category above.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unit 
          Weight<br>
          Density or unit weight has been found to be one of the most useful and 
          reliable means of communicating rock quality to design engineers and 
          contractors, due to their past experience with rock. The unit weight 
          is determined in the field with the aid of a spring-loaded &quot;fish&quot; 
          scale and a bucket of water. A suitable sample is fastened to the scale 
          with a short piece of string. The weight of the sample is determined 
          first in air and then submerged in water. The weight of the string (wet 
          and dry) is ignored. The unit weight is calculated by the following 
          equation:</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">where 
          Wa is the weight of the sample in air, Ww is the weight of the sample 
          in water, and Dw is the density of water (62.4 pounds per cubic foot, 
          pcf, 1.0 g/cc). The weight of the sample in air and water can be measured 
          in either pounds or grams since the mathematical operation with the 
          weights produces a dimensionless number.<br>
          <br>
          The five categories of unit weight are: 1) greater than 160 pcf (2.55 
          g/cc) designated by <u>A</u>, 2) 150 to 160 pcf (2.40 to 2.55 g/cc) 
          designated by <u>B</u>, 3) 140 to 150 pcf (2.25 to 2.40 g/cc) designated 
          by <u>C</u>. 4) 130 to 140 pcf (2.10 to 2.25 g/cc) designated by <u>D,</u> 
          and 5) less than 130 pcf (2.10 g/cc) designated by <u>E</u>. These five 
          unit weight conditions are listed in the bottom line of Figure 1.<br>
          <br>
          The unit weight design evaluation establishes the driving force in problems 
          of slope stability, the relative usefulness of the rock material as 
          a surface course or concrete aggregate, of the weight-volume relationship 
          for estimates of haul cost. Unit weight establishes the degree of change 
          due to change of weathering state.<br>
          <br>
          As a general rule,. the author has found that rock material having a 
          unit weight greater than 160 pcf (2.55 g/cc) is suitable more than 50 
          percent of the time for use as road aggregate, concrete aggregate, riprap, 
          or jettystone without laboratory testing. Rock material having a unit 
          weight of 150 to 160 pcf (2.40 to 2.55 g/cc) may be acceptable for these 
          uses but requires laboratory testing for confirmation. Rock having a 
          unit weight less than 150 pcf (2.40 g/cc) is usually not acceptable 
          for these uses, typically does not produce free-draining fill, and will 
          probably degrade. Rock having a unit weight less than 130 pcf (2.10 
          g/cc) can usually be excavated by machinery but will likely degrade 
          during excavation under abrasion of excavation equipment.</font></p>

          and Notations<br>
          <br>
          The URCS employs a simple system of notation for graphic representation 
          on geotechnical inventories, boring logs, maps, and sections. The notation 
          registers rapidly in the mind and minimizes the required drafting effort. 
          The letter design symbols for the four basic elements described above 
          and shown in Figure 1 are grouped together in a four-letter notation.<br>
          <br>
          The four letters are upper case and are underlined. The letter &quot;<u>A</u>&quot; 
          denotes that the least design evaluation is generally required, while 
          the letter &quot;<u>E</u>&quot; denotes the greatest design evaluation. 
          The letter &quot;<u>O</u>&quot; in sequence indicates that no determination 
          of that basic element was made; a lower case &quot;<u>e</u>&quot; after 
          an upper case letter indicates that the value of the basic element was 
          estimated. The field notation should include both the letter symbol 
          and the abbreviated basis written under the letter. For example:</font></p>

          values can then be established for this material for the intended purpose.<br>
          <br>
          Some combinations of states or qualities do not occur. For example, 
          the CDS weathering state could not occur with RQ strength or 160 pcf 
          (2.55 g/cc) unit weight. Neither could MQ strength material occur with 
          MFS weathering.<br>
          <br>
          Design values of the four basic elements are not equivalent even though 
          the same letter notation might apply. In general, rock material designated 
          <u>AAAA</u> will require the least design evaluation while <u>EEEE</u> 
          will require the most.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DISCUSSION<br>
          Information pertaining to rock material or rock masses in current contract 
          specifications or design memoranda is sketchy and ambiguous, to say 
          the least, even when supported by laboratory test data. The terminology 
          used in drilling logs and geologic </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">sections 
          usually fails to provide understandable information to the contractor 
          for purposes of bid estimates.<br>
          Here is an example of a rock description found in a typical contract 
          specification or design memorandum:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Slightly 
          weathered, moderately hard, highly fractured, lightweight rhyolitic 
          rock.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="center"><a href="images/3App/app_f288.gif" target="_blank"><img src="images/3App/app_f288.gif" width="320" height="412" border="1"></a></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Figure 
          3. Example of boring log utilizing URCS notation.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
          information is sincerely intended to portray actual conditions existing 
          at a site and will provide the basis of the design, the cost estimate, 
          and the judgment of the construction method required as well as the 
          basis for defending the owner from future construction claims or extras.<br>
          <br>
          Descriptive terms such as these vary widely in meaning, depending on 
          both individual and professional experience, and cannot be quantified 
          with any degree of precision or uniformity. Consequently, design decisions, 
          cost estimates, or construction methods based on such information also 
          vary widely.<br>
          <br>
          The URCS offers a suitable alternative to this ambiguous, descriptive 
          approach. The term &quot;unified&quot; refers to the necessary unification 
          of geology and engineering for geotechnical purposes. The URCS equivalent 
          of the typical rock description for contract specifications and design 
          memoranda is <u>CCED</u>. This simple notation is based on uniform acceptable 
          procedures used to define design conditions.<BR>
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><img src="images/3App/app_f289.gif" width="493" height="363"></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Figure 
          4. Example of geotechnial section utilizing URCS notation. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
          The <u>CCED</u> notation indicates that the degree of weathering of 
          the rock is the stained state (STS) or not representative of the standard 
          design condition that exists at the site and that comparative data will 
          have to be determined. The strength of the rock material is dent quality 
          (DQ) and has a range of unconfined compressive strength of 3,000 to 
          8,000 psi (21 to 55 MPa), which is comparable to the strength of concrete. 
          The rock mass has three-dimensional planar separations (3-D), which 
          will be the primary design and construction consideration with respect 
          to stability, excavation, and material use. The size, shape, volume 
          and weight of the unit joint block have not been defined and will have 
          to be determined as well as the continuity and attitude of the planes 
          and degree of interlock of the joint blocks. Water transmission will 
          have to be estimated or measured. The unit weight of the rock material 
          is 130 to 140 pcf (2.10 to 2.25 g/cc), which indicates that there will 
          be full loads for hauling equipment but that the material is probably 
          not free draining nor can it be used in load-bearing fills or for surfacing.<br>
          <br>
          This simple but well-defined verifiable design notation is suitable 
          for graphic abstracts, boring logs, plans and sections, and other documentation. 
          Since it is based on basic design elements, the notation provides a 
          reliable means for decision. The notation registers rapidly in the mind 
          during scanning and allows rapid comparison with several rock conditions. 
          Similarities and differences can be established immediately. The simple 
          notation minimizes drafting effort. The notation prevents subjective 
          connotation and allows recording of the significant information on a 
          scale appropriate to the investigation. The information can be checked 
          and verified.</font><br>
          <br>

          in actual use on a boring log and on a section are presented as Figures

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CONCLUSION<br>
          The URCS furnishes a means by which persons from professional and technical 
          disciplines who have different experience levels can communicate in 
          a reliable and unambiguous manner about rock conditions.</font></p>
