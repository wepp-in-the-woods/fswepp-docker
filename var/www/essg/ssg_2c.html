        Hazard and risk zonation approaches vary in their degree of resolution 
        (accuracy), reproducibility (precision), and applicability to other areas, 
        as well as the type of information provided. The "empirical" approach 
        is based on local experience and emphasizes identification of unusual 
        ground conditions. Typically, the probability of failure is not quantified, 
        and potential failure sites may not be located unless a field-intensive 
        approach is used. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Soil mechanics approaches 
        to hazard zonation rely on stability analysis using universally applicable 
        deterministic or probabilistic equations. Probability and resolution are 
        quantified, and feedback from site investigations may be incorporated 
        into a data base. The effects of variable harvest prescriptions can be 
        estimated without local experience. This approach may require supplemental 
        detailed site investigations to locate potential failures more accurately 
        than for the above methods. A generalized and cross-referenced basin study

        The LISA computer program (Level I Stability Analysis Ver. 2.0 1991) is 
        a tool for estimating the relative stability of natural slopes or landforms. 
        LISA uses the infinite slope equation to compute the factor of safety 
        against failure for a given set of site conditions (input values). The 
        input values include ground slope, soil depth (depth to potential failure 
        surface), soil cohesion, friction angle, unit weight, ratio of ground 
        water to soil depth (Dw/D), root strength, and tree surcharge. For any 
        particular input value, a probability distribution is used to represent 
        natural variability and uncertainty in the value. LISA uses Monte Carlo 
        simulation to sample the probability distribution of each input value 
        and reports the probability of failure (PF#) as the percentage of factors 
        of safety less than or equal to 1 (Hammond et al., 1992). </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The two case histories 
        below illustrate different ways of using LISA and other more subjective 
        approaches to hazard mapping. Which is the most useful approach depends 
        on the size of the area to be assessed, the desired degree of resolution 
        of the potential failure site, the objective of the assessment, and whether 
        repeatable numerical results are desired and how they will be used. Common 
        objectives range from identifying areas needing more detailed analysis 
        (level II for roads or level I with more refined map units for harvest) 
        to estimating sediment production for cumulative effects analysis. </font> 
      </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> For sediment estimates 
        to support land use planning, it may be necessary to use soil survey units. 
        Forests having geologic resource and conditions maps (Reilly, 1989), such 
        as the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, may use geologic materials map 
        units (see <a href="#2C_Case_Gifford_Pinchot">Gifford Pinchot</a> case 
        history below). Useful map units for LISA analysis could be generated 
        by subdividing these units by slope classes using a digital elevation 
        model (DEM). For such large areas, geographic information system (GIS) 
        support is necessary. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> For assessments 
        of future land use proposals, increased resolution is desirable for transportation 
        planning or estimates of cumulative watershed effects. Map units can be 
        refined to improve LISA estimates. Results can be used to compare probabilities 
        among different areas and focus on data needed for level II. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Mapping directly 
        from aerial photos using a subjective approach may be desirable for large-scale 
        (5- to 50,000-acre), short timeframe projects, such as fire or forest 
        health salvage (as in the <a href="#2C_Case_Siskiyou">Siskiyou</a> case 
        history below). National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) needs will be 
        met and specialists will need to spend more time in the field, but there 
        will be less emphasis on collecting and storing site-condition data for 
        future use. </font> </p></td>

          The probability of mass failure and risk of delivery to a stream channel 
          was mapped on aerial photographs into relative classes of high, moderate, 
          and low. The subjective mapping considered the following factors: ground 
          slope, slope shape, proximity to stream channels, lithology, structure, 
          existing landslides, landslide types, and location of failure prone 
          facilities (such as sidecast or stacked roads). </font> 
        <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In the same 4,700-acre 
          area, LISA was used to estimate the factor of safety for landforms mapped 
          as bench, footslope, inner gorge, draw, or gulch (definitions modified 
          from 1986 National Soils Handbook Glossary of Landform and Geologic 
          Terms). Input values and their distributions were estimated from ground 
          reconnaissance and correlations between areas of similar rock/soil type 
          and geomorphology. The intensity of ground reconnaissance was low; approximately 
          3 miles per square mile were traversed. Because LISA input values and 
          distributions are determined on a spatial basis, PF# can be interpreted 
          as the percentage area of the landform expected to be unstable. </font> 
        <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Results:</b> 
          Because the subjective mapping included the risk of sediment delivery 
          to a stream as well as the stability of landforms, it was expected that 
          the two methods might produce different results. However, the table

<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Discussion:</b> 
          The degree of resolution varies between the two approaches used above. 
          The subjective map identifies sites within the LISA landforms which 
          have lower factors of safety. For example, convergent (valley) and divergent 
          (peak) slopes within the "steep" footslope landform are separated in 
          the subjective mapping. For use with LISA, map units could be subdivided 
          to a resolution approaching the subjective map. This approach would 
          be useful where alternative road locations will be analyzed using level 
          II or where alternative silvicultural methods or unit locations could 
          be addressed using LISA. </font> </p>
        <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> When existing 
          map units must be refined to improve resolution, LISA involves considerably 
          more time than subjective mapping. As the user gains knowledge of soil 
          mechanics, smaller areas can be targeted for analysis. LISA is expected 
          to become more efficient as geotechnical soils data bases and GIS map 
          layers are developed. Delineation of high resolution map units is the 
          time-limiting factor in the analysis described above. If DEM's could 
          be used to map landforms into concave, planar, and convex elements, 
          as well as to assign drainage area and slope distribution, some parameters 
          could be automated. The benefits of this GIS approach will be limited 
          by the resolution of available DEM's. The dangers of automation are 
          clear; no analysis can replace air photo and field verification. </font></p>

        resolution to assess effects of proposed specific harvest units. This 
        project tested the results of LISA using various intensities of ground 
        reconnaissance. The LISA probability of failure number (PF#) was compared

        The rankings of the map units based on PF# corresponded with numbers of 
        natural and harvest-related failures. The correlation between PF# and 
        percentage of land in failure depended on the intensity of ground reconnaissance 
        and the ground water method used. Sources of error were in slope estimates 
        from the map base and the minimum root cohesion value after harvest (not 
        yet achieved in recently harvested units). Method 1 gave PF#'s that were 
        too high, but they were improved by using method 2. Method 3 over-predicted 
        the percentage of land in failure on the harvest unit, but this was explained 
        as an error in the estimate of the area subject to the peak Dw/D. </font></blockquote>
      <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Discussion:</b> 
        Ground reconnaissance is necessary to achieve the desired resolution for 
        evaluating stability of proposed harvest units. Field verification of 
        input values and location of land in failure for back-calculation of ground 
        water values improves the accuracy of the LISA PF#. </font> </blockquote>
      <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Where rotational 
        failures are present, LISA may be used if input variables are selected 
        for the center of gravity (Ristau, 1988). Hammond et al. (1992) found 
        that LISA may overestimate factors of safety where soils are less than 
        2 feet deep. The soil-ground water interactions controlling slope failure, 
        surface erosion, and piping processes may not be well understood under 
        these conditions. </font></blockquote>
