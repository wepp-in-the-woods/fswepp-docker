    <td valign="top"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There 
      are two categories of water with which we will be concerned: surface water 
      and ground water. Concentrations of surface water, seeps, springs, and vegetation 
      changes indicate topographic changes that can provide critical clues about 
      what may be happening with the ground water. <br>
      <br>
      Water plays a very important role in the cause and mitigation of most landslides. 
      It is important to learn as much as possible about surface water and ground 
      water because changes in ground water levels and pore water pressures alter 
      effective normal stress and, as a result, modify shear strength. <br>
      <br>
      It is therefore critical that the source of ground water, changes in ground 
      water levels, and the relationships among surface water, ground water, and 
      the local geology be understood if landslide activity is to be managed.

      6C.2 Surface Drainage </font> </td>
    <td valign="top"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The 
      first step in understanding surface drainage is to obtain an accurate map 
      that depicts topography, geographic features, permanent and intermittent 
      watercourses, seeps, and ponds (see sections <a href="ssg_3ap5.html">3</a> 
      and 4 on field-developed cross-sections). Landslide magnitude and activity 
      can sometimes be inferred by changes in drainage courses, blocked drainages, 
      the deepness of incised runoff channels, and the location of seeps and springs. 
      Thus, some type of record reporting the location of the hydrologic features 
      and any changes should be started. Observations of surface runoff are best 
      collected during periods of high rainfall. <br>
      <br>
      Both natural and constructed changes to the affected areas must be taken 
      into account. Construction and landslide activities may alter surface water 
      courses, change ground water conditions, and activate otherwise stable areas. 
      Evidence of previous locations of channels should be noted. <br>
      <br>
      Maps of seeps and springs (caused by the intersection of an aquifer with 
      the ground surface) and identification of the associated aquifers can be 
      correlated to subsurface information and help establish the geologic map 
      for the site. Changes in the flows of seeps or springs may be indicators 
      that can be correlated to slide activity. Generally, if free flow is continued 
      and is adequate to handle peak flow, the aquifer acts as a natural drain, 
      and pore pressure cannot build up. However, if the volume of water exceeds 
      the capacity of the aquifer, the pore pressure may increase to the point 
      that a land mass becomes unstable. <br>
      <br>
      A very important consideration in the design and construction of any repair 
      work associated with a slope stability problem is that the surface water 
      and any collected ground water should be carried away from the unstable 
      or potentially unstable slopes. <br>
      <br>
      It is almost always less costly to deal with the collection and control 
      of surface water than of ground water. Some methods of dealing with surface 
      water are: 
      <ul>
        <li> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Installing surface 
          channels and trenches that redirect or intercept surface flows. </font> 
        </li>
        <li> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Sealing the exposed 
          surface cracks and other locations where the surface water gains access 
          to subsurface aquifers. </font> </li>
        <li> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Reshaping the 
          surface topography of a slide. This can eliminate ponding and seal unseen 
          cracks. Care must be taken to ensure that the distribution of soil loads 
          does not decrease any resisting forces or increase any driving forces. 
          Reshaping an area may seal natural seepage, or it may redirect seepage 
          paths and cause new problems. </font> </li>
      </ul>
      Such radical methods as sealing the entire surface of a slide mass to prevent 
      infiltration are generally only reasonable in extreme situations and have 
      a very low success rate. </font> </td>

    <td valign="top"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> It is 
      generally agreed that ground water is the most important trigger for landslides. 
      Thus, one of the main goals of a subsurface investigation should be to locate 
      the aquifers and to install equipment to monitor ground water activity (see 
      <a href="ssg_3d.html">section 3D</a>). This equipment also can be used to 
      evaluate the success of the repair. The drillers and geologist must be aware 
      that locating the ground water is a main objective of the investigation. 
      Accurate information must be available in order to perform any stability 
      analysis and to design the control and possible changes to the ground water. 
      Once the surface and subsurface water have been adequately mapped and the 
      relationship between them determined, design alternatives can be developed 
      and evaluated for cost and practicality. <br>
      <br>
      There are inherent risks associated with subsurface drainage systems, due 
      primarily to the difficulty in determining ground water flow patterns and 
      locations and geology and soil types. The reader is referred to sections 
      <a href="ssg_3d.html">3D</a> and <a href="ssg_6d.html#6D.2">6D.2</a> for 
      investigation techniques that will aid in determining ground water location 
      and soil parameters. <br>
      <br>
      The success of a drainage system depends upon the decrease in pore pressure 
      on the critical failure surface (see <a href="ssg_4e.html">section 4E</a>). 
      Its rate of flow is not a reliable indicator of how successful the application 
      is; some subsurface systems drain very little water but are very successful 
      in stabilizing a failure. Flow rate is actually a function of soil type 
      and whether or not the water is confined. <br>
      <br>
      Two of the most common subsurface drain systems used to manage ground water 
      are cutoff trenches and horizontal drains. </font> </td>

      Cutoff trenches are ditches dug to intercept and drain ground water away 
      from areas of instability. The trenches usually consist of perforated pipe 
      with geotextile or drain rock and divert the intercepted water to daylight 
      at an acceptable location. Some typical cutoff trench systems are show in

    <td valign="top"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If a 
      critical aquifer is located within an excavatable distance of the ground 
      surface, then a cutoff trench can be a very good solution. The technique 
      and actual construction are not easy and can be very expensive, especially 
      if the trench is more than 10 feet deep; trenches greater than 10 to 15 
      feet deep become impractical to construct. If the water is perched on a 
      surface of relatively low permeability and the trench can be constructed 
      down to that level, then most of the ground water can be diverted from the 
      area of instability. If the perched aquifer handling the ground water is 
      very thick or deep, then a cutoff trench may divert only a portion of the 
      aquifer water. However, if enough water is collected, then the slope still 
      may be stabilized. <br>
      <br>
      The cutoff trench design includes three elements: the separation layer, 
      the trench geometry, and pipe size and slope. 
      <ul>
        <li> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i>Separation 
          Layer.</i> The function of the separation layer is to keep soil fines 
          from clogging the drain system and reducing or eliminating the capacity 
          to carry away intercepted water. At the same time, the separation layer 
          must have adequate hydraulic capacity itself to allow the ground water 
          to enter the drain freely. <br>
          <br>
          The most economical and simple separation materials used today are geotextiles. 
          The equivalent opening size (EOS) of a geotextile to provide adequate 
          separation must be specified. The reader is referred to Christopher 
          and Holtz (1984) for information about estimating the necessary EOS. 
          For required flow characteristics, which should be at least as great 
          as the soil surrounding the cutoff trench, the permeability of the geotextile 
          must be specified. The designer also should consider the puncture strength 
          characteristics of the geotextile in order to ensure minimal damage 
          during installation. <br>
          <br>
          </font> </li>
        <li> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i>Trench Geometry.</i> 
          The trench must extend to the minimum depth that will ensure desired 
          ground water interception. In cases where the trench does not terminate 
          in a low permeability layer, the response of the ground water on the 
          downstream side of the trench must be estimated, and the trench depth 
          must be adjusted as necessary. Trench length should allow for uncertainty 
          in the geometry of the unstable or unsuitable geology. <br>
          <br>
          </font> </li>
        <li> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i>Pipe Geometry.</i> 
          Most trenches will be drained using either a perforated pipe at the 
          bottom of the trench or a composite vertical drain system. In either 
          case, the hydraulic capacity of the pipe or composite drain must be 
          at least as large as the calculated ground water recharge capacity for 
          the area of interception. Section <a href="ssg_6d.html#6D.3">6D.3</a> 
          outlines how to determine ground water recharge capacity and discusses 
          pipe hydraulic capacity. We recommend that the pipe be sized for a greater 
          capacity than is estimated from ground water recharge calculations. 
          The amount of additional design capacity depends on the probability 
          and consequence of drain failure, such as separation layer failure (clogging 
          the system) or ground movement (reducing cross-sectional area of the 
          drain). </font> </li>

        including the background, survey data, investigation, testing, and exploration

        XSTABL (XSTABL v. 4.102 1992). </font></p>

        slide-12-18 feet deep, 500-600 feet long, and 150-200 feet wide-is located 
        on a south-facing slope. Approximately 180-200 feet of roadway is affected 
        by this failure. However, the failure itself extends 300-400 feet above 
        and below the road (see Figure <a href="#Fig_6C.2">6C.2</a>). Movement 
        of the area occurred yearly at varying rates depending upon the amount 
        of precipitation. Many trees within the slide area had fallen over as 
        a result of the slide. Several springs appeared above and below the road 
        during the high precipitation season. In general, the ground water within 
        the slide was very high during the winter and spring months. During years 
        of extreme slide activity, road use was restricted due to vertical and 
        horizontal displacements that occurred across the road prism.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Background</u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first report concerning 
        this area is dated 1980, when it was reported that the road had been closed 
        due to displacements of as great as 6 feet. Several inconclusive investigations 
        were conducted between 1980 and 1986. These consisted of seismic work, 
        core drilling, and test pits. The road was realigned in 1983 approximately 
        15-20 feet uphill, but that winter the slide activity, which had been 
        only below the road, progressed above the road and took the present configuration 
        shown in figure <a href="#Fig_6C.2">6C.2</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Field Investigation</u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An additional subsurface 
        investigation of the site was made in October 1986 using 8-inch hollow-flight 
        augers. That investigation had several objectives: to characterize the 
        subsurface geology; to install water monitoring pipes to allow observation 
        of the fluctuations in ground water; and to monitor the movement of the 
        slide and determine the depth of the slip surface. Three drill holes were 
        located along the central axis of the slide (see figures <a href="#Fig_6C.2">6C.2</a> 
        and <a href="#Fig_6C.3">6C.3</a>). Evidence of sliding and movement was 
        found just above the refusal layer (a layer of mudstone) in each hole; 
        see the drill logs (figure <a href="#Fig_6C.4">6C.4</a>) and the test

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Using field-generated 
        cross-sections (figure <a href="#Fig_6C.3">6C.3</a>), several ground water 
        conditions and various soil parameters were analyzed to determine the 
        factors of safety for each situation. A parametric analysis was performed 
        to estimate values of the shear strength and cohesion of the soil and 
        to confirm the ground water conditions that caused failure. These soil 
        parameter values were then used in analyzing conditions prior to failure 
        (figures <a href="#Fig_6C.7">6C.7</a> and <a href="#Fig_6C.8">6C.8</a>).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The goal was to stabilize 
        the road. It was anticipated that by installing one trench drain above 
        the road and a second at the inside edge of the road, most of the water 
        that was causing the instability in this localized area could be diverted 
        (see the XSTABL analysis in figure <a href="#Fig_6C.9">6C.9</a>). The 
        construction of the trenches to intercept the mudstone also would allow 
        the backfill material to act as a shear key (see <a href="ssg_6g.html">section 
        6G</a>). Note that at some distance below the downhill drainage trench 
        the slope could still be unstable because the undiverted ground water 
        could presumably rise to a critical level and cause the failure to become 
        active once again. </font> </p></td>

      Figure <a href="#Fig_6C.9">6C.9</a> shows the same slope with the trenches

    <td valign="top" colspan="4" height="98" width="478"> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Horizontal 
        drains are also used extensively to drain ground water from unstable or 
        potentially unstable areas. On many landslides the ground water either 
        does not conform to an easily mapped or linear surface, or it is located 
        at such a depth that draining it with surface trenches is impractical. 
        The use of horizontal drains may solve such problems.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Horizontal drains 
        consist of a system of slotted or perforated pipes installed horizontally, 
        or nearly horizontally, into a slope (see figure <a href="#Fig_6C.11">6C.11</a>). 
        They work by intercepting ground water and reducing pore pressures in 
        zones of instability. Installation requires a slope face from which the 
        drains can be installed and can daylight. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Contracts for the 
        installation of horizontal drains usually provide that the exact location 
        of the drains depends upon information gained during the placement of 
        the drains. This may reduce some of the initial investigation costs. Costs 
        for installing horizontal drains are generally less than for other subsurface 
        drainage methods.</font></p>
