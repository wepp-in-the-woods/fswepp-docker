        <a href="ssg_6toc.html">6</a> discusses methods of stabilizing a slope 
        against mass failure. The focus is on techniques to prevent or correct 
        mass wasting (landsliding), which can be analyzed by methods discussed 
        in section <a href="ssg_5toc.html">5</a>, and not surface erosion. Although 
        biostabilization with vegetation can be thought of as preventing shallow 
        mass erosion, here it is considered to be a technique for the prevention 
        of surface erosion. Section <a href="ssg_6f.html">6F</a> contains a discussion 
        of biostabilization in conjunction with reinforced fill slopes to aid 
        in stabilization of the over-steepened slope, but the reader is referred 
        to the cited references for more complete coverage of this technique. 
        The purpose of this section is to point out the basic steps of stabilization 
        analysis and to discuss several stabilization techniques commonly applied 
        to slope failures on Forest Service roads. Figure <a href="javascript:popupfig('images/6a/6a_f01.gif','Figure 6A.1 - Section 6 is concerned with level III analysis within the three-level system')">6A.1</a>

        to the solution of any problem is the definition of what that problem 
        really is. In this case, the selection of the appropriate slope stabilization 
        technique must be preceded by an adequate determination of the site conditions 
        likely to cause instability. The techniques covered in section <a href="ssg_3toc.html">3</a> 
        for preparing a detailed field-developed cross-section on which to develop 
        a hypothesis of subsurface conditions, and subsequent subsurface investigation 
        to verify those conditions, are essential prerequisites of the stabilization 
        analysis. Following the site investigation, a thorough stability analysis 
        of the <em>unstabilized</em> slope is necessary to identify the extent 
        of the stability problem and to provide a <em>standard of comparison</em> 
        for all possible stabilization alternatives. All levels of stability analysis 
        discussed in section <a href="ssg_5toc.html">5</a> and demonstrated in 
        the sample problem in section <a href="ssg_5g.html">5G</a> may be useful 
        in this unstabilized slope analysis for back-calculation analysis and 
        parametric value evaluation.</font></p></td>

        evaluation of the results of the unstabilized slope analysis and the existing 
        site conditions will usually indicate the most practical stabilization 
        efforts. This may appear to be fundamental logic, but this initial scoping 
        of all possible stabilization techniques can save analysis and design 
        time and perhaps prevent oversight of the obvious; as Wooten's Third Law 
        states, "The acquisition of uncommon knowledge inhibits the application 
        of common sense" (Wooten, 1971). Some examples: if ground water appears 
        to be the dominant cause of instability, then a drainage system should 
        be the most effective stabilization measure; if the unstable slope is 
        already excessively steep, then a reinforced fill or retaining wall should 
        function better than a rock buttress; if a minor realignment of the road 
        location can avoid the problem completely, then maybe that is the best 
        alternative. The point is that all possible stabilization techniques should 
        be identified, based on the unstabilized slope stability analysis, <em>before</em> 
        selecting alternatives to evaluate.</font></p></td>

      Analysis of Stabilization Alternatives</font></b></font> </td>
    <td valign="top" colspan="2" ><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once 
      the stabilization alternatives applicable to the site conditions are identified, 
      a stability analysis of each is necessary to determine the extent, dimensions, 
      etc., of that technique required to bring the unstabilized slope to an acceptable 
      level of stability. What is an acceptable level of stability? A probabilistic 
      method in a risk analysis format -- the preferred method -- considers the 
      probability of the stabilization measure failing, the cost of construction 
      of the measure, and the consequences of failure, objectively comparing possible 
      alternatives. Section 6I introduces risk analysis for the selection of stabilization 
      alternatives. However, the current state of the art is based on deterministic 
      slope stability analysis. This methodology develops alternatives which have 
      reasonably secure safety factors against failure and then compares them 
      subjectively on the basis of construction cost, potential for failure, expected 
      life span, consequences of failure, maintenance cost, and aesthetics. In 
      this deterministic context, selection of the design factor of safety determines 
      the acceptable level of stability. Vandre (1980) gives the following perspective 
      on the design factor of safety (FOS): </font> </td>

    <td valign="top" width="415"> <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
        are techniques available to the designer that reduce uncertainty and increase 
        confidence; these include better definition of the site conditions and 
        failure model through site investigation, ground water monitoring, laboratory 
        testing, and back-calculation analysis. These techniques tend to reduce 
        large errors in Vandre's components (2), (3), and (4). This leaves components 
        (1), (5), and (6) with some degree of uncertainty, which is inevitable 
        in the selection of the design FOS. Even with the most intensive investigation 
        and lab testing program, and using the most sophisticated methods of back-calculation 
        analysis, to define the conditions where the FOS equals 1.00 for the unstabilized 
        failure model, most experienced engineers would not be comfortable with 
        a design FOS = 1.00 for the stabilization alternative. This discomfort 
        is the result of lingering uncertainty in components (3), (4), and (5); 
        the concern for the consequences in component (1); and, often, the lack 
        of historical precedence (experience) in component (6).</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ideally, a universally 
        applicable and accepted design FOS -- such as 1.25, 1.50, or 3.00 -- could 
        be used as a minimum safe level to account for all of these uncertainties 
        and variations. In reality, no design FOS can substitute for an adequate 
        site investigation, parameter evaluation, or problem definition program. 
        It can only provide for an additional margin of error. Sections <a href="ssg_5a.html#5A.12">5A.12</a> 
        through <a href="ssg_5a.html#5A.14">5A.14</a> contain a discussion of 
        the manner in which stability in terms of FOS can be perceived differently 
        in deterministic and probabilistic analyses. As applied to this section, 
        the experienced deterministic analyst will compensate for this uncertainty 
        and natural variability in the evaluation of the unstabilized slope to 
        arrive at the <em>standard of comparison</em> for the stabilization measures. 
        This must be factored into the selection of the design FOS to avoid the 
        danger of compounding conservatism. The experienced practitioner will 
        not use a fixed design FOS (e.g., 1.25 or 1.50), largely because of the 
        additional cost which might be necessary to reach that number but which 
        might not be justified in the overall consideration of the components 
        stated above. In the sample problems of sections 6C through 6H you will 
        note the range of design FOS which these experienced practitioners have 
        determined to be "safe" for their particular problems. Even for the same 
        site conditions, different design FOS's may be deemed necessary for different 
        stabilization alternatives as a result of how components (3), (5), or 
        (6) relate to that specific alternative.</font></p></td>

      There are many answers to this question when all of the components are considered

      concerns what the experienced practitioner perceives to be a "safe" design 
      FOS for a given situation when he or she is completing the design, compared

      good example of this is a liability suit in which the agency is sued for 
      death or injuries resulting from a landslide or slope failure on a Forest 
      Service road. The design engineer designs a fill slope to be "stable" for 
      traffic in the traveled way but accidents still occur as a result of travel 
      on the extreme shoulder (outside 2 to 3 feet). The design and construction 
      engineers are aware that the extreme edge of a fill slope cannot be adequately 
      compacted. They allow "fill widening" to account for this with the assumption 
      that the prudent driver will travel only within the traveled way. This assumption 
      has cost the agency several million dollars in more than one lawsuit. In 
      the litigation arena, when a vehicle's wheel sinks into the soft shoulder 
      and the vehicle goes off of the fill slope as a result, it is a "slope failure."
