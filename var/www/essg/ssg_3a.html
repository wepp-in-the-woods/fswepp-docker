    <td valign="top" colspan="4" height="349" width="452"> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
        section describes how a geotechnical specialist can organize a project, 
        using the scientific method, to study a slope stability problem. The following 
        parts of this section contain the actual tools and methods (i.e., classifications, 
        surface and subsurface investigations, and monitoring). The process consists 
        of the specialist defining the problem of interest (what is requested 
        to be done), constructing a methodology to solve the problem (how to get 
        the requested product), the serial order of steps in the methodology (timeframe 
        and people involved), and costs to get the project done. Intrinsic to 
        this is the need to calculate whether it is worth the time and money to 
        carry out the work (e.g., an estimated monetary value analysis as described 
        in section <a href="ssg_6toc.html">6</a>). Sometimes land managers do 
        not understand the effort involved in getting a product completed for 
        them. If they know the costs in advance, it will save you the problems 
        inherent in unfulfilled low-cost expectations. </font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In graduate school this 
      project setup is called a thesis proposal, but, because we are not part 
      of academe, we use other names for it. In the Pacific Northwest Region, 
      and in the private sector, many of the geotechnical specialists call it 
      a job prescription. Regardless of what it is called, it is the blueprint 
      for project work, usually including purpose and scope, methodology and analysis, 
      scheduling, report format, and funding. We will describe these parts individually.

      Purpose and Scope</strong></font> </td>
    <td valign="top" colspan="4" width="452"> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within 
        the scientific method framework, the purpose and scope section of the 
        job prescription is the postulate you will be examining. In this section 
        you will describe the problem to be examined and what is being requested, 
        the location and areal size of the project, and the scale of the field 
        data collection. Because you are interpreting the customer's request, 
        this is the most critical part of the job prescription; therefore, communication 
        has to be successful. Frequently, what the customer needs is unclear, 
        and you will need to ask for a clarification. For example, a timber planner 
        will ask for a slope stability analysis within a particular portion of 
        the proposed timber sale area. Is this to be a site-specific investigation 
        or a basin-wide stochastic investigation? In this example it is probably 
        a basin-wide stochastic investigation, although the planner asked for 
        a stability analysis in only a few hundred acres of the planning block. 
        If that is the case, then a level I stability analysis is the appropriate 
        tool, but with inadequate communication you could have completed a level 
        III analysis instead. Make sure you understand what the postulate is and 
        what the customer needs. This is the time to reach agreement on what the 
        customer needs, and how you will meet those needs.</font></p></td>

      Methodology and Analysis</font></b></font></td>
    <td valign="top" colspan="4" width="452"> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        next logical step in the scientific method-and for the project prescription-is 
        to test your postulate. How are you going to approach the project and 
        what type of data do you think you will be gathering? Are the data collected 
        at one scale or several scales? What types of parameters will you be collecting 
        data for and how will you analyze them? To complete the project successfully, 
        you must lay out the system and method to be used. You can still change 
        your methodology as you progress with the project, but you need to know 
        your starting "pathway," otherwise you will collect a plethora of data 
        with no rhyme nor reason. Data should be analyzed preliminarily as they 
        are received in order to check that they answer the questions for which 
        they are being collected. For example, at the outset of drilling, we develop 
        a plan for the location of the drill holes. Many times after a few holes 
        have been drilled, new questions arise. If the top of the bedrock dips 
        steeply across the width of a landslide, then it may be beneficial to 
        concentrate drilling on the side with the deeper soil. Finding a significant 
        aquifer in an early drill hole may expose the need to better define that 
        aquifer, rather than to continue drilling according to the original plan.</font></p></td>

    <td valign="top" colspan="4" width="452"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What 
      type of document does the customer need? Sometimes all that is needed is 
      a two- or three-page trip report. At other times, the customer may ask for 
      a full geotechnical report. All reports should have purpose and scope, methodology 
      and analysis, discussion of findings, conclusions and recommendations, and 
      references sections, with appendixes included as appropriate. Remember, 
      the purpose of the paper trail is to allow you or others to go back later 
      and see what was requested and what was done. The report should be thorough, 
      professional, and have a letterhead or cover sheet. A superior report is 
      well worth the effort.</font></td>

      customer will be very interested in this section of the job prescription, 
      especially if you are using his or her funds. You probably will not be able 
      to estimate the exact dollar amount because of changes in how the work gets 
      done, but you should be able to get within 5 to 10 percent of the actual 
      costs.</font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Who 
        should get a copy of the job prescription? Your supervisor and the customer 
        are clearly due a copy. You should also keep a copy in a field file and 
        an office project file. The field crew may also need copies if you are 
        not going to be on the site every day. Before you distribute copies, however, 
        you may want to review a draft copy with the customer to clarify details 
        and make any required changes.</font></p>
