    <td valign="top" colspan="4"> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        relative density probe is a simple exploratory device used to determine 
        the distribution and estimated strength of the subsurface soil units and 
        decomposed rock units. The drive probe can also be used to determine the 
        presence of water and subsurface water levels. It requires some equipment 
        and moderate work effort, but it does define strength parameters of the 
        soil units. Once set up, it is much quicker than hand augering but does 
        not provide a sample to determine plasticity. One or more auger holes 
        can be used to classify the subsurface materials, and the drive probe 
        can be used to define the subsurface for the rest of the project area.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The equipment is relatively 
        inexpensive (less than $500) and can be either specified and ordered or 
        fabricated in-house. The drive probe is most effective when used in conjunction 
        with conventional geotechnical soil exploration to inexpensively extend 
        the known conditions revealed by conventional drilling. The drive probe 
        can also be used alone and has been found to be accurate and discrete 
        in defining subsurface conditions for difficult access projects. It has 
        been proven through geotechnical work over a period of more than 4 years.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Relative density" 
        in this document is defined as the estimated strength of subsurface materials 
        determined by the resistance to penetration. The resistance to penetration 
        is measured in blows-per-foot of an 11-pound circular hammer, freely falling 
        "39 inches," striking a coupling, and driving a 1-inch diameter solid 
        end area. Note the "39 inches" is the distance between couplings on a 
        4-foot pipe length minus the length of the hammer.</font></p></td>

    <td valign="top" colspan="4"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
      equipment for the drive probe consists of segments of 1/2-inch galvanized 
      pipe (3/4-inch outside diameter), cut into 4- and 5-foot lengths and threaded 
      on each end. Commercially, 1/2-inch galvanized pipe comes in 21-foot lengths, 
      so the pipe is cut into one 5-foot length and four 4-foot lengths to eliminate 
      waste. Smooth-walled pipe couplings with full threads (1-inch outside diameter) 
      are used to join the pipes together as the hole is advanced. The 5-foot 
      length is used for the initial drive. The starting 5-foot length is randomly 
      drilled with 3/16-inch diameter holes to allow water to enter the pipe as 
      it is driven into the ground. The driving end of the pipe is a coupling 
      with a pipe plug in it. </font> <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
        is critical to the operation that the threads on the ends of the pipe 
        are no longer than those which will "meet" in the center of the full-thread 
        couplings when two pipes are joined. This allows the driving force to 
        be transmitted through the pipe ends and not through the threads. The 
        pipe lengths can be made up in advance with a coupling on one end, ready 
        for adding to the drive string.</font></p>
      <div align="center"> 
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An 
          11-pound, circular, mild steel hammer is used. The total hammer length 
          is7-3/4 inches, including the guards. The driving section is 7 inches 
          long (minus the guards) and 2-1/2 inches in diameter. The driving section 
          has a hole in the center that is 7/8 inch in diameter through which 
          the pipe will pass freely. Welded on each end of the driving section 
          are round hand guards. The hand guards are 4 inches in diameter and 
          made from 3/8-inch-thick mild steel plate.</font></p>
      </div>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 1/2-inch pipe die 
        and die stock, a pipe cutter, a pipe reamer, a pipe vise, and a 1/2-inch 
        "easyout" for removal of broken pipe threads from couplings are convenient 
        and economic in-house equipment. A supply of smooth-walled, full thread 
        pipe couplings should be kept on hand.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A drive probe is designed 
        for a one- or two-man operation for either technical or non-technical 
        personnel. Depths of up to 30 feet have been achieved without unusual 
        effort. When "refusal" is reached with "free-falling method," the hole 
        can be continued by "hand-driving" methods to "absolute refusal." </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A small portable tripod 
        is useful if extensive drive probe drilling is done. The tripod can be 
        made from three 10-foot lengths of 1-inch diameter electrical conduit 
        joined at one end by a 1/2-inch diameter bolt. A convenient sheave suitable 
        for use with a 3/4-inch diameter rope is attached to the bolt at the top 
        of the tripod. The hammer can then be raised and lowered by attaching 
        the rope to the hammer and pulling on the rope. A loop can be tied in 
        the rope, and a foot can be used to raise and lower the hammer. This method 
        is especially useful when "pulling a string." Gloves are a must when driving 
        by hand or using a rope. See <a href="#Fig_3.6.1">figure 3.6.1</a>. for 
        a schematic of a drive probe.</font></p></td>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          site selected for the probe is cleared of the surface duff or organic 
          material to expose the upper surface of the soil deposit. The starting 
          5-foot length is measured and marked in 0.5-foot intervals with the 
          keel or marking pencil. The 4-foot length with the hammer on it is screwed 
          into the top of the 5-foot length. The hammer is then raised up to the 
          coupling on the upper end of the 4-foot length and allowed to fall freely 
          and strike the coupling on the upper end of the 5-foot length. A coupling 
          should always be screwed into the top of the 4-foot length to prevent 
          the hammer from flying off the top of the pipe when raising the hammer.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
          each segment is driven, the number of blows required to advance the 
          hole for each one-half foot (6 inches) is recorded. After driving 5 
          feet, the amount of open hole is measured and the hole checked for the 
          presence of water. The 4-foot pipe segment is unscrewed and the hammer 
          is moved to the uppermost pipe as each additional 4-foot segment is 
          added to the "string." The bottom pipe segment is marked each time. 
          The hole is then advanced another 4 feet. The open hole and water level 
          is again checked, and so on, until "refusal." </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          friction of the pipe in the hole is primarily between the couplings 
          and the sides of the hole, rather than all of the pipe in the hole. 
          This causes easier advance of the hole than if all of the pipe were 
          in contact. It is recognized that the friction increases slightly with 
          each additional coupling in the hole, but with this type of operation 
          it is negligible. In granular soil materials, all of the pipe is probably 
          in contact with the sides of the hole.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          pipe lengths can be removed from the hole for inspection of thread conditions, 
          for cleaning and removal of soil material in the pipe, or for recovery 
          of the pipe for further use. The hammer is driven "upward," striking 
          the coupling on the top of the uppermost pipe. Repeated blows remove 
          whatever length is desired. It may be convenient to have a 2-foot segment 
          for pipe removal for a more convenient driving length. Shorter people 
          may have to stand on the bucket when starting the hole or when removing 
          pipe from the hole. The pipes can either be retrieved or left in the 
          hole for later water measurements. </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
          doing drive probe exploration, the blows needed to advance the hole 
          for the 0.5-foot (6-inch) interval are doubled to get the "blows-per-foot" 
          representing the strength of the material for that interval. Six inches 
          are driven in order to be sure of detecting a layer 1-foot or more in 
          thickness. The longer the interval driven, the less likely that "thin" 
          layers will be detected. Any depth interval can be driven and converted 
          to "blows-per-foot" for that interval. In all cases, whatever interval 
          is advanced, the blows-per-interval are converted to blows-per-foot, 
          the "standard of comparison" for that given material. The blows-per-foot 
          have been found to be a discrete and reliable means of correlating between 
          drive probe holes.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
          a hole is drilled into a soil deposit by means of geotechnical driving 
          methods, there is a "typical anticipated result." This anticipated result 
          is that the number of blows necessary to advance the hole will increase 
          with depth to a point at which the hole cannot be advanced. In other 
          words, soil deposits normally increase in strength and density with 
          depth. When doing drive probe drilling, the result that is of most importance 
          to a subsurface strength assessment is the detection of a relatively 
          weaker layer revealed by a "blow-count-reversal." A "blow-count-reversal" 
          occurs when the blows-per-foot decrease with depth rather than increase. 
          This condition indicates the strength and density of the soil material 
          in that interval has decreased. It is this "blow-count-reversal" that 
          is of prime significance in assessing foundation conditions or slope 
          stability.</font></p>

        probe drilling allows static water levels to be measured and simple permeability 
        tests to be done. When water levels, measured in the pipe during and after 
        driving, appear inconsistent with previous measurements, water can be 
        added to the pipe to clean out the holes in the tip. The depth to water 
        can be checked in the pipe after a period of time to see if there is a 
        change in water level. Water can be added to the holes already in the 
        ground, at any time, to check on the reliability of the previously measured 
        static water levels.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
        appears to be a "natural sealing" between the pipe and the plastic soil 
        materials preventing water movement up along the pipe. Metered water flows 
        can be added to the pipe to do maintained head tests. Falling-head tests 
        can be done by timing the drop in water level. From these data the permeability

        can be directly added to the pipe with the 5 gallon bucket or by means 
        of a back pack tank. The hydraulic head of the water in the pipe will 
        usually clear the holes in the tip. When adding water with a bucket, a 
        "screw-on" type funnel is convenient but any funnel will do. If a back 
        pack tank is used, a 1/4 inch plastic tube attached to the tank is inserted 
        in the pipe to the bottom of the pipe. The tube is then moved up and down 
        to flush out any soil material filling the holes in the tip. </font></p></td>
