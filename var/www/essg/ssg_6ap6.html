        drain systems for use on low-volume roads. The laboratory testing program 
        was designed to determine the flow capacity of various manufactured systems 
        when subjected to varying lateral loads and hydraulic gradients. Because 
        no standard tests were available to evaluate geocomposite drain system 
        performance under field conditions, a test system consisting of a large

        specimens were placed vertically in a 6- by 12-inch mold, which was then 
        filled with a compacted silty soil. Changes in flow rates through the

        test results.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Proper drainage systems 
        have long been recognized as the key to successful road performance. In 
        the past. the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service has 
        predominantly used aggregate drains (graded filter aggregate or coarse-graded 
        aggregate completely enclosed in a geotextile). However, the use of aggregate 
        drains on low-volume roads in remote areas or in difficult terrain has 
        several drawbacks, including long aggregate hauls, the need for large 
        storage areas, the difficulty of coordinating fill or retaining wall placement 
        and drain installation, cumbersome construction, and labor-intensive installation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The development of 
        prefabricated or geocomposite drain systems in the early 1980s offered 
        the potential for high flow transmitting capabilities, easy installation, 
        and low costs. The Forest Service initiated a study to evaluate these 
        products for use on various road projects. The study included both laboratory 
        testing and evaluation of field installations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>GEOCOMPOSITE DRAIN 
        SYSTEMS </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Geocomposite drain 
        systems, originally called tin drains or prefabricated drain systems. 
        consist of a geotextile covering one or both sides of a core material. 
        The geotextile permits water to pass through while retaining the soil, 
        and the core transmits the water to the drain outlet. There are currently 
        at least 15 manufacturers making more than 40 geocomposite drain systems. 
        The primary differences in the products are the cores, which can vary 
        from a dimpled polystyrene or polyethylene sheet to a nylon wire mesh 
        to a polyethylene net. and the geotextile covering, which can he woven 
        or non. woven.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>TEST PROGRAM </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A test program was 
        developed to determine the flow capacity of the geocomposite drain systems 
        when subjected to varying lateral loads. A preliminary examination indicated 
        two potential factors that could greatly reduce flow capacity: (a) elongation 
        of the geotextile into the core flow channels as a result of the soil 
        pressures. and (b) compression or deformation of the core material by 
        the lateral loads. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>LABORATORY TESTING 
        </b> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Laboratory testing 
        involved measuring flow through geocomposite drain systems by conducting 
        constant head permeability tests with a 6- by 12-in, sample of the drain 
        system placed vertically in a silty soil. The soil (AASHTO A-4) was compacted 
        to a dry density of 85 lb/ft3 (85 percent of maximum density as determined 
        by AASHTO T99) around the sample in a 6-in.-diameter by 12-in.-high mold. 
        The soil/geocomposite test specimen was then covered with a latex membrane 
        and placed in a 12-in.-diameter by 40-in.-high triaxtal chamber. The test 
        system shown in Figure 1 was built to allow water to flow into the geocomposite 
        sample at the bottom and out at the top under varying hydraulic gradients 
        (0.3. 1.0. and 2.0) and confining pressures (5. 10. 15, 20. 25. and 30 
        psi). The ends of the geocomposite sample were open to permit an unrestricted 
        flow of water. The type of soil used as selected to represent a worst-case 
        condition, whereas the gradients and pressures were selected to represent 
        typical field application conditions. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The test was performed 
        by measuring the flow rate for each sample at various combinations of 
        hydraulic gradients and confining pressures. maintaining the confining 
        pressure until the flow rate stabilized. This procedure was used to ensure 
        that the effects of soil, fabric, and core creep were included in the 
        results. The period required for this steady-state flow varied from a 
        few days to many weeks. A minimum of two complete tests was performed 
        on each product. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Graphs plotting the 
        steady-state flow rate versus the confining pressure for each of the tested 
        gradients were developed for each product. Graphs plotting flow rate versus 
        time for a given gradient and pressure were also produced. Samples of 
        these graphs are shown in Figures <a href="#Fig_2">2</a>-<a href="#Fig_5">5</a>. 
        Consolidated results for the tested products are shown in <a href="#Table_1">Table 
        1</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results of the 
        laboratory testing program show a wide range in performance among the 
        different geocomposite drainage systems. Some products (e.g.. Miradrain 
        and Con-tech) have rigid cores, and their flow rates showed only slight 
        decreases with increasing confining pressure. The decrease in flow (around 
        It) percent) is believed due to a reduction in the cross-sectional area 
        of the geocomposite drain system caused a combination of compression of 
        the core and elongation of the geotextile into the flow channels. Howev 
        er. when the crushing strength of the core was exceeded, the flow rate 
        dropped sharply. <a href="#Fig_2">Figure 2</a> shows a dramatic decrease 
        in flow for the ('ontech Stripdrain w hen the contining pressure w as 
        increased from 20 to 25 psi. <a href="#Fig_3">Figure 3</a> shows a similar 
        decrease in flow capacity for the Miradrain 4000 w hen the confining pressure 
        was maintained at 30 psi. Other geocomposite drain systems have compressible 
        cores. and flow rates for these products dropped markedly with increasing 
        confining pressure. The Enkadrain. with its compressible mesh core. was 
        especially susceptible (see <a href="#Fig_2">Figure 2</a>). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the confining 
        pressure was increased during the test. the flow rate usually stabilized 
        within a few days. However the slow crushing process of the Contech product 
        caused the flow rate to gradually decrease over a period of months (see 
        Figures <a href="#Fig_4">4</a> and Fig <a href="#Fig_5">5</a>). All other 
        products. including those whose core was crushed, had a minimum equilibrium 
        flow rate of about 1 gal/mm per foot of drain width when subjected to 
        a hydraulic gradient of 1.0 and a confining pressure of 30 psi. The Contech 
        product exceeded this value at a confining pressure of 25 psi.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>FIELD INSTALLATIONS</b> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In conjunction with 
        the laboratory testing. three field installations of geocomposite drain 
        systems were instrumented for future monitoring. These installations were 
        placed behind fills or retaining walls. Instrumentation consisted of piezometers 
        placed upslope and downslope of the drains. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two of the installations 
        were behind retaining walls on Stump Springs Road in the Sierra National 
        Forest in central Sierra Nevada. California. This road, which is underlain 
        by granitic bedrock, suffered extensive landslide damage in the spring 
        of 1982 and the spring of 1983. Geocomposite drain systems were installed 
        behind the Hilfiker welded wire retaining walls, which were constructed 
        to repair the landslide damage. The geocomposite drain system used was 
        the Eljen drain. which has a core similar to the Miradrain 4000. Construction 
        of the walls and drain systems was completed in 1984.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sites selected 
        for future monitoring were Site 11. which involved a retaining wall approximately 
        150 ft long and 21 ft high at its highest point, and Site 17, which required 
        a wall 100 ft long and 22.5 ft high. Installation of the drain system 
        proceeded without difficulty. The rolls of Eljen drain came in lengths 
        specified to fit the project conditions. As shown in <a href="#Fig_6">Figure 
        6</a>, the drains were pinned at the top and unrolled into the collection 
        trench at the base of the drain system. With the drain system in place. 
        the wall could be built easily. The completed wall at Site 17 is shown 
        in <a href="#Fig_7">Figure 7</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The monitoring equipment 
        consisted of hand-fabricated piezometer sensors installed in front of 
        and behind the drain system. The Omnidata Datapod Model DP212 was used 
        to scan the groundwater level detected by the sensors every 30 mi and 
        to record the average. high. and low readings every 24 hr. In addition. 
        Site 17 had a high-capacity tipping-bucket rain gauge to monitor the drain 
        system outflow. The outflow was recorded using an Enmos event recorder. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The instrumentation, 
        monitored over a 4-year period, showed that the drain systems did perform 
        as designed. As shown in Figure 8. the piezometers installed downslope 
        of the drain system showed little or no groundwater. whereas the piezometers 
        installed upslope of the drain showed fluctuating higher groundwater levels. 
        Monitoring at Site 17 also showed a direct correlation between groundwater 
        level behind the drain and outflow of the drain. The February 23. 1986. 
        storm shown in Figure 8 was one of the largest in the area in the past 
        10 years. proving that this system can accommodate transient as well as 
        steady-state groundwater conditions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The third site monitored 
        was on Mosquito Ridge Road in the Tahoe National Forest in northern Sierra 
        Nevada. California. The project involved replacing a 25-ft-high fill damaged 
        by storms in the spring of 1982. The site is underlain byslate bedrock. 
        The geocomposite drain system installed was a double layer of Enkadrain 
        912(0 placed along the bottom 6 ft of the fill. The two layers of Enkadrain. 
        which comes with a geotextile glued to one side. were placed such that 
        the geotextile side of one layer was in contact with the nongeotextile 
        side of the other layer. A laver of Mirati 7(KJX woven geotextile completed 
        this installation (see <a href="#Fig_9">Figure 9</a>). Once the drain 
        system was installed, construction of the fill proceeded without difficulty. 
        The project was completed in 1983 (see <a href="#Fig_10">Figure 10</a>). 
        Instrumentation to monitor the groundwater levels at this site consisted 
        of manually operated pneumatic piezometers. Monitoring of this site has 
        revealed very little flow from the drain outlet. and no pore pressure 
        buildup has been detected.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other field installations 
        of geocomposite drain systems without instrumentation involved systems 
        fabricated at the site. These drains, which consisted of two layers of 
        Tensar DN1 drainage net surrounded by a nonwoven geotextile were placed 
        behind geogrid-reinforced fills. These systems proved easy to fabricate 
        and install.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Subdrains were also 
        constructed along the edge of roads by trenching to a depth of up to 6 
        ft. installing the drain system (i.e.. the Eljen drain or the Miradrain 
        4000). and backfilling the trench. All systems constructed to date have 
        included perforated and nonperforated pipe networks to carry collected 
        water.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>CONCLUSIONS </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the basis of results 
        of the Laboratory work and field installations. the following conclusions 
        were drawn: </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The flow capacity 
          of geocomposite drain systems is directly proportional to the hydraulic 
          gradient and inversely proportional to the confining pressure. These 
          relationships can be determined using the test apparatus and method 
          used in this study. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The equilibrium 
          flow of a product at a confining pressure can usually be determined 
          after a period of several days. However, the confining pressure may 
          need to he maintained for longer periods. up to several months. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Reduction in flow 
          capacity of the drain system may result from crushing or compression 
          of the core material or from elongation of the geotextile due to increased 
          soil pressures. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All products tested, 
          except for the Contech Stripdrain (which partially collapsed at 25 psi). 
          had minimum equilibrium flow rates of about 1 gal/mm per foot of drain 
          width when subjected to a confining pressure of 30 psi and a hydraulic 
          gradient of 1.0. The Contech product transmitted this volume at a confining 
          pressure of 25 psi. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Monitoring of 
          several field installations of geocomposite drain systems has shown 
          that these systems function as designed. As demonstrated during a severe 
          storm, geocomposite drain systems can accommodate transient as well 
          as steady-state groundwater conditions. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> All field installations 
          were easy to install. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> For most Forest 
          Service applications involving lateral pressures less than 15 psi and 
          low flow rates, any of the tested systems would perform satisfactorily. 
          </font></li>
      </ul>
