      Modification of geometry is a mitigation measure that closely mimics nature.
      The force of gravity is constantly reshaping the landscape through natural slope 
        building processes. Unfortunately, nature's forces also affect areas with 
        human-built structures. Sometimes these human-built structures give nature 
        a little "push."
      <br><br>
      An advantage of modifying 
        the geometry of a slide area is that for many situations, the repair works 
        with instead of against nature. Some examples are: flattening the slope 
        angle, using a sag vertical curve, using a steepened embankment, and using 
        a lightweight fill that would reduce the weight load on a slope. Most 
        of these options are substantially less expensive than buttresses or retaining 
        structures.
      <br><br>
      A disadvantage of 
        modifying the geometry is the possible increased effect on land resources. 
        Flattening a cut slope could result in a large exposed area, possibly 
        creating sediment production through erosion. In addition to creating 
        a "bend in the road," a shift in horizontal alignment creates additional 
        excavated material that must be disposed of. A sag vertical curve may 
        concentrate water runoff into a sensitive area.
      <br><br>
      The geotechnical specialist must carefully determine the advantages and disadvantages for each application. 
      All significant benefits and impacts should be relayed to the decision maker.

      As demonstrated in section <a href="ssg_5toc.html">5</a>, stability is a function 
      of material strength, weight, and slope angle/height. Thus, mitigation can 
      be accomplished by increasing the material strength, reducing the driving 
      weight, decreasing the slope angle, reducing the slope height, or a combination 
      of these methods. This section explores modification of road geometry and 
      how it uses these mitigation techniques.

      <b>6B.3.1.1 Flattened Slopes</b>
     </font>
     <br><br>
     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
      Flattened slopes can be applied to either cut slopes or fill slopes.
      A flattened slope is the typical natural response of most slope failures.
      A cut slope failure is typically followed by the maintenance response of material removal from the road.
      However, a fill slope failure often results in lost road width and downslope resource damage from the failed material. 
      In either case a proactive design is encouraged.
      <br><br>
      An example of flattening a fill slope is sidecast fill removal.
      Sidecast fill is typically "drifted" over the groundslope during road construction.
      The result is a fill slope at the angle of repose and possibly a foundation of organic material.
      It is not uncommon to find logs at the base of these fills acting as artificial retaining support
      (figure <a href="javascript:popupfig('images/6b/6b_f01.gif','Figure 6B.1 - Typical view of a sidecast fill')">6B.1</a>).
      As the logs and other organics decay, downhill movement and cracking or loss of roadway result.
      The movement will continue until a more stable, flatter slope is achieved.
      Removal of the sidecast material will return the slope to the flatter angle of the original ground.
      Of course, this alternative requires reducing the road width, possibly obtaining additional road width from the 
      opposite side, or rebuilding the outside edge
      (figure <a href="javascript:popupfig('images/6b/6b_f02.gif','Figure 6B.2 - Typical section for &quot;move into the hill.&quot;')">6B.2</a>).

      Reducing the slope angle of a cut may increase the FOS as a result of increased resisting 
      weight and the lengthening of failure surfaces.
      An additional effect of a reduced slope angle is a greater drawdown of the phreatic surface.
      A disadvantage of flattening a cut slope is the increased excavation created and associated resource disturbance.
      This can be a problem economically as well as for the slope stability of the generated material.
      If adequate disposal sites are not readily available within economical haul distances, the geotechnical 
      specialist may need to consider and analyze less stable locations for an engineered waste embankment.

      <b>6B.3.1.2 Steepened Slopes</b>
      <br><br>
      The use of steepened slopes as mitigation is generally applied to fill slopes rather than cut slopes.
      The use of a steepened slope generally requires a design based on materials chosen.
      Some examples of steepened slopes are: rock buttresses (see section <a href="ssg_6e.html">6E</a>), reinforced 
      embankments (see section <a href="ssg_6f.html">6F</a>), and retaining 
      walls
      (see section <a href="ssg_6e.html">6E</a>).
      <br><br>
      A typical situation for steepened fill slopes is sidecast fill removal.
      As was described for flattened fill slopes, sidecast material caught on logs or built on organics will settle and move downhill as the organics decay.
      If the road template cannot be modified, it may be economical to remove some or all of the sidecast material and rebuild a steepened slope.
      The greatest stability is achieved when the rebuilt section is placed on a firm foundation, generally entirely on the foundation material.
      This can be quite critical for a retaining structure, and
      <em>the external stability of the foundation should not be overlooked</em>
      (see section <a href="ssg_6e.html#6E.4">6E.4</a>).
      An advantage of building a steepened fill slope is that suitable embankment material can be conserved and borrow minimized.
      This results in less impact on the right-of-way and possible impact on a soil borrow or rock material source.
      A case history is presented in
      <a href="#Prob_1">problem 1</a>.
      <br><br>
      A steepened  cut slope alternative is possible with soils exhibiting some cohesion and generally results in a benched cut.
      As was demonstrated in section <a href="ssg_5c.html#5C.3">5C.3</a>, 
      height is one of the factors controlling stability for soils with cohesion. 
      However, for cohesionless materials with no ground water influence, it was 
      shown that for any slope angle, the stability is controlled by the friction 
      angle of the material and is independent of height
      (section <a href="ssg_5c.html#5C.5">5C.5</a>). 
      Therefore, for soils with cohesion the idea of a steepened slope is to limit 
      the height. By placing a bench in the slope it is possible to achieve a 
      desired FOS with economical excavation quantities compared to a flattened slope.
      The use of a benched cut for cohesionless materials will generally reduce erosion rather than increase mass slope stability.

      <b>6B.3.1.3 Lightweight Embankments</b>
      <br><br>
      Lightweight embankments have been used for both bearing capacity and slope stability problems.
      Because of the expense, lightweight embankments are generally 
      considered when alignment cannot be modified or the additional weight 
      of other alternatives does not provide an acceptable increase in stability 
      (see <a href="#Prob_2">problem 2</a>).
      <br><br>
      Lightweight embankments have been built using various materials and at various slope angles.
      Some of the materials used, such as wood chips and shredded tires, are waste byproducts.
      Other materials, such as polystyrene foam and plastics, are produced for other uses.
      In all cases, the geotechnical specialist must assign material properties either through laboratory testing, research 
      of existing test data, or engineering judgment.
      The parameters are then used in a stability analysis, along with site constraints and economics, 
      to determine the embankment slope angle and the possible need for internal and/or external reinforcement.
      <br><br>
      Some typical parameters used for wood material embankments are as follows:

    <td>
     <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
      An alternative that shifts horizontal alignment is typically referred to as a "move into 
      the hill" since it is almost always applied to a cut slope side of the road template.
      This alternative is typically combined with the flattened fill slope alternative.
      The idea is to gain additional road width by shifting 
      the roadway off the slide feature -- either the head of a slide that results 
      in a drop in grade or the lost outside edge of the roadway.
      The general result is a full-bench road template where the main stability concern is 
      the stability of the cut slope
      (figure <a href="javascript:popupfig('images/6b/6b_f03.gif','Figure 6B.3 - XSTABL cross-section for a cut slope stability analysis')">6B.3</a>).
      Because a larger base width is placed in natural ground, the usual result in forest terrain is a higher cut slope.
      The geotechnical designer may need to consider a flatter cut slope than the previously existing cut or possibly a benched cut.
      The benched cut may also be required for equipment access. A case history for a shift in alignment is presented in
      <a href="#Prob_3">problem 3</a>.

      results when a descending grade meets an ascending grade.
      A sag profile is the typical result of a road that crosses an active slide.
      Just as a flattened slope can result in stability closer to a natural state, so can a sag vertical curve.
      The use of a sag vertical curve is most appropriate at the head of a slide and where road design speed and minimum curvature allow for it.
      One potential negative aspect of a sag vertical curve is drainage.
      The low point of the sag is typically within the slide mass and ditch water may drain into the slide,
      or a ditch relief culvert may place water onto the slide mass.
      The geotechnical designer is encouraged to consider 
      drainage methods that limit ditch water entering the slide area, such 
      as placing relief culverts before water enters the slide boundaries and 
      using pipe extensions (such as corrugated plastic pipe) within the slide mass.
      The use of sag vertical curves can be a very inexpensive short- or long-term stability mitigation.

      A crest vertical curve may be used for a buttressing effect on a cut slope failure or as a method to reduce cut slope height.
      A crest vertical curve also results in a positive means to divert water drainage from the crest point.
      The geotechnical designer decides on the appropriate fill slope based on stability and economics previously discussed.
      A typical "fill slope" used with crest vertical curves is the natural ground slope for a full-bench cut, or a 
      mechanically stabilized embankment (MSE).

      <br><br>
      <i>
       Case History: Blackhawk Campground Road, USDA Forest Service, Uinta National Forest.
       Original investigation by Rene Renteria, Geotechnical Engineer, September 2, 1992.
      </i>
      <br><br>
      <u>Observations</u>
      <br><br>
      The road begins from 
      a ridge top alignment at a junction with the Mt. Nebo Loop Road, #015. 
      The road descends along a ridge top alignment, then crosses the ridge 
      and continues at the base of the slope just above a large bench area. 
      After about a mile, the road descends slightly before ascending back to a ridge line and saddle.
      At approximately milepost 1, approximately 240 feet of the outside lane of the two-lane paved road has settled.
      The road had been patched this summer, and already new cracking of the pavement has occurred.
      The cracking varies from 1-2 feet in from the edge to a width of 18 feet from the outside edge.
      There are no visible cracks that cross the entire asphalt pavement.
<br><br>
      The slope below the 
      road has benched terrain, with arid-type vegetation. Below the small bench 
      is a large benched area with meadow-like characteristics. At the toe of 
      the embankment there is no evidence of water flow exiting at the embankment / 
      natural ground contact. The fill slope appears to have a convex shape 
      (bowed outward). The fill slope is well vegetated with grass.
<br><br>
      From observations 
      of the cut slope, two soil units were identified and field classified. 
      The upper layer, labeled soil unit A (SU-A), is a silty sand with rock 
      fragments (field classified by the USCS as SM). The probable origin is 
      glacial. At the east end of the settlement area, a second soil layer is 
      exposed at ditch elevation. This soil, labeled soil unit B (SU-B), is 
      considered a sandy silt (field classified by the USCS as ML); probable 
      origin is sedimentary (decomposed rock?). This soil unit is visible in 
      the cut slope just above ditch elevation from the east to west ends of 
      the shoulder settlement area. During this visit, no water was visible 
      either in the ditch or on the surrounding slopes. Discussion with Carol 
      Johnson confirms evidence that water does flow into the ditch in late 
      spring/early summer. Toward the west end of the settlement area, an old 
      slope failure was noted above the road. There was some indication that 
      the cut slope had been displaced toward the road, but it does not seem 
      to be a recent event (older than 10 years). Minor cracks were noted just 
      above ditch elevation on this displaced mass, but it is unclear whether 
      these are cracks from creep movement of the cut slope or just shrinkage 
      cracks after the ditch moisture dried up. The probability that the old 
      cut slope movement and the road movement are related is extremely low. 
      This is based on the observation that no cracks cross the width of the 
      pavement. It was also noted that at the area of greatest crack width, 
      there is a low spot in the ditch line that would collect water with no 
      outlet for drainage.
<br><br>
      <u>Assessment</u>
<br><br>
      Based on past experience, 
      the model of failure for this site is probably movement of the embankment 
      as a result of moisture within the fill/natural ground contact zone. There 
      may be organic material remaining along this contact that is decomposing, 
      and the reduced strength produces continued movement. The water is probably 
      the result of seepage into the fill from the ditch line. The sources of 
      water include normal snowmelt, normal rain runoff, and the likely interception 
      of some ground water that flows along the SU-A/SU-B contact exposed in 
      the ditch. This hypothesis is supported by the observation of no movement 
      or water flow at the toe of the embankment, but a bowed fill slope that 
      indicates internal movement, with the resulting road grade settlement. 
      A preliminary interpretation of a cross-section through the wide-width 
      crack area indicates the majority of the road width is embankment material. 
      The lesser-width crack areas should have a corresponding smaller embankment.
<br><br>
      <u>Potential Mitigation Alternatives</u>
<br><br>
      The following alternatives 
      are possible mitigation actions based on the data collected on the initial 
      assessment visit. Additional investigation is necessary to better quantify 
      the risks and provide a more accurate assessment on the likelihood of 
      success. Estimated costs are given for comparison and are not to be considered 
      an accurate project estimate. Further investigation and an accurate survey 
      would provide more accurate estimates and possible refinements in mitigation 
      alternatives.
<br><br>
      In all alternatives, consideration should be given to providing positive drainage of the low 
      spot in the ditch by installing a culvert (at an estimated cost of $1,000).
      <ul>
       <li>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
         <i>Interceptor trench.</i>
         An interceptor trench in the ditchline would reduce the subsurface water flow under the roadway.
         This alternative by itself is considered to have limited success potential.
         The trench would reduce the subsurface water,
         but water could still penetrate under the pavement section along the ditch slope, especially during snowmelt.
         Another condition not addressed is that no positive action is taken inside the slope if decomposing organics exist.
         The estimated cost of a interceptor trench installation is $2,500.

         <i>Retaining wall. </i>
         A Hilfiker-style welded wire retaining wall could be placed at the outside edge of road.
         The excavation would be into natural ground, thus removing any organics that may be in the embankment.
         Positive drainage could be provided in the backfill.
         This alternative may require finding a site for waste material, as well as quality backfill.
         Some pavement would be removed and replaced.
         The estimated cost of installing the wall and pavement is $57,000.

         <i>Excavate and rebuild reinforced embankment.</i>
         This alternative would involve excavating through the existing embankment to natural ground and removing unsuitable material.
         The new embankment could be built at 1:1 using geotextile or geogrid reinforcement
 (figure <a href="javascript:popupfig('images/6b/6b_f06.gif','Figure 6B.6 - Typical section for excavate-and-rebuild reinforced embankment')">6B.6</a>).
         This method would re-use the suitable existing embankment material, thus limiting the need for a new material source.
         Positive drainage could be provided if needed.
         The pavement would have to be removed and replaced.
         The fill slope should be seeded to limit erosion.
         The estimated cost of this alternative is $26,000.

      <u>Recommendation</u>

      The recommendation at this time is to install a culvert at the low spot along the ditch line 
      and investigate further the alternative of excavating and rebuilding a reinforced embankment.
      Further investigation would consist of:
      (1) a survey of the area from below the road to the upper area of the old cut slope 
        area and slightly east and west outside of the settled roadway section; 
      (2) geotechnical field confirmation of soil layers and possible subsurface water; and
      (3) geotechnical confirmation of the stability of the old cut slope failure area.
      At this time it is anticipated that the additional field investigation would not require a drill machine.

      <b>Problem 2:</b> <i>Use of a Lightweight Fill</i>
      <br><br>
      <i>
       Case History: Slide #4--Horseshoe Bend Hill (Idaho), Federal Highway Administration, T<sup>2</sup>.
       Contact Ron Chassie, Portland, Oregon.
      </i>
<br><br>
      Slide #4 on Horseshoe Bend Hill was a perennial maintenance problem.
      The slide was occurring through an approximately 400-foot length of sidehill fill constructed over a weak bentonitic clay foundation.
      The slip plane extended to 25 feet below the fill base.
      Sliding was occurring at the contact between the weak clay and underlying shale.
      The slide extended laterally several hundred feet downslope beyond the fill toe.
<br><br>
      During the wet spring of 1983, slide movement accelerated to the point where the roadway was dropping at the rate of up to 1 foot per day.
      Continual maintenance was required that spring to maintain trafficability across the slide area. 
      The accelerated slide movement necessitated development of a permanent correction scheme.
<br><br>
      Preliminary design of a slide correction scheme called for subexcavation of the weak clay foundation below the
      fill toe to a depth below the slide failure plane and replacement with granular borrow to form a stabilizing shear key. 
      The upper 15 feet of roadway fill, which was also comprised of clay, also was to be removed and replaced with granular borrow.
      A deep drainage interceptor trench was proposed in the uphill ditch to intercept subsurface seepage. 
      Estimated FOS = 1.5.
<br><br>
      Because of previous successful sawdust fill slide stabilizations performed by the Washington 
      State Department of Transportation, a sawdust fill alternative was considered. 
      This alternative consisted only of removal and replacement with sawdust 
      of the upper 15 feet of roadway clay fill and installation of the drainage 
      interceptor trench
 (figure <a href="javascript:popupfig('images/6b/6b_f07.gif','Figure 6B.7 - Profile sketch for comparison of shear key to sawdust embankment')">6B.7</a>).
      The shear key subexcavation was eliminated. 
      Estimated FOS = 1.2.
<br><br>
      The sawdust fill alternative was chosen and constructed, saving $185,000 compared with the shear key alternative.
<br><br>
      The slide repair was completed in the fall of 1983 and has performed very successfully.

      <u>Introduction</u>
<br><br>
      The Vann slope failure, on Road 1912 at milepost 0.68, is approximately 500 feet in length and 
      extends from the road to the creek below with an estimated volume of 30,000 cubic yards.
      This failure has resulted in loss of road width and has been 
      investigated four times (in 1980, 1983, 1985, and 1986) by the South Zone 
      Geotechnical Group. This is a summary of the findings of those investigations 
      and documents the work leading to the recommended design alternative made 
      in the most recent investigation.
<br><br>
      <u>History</u>
<br><br>
        the geotechnical recommendation was to shift the road alignment 6 to 10 
        feet. The alignment shift was completed by approximately December 1981.
<br><br>
      In February 1983, 
        continued movement of the outside edge of the road and loss of width prompted 
        another investigation. At this time, the site was recognized as a large 
        area in movement. A subsurface investigation was begun. The recommended 
        solution was to construct a retaining structure.
<br><br>
      In March 1985, review 
        of the previous analysis and projected lack of funding for a retaining 
        structure led to exploration below the road to determine the feasibility 
        of a rock buttress. The buttress was chosen as the new recommended alternative, 
        and a design was produced.
<br><br>
      In May 1986, the analysis 
        was again reviewed. It was noted that there was insufficient confidence 
        in the location of the failure surface near the road to proceed with the 
        buttress design. Information gathered from inclinometer monitoring indicated 
        the possibility of a deep failure. Stability analysis was performed using 
        the deflection and water data gathered over the year. With this additional 
        information, the decision was made to shift the road alignment into the 
        hillside and avoid the slide area below the road.
<br><br>
      <u>Analysis</u>
<br><br>
      The loss of road width is the result of a translational movement below the road extending to a slope break above the creek.
      The result of moment <!-- movement -->
      at the toe end of the slope is a response of the area immediately below the road.
      The continued loss of fill material has resulted in inadequate road width and horizontal alignment.
      Deep movement detected in the slope indicator casing installed within the slide mass produces major uncertainty in the foundation conditions for a retaining structure or buttress.
      Therefore, to meet the objective of acceptable horizontal alignment and road width, the alternative to shift the horizontal alignment was chosen (figure

      The height of cut involved in the new alignment required the combination of 
      steep slopes and benching to produce an economical design. A bench cut was 
      chosen to limit the free-fall height of material dislodged at the top of 
      the cut. Slopes were chosen to parallel existing stable cut slopes, along 
      with a bench width wide enough for a dozer, so that excavation could be 
      accomplished efficiently. A critical section was analyzed using the program 
      XSTABL (XSTABL v. 4.102 1992).
      The XSTABL input file is shown in figure 
<a href="#Fig_6B.9">6B.9</a>,

<br><br>
      <u>Recommendation</u>
<br><br>
      The recommendation is to shift the horizontal alignment and construct a new cut slope using 
      a combination of steep slopes and benching where necessary.
      Excess material should be removed from the outside road edge, and the slope below the 
      road should be "rounded" from its near vertical slope to reduce the occurrence 
      of sloughing if additional movement of the translational slide should occur.

      <u>Introduction</u>
      <br><br>
      Bruler Slide occurred at milepost 12 on the Quartzville Road in or around 1975.
      Each spring after the slide had moved during the winter, Forest Service maintenance 
      crews "fixed" the road by filling in the sag caused by the slide.
      This loaded the head of the slide where the road crosses it.
      <br><br>
      <u>Field Investigation</u>
      <br><br>
      The field investigation consisted of surface reconnaissance, surveying geologic cross-sections, 
      subsurface drilling, and monitoring a slope indicator casing installed during the drilling operation.
      Seven holes were drilled at the site, and a record of the water level was kept for each hole.
      <br><br>
      Five material units (soil units A, B, C, D, and rock unit 12) were used for analysis.
      Their characteristics are summarized as:

      <u>Slide Mechanism</u>
      <br><br>
      The topographies above and below Bruler Slide are indicative of a very large and very old slide consisting of a series of blocks.
      Two mechanisms were examined.

        <i>Model 1</i>. 
         It appears that the "slide block" below Bruler Slide slipped out and 
         was washed away by the stream. This removed the support for the next 
         block (Bruler Slide). When combined with the added weight of road fill 
         on the head of the slide, and a high water table, the loss of the abutment <!-- abuttment -->
         at its toe allowed Bruler Slide to move downhill. Slope indicator readings 
         show a failure plane at approximately 25 feet below the road surface. 
         However, tilting of the entire slope indicator casing suggests that a much deeper failure may exist.

        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
        <i>Model 2.</i> 
        From the drill investigation, wet moisture conditions were noted only 
        for SU-A, SU-C, and part of SU-D. This model assumes a perched water 
        table on SU-B with minor surface saturation at the interface of SU-B. 
        Water is allowed to rise into the fill (SU-D).

      </ul>
      <br>
      Based on monitoring for deflections in the slope indicator casing and observation pipes located 
      below the road, model 2 was chosen for final analysis and design.
      Movement was detected under the road at a depth of 25 feet, but no movement was detected 
      in the observation pipes downslope of the embankment.
      The deformation of the slope also supports the appearance of an embankment foundation failure.

      <u>Alternatives</u>
      <br><br>
      Five alternatives were considered (costs are given in 1984 dollars).

      <ul>
       <li>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
         <i>Trench drains (cost estimated at $10,000-$12,000).</i>
         Trench drains would be a relatively 
         simple way to lower the ground water level, particularly during the 
         wet season when the slide moves. This should be an effective measure 
         against large movements because the slide is most sensitive to the water level.

        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
         <i>Lightweight fill with drain system (cost estimated at $15,000-$17,000)</i>.
         Although more expensive than the other alternatives, a lightweight fill combined 
         with trench drains would not only "de-water" the slide, but also unload 
         the head of it, thereby significantly reducing the driving forces.
         This alternative also produces the largest FOS against instability.

         <i>Road relocation (cost estimated at $9,000-$10,000).</i>
         A road relocation would unload Bruler Slide, but the alignment of the 
         road would be poor because it is advisable to avoid building the road 
         through the marshy area above the slide.

         <i>Horizontal drains (cost estimate $11,000-$13,000).</i>
         Drain holes would be drilled from below the road and pass through the slide plane.
         There is a risk of losing the drain system if the slide moves significantly.

         maintenance crews would grade the road after movements but would not add additional material.

      <u>Recommended Alternative</u>
      <br><br>
      Based on limited movement from 1985 to 1991, maintaining the road in the post-failure configuration of a sag vertical curve is recommended.
      New culverts should be placed at the low point in the ditch line and at a location to relieve ditch water before it enters the slide area.
      Water should be carried from the culvert outlets past the failed area limits with the use of corrugated plastic pipe.
      Without restoring the grade, a 27 percent increase is realized in the FOS without the additional costs of a lightweight fill or subsurface drainage.

       Case history: Krassel Rock Slope Failure, South Fork Salmon River Road,
       USDA Forest Service, Payette National Forest.
       Original investigation by Michael Remboldt, Assistant Forest Engineer, September 9, 1992.
      </i>
      <br><br>
      <u>Problem</u>
      <br><br>
      During road construction involving road widening excavation, the contractor undercut an existing rock slope by blasting.
      The failure was immediately adjacent to a major anadromous river which at the time had a spawning threatened and endangered (T&amp;E) species.
      The failure also threatened the safety and stability of a major fire guard station and airstrip at the top of the slope.
      <br><br>
      Time was of the essence due to the T&amp;E issue.
      <br><br>
      <u>Investigation</u>
      <br><br>
      Field-developed cross-sections were plotted to determine the size and extent of the failure and for design (see figure
 <a href="javascript:popupfig('images/6b/6b_f15.gif','Figure 6B.15 - Field-developed cross-sections at Krassel rock slope failure. Slope angle approximately 40°. Rock type granite, Idaho Batholith.')">6B.15</a>).
      Road alignment at the failure was a long, straight tangent with minimal vertical grade.
      <br><br>
      The geology (Idaho Batholith) prevented stabilization alternatives, such as rock bolting, due to the random structure of the rock.
      <br><br>
      There were ample sources of select fill.
      The ongoing road construction contract included a significant amount of H-pile/timber lagging retaining wall
      which had been recently installed, with some extra material left over due to contract modifications.

      <u>Solution</u>
      <br><br>
      Several alternatives, including rock bolting and buttressing, were evaluated.
      An earth buttress was selected because of availability of materials, cost, road alignment, and time to construct.

         Let <i>B</i> be the mass of required earth buttress and calculate buttress size required for FOS&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.15.
         <br><br>
         This type of problem is most readily solved by drawing a free body diagram showing the forces acting on the mass
         (see figure
 <a href="javascript:popupfig('images/6b/6b_f16.gif','Figure 6B.16 - Free body diagram of sliding mass')">6B.16</a>).
         In equilibrium (FOS=1), the horizontal and vertical components of all forces acting on a body must sum to zero.
         Therefore a polygon comprised of all force vectors acting on the mass must close
         (see figure
 <a href="javascript:popupfig('images/6b/6b_f17.gif','Figure 6B.17 - Force polygon')">6B.17</a>).

         <i>Figure 6B.17 - Force polygon.</i>
         <br><br>
         In analyzing problems such as this, with rigid blocks acting against each other, the ordinary method of slices (OMS) can yield a FOS 8 to 10 percent 
         greater than will a more rigorous force equilibrium analysis, resulting in a more costly, conservative solution.
         This is because of the simplifying assumptions of the OMS to satisfy only moment equilibrium.
         <br><br>
         From figure
         <a href="javascript:popupfig('images/6b/6b_f16.gif','Figure 6B.16 - Free body diagram of sliding mass')">6B.16</a>, 
         it can be seen that movement will not occur without sliding at the block-to-block interface.
         At equilibrium (no sliding), there will be a force at the interface, the components of which are denoted <i>Rx</i> and <i>Ry</i>.
         It can also be seen that only horizontal movement can occur in BOTH blocks (assuming the buttress moves only on the underlying surface).
         For these reasons it is appropriate to use force equilibrium analysis rather than a moment equilibrium analysis.
         <br><br>
         The buttress mass solution is simplified by considering equilibrium in the horizontal (x) direction only.
         This is conservative, because the increase in the buttress normal force is greater than the corresponding decrease in normal force on the failing mass.
         <br><br>
         To solve for overall FOS, use the following equation for the forces acting in the horizontal direction:

         <i>B</i> = 6.88 kips/ft = 6880 lb/ft.

       </font>
      </li>
      </ol>
      One can check the effect of ignoring an interslice force by using a force equilibrium method such as Janbu's or Spencer's method.
      Output files from XSTABL (v. 4.1) using Janbu's method which illustrate the validity of the design assumptions are found in figure
      <a href="#Fig_6B.19">6B.19</a>.
      <br><br>
      <u>Design</u>
      <br><br>
      The criteria for buttress geometry were that it:
      (1) must have end area greater than 57.3 sq. ft., 
      (2) must support raised road subgrade (i.e., minimum width of 18 ft.), and
      (3) must be high enough to contain some large, loose rock fragments near the top of the existing cut slope.
      <br><br>
      A retaining wall system was constructed on the outside edge of the buttress because of geometry considerations
      (proximity to the river) and for protection of fisheries habitat (sediment delivery and disturbance).
      The wall system was constructed out of surplus H-piling and timber lagging and was anchored into the buttress itself.
