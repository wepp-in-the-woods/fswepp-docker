      <p align="left"><font face="trebuchet MS, verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rugged 
        terrain of America's national forests presents engineering geologists 
        and geotechnical engineers with many challenges. Small budgets and staffs 
        encourage innovative exploration techniques, while high design standards 
        are necessary for compliance with Federal resource protection regulations. 
        These sometimes conflicting conditions have fostered the development of 
        skilled professionals, who often rely on the experiences of their colleagues 
        for help with difficult problems. In this spirit of cooperation the <i>Slope 
        Stability Reference Guide</i> was developed, a spirit that characterizes 
        the career of the guide's instigator, Rod Prellwitz. In recognition of 
        his years of guidance and support as a mentor and friend to geotechnical 
        specialists in the Northwest, we dedicate these volumes, a summary of 
        what we have learned together.</font> 
      <p align="left"><font face="trebuchet MS, verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rod Prellwitz's 
        career as a geotechnical engineer is the result of his love of the mountains 
        and forests of the West and his love for the process of solving geotechnical 
        problems. The symbols of these two loves are his continuing enthusiasm 
        for field work and the license plate on his four-wheel-drive pickup, GEOTECH. 
        </font> 
      <p align="left"><font face="trebuchet MS, verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rod's 
        professional training began in 1957 at the Montana School of Mines (now 
        Montana College of Mineral Sciences and Technology), where he studied 
        geological engineering with a petroleum option. After graduating in 1961, 
        he worked for 3 years as a seismic geophysicist in Wyoming, Utah, and 
        Colorado with Texaco, Inc. During that time he realized that career advancement 
        in the petroleum industry meant spending long periods of time in such 
        &quot;God-forsaken places&quot; as Houston, Tulsa, and Denver--a depressing 
        prospect for a young man who loved the big, empty country of the West. 
        </font> 
      <p align="left"><font face="trebuchet MS, verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 1964, 
        Rod heard that the USDA Forest Service was looking for a civil engineer 
        on the Apache National Forest, and soon he was on his way to Springerville, 
        Arizona, leaving the oil business behind forever. In 1965, he moved on 
        to a position in preconstruction engineering in the regional office at 
        Missoula, Montana, seizing a chance to return to the State he had grown 
        to love. By 1966, he had moved on to Hamilton, Montana, and the Bitterroot 
        National Forest, where he eventually became an assistant forest engineer. 
        Rod later found that he was spending far too much time managing the motor 
        pool and not enough time on engineering; so, in 1969 he transferred to 
        the Northern Region Materials Investigation Unit back in Missoula as a 
        geotechnical engineer. </font> 
      <p align="left"><font face="trebuchet MS, verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">His role 
        as a regional office geotechnical engineer gave him an opportunity to 
        see much of Idaho and Montana and a full range of geotechnical problems. 
        Rod took graduate courses at the University of Idaho in the early 1970's, 
        graduating with an M.S. in civil engineering with a geotechnical option 
        in 1975. In 1979, he became a research geotechnical engineer at the Intermountain 
        Research Station in Missoula, continuing there until his retirement in 
        early 1993.</font> 
      <p align="left"><font face="trebuchet MS, verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Slope 
        stability analysis and ground water monitoring have been Rod's primary 
        professional interests as a researcher. Since 1975, he has written more 
        than a dozen professional papers, made numerous presentations before professional 
        societies on geotechnical topics, and developed several practical guides 
        and handbooks for use by Forest Service field specialists. Among his papers 
        &quot;<i>SSMOS&quot;--Slope Stability Analysis by Three Methods of Slices 
        with the HP-41 Programmable Calculator</i> in 1985 and
&quot;<i>SSLS&quot; and  &quot;SSCHFS&quot;--Preliminary Slope Stability Analysis with the HP-41 
        Programmable Calculator</i> in 1988 were instantly popular with Forest 
        Service geotechnical engineers and engineering geologists in the Northern 
        and Pacific Northwest Regions.</font> 
      <p align="left"><font face="trebuchet MS, verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Through 
        the development of those publications, the Pacific Southwest and Pacific 
        Northwest Region geotechnical specialists learned what their Northern 
        Region colleagues had known for some years: Rod was a research scientist 
        who understood the field conditions they faced every day, and he was interested 
        in helping them find the answers to their technical problems. He routinely 
        provided technical support to national forest engineers, geologists, and 
        soil scientists who were trying to apply textbook soil mechanics and ground 
        water principles to steep forested terrain conditions and finding that 
        the two were not always compatible.</font> 
      <p align="left"><font face="trebuchet MS, verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rod is 
        probably best known in the Forest Service for developing what is commonly 
        called the three-level slope stability analysis concept. The three-level 
        system grew out of his understanding that engineering geologists and geotechnical 
        engineers could contribute their knowledge of soil mechanics and physical 
        processes to forest planning and decision making. His 1983 presentation 
        to the Transportation Research Board 62nd Annual Meeting, <i>Landslide 
        Analysis Concepts for Management of Forest Lands on Residual and Colluvial 
        Soils </i>(T.R. Howard and W.D. Wilson, co-authors), summarizes the three-level 
        system and sets the stage for his later work on Level I Stability Analysis 
        (LISA), Stability Analysis for Road Access (SARA, the level H program), 
        and XSTABL (the level III program). LISA and XSTABL have become standard 
        analysis tools for resource planning level and site-specific slope stability 
        assessments, respectively, on national forests in the western United States.</font> 
      <p align="left"><font face="trebuchet MS, verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As helpful 
        as these tools have been, Rod's willingness to teach others what he has 
        learned is his greatest contribution to the profession. He has always 
        been more than generous with his time when people ask for help, preferring 
        a field trip to look at the problem to talking about it on the phone. 
        His informal style and ever-present sketch pad frequently turn simple 
        questions into impromptu tutoring sessions, where gaining knowledge and 
        understanding are as important as finding the answer to the problem. Over 
        the years, Rod has been a frequent contributor to technical workshops 
        held by the Forest Service, the Oregon and Washington Departments of Transportation, 
        and the Federal Highway Administration. In the last 5 years, he has been 
        a principal instructor at more than half a dozen Forest Service-sponsored 
        workshops focused on the LISA computer model, demonstrating his belief 
        that technical information is most effectively exchanged through discussion 
        and shared experience.</font> 
      <p align="left"><font face="trebuchet MS, verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even 
        though we won't see the familiar Montana GEOTECH license plates as often 
        in our office parking lots, Rod has left us a rich legacy of his knowledge 
        and experience and a promise to be available occasionally for a look at 
        an interesting problem. In thanks for his many gifts, we dedicate the 
        <i>Slope Stability Reference Guide</i> to Rod Prellwitz.</font>
