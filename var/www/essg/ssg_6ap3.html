        shall be conducted on all rock slopes as directed by the engineer (as 
        shown on the drawings) and in accordance with these specifications and 
        the contractor's work plan and shall include the removal of loose blocks 
        of debris and vegetation from the slope by mechanical methods. Blasting 
        or the use of ground surface power equipment, such as backhoes, etc., 
        shall be prohibited except in construction zone 3 as shown on the drawings.</font></p>

        </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The contractor shall 
        provide a minimum of one qualified rock slope scaling crew that consists 
        of a working foreperson and two scalers. The crew size shall be maintained 
        at all times. Any crew member who must leave for any reason shall be replaced 
        immediately by a qualified replacement. If the scaling activities have 
        the potential of endangering adjacent structures (e.g., guardrail, retaining 
        wall, signs) the contractor shall provide appropriate protective devices, 
        as per the contractor's work plan, prior to commencing the scaling work.

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> All slopes to be 
        scaled are indicated on the drawings. Scaling of these slopes shall include 
        the removal of all loose rock, whether in original position or not; all 
        vegetation over 1/8 inch in diameter; and any existing wire mesh installed 
        on the slope. Existing wire mesh and associated hardware shall become 
        the property of the contractor.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <u>Methods </u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rock shall be scaled 
        manually using a suitable 5-foot standard steel mine scaling rod supplemented 
        when necessary by pneumatic splitters. Vegetation shall be pruned or sawed 
        off even with the rock face. In construction zone 3 only, alternative 
        methods such as blasting or use of ground surface power equipment may 
        be allowed at the discretion of the Forest Service. If blasting methods 
        are to be used, this portion of the scaling work must precede any other 
        scaling proceeds. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rock slope scaling 
        shall start at the top of the slope and work shall proceed downward towards 
        road grade, removing all loose rock blocks as the work progresses. Rock 
        blocks or debris which hang up on the slopes during the scaling operations 
        shall be removed upon completion of the first rock slope scaling pass. 
        The new face shall be inspected by the engineer to determine whether or 
        not the rock slope scaling has been completed. The contractor shall continue 
        to scale the slope until the scaling has been completed to the satisfaction 
        of the engineer.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All rock and debris 
        produced during the rock slope scaling operation shall be removed by the 
        contractor and disposed of at the waste area shown on the drawings.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If necessary, the 
        contractor shall provide emergency access through the project within 24 
        hours of notice. A temporary stockpile for scaled material may be located 
        in the ditch and cutslope area between stations __ and __ . No material 
        shall be stored within 10 feet of the edge of the retaining wall. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Disposal of Material 
        </u> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All earth and rock 
        materials removed shall be placed in the designated waste disposal site. 
        All vegetation removed shall be burned in the designated burn area. The 
        contractor shall obtain an approved <u>burning permit</u> from __________________.

        </u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rock slope scaling 
        will be measured on a crew-hour basis. A crew is defined as a qualified 
        working foreperson and two qualified scalers. Time will be measured while 
        the crew is working on the slope. Stockpiling, hauling, and disposal of 
        scaled material shall be considered incidental to scaling. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Basis of Payment 
        </u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Payment for rock slope 
        scaling will be made at the unit price per crew hour for the "rock slope 
        scaling." The unit price shall include the cost of furnishing all the

        anchorages, bearing plates, corrosion protection, and other appurtenances 
        shall be products of a manufacturer regularly engaged in manufacture of 
        rock bolts. Bolts shall be fabricated from deformed bars. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Type 1 Rock bolts 
        shall be 1-inch diameter Williams hollow core prestressable rock and concrete 
        anchor bolts, number R1H-08-C14, or approved equivalent and will require 
        a 1-3/4-inch drill hole. The head assembly shall be number C14. The design 
        load is 30,000 pounds. An equivalent rock bolt would be a hollow-core 
        deformed rod ASTM A-615 grade 60 steel with a minimum ultimate tensile 
        strength of 50,000 lbs. A mechanical anchor assembly shall be at the end 
        of the bolt rod and shall be capable of exceeding the ultimate tensile 
        strength of the bolt rod. The anchor assembly shall be designed to prestress 
        the bolt rod prior to grouting. The bolt shall be designed to ensure that 
        grout will completely fill the annular space around the bolt rod.</font> 
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Type 2 rock bolts 
        shall be 1-3/8-inch diameter Williams high grade hollow core prestressable 
        rock and concrete anchor bolts, number R1HG-11-C18, or equivalent, and 
        will require a 2-1/4-inch drill hole. The required head assembly is C18. 
        The design load is 80,000 pounds. An equivalent rock bolt would have the 
        same requirements as an equivalent type 1, but would be ASTM A-615 Grade 
        70 steel, with a minimum ultimate tensile strength of 138,000 pounds.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rock bolts shall 
        meet applicable specifications of ASTM A-615, ASTM A-331, and ASTM A-722.

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All couplers and nuts 
        shall be high strength and the ultimate strengths and maximum working 
        load to yield shall meet or exceed that of the rock bolts.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Where the required 
        length of the rock bolt exceeds 16 feet, the contractor will be permitted 
        to couple lengths of bolts together to produce such lengths. All bolts 
        shall be free of any coatings except at the threaded end. The bolts shall 
        be completely fabricated at the point of manufacture under controlled 
        shop conditions. Couplings for connecting sections of rock bolts shall 
        have a center stop so that each section is connected by an equal length 
        of thread, shall be as strong as the bolt, and shall be so fabricated 
        as not to interfere in any way with the flow of grout. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The surface of the 
        steel rock bolts shall have a continuous pattern of rolled-in raised deformations 
        except for any necessary threads at the ends of the rods.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rock bolts shall 
        be handled and stored in such a manner as to avoid damage and corrosion. 
        Damage to the rock bolt as a result of abrasions, cuts, nicks, welds, 
        and weld splatter will be cause for rejection. The rock bolts shall be 
        protected from dirt, rust, and harmful substances. A light coating of 
        rust on the steel is acceptable. If heavy corrosion or pitting is noted, 
        the engineer will reject the affected rock bolt. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prior to installation 
        all mill flaking, rust, and grease shall be removed from the steel. The

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bearing plates, 
        washers, and nuts shall conform to ASTM F-432 and ASTM A-36. The bearing 
        plates shall be Williams S1K keyhole plates, or approved equivalents. 
        The plates for the type 1 rock bolts shall be 3/8 by 6 by 6 inches and 
        the plates for the type 2 rock bolts shall be 1 by 8 by 8 inches. Hardware

        in the bolt to the rock. The plate shall be in uniform contact with the 
        rock surface. If the rock face is not perpendicular to the axis of the 
        bolt, or the rock under the bearing plate is not sound, a bearing pad 
        approved by the engineer shall be constructed so that the bolt is not 
        bent when the tension is applied. Beveled washers may be used to level 
        a bearing plate. Where the rock surface is generally weak or weathered, 
        extra large bearing plates shall be used to distribute the load over a 
        larger surface area to reduce the potential of failure of the bearing

        may be rotary- or percussion-drilled and shall deviate by not more than 
        2 percent over their length. The holes shall be declined downward 5 degrees 
        below the horizontal as shown on the drawings, unless otherwise specified

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drilled holes shall 
        be cleaned of all drill cuttings, sludge and debris before the rock bolt 
        is inserted into the hole. The contractor shall make certain that the 
        hollow core of a rock bolt is clear of all obstructions. Rock bolts are 
        to be inserted in the hole with the anchor assembly positioned approximately 
        12 inches from the bottom of the hole in rock, and the threaded outer 
        end projecting beyond the mortar pad, plate, and nut at least 2 inches. 
        The anchor is to be expanded by rotation of the bolt clockwise with a 
        Williams rock bolt setting tool (or approved equivalent) in accordance 
        with the manufacturer's recommendations. The use of pipe wrenches for 
        applying torque to the bolt rod is expressly prohibited. Torque for setting 
        the anchor assembly shall be in accordance with the recommendations of 
        the manufacturer.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Beveled or hemispherical 
        washers, where needed, shall be placed between the bearing plate and the 
        nut to ensure uniform bearing on the bearing plate. A machine washer shall 
        be placed between the nut and the beveled washer. The washer shall be 
        coated on both sides with molybdenum disulfide grease.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Tensioning </u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each rock bolt shall 
        be tensioned to the specified design load prior to grouting. Tensioning 
        shall be done with approved calibrated hydraulic jacks. Tension may be 
        done with a calibrated torque or impact wrench if the relationship between 
        torque and load can be demonstrated to the engineer.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Any rock bolt which 
        is damaged to the extent that it no longer can be retensioned or cannot 
        be grouted completely, shall be replaced at the contractor's expense. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once a rock bolt has 
        been tensioned, the tension shall not be relaxed for any purpose unless 
        authorized by the engineer.</font></p>

        shall be tensioned to 32,000 pounds and type 2 rock bolts to 80,000 pounds. 
        Load/extension measurements shall be made during tensioning. The load 
        shall be held for 10 minutes with no loss of load and the extension of 
        the bolt shall not exceed the elastic strain of the bolt by more than 
        20 percent. For each rock bolt type, a minimum of the first three rock 
        bolts and 10 percent of the remaining bolts will be tested in such a manner. 
        More bolts may be tested if bolts fail or if a valid load-torque relationship 
        cannot be established. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Testing </u></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A quality control 
        program of proof-testing of up to 10 percent of all bolts installed shall 
        be carried out on a routine basis by the contractor. Any bolt which fails 
        to satisfy the proof testing shall be replaced at the contractor's cost. 
        A repeat test shall be carried out by the contractor on any new bolt installed 
        to replace a bolt which fails to meet the requirements of the proof-test 
        program by reason of insufficient anchorage capacity. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The engineer may require 
        a repeat of the proof testing at any stage during the execution of the 
        contract to ensure that the method of installation is satisfactory for 
        the conditions encountered. Repeat proof testing shall also be carried 
        out if any changes occur in the method of the installation, material, 
        or personnel.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proof tests shall 
        be carried out by the contractor using equipment provided by the contractor 
        as follows:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Apply axial load 
          to bolt through a coupling attached to the threaded end, using a hydraulic

          considered to have failed if any outward movement of the bolt anchorage 
          occurs at a loading below or at the required 100 percent load. </font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additional installation 
        quality control will be by means of inspections by the engineer.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The entire space between 
        the rock bolt and the sides of the drill hole shall be filled with grout. 
        In order to accomplish this, the grout shall be pressure pumped (using 
        sufficient pressure to overcome the hydrostatic head) with a portable 
        grout pump, providing a minimum of 30 pounds per square inch capacity 
        to the low end of the hole first and pumping continued until grout is 
        forced out of the de?airing tube at the face of the hole. Failure of grout 
        to be extruded from the face of the hole shall be cause for rejection 
        of the rock bolt installation. </font></p>

        the hole and supported in place if necessary.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The dowel shall be 
        inserted into the hole following the manufacturer's recommendations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the dowel has

        the duration recommended by the resin manufacturer. The mixing time shall 
        be adjusted for the ambient temperature of the rock mass or resin storage 
        area according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The dowel shall 
        be maintained in position until the resin has gelled.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the resin has 
        reached final set, a face plate shall be placed over the dowel and held 
        in place by a nut. The nut shall be torqued to a nominal 100 ft?lbs to 
        ensure proper seating against the rock.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For type 3 dowels, 
        the dowel shall be as close as possible to the rock that it is to support. 
        The dowel shall be grouted full-depth into the drill hole. The dowel and 
        the toe area of the block that it is supporting shall be encased with 
        shotcrete or hand-packed cement for corrosion protection and support. 
        Wood packing shall not be used.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For soil anchors, 
        centering devices shall be installed at 5-foot intervals and the dowel 
        inserted into the drill hole. Grout shall be pumped through a grout tube 
        into the bottom of the hole and the hole completely filled with grout. 
        A temporary form may be used at the face and may consist of the 8 by 8 
        by 3/8-inch steel face plate sufficiently greased to prevent bonding of 
        the grout. The face plate may subsequently be removed and used as intended

        expense. A repeat test shall be carried out by the contractor on any new 
        bolt or dowel installed to replace a bolt or dowel which fails the proof

        the conditions encountered. Repeat proof testing shall also be carried 
        out if any changes occur in the method of installation, material or personnel.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proof tests shall

          until steady flow resumes. A nozzleman's helper, equipped with an air 
          blowout jet, shall attend the nozzleman at all times during the placement 
          of shotcrete to keep the working area free from rebound. Shooting shall

        The curing compound shall be applied immediately after gunning. The air 
        in contact with shotcrete surfaces shall be maintained at temperatures 
        above freezing for a minimum of 7 days. Curing compounds shall not be 
        used on any surfaces against which additional shotcrete or other cementatious 
        finishing materials are to be bonded unless positive measures, such as 
        sandblasting, are taken to remove curing compounds completely prior to 
        the application of such additional materials.</font></p>
