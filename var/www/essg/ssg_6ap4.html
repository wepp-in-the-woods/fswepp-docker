      Creek slide is a large translational slope movement located on the Willamette 
      National Forest near Oakridge, Oregon. The site is located on Road 2120 
      at milepost 4.8 in the Buck Creek Drainage at the 3,500 foot elevation in 
      section 13, T. 23 S., R. 3 E., W.M.</font></td>

    <td width="80%"> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Displacement 
        of the roadway (then Road 2321) was noted in the early 1960's. Wooden 
        piles were driven into the slide mass in an attempt to stop movement. 
        The treatment was unsuccessful, as indicated by 1984 sightings of pile 
        tips above the failure surface.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A slope movement southeast 
        of Powder Creek Quarry circa 1974 required a road realignment. The realignment 
        shifted the road centerline upslope. The counterline subsequently became 
        the head of the present failure of Area A. The realignment created a through-cut 
        east of Area A. It is thought that separate movements occurred south of 
        the through?cut and south of the road crossing at Powder Creek.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By 1976, the slope 
        movements had caused numerous tension cracks along the road in Area A. 
        The recommendations at that time were to relocate the Powder Creek channel 
        to the east, drain the marsh upslope of Area A, and drain the marsh near 
        the road at Powder Creek. The marshes were drained by excavating a trench 
        to Powder Creek. The trench and stream relocation successfully drained 
        the marsh near the road and eliminated the tension cracks in the roadway. 
        However, the marsh above Area A remained.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A large clearcut unit 
        at the headwater of Powder Creek was harvested circa 1979. The logging 
        operation required that a one- to two-acre spring-fed pond be drained; 
        a trench was created to drain the pond into Powder Creek.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At this time the road 
        grade began a vertical displacement of 1 to 3 feet yearly through Area 
        A. The maintenance crew has bladed and reshaped the road annually with 
        base rock at an estimated average cost of between $3,000 and $5,000 per 
        year.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1984, a comprehensive 
        slope stability investigation involving a site survey and subsurface investigation 
        was begun by the South Zone Geotechnical Group. Subsurface soil samples 
        were classified and tested. Piezometer tubes and a slope inclinometer 
        casing were installed in the drill holes to monitor subsurface water and 
        to locate the failure surface. Comparison of survey points in the middle 
        of Area A from 1976 to 1984 indicated an average horizontal displacement 
        of 10 feet per year, with a corresponding estimated average yearly loss 
        of 2,500 cubic yards of soil into Buck Creek.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the winter 
        of 1984-85 a slope movement sheared the piezometers and inclinometer casing. 
        With the failure surface defined, analysis indicated that water pressure 
        was the driving mechanism. During 1985, three measures were attempted 
        to control the water in the failure area. In March, three horizontal drains 
        were installed from below the road, and four vertical siphon wells were 
        installed. A subsequent movement sheared and blocked the drains. The vertical 
        siphon wells were also a disappointment due to clogging by soil fines 
        and low permeability limiting the siphon flow. In September, an attempt 
        was made to drain the marsh above Area A. The installed trench reduced 
        the subsurface water levels near the marsh, but no effect was noted downslope 
        of the marsh. The water source of the marsh is still undetermined.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1986, an additional 
        subsurface exploration was conducted. Samples were taken at the failure 
        surface to be classified and tested for strength and piezometers were 
        installed to monitor the subsurface water levels. The yearly horizontal 
        movement was measured to be 15 feet, with 2,000 cubic yards of soil being 
        moved.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By March 1987, an 
        additional 12 feet of horizontal movement at the toe was noted. The road 
        grade had displaced 1 to 2 feet vertically and horizontally. The estimated 
        volume of soil displaced was less than 1,500 cubic yards.</font></p></td>

      Exploration and Testing</b></font></td>
    <td width="80%"> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Subsurface 
        exploration was conducted in 1984 and 1986 using an Acker Mark IV track-mounted 
        drill. The objectives of the drilling were to confirm or modify the subsurface 
        interpretation of material type and extent, the location of the failure 
        zone, and the subsurface water conditions, and to obtain and test samples 
        of subsurface materials for engineering properties relevant to the design 
        of alternatives.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drilling was performed 
        using hollow stem augers and the standard penetration test (SPT) method 
        and/or wireline core drilling. Shelby tube samplers were pushed to obtain 
        undisturbed samples for strength testing. Two slope inclinometer casings 
        were installed to monitor slope movement and provide data for identifying 
        the failure surface. One-inch-diameter PVC pipe was installed in the drill 
        holes to monitor the seasonal subsurface water.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Subsurface testing 
        consisted of SPT, soil permeability, and strength testing in the shear 
        zone. Permeability tests were run using constant-head and falling-head 
        methods. In-situ strength testing was accomplished with the Iowa borehole 
        shear strength device.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Laboratory testing 
        was used to confirm the field soil classification and to perform strength 
        tests on undisturbed samples. Soils were classified according to the Unified 
        Soil Classification System (USCS). Direct shear strength tests were run 
        on samples taken from a saturated soil layer above the shear zone. The 
        samples were tested under field moisture and saturated moisture conditions. 
        Triaxial shear strength tests were run on saturated shear zone samples 
        using the consolidated undrained method with pore pressure measurements.</font></p></td>

    <td width="80%" height="1049"> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        Powder Creek drainage is located in a former glacial cirque basin which 
        drains transversely into Buck Creek. The soils found in the Powder Creek 
        area are the result of glacial, fluvial, and mass movement processes. 
        As Buck Creek enters the basin, the channel has been deeply incised into 
        the soils at the lower edge of the basin. Subsurface investigation has 
        shown soil depths greater than 100 feet within the basin area, excluding 
        the Buck Creek channel.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On average, the slide 
        progresses 10 feet horizontally per year by slow movement, with one to 
        three major movements between early winter and early spring. The body 
        of the failure translates as a block slide that displaces material off 
        the slope and into Buck Creek. At the failure head, the response affecting 
        the roadway has been limited to 1 to 3 feet per year of vertical displacement 
        and minor horizontal movement. This observation indicates that movement 
        is not initiated by the weight of material at the head. The saturated 
        conditions at the toe cause a liquid condition of the soil material which 
        will flow the 400 feet downslope to Buck Creek.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For engineering and 
        discussion purposes four soil units were identified. A brief description 
        of the units follows:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Soil Unit A1 (SU-A1)-<u>Silty 
          sand</u>, damp to wet, plastic, USCS: SM(material of failure masses).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Soil Unit A2 (SU-A2)-<u>Silty 
          sand with rock fragments</u>, damp to moist,plastic, USCS: SM-GM.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Soil Unit B (SU-B)-<u>Rock 
          fragments with silty sand,</u> plastic, USCS: GM-GW.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Soil Unit F (SU-F)-<u>Fill 
          material</u>: silty sand with rock fragments, damp tomoist, plastic, 
          includes aggregate surfacing.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interpretation of 
        the data obtained by the subsurface exploration is believed to confirm 
        the failure mass as translational with water pressure at the failure surface. 
        The SPT results indicate a failure zone of 1 foot or less. The initial 
        drilling in October 1984 indicated no water in the failure zone of Area 
        A. The shearing of the water monitoring pipes in December 1984 provided 
        the location of the failure surface. However, the actual water pressure 
        at the failure surface could not be determined reliably from the sheared 
        pipes (because of leakage and blockage). Followup drilling in March 1986 
        confirmed water at the failure surface within a zone of artesian pressure. 
        The water pressure head measured at the failure surface (sealed ADH-14A) 
        was similar to the head measured in piezometers sealed near the top of 
        the water zone (ADH-14B, 14C). This indicates a common water source for 
        the horizontal soil layers noted in the drilling investigation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Water pressure heads 
        inside Area A vary less than measurements taken in the outside areas. 
        In Area A the water pressure heads measured in the upper section of the 
        failure mass increase 1 to 2 feet from summer to winter. Water flow at 
        the toe area of the failure falls off sharply in the summer (soil is damp; 
        no functioning water observation pipes). The maximum rise in water level 
        in Area A was monitored using ground-up cork placed in an observation 
        pipe. Observations of water pressure head outside Area A show increases 
        of 2-8 feet from summer to winter.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The conclusion is 
        that subsurface water from outside of Area A, increased by winter rains, 
        is forced into permeable zones of Area A from all sides, and possibly 
        from below. Water flow in Area A may occur as parallel artesian flow separated 
        by a less permeable zone. Over the wet season, the less permeable zone 
        will become saturated, and the subsurface water will become more like 
        a "ground water table." Increased subsurface water has lowered the effective 
        soil strength, which allows failure to occur. This interpretation is based 
        on observations of the varying subsurface water conditions during drilling 
        and over two to four winter seasons. Supporting evidence is provided by 
        the observation during the summer of relatively unchanged subsurface water 
        conditions at the head of the failure and a drained toe of the failure 
        mass. Therefore, the rise in water pressure head outside of Area A must 
        contribute to the water found in the toe during the winter by restricting 
        the summertime drainage paths.</font></p></td>

    <td width="80%"> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        failure was analyzed as a translational block, with a rotational toe and 
        head, and residual shear strength mobilized to resist the movement. The 
        location of the failure surface was established from an analysis of field 
        data and observations. Residual strength theory was used as the basis 
        for the strength parameters obtained through a back-calculation analysis 
        at the moment of failure (factor of safety equal to 1.00). The hypothesized 
        mechanism of failure begins when increased subsurface water from outside 
        of Area A restricts available drainage paths of the toe area. The water 
        pressure then increases to a level sufficient to initiate failure.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The shear strength 
        in the failure zone of Area A has been decreasing over time as a result 
        of large horizontal displacements. A factor of safety was obtained using 
        the friction angle and cohesion value based on laboratory and field strength 
        tests, and values for similar local soils. Residual strength values were 
        obtained by assuming no cohesion and a friction angle within the range 
        given by figure 4C.12 (PI=18), to obtain a back-calculated factor of safety 
        of 1.</font></p></td>

      Alternatives</b></font></td>
    <td width="80%"> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Five 
        potentially feasible alternatives were considered to stop the movement 
        and provide a stable roadway. Two alternatives which proved to be infeasible 
        were to shift the alignment and remove the fill (analysis showed no gain 
        in stability) and to realign the road through the marsh area (environmentally 
        unacceptable to damage wetlands). A description of each feasible alternative 
        is presented here, and a summary of the alternatives is presented in <a href="Table_6.4.1">table 
        6.4.1</a>. Probabilities of success of stabilization were subjectively 
        assigned to each of the alternative outcomes based on the use of the conservative 
        separate ground water model. This model considers that ground water flow 
        may not be continuous, an artesian condition may exist, and the toe area 
        may be influenced during the winter months, creating a separate water 
        source from that under the road.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Alternative A-continue 
        with maintenance ("do nothing")</u>. Repair consists of blading and shaping. 
        Minimal aggregate should be added to restore a smooth grade. Continued 
        failure will produce deepening of existing vertical sag curve. An unusual 
        storm event (such as rapid snowmelt or a 50-year event) increases the 
        probability of a complete debris flow failure involving up to 45,000 cubic 
        yards of soil.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Alternative B-excavate 
        for a shear trench below the roadway</u>. Replace the excavated material 
        using select borrow material from Powder Creek Quarry. There is a moderate 
        probability that water may re-enter the area from the sides or from below. 
        A failure at the toe area would resume the resource damage and eventually 
        affect the roadway.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Alternative C-rock 
        buttress at the toe.</u> Excavate a foundation at the toe and place a 
        rock buttress. This alternative is not influenced by direction of water 
        flow entering the failure area, but placement of a buttress below the 
        road is infeasible due to the depth to the failure surface.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Alternative D-drill 
        and install horizontal drains at the toe.</u> A drill pad and access road 
        would have to be constructed. Access would be limited to May through October 
        (FOS=1.10) due to saturated conditions at the toe. A dual-tier drain design 
        increases the probability of draining water at the failure surface regardless 
        of the direction from which water enters. There is a moderate probability 
        that a circular failure at the toe could shear the drains and block the 
        drainage.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><u>Alternative E-drill 
        and install piles at the toe</u>. Placement of piles at the toe protects 
        Area A from further resource damage. Placement from below the road would 
        increase the depth of drilling. This alternative is not influenced by 
        direction of water flow.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The recommended preferred 
        alternative is to drill and install horizontal drains at the toe (alternative 
        D). This alternative is the most cost-effective based on an expected monetary 
        value (EMV) analysis that considers probabilities of failure/success and 
        anticipated resource damage. If movement at the toe cannot be halted with 
        the drains, then alternatives B and C would also likely not succeed. If 
        the drains are not fully successful in stopping the movement, a much smaller 
        buttress than that required in alternative C may be considered. However, 
        a high degree of control would be needed not to damage the installed horizontal 
        drains.</font></p></td>

    <td width="80%"> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        Powder Creek Basin is an area of past instability reactivated by major 
        disturbances in the past 25 years. The location of Road 2120 at the toe 
        of this basin makes the alignment vulnerable to mass movements of reactivated 
        ancient failures. The material in the failure zone has shown a reduction 
        in strength with increasing displacement. It is believed that this strength 
        reduction has reached its lowest value, which is not a stabilizing effect 
        by itself. Failures driven by the subsurface water will continue and may 
        be accelerated by activities which increase the subsurface flow further 
        up the drainage. It is felt that the failing grade of Road 2120 through 
        Area A can be treated with a high probability of success.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The recommendation 
        to repair the failing grade on Road 2120 and to minimize resource damage 
        at the site is to install horizontal drains (alternative D). This alternative 
        is the most cost-effective and has a high probability of success. In addition 
        to installing the drains, adequate ditch drainage must be improved through 
        Area A. This can be accomplished by use of a trench/pipe drain or a vertical 
        curve improvement.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is further recommended 
        that the area be monitored and all activities in the area be examined 
        for their effects on the subsurface water flow. No live vegetation should 
        be removed from the failure areas. The geotechnical group should be consulted 
        for technical input for future sale activity and road construction in 
        the upper reaches of the Powder Creek Basin.</font></p></td>
