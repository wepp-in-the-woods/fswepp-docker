      <b>6H.2 Advantages and Disadvantages</b> </font> </td>
    <td> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a general sense, 
        the advantages of stabilizing a failing rock slope or one which has a 
        high potential for failure may be obvious: it reduces risk of injury to 
        the public, reduces maintenance costs, and reduces the possibility of 
        road closure. In more specific cases, stabilizing or rehabilitating aging 
        rock slopes may enhance fisheries' environments by reducing sediment yield 
        to streams (shotcrete applications and scaling), may reduce the agency's 
        liability in the event of a tort claim from a rockfall injury, and may 
        prevent severe environmental damage by preventing large-scale structural 
        discontinuities from daylighting in the slope due to small-scale failures. 
        </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are some disadvantages 
        that must be considered in choosing a design alternative. Rock bolt installation 
        often involves a drill rig suspended from a large crane, which may block 
        traffic. Scaling operations involve road closure as well due to loose 
        rock falling on the roadway. Artificial support and containment systems, 
        such as screening, bolting, and shotcrete applications, although well 
        engineered, are obviously not a natural component of the slope and can 
        be visually disadvantageous. </font> </p></td>

      for stabilization design is also that needed in the stability analysis. 
      Sizes, lengths, angles, and loads on bolts; square feet of retaining screen; 
      cubic yards of shotcrete; and crew scaling hours all depend on an accurate 
      representation of the slope geometry, defined by design segments (see figure 
      <a href="#Fig_6H.1">6H.1</a>). These design segments are defined during 
      the mapping phase of the project by horizontal and vertical determination 
      of the mass structural geology characteristics, local discontinuities, and 
      individual structural blocks. Outcrop mapping upslope, and discontinuity 
      mapping by horizontal/vertical line and cell methods, must be used in order 
      to define the geometry. </font> </td>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hydrostatic forces 
        created by water-filled tension cracks can cause rock slope failure. Slopes 
        should be evaluated for the presence of tension cracks and for water sources 
        upslope. Simple upslope interceptor and diversion trenches can often improve 
        slope drainage. Care must be taken to consider long-term maintenance of 
        open trenches. Cut-and-cover designs using clean open-graded fabric-wrapped 
        gravel will reduce long-term maintenance problems. </font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Geometry</b> 
        </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By changing the geometry 
        (steepness and alignment) of the construction slope, the resulting intersections 
        of planar, wedge, and toppling discontinuities may be designed to avoid 
        critical dip angles. Markland's test for kinematic possibility of failure 
        is useful for determining critical slope angles and directions but does 
        not account for apparent cohesion or pore pressures (see section <a href="ssg_3c.html#3C.2">3C.2</a> 
        for a structural analysis discussion). </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Changing geometry 
        may require blasting followed by mechanical scaling of the slope to remove 
        loose rock fragments. Controlled blasting methods using pre-split designs 
        should be used to prevent over-break of the final slope face. Hand scaling 
        of the slope should be completed after blasting in order to remove all 
        of the loose rock and vegetation and prevent root-wedging. Any trees growing 
        within 10 to 15 feet of the slope crest should be removed to prevent wind-levering 
        of rocks at the slope crest. </font> </p></td>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Excess pore-water 
        pressures are often the cause of rock slope failure. Reducing the excess 
        pore pressure results in an increase in normal force and stability. Slopes 
        should be evaluated for the presence of seepage on the face through the 
        discontinuities. Horizontal drains are also effective in reducing pore 
        pressures and improving overall drainage. If horizontal drains are anticipated 
        with the installation of rock bolts or dowels, it is advantageous to locate 
        specific sites during the drilling phase of rock bolt installation (see 
        section <a href="ssg_6d.html">6D</a> for drainage discussion). </font>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As discussed in section 
        <a href="ssg_5h.html">5H</a>, tensioned rock bolts improve stability by 
        applying an additional normal and upslope force component on the failure 
        plane by transfer of load through tension on the bolt and compression 
        on the face bearing plate analogous to a pair of pliers pinching a deck 
        of playing cards. Two popular types of tensioned bolts are: </font> </p>
      <ul>
        <li> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those with mechanical 
          expansion shell anchors located at the base of the bolt which anchor 
          it in place at the bottom of the drill hole and allow for tensioning. 
          Corrosion protection is accomplished by pumping cement grout through 
          a small-diameter center hole in hollow-core bolts (see figure <a href="#Fig_6H.2">6H.2</a>).

          break and encapsulate the bolt. The quick-setting resin hardens in less 
          than 3 minutes, allowing the bolt to be tensioned and locked into place

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Portland cement concrete 
        applied to the slope by pneumatically blowing it through a nozzle is termed 
        shotcrete, or gunite, depending on whether the concrete is premixed or 
        mixed with water as it is applied to the slope. The process requires operator 
        experience and skill in order to prevent rebound (mix that bounces off 
        of the slope due to either excessive pressure or the nozzle being too 
        close to the slope). Quality control must be maintained by gauging thickness 
        and sampling for unconfined compressive strength. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shotcrete is applied 
        to slopes with weaker interbedded material to prevent spalling and eventual 
        development of overhangs and to slopes with a large number of open discontinuities 
        that produce a "diced" effect that spalls easily. Steel, polypropylene, 
        or fiberglass reinforcing fibers are mixed with the concrete to increase 
        strength. Short sections of rebar are installed in the slope prior to 
        application to act as hangars. Weep holes should be provided to prevent 
        hydrostatic forces from building behind the shotcrete. Rules of thumb 
        are: a maximum 12 to 15 percent rebound is allowed; the nozzle should 
        be approximately 5 feet from the slope and remain horizontal; and the 
        final thickness should be greater than 3-1/2 inches to prevent spalling 
        of the concrete (see figure <a href="#Fig_6H.5">6H.5</a>). </font> </p></td>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Free-hanging or reinforced 
        wire screening can be installed on rock slopes which have a potential 
        for continual rockfall and ravel. Use of "chain link" type of fabric is 
        not recommended due to the potential of complete vertical disassembly 
        in the event of a tear. Double- or triple-twisted gabion wire is now widely 
        used due to its flexibility, ease of handling, and durability. When a 
        tear or puncture occurs, it does not expand further than the diameter 
        of the hole (see figure 6H.6). </font> </p></td>

        barriers at mid-slope or slope toes may be installed in areas of critical 
        rock fall with long upslope runout areas. CRSP (Colorado Rockfall Simulation 
        Program ver. 4.0 1993) is useful in evaluating these types of slopes and 
        in designing barriers. Some barriers consist of heavy wire rope netting, 
        such as that used by defense agencies as submarine nets, supported by 
        anchored steel supports. Others consist of simple free-standing bin-type 
        walls filled with earth. </font> </p>

        from the criteria developed by Ritchie (1963). Depth may be increased 
        by excavation or by installing gabion baskets or Jersey-type concrete
