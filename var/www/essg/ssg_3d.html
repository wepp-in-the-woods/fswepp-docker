        The success and effectiveness of any subsurface investigation depend upon 
        many factors, which cannot all be addressed adequately to deal with the 
        variables presented by nature, politics, money, time, and skill level. 
        Therefore, this chapter presents some of the methods proven to be effective 
        within typical Forest Service projects and introduces some philosophies 
        or ways to think about the project. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Perhaps the most 
        important concept is that sufficient pre-investigation work must be done 
        in defining the scope and scale of the project, the probable mechanism 
        of failure, the types of soil and rock involved, the ground water regime, 
        and the best method to prove your hypotheses of subsurface conditions. 
        For this reason, the concepts described earlier in this chapter involving 
        problem definition, the scientific method, material classification, and 
        surface investigation were presented before introducing ideas relating 
        to subsurface investigation. Simply stated, the subsurface investigation 
        and exploration should be used to confirm and refine your model rather 
        than develop it. </font> 
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Ideally, in addition 
        to confirming the subsurface model developed by your surface investigation, 
        the subsurface investigation will address the feasibility of various treatment 
        alternatives. Therefore, during the surface investigation and job prescription 
        you should consider what treatment options are feasible considering slope 
        geometry, funding opportunities, and potential socioeconomic impacts. 
        The subsurface investigation should balance material modeling with potential 
        treatment options. </font> </p></td>

        Often the choice of tools for use in the subsurface investigation for 
        a particular slope stability project is a function of time, access, money, 
        equipment availability, and risk (socioeconomic consequences of failure). 
        A good rule of thumb when selecting tools and methods for subsurface investigations 
        is that the degree of precision should be directly proportional to the 
        risk (see section 6I for a full discussion of risk analysis). </font> 
      </p>
      <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A combination 
        of exploration tools can be used to increase the degree of confidence 
        as the site complexity and degree of risk increase. Each tool has inherent 
        limitations, but the combination of tools should balance the limitations 
        by setting up a system of checks and balances. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The following is 
        a list and description of tools used effectively on Forest Service projects. 
        This is not intended to be an exhaustive list, nor should it (in combination 
        with the numerous tools noted in the references cited at the end of this 
        chapter) be considered complete. Be innovative! The most important contribution 
        that geotechnical practitioners in this organization can make to science 
        is the development of inexpensive, innovative methods to determine subsurface 
        conditions. </font> </td>

      The most portable and available pieces of equipment for the subsurface investigation 
      -- a hand shovel, pick, sledge hammer, and rebar -- also happen to be the 
      most inexpensive. Of course, these tools provide only near-surface information 
      unless you have a lot of time and a strong back. By digging a hole, soil 
      samples can be obtained for field or lab classification, moisture characteristics 
      can be determined, and an estimate can be made of in-place strength by the 
      use of handheld equipment (torvane, pocket penetrometer, Ely volumeter, 
      etc.). See section <a href="ssg_4c.html">4C</a> for further discussion of 
      these tools. Tables <a href="#Table_3D.1">3D.1</a> and <a href="#Table_3D.2">3D.2</a>

    <td colspan="4" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="514"> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        One of the most common tools used during preliminary subsurface investigation 
        is the hand auger. There are many varieties available, but, regardless 
        of the variety, it should be durable, lightweight, and portable (ideally 
        with the ability to be broken down into parts small enough to be carried 
        easily and safely through various terrains). With experience, one can 
        use the auger not only to retrieve remolded soil samples for material 
        and moisture characteristics, but also to obtain an estimate of soil strength 
        at depth by the ease of penetration, both by rotating the auger and applying 
        moderate body weight to the auger without rotation. Remember to bring 
        plastic bags for sample collection. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> During advancement 
        of the auger in dense material, it is possible to tighten the coupling 
        threads to the point that they cannot be uncoupled in the field. It also 
        is possible to strip the threads if too much force is exerted. If the 
        auger is advanced obliquely past a rock fragment, it may be impossible 
        to withdraw it without rotating the auger backwards (which can unscrew 
        a coupling). Take the time to clean the auger screws by hand after each 
        withdrawal. Banging the auger against a tree or rock can break it. </font> 
      </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> These minor drawbacks 
        should not discourage you from using a hand auger, though. It is probably 
        the most cost-effective tool for rapid determination of soil type and 
        characteristics in the upper 10 feet of the soil profile. </font> </p></td>

      One of the most promising innovations developed recently is the drive probe. 
      The equipment is inexpensive and for the most part available at your local

      of soils projects. It yields relative strength characteristics and can serve 
      as an observation well for ground water monitoring. A correlation between 
      the drive probe and standard penetration testing (which is covered in section 
      <a href="#3D.5.6">3D.5.6</a>) is being sought. You are encouraged to perform 
      a drive probe test adjacent to a standard penetration testing hole and send 
      the hole logs of each to the Willamette National Forest, which is serving 
      as a clearinghouse for the information. A report on the construction and

    <td colspan="4" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="514"> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Seismic 
        investigations depend on the propagation of waves in an elastic medium. 
        An elastic wave or ground motion is induced by a small energy source (either 
        a hammer and strike plate or explosives) and detected by a sensitive transducer 
        called a geophone (USDA, 1976). The amount of time necessary for this 
        wave to reach the geophone increases as the distance between the energy 
        source and detector increases. Any deviation from an assumed homogeneous, 
        isotropic condition can be interpreted to indicate changes in depth and 
        nature of the subsurface geologic unit or units. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two or three horizons 
        can be detected to depths of 30 to 100 feet, depending on the equipment 
        used and the distance between geophones (USDA, 1969). With experience 
        and comparison with field and lab data (primarily densities), interpretations 
        can be made for a variety of geologic conditions. Interpretation of data 
        improves markedly with experience. However, some important limitations 
        exist. Sufficient pre-exploration work should be done to allow for an 
        initial subsurface interpretation prior to running seismic lines. Density 
        or velocity of site materials must increase with depth; refractive seismographs 
        are ineffective or of severely limited use when you try to work through 
        asphalt, concrete, frozen soil, or any layer underlying a denser one. 
        Also, data gathering may be impeded by weather (for example, wind, background 
        noise, cold batteries, etc). </font> </p></td>

        of subsurface conditions (USDA, 1969). This method works because earth 
        materials are good conductors of electricity and conduct in proportion 
        to their content of water or moisture (AASHTO, 1988) and dissolved salts 
        or free ions. Massive rock formations and dry gravels and sand are poor 
        conductors (with high resistivity) whereas moist soil, including clay 
        and silt, (containing both water and dissolved ions) is a good conductor 
        (with low resistivity).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The depth of investigation 
        by this method can be controlled by the user. Shallow investigations are 
        carried out by placing the electrodes relatively close together, whereas 
        deeper investigations require increased spacing between electrodes. There 
        is no theoretical limit to the depth of investigation, but instrument 
        sensitivity generally limits the useful depths to 100 to 200 feet (Bison 
        Instruments, 1969)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
        investigative method has an advantage over the seismic method in that 
        there are no masked layers because of any density or resistivity changes, 
        and it is unaffected by frozen ground. </font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One drawback of the electrical 
      resistivity method as compared to the seismic method is that it entails 
      a more complicated determination of depths of resistivity changes. Also, 
      natural currents (oxidized ore bodies or corroding buried metal) and artificial 
      currents (electrical installations) may affect readings. A serious limitation 
      of electrical resistivity investigations is the requirement that the interfaces 
      (material boundaries) and the ground surface be parallel or nearly parallel; 
      no dip discontinuities are allowed (USDA, 1969).</font></td>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A determination of 
        the equipment necessary to obtain information about subsurface conditions

        each method has limitations that depend on site materials and the type

        of some sort is necessary, possibly requiring an interdisciplinary examination 
        of the site to define the environmental constraints under which all ground-disturbing 
        activities will comply. Given those general guidelines, access roads for 
        drilling equipment must be constructed with sufficient width and grade 
        to accommodate the probable type of drill rig without adversely affecting 
        the stability of the slope. Drilling pads also need to be constructed 
        to allow enough working room and good footing for the crew. A 30- by 25-foot 
        pad is generally large enough to handle a drill, portable water source,

      Drilling Operations</font></b></td>
    <td colspan="4" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="514"> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Safety 
        is the most important aspect of any drilling operation. The job of the 
        inspector of drilling operations is not only to create a safe working 
        environment by access and drill pad preparation, but to plan and monitor 
        the operations for safe procedures and work habits. The drill crew will 
        likely do its best to accomplish the intent of your request, so your request 
        must be reasonable. The inspector must be aware of overhead dangers and 
        that the crew has probably worked together for some time and have well-rehearsed 
        procedures and movements. The inspector should stay out of their way and 
        make eye contact before entering the working area. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is also the inspector's 
        responsibility to develop and maintain a good working relationship with 
        the drillers. Before the drill enters the site, it is a good idea to hold 
        an informal meeting (jelly doughnuts are a good ice breaker) and outline 
        what the purpose of the investigation is, what constraints they will be 
        working under, what they will be asked to do and why, and what is expected 
        of them and the drilling inspector. Create an environment in which the 
        drill crew feels free to ask questions or suggest alternatives, but be 
        clear that the inspector makes the final decisions, within reason. The 
        drill crew is likely to have more experience in drilling operations than 
        the inspector; listen and incorporate their ideas. A drill crew recognized 
        for its value will produce a better work environment and product. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As operations begin, 
        make sure that you are prepared and have all the equipment and information 
        necessary to record information and make informed, correct decisions. 
        Have a copy of your interpreted drawings and drafting equipment available 
        and know the potential variables of your model. Record and serially alter 
        your interpretation on your drawings. Once drilling begins, operations 
        and information come quickly.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Remember to dress 
        appropriately for the weather and working environment. A good rule of 
        thumb is that the degree of accuracy and thoroughness in an investigation 
        is directly proportional to personal comfort. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following is a 
        brief description of the most common drilling exploration methods used

        on the procedures and applications of these methods. The directions for 
        accomplishing your task are not contained in any single publication or 
        standard, so we suggest that you read several of these articles, as well 
        as the AASHTO and ASTM standards, before you begin drilling operations.

      Core Drilling</font></b></td>
    <td colspan="4" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="514"> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Core 
        drilling can be used for obtaining samples of rock units and some soil 
        units that are either too hard to sample by soil sampling techniques or 
        that contain a significant amount of cobble-sized or larger rock fragments. 
        In the latter case, the material retrieved from the core barrel is probably 
        representative of the rock fragments encountered, because finer material 
        may be washed out by the circulation fluid.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several methods can 
        be used to improve the recovery of finer material. Most rotary core barrels 
        used are the double-tube type, which is basically a single-tube barrel 
        with a separate inner liner. The most recent advance in rotary core barrel 
        design is the triple-tube core barrel, which adds another separate, non-rotating 
        liner to the double-tube core barrel. This liner, which retains the sample, 
        consists of a clear plastic solid tube or a split thin-metal liner. Each 
        is capable of increased sample recovery in poor quality rock or semi-cemented 
        soils, while minimizing sample handling and disturbance during removal 
        of the core barrel. The use of "drilling mud," with its specific gravity 
        and viscosity greater than water, will assist in sample retention (Ruda 
        and Basscher, 1990). Note that using these fluid additives can limit the 
        effectiveness of ground water monitoring devices by sealing the hole with 
        a filter (mud) cake. This filter cake can be removed by using normal mechanical 
        well development techniques or by the addition of polyphosphates. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Information about 
        soil characteristics can be obtained by other exploration methods in conjunction 
        with core drilling. This is accomplished by using drill steel of sufficient 
        diameter to allow testing equipment or samplers through the annulus. Once 
        a boulder or hard layer has been penetrated by core drilling, the drill 
        steel can be uncoupled and the equipment or sampler lowered to the desired 
        depth. One drawback to this method is that circulating fluid is required 
        for core drilling, so information relevant to ground water is not readily 
        apparent, and the moisture content of the retrieved sample may not be 
        representative of subsurface conditions. A less desirable method can be 
        used in conditions where larger diameter drill steel is unavailable. The 
        procedure consists of simply asking the driller to stop rotation of the 
        drill steel and to advance the hole by gentle downward pressure. The inner 
        barrel (for double- or triple-tube drilling) must be retrieved before 
        resumption of drilling and fluid circulation so the sample is not washed 
        out. This method is most effective for retrieval of cohesive samples, 
        and a relative idea of the strength of the material can be gained by the 
        ease of penetration with constant downward pressure. The drawback of this 
        method is that there is a risk of plugging the bit and fouling the locking 
        mechanism of the inner barrel, either of which will require pulling the 
        drill string for cleaning. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An alternative to 
        core drilling using circulating fluid is the ODEX system, which uses the 
        principles of standard percussive drilling equipment but has been modified 
        to facilitate the installation of heavy duty, removable casing for borehole 
        stabilization in conjunction with the drilling operation (Ruda and Basscher, 
        1990). The drill tool can be withdrawn into the casing. The advantage 
        of this system is that hole advancement is more rapid than core drilling, 
        and testing or sampling can be performed at depth without the influence 
        of circulating fluid. The disadvantage is that limited information is 
        available during advancement of the hole. This can be moderated, as with 
        any percussive drilling methods, by recording advance rates and logging 
        the chips and dust that are returned to the surface. </font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another useful piece 
      of information regarding soil characteristics that can be derived from core 
      drilling is the permeability of the soil. This can be done in a couple of 
      ways. The first is to watch the return of the circulating fluid to the surface. 
      It is likely that surface circulation will be lost at some point, due either 
      to the permeability of the soil near the surface or to interception of a 
      more permeable layer at depth. In the latter case, knowledge of the permeability 
      of that layer can be obtained by stopping advancement and uncoupling the 
      steel to perform either a falling-head or constant-head test. It is useful 
      to fill the drill steel with water before breaks, lunch, and at the end 
      of shifts, then to measure water levels at the resumption of drilling. Keep 
      in mind that the addition of "driller's mud" will have an effect on permeability.

      Augering</font></b></td>
    <td colspan="4" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="514"> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Augering 
        is another common method of subsurface exploration for soil projects. 
        It allows the advancement of a hole and retrieval of remolded soil samples 
        and indicates where water is encountered. Procedures for the use of auger 
        systems are covered by AASHTO T 203-82 (1990) and ASTM D 1452-80 (1987); 
        hollow-stem augers are covered by AASHTO T 251-77 (1981). By watching 
        the advancement of the hole at constant downward pressure (adjusted to 
        compensate for the weight of the auger string) and listening to the sound 
        produced, you can gain an idea of the relative strength changes with depth 
        and the type of material present, respectively. One drawback of augering 
        is that it does not give a precise depth at which the water or soil was 
        encountered, particularly in cohesive soil. We suggest that while watching 
        the rate of advance of the auger, you note a reference point on the mast 
        relative to something other than the auger to avoid Barber Pole Syndrome 
        (the eyes tend to follow the apparent upward movement of the auger and 
        lose their focal point). </font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hollow-stem augering 
      is often used in conjunction with standard penetration testing. Two 18-inch 
      drives are followed by advancing the auger to that depth. The use of hollow-stem 
      augers has the advantages of providing a means of ensuring that the hole 
      is vertical, reducing skin friction on the drill steel, and providing greater 
      reliability that the soil sample in the split barrel is from the desired 
      depth. Augers also can pass through obstructions. Rubber O-rings can be 
      installed at the connection of individual flights to reduce water inflow 
      above the bottom of the hole. The development of removable auger bits, retrievable 
      through the annulus of the augers, has greatly improved the efficiency of 
      operations. </font> </td>

        a wide variety of other reference materials.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Effective SPT is much 
        more complicated than the procedures in the references portray. Therefore, 
        it is especially important that the geotechnical specialist has all of 
        the equipment and pre-drilling interpretative work organized and available 
        before operations begin. At a minimum, the specialist will observe and 
        document drilling operations, classify material, select and prepare samples, 
        prepare field logs, and modify pre-drilling interpretation on drawings. 
        Additional duties often include removal of samples and cleaning of the 
        split spoon.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recommended equipment 
        includes: a water resistant field book, several pencils, rags, a 5 gallon 
        bucket of water for cleaning hands and equipment, knife, hand lens, permanent 
        markers (felt pens or grease pencils), baby food jars, sample containers, 
        lab tags, propane stove, classification charts, blow count conversion 
        charts, water level measuring device, and surveying equipment.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is valuable to 
        observe the penetration distance with each blow. This is particularly 
        true when rock fragments, which may result in blow counts not representative 
        of subsurface conditions.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is best to perform 
      drilling operations during a season providing the most information, such 
      as when the subsurface water system has recharged. This allows observation 
      of subsurface conditions more representative of failure conditions; it also 
      provides better reliability in setting up a water monitoring system. Unfortunately, 
      access may not be practical due to snow or soil strengths that are too low 
      to support drilling equipment. An important observation to be made during 
      drilling is the character, location, and behavior of water. Note whether 
      the water content of the soil gradually increases or is in a particular 
      zone or discontinuity. Upon encountering water, it is often valuable to 
      stop operations for a few minutes to observe whether the water level rises 
      or is static. Also, measure and record the water level before breaks, lunch, 
      at end of shift, and again at the resumption of hole advancement. Samples 
      collected for moisture content should be placed in a tight, waterproof container

        drilling operations, observations, and subsequent monitoring, the extent 
        and nature of the ground water regime should be determined. One of the 
        most important observations to be made is whether individual ground water 
        surfaces are perched, confined, or phreatic. The significance of these 
        measurements and their effects on slope stability will be explained and 
        discussed in section <a href="ssg_4e.html">4E</a>.</font></p>

        for equipment and procedures for installation of ground water monitoring 
        devices. A few of the more useful ones are included in the reference list 
        at the end of this section. Familiarization with several references, as 
        well as pertinent state regulations regarding monitoring holes, is recommended. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some guiding principles 
        for ground water monitoring device installation are: (1) Use clean sand 
        for backfill to decrease the chance of bridging; (2) Wash backfill down 
        the hole with plenty of water; (3) Take frequent depth measurements; (4) 
        Allow time for sand or bentonite pellets to settle out; and (5) Consider 
        coated or specialized bentonite pellets for deeper installations to reduce 
        the chance of pellets adhering to one another during descent.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Upon completion of 
        installation, clearly label the hole, measure the installed depth, and 
        check for deflections in the casing. This can be done by lowering a length 
        of pipe to the bottom of the hole. A 1/2 inch- by 4 foot-length of conduit 
        tied to a measuring tape is effective. A shorter (6-inch) conduit works 
        well for measuring water levels. A distinctive sound is heard when the 
        annulus of the conduit encounters the water surface. It is also useful 
        to measure the length of pipe sticking out of the ground. On several occasions, 
        slope movement without pipe shear has resulted in changes in length above 
        the surface. To check whether the ground water monitoring device is functioning 
        properly, fill the pipe with water periodically to see that the measured 
        depth can be repeated. Remember, it may take some time for the seals to 
        become functional if bentonite pellets or chunks are used. </font></p>

      of the intended function of the casing, the relationship between its outside

        distinguish between confined and unconfined aquifers during drilling and 
        to determine the depth limits of each. This is necessary for proper slotting 
        and sealing of the drill hole to access and isolate the aquifer (figure 
        <a href="#Fig_3D.2">3D.2</a>). The deeper confined aquifer can be isolated 
        and monitored only if: (1) the casing is slotted and backfilled with drainage 
        aggregate through the aquifer thickness, (2) the casing is unslotted from 
        there to the ground surface, and (3) the backfill is sealed within the 
        confining layer that confines the aquifer. Installation of the casing 
        to access the upper unconfined aquifer is less critical because it extends 
        to the ground surface; the casing can be: (1) slotted to within 18 inches 
        of the ground surface and backfilled with drainage aggregate and (2) unslotted 
        and sealed with bentonite (to prevent surface water from infiltrating 
        the backfill) from there to the ground surface.</font></p>

        (with specified slot width) lengths; however, because the slotted and 
        unslotted couplings must be placed at the appropriate depths in the field, 
        preslotting is sometimes of little advantage. This casing is also relatively 
        expensive. For most installations, standard 1-inch PVC pipe, available 
        at hardware stores in 20-foot lengths, is more economical and perfectly 
        satisfactory. At the site, slots can be made with a hacksaw at the aquifer

        recommended to allow installation of the piezometer sensor (which remains 
        in the well) with adequate space remaining for the sensor of a resistivity 
        meter during periodic manual checks. All pertinent data-such as casing 
        size and type, slotting depth, drainage aggregate type and depth and soil

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 200-foot section 
        of the road accessing the Mill Creek drainage dropped about 6 inches in 
        late winter (about 1973). The landslide area was cleared and several holes 
        were drilled with a 4-inch o.d. auger. Perforated plastic pipes were installed 
        in all the holes similar to A in figure 3D.2. A 30-day strip chart recorder 
        with a water level float was installed on one hole near the center of 
        the slide area. The maximum water level came to within 12 feet of the 
        ground surface. A stability analysis was performed using site geometry, 
        measured ground water levels, and back-calculated strength parameters. 
        The analysis indicated removal of landslide material above the road would 
        increase the stability of the slide. Removal of 10-15 feet of material 
        resulted in the road dropping about 2 feet and moving toward Mill Creek. 
        Ground movement was evident in several directions, but none in the direction 
        expected from the surface geometry and the stability analysis. Ground 
        surface cracks indicated up to seven interconnected sliding areas existed 
        within the main slide area.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We then suspected 
        a deep, confined aquifer with high water pressure was involved. The area 
        was redrilled using a wireline core drill with soil samples taken through 
        the core barrel. A new drill hole located near the center of the slide 
        (near the previously auger hole with the water level recorder) told the 
        rest of the story. At about the 50-foot depth during drilling, the drill 
        rod dropped about 5 feet with no effort, and entered a black organic layer 
        followed by a clayey layer. A confined aquifer piezometer (B in figure 
        <a href="#Fig_3D.2">3D.2</a>) was installed. The water level rose to the 
        ground surface, a full 12 feet higher than in the nearby auger hole. A 
        permeable rocky zone at 12-foot depth had allowed ground water to escape 
        from the original holes. Re-analysis of the landslide with the new ground 
        water information confirmed that we would destabilize the slide if we 
        removed landslide material above the road.</font></p>

        Based on what could be measured at the site, the estimated cost of the 
        corrections ranged from $3 to $7 million. The consultant's report indicated 
        that the ground water level or pore water pressure was likely higher than 
        had been measured in order to cause the slide to move as it was moving. 
        One key indicator was water seepage noted above the road level, but not 
        picked up in the drill holes. Another key indicator was the observation 
        noted in the drill log that the water level in one of the drill holes 
        increased overnight when the hole was partially completed. The water level 
        measured in this hole remained very deep after the hole was completed. 
        These observations indicated one or more perched or confined water levels 
        existed in the landslide.</font></p>

        about the ground water. Multiple ground water zones were measured and 
        the response to rainfall indicated some ground water zones interconnected 
        and some were independent. Pore water pressures equivalent to water near 
        the ground surface were measured deep in the landslide. The information 
        gained from the multiple piezometers allowed the landslide to be stabilized 
        for about $1.1 million in 1976. Stabilization measures included a deep 
        key trench, massive rock buttress with geotextile filter, horizontal drains, 
        and regrading.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The standpipe piezometer 
      installations in figure <a href="#Fig_3D.2">3D.2</a> (A and B) are relatively

      using electric piezometers with a data recorder. These methods are adequate, 
      unless the landslide and related ground water distributions and pore water 
      pressures are complex. Multiple piezometers can be more difficult to install 
      than the standpipe piezometers, and if damaged, cannot be replaced without 
      drilling a new hole. However, two to four piezometers can be installed and 
      isolated from each other in one drill hole, depending on the diameter of 
      the drill hole, the drilling equipment used, and the skill of the personnel. 
      Properly installed multiple piezometers can save drilling costs and improve 
      information collection for complex ground water conditions. Electric piezometers

      an air-driven vibrator that operates inside the casing for this purpose. 
      All pertinent data for the casing should be recorded. Initial readings of 
      displacement should be taken at completion of the casing installation to 
      be the standard of comparison for all subsequent readings.</font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Horizontal 
        Inclinometer </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This instrument is 
        similar to the vertical inclinometer but requires a special sonde and 
        a dead-end cap with a pulley for pulling the sonde into the casing (figure 
        <a href="#Fig_3D.3">3D.3</a>). Plastic "poke holes" (1/2-inch o.d. plastic 
        pipe) have been used to push the horizontal inclinometer into short holes 
        less than 25 feet long) in lieu of the pulley and cable assembly. The 
        casing is usually not placed in a drill hole but installed during construction 
        at various lifts in an embankment. However, in order to distinguish between 
        settlement deflection and subsidence reflection, some drilling is required 
        through the in-situ soil under the embankment, as shown in the figure. 
        In this zone, the annulus between the drill hole and casing must be backfilled 
        by pressure grouting with a lean cement or clay cement grout. The 3.4-inch-o.d. 
        aluminum casing with external couplings is typically used. An additional 
        1/2-inch PVC conduit is required for the permanently installed pull line. 
        The grout injection may force some grout into the aluminum casing at the 
        couplings, the end cap, or the PVC conduit. These should be flushed out 
        with clean water before the grout has hardened. The casing grooves should 
        also be cleaned with a wire brush during the flushing operation.</font></p></td>

      The drilled-in portion of the casing and the pull line conduit should be 
      capped and protected from construction damage just below the ground line. 
      The horizontal and vertical location of the ground surface of the cap location 
      must be referenced off the construction area for later relocation and as 
      a standard for settlement measurement. After the fill has been constructed 
      and compacted to an elevation about 6 inches above the drilled-in casing, 
      the casing can be extended across the fill. The cap is relocated and a trench 
      excavated to conform to the elevation and direction of the drilled-in portion 
      of the casing. The pipe and pull line are then extended to the monitoring 
      location at the fill slope. Backfill of concrete sand is tamped into the 
      trench. Additional concrete sand cover, 6 inches in depth, is placed over 
      the pipe and compacted with a mechanical tamper to protect the casing before 
      the next lift of fill is placed. All pertinent casing data are recorded. 
      Initial readings are taken on the casing at the completion of the drilled-in

        devices are installed during construction of the fill and do not require 
        drilling. However, in order to determine the amount of subsidence of the 
        in-situ soil under the fill it is necessary to drill through the foundation 
        soil. An excellent settlement measurement device utilizes the 3.4-inch-o.d. 
        aluminum vertical inclinometer casing with external telescoping couplings. 
        Lateral displacement can still be measured with the vertical inclinometer, 
        but, in addition, the relative movement between adjacent 5-foot casing 
        lengths can be measured in the coupling space (figure <a href="#Fig_3D.4">3D.4</a>).</font></p></td>

        6-inch settlement flange is attached to each length of casing above ground 
        surface-fill contact in each 5-foot lift of fill. The couplings are riveted 
        only to the lower casing to allow the upper casing section to telescope 
        into the couplings where the displacement can be measured. Installation 
        below the fill should be as described for the vertical inclinometer except 
        that (1) telescoping couplings are used, (2) the casing is grouted or 
        otherwise anchored at the bottom of the hole, and (3) a settlement flange 
        is installed at the ground surface. Metal settlement plates or rings can 
        be installed on plastic casing loosely, without attachment) during placement 
        of the fill and located after construction using an inductance device 
        lowered into the hole. The horizontal and vertical location of the ground 
        surface top-of-casing must be referenced off the construction area for 
        later relocation and as a standard for settlement measurement. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To minimize interference 
        with the construction activity, (1) the casing is installed to near ground 
        surface, (2) the casing is capped for protection until the 5-foot lift 
        of fill is placed over the location, (3) a pit is excavated to the capped 
        casing, (4) the next length of 5-foot casing with a telescoping coupling 
        and settlement flange is installed and the pit backfilled and compacted, 
        and (5) settlement readings are taken on all installed sections. This 
        must be repeated for each 5-foot lift of fill. All pertinent data must 
        be recorded and initial settlement readings taken prior to fill placement 
        and with the completion of each 5-foot lift of fill.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is an inexpensive 
      alternative that allows the measurement of total settlement within the fill 
      and of total subsidence under the fill. It requires permanently anchored, 
      shielded wire line cable extensometers extended up through the fill in 5-foot 
      lifts with 1/2-inch PVC conduit, similar to the vertical inclinometer casing 
      without the telescoping couplings and settlement flanges (figure <a href="#Fig_3D.5">3D.5</a>). 
      Two cables are necessary: one anchored at the base of fill and one below 
      the foundation soil. The cable length to the anchor must be premeasured 
      and permanently marked in the shielding at 5-foot intervals. The horizontal 
      and vertical location of the top-of-ground surface must be referenced off 
      the construction area for later relocations and as a standard for the settlement 
      measurement. The exact length of 1/2-inch PVC pipe must also be measured 
      at each lift to provide a reference for the relative difference between 
      the conduit length and wire line length. The conduit should not extend to 
      the anchor but allow about a 2-foot (or whatever the anticipated range of 
      expected settlement is) gap so that the conduit has room for vertical displacement 
      as the fill settles. Backfilling of the 1/2-inch conduit is not as critical 
      as for the inclinometer casing because lateral displacement will not be 
      measured.</font></td>

    <td colspan="4" height="152" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="514"> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
        are probably as many methods of portraying subsurface information on drilling 
        logs as there are geotechnical practitioners. Numerous software packages 
        that produce high quality products are available. Many forms have been 
        produced by various agencies. But neither the software nor the form guarantees 
        a useful log; that responsibility lies with the person who inspects the 
        drilling operation and produces the final drill log.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The final drill log 
        can be thought of as the final representation of the drilling effort and 
        the site materials. A lot of physical and mental effort goes into each 
        hole, and the log should reflect that. When producing a drill log, consider 
        that another person who uses it may not have access to your memory. As 
        with many tasks where documentation of effort is critical, the following 
        saying is good to remember: "If you did something and you didn't write 
        it down, you didn't do it; if you did something and wrote it down but 
        can't find it, you didn't do it." (Williamson, personal communication). 
        Make sure that your documentation process is thorough and understandable 
        to others. You may not be the last person working on the project. </font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is not necessary to 
      repeat all of the information from each drill hole field log on the final 
      log as long as the field logs are legible, understandable, and accessible, 
      but the final log must contain enough substance to adequately portray the 
      information and interpretations derived from the drilling operation. It 
      is best to use a blend of graphical representation and text description. 
      Graphics can be used to portray boundary conditions (classification, origin 
      and strength changes, water-bearing zones, failure surfaces, etc.). Text 
      can be used to describe material conditions, operational information, and 
      such. It is important that the log have a graduated scale for depth.</font></td>
