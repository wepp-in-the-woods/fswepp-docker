    <td> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reinforced embankments 
        (reinforced fills or mechanically stabilized earth slopes) consist of 
        an embankment fill built up in compacted lifts, with layers of a reinforcing 
        material (geogrid, welded wire, or geotextile) placed throughout the embankment. 
        The reinforcing material adds tensile resistance to local (face) or deep-seated 
        shear failure in the embankment. Reinforced fills placed with a 1H:1V 
        or steeper face slope can offer an economical alternative to retaining 
        structures for those sites where the ground is too steep to catch a conventional 
        1-1/2:1 fill slope, yet is flat enough to catch an oversteep reinforced 
        fill. A slope range from 67 to over 150 percent can be achieved, depending 
        on the reinforcement and facing measures used. Reinforced fill heights 
        have ranged from 15 to 50 feet (5 to 15 m) on forest projects, and the 
        highest fill built anywhere to date is a 115-foot-high (38-m-high) 1:1 
        fill in California. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The spacing of the 
        primary reinforcement is chosen to add the tensile strength needed to 
        support the oversteepened fill slope and to prevent a deep-seated slope 
        failure. Spacing typically varies between 2 feet (0.6 m) and 5 feet (1.5 
        m) and depends on soil parameters, height of the fill, and strength of 
        the reinforcing material. Intermediate reinforcement, placed between layers 
        of the primary reinforcement, typically consists of narrow, e.g., 5-foot-wide 
        (1.5-m-wide), strips of low-strength geogrid placed along the fill face 
        on a 1-foot (0.3-m) vertical spacing. They prevent local failure on the 
        oversteep face between the primary reinforcement layers and prevent failures 
        due to construction equipment loading. <a href="#Fig_6F.1">Figure 6F.1</a>

      <b>6F.1.2 Advantages and Disadvantages</b> </font></td>
    <td> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The primary advantage 
        of a reinforced fill is cost savings through the ability to fit a fill 
        slope on a tight (steep) location. A stable reinforced embankment can 
        be constructed in a location where a conventional 1-1/2:1 fill will not 
        catch, yet a retaining wall and its associated facing costs can be avoided. 
        The cost for reinforced fills has been between that of a conventional 
        fill and a retaining structure needed for that site. Reinforcing materials 
        needed are roughly similar in quantity to those used in a wall, so the 
        principal cost savings come from avoiding use of forms or installation 
        of facing members, both of which are typical in wall construction. </font> 
      </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Installation of 
        the geogrid is quite easy, but commonly geogrid placement requires hand 
        labor. It is important to note that the geogrid must be correctly oriented. 
        Incorrect orientation may lead to a material strength lower than that 
        required by design and can waste money. Some geogrids are biaxial, with 
        the same or similar design tensile strengths in either direction. Others 
        are uniaxial, where one direction is substantially stronger than the other, 
        so correct orientation of this material is critical. All materials should 
        be installed in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. </font>

    <td> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> One disadvantage 
        of geotextiles and geogrids is the unknown long-term behavior of the material. 
        Different manufacturers have different performance histories for their 
        products, but neither the long-term creep characteristics nor the long-term 
        environmental degradation of the synthetics is well known. This issue 
        is a subject of considerable current research and is currently addressed 
        by the practice of applying various environmental and construction factors 
        of safety (FOSes). </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An advantage of reinforced 
        fills is their ability to increase the stability of any slope, particularly 
        after a failure, to improve on the construction behavior of poor-quality 
        soils, such as silts and clays, and to make slopes "fit" when constrained 
        by space. Improved compaction at the edge of the slope by equipment operating 
        on the secondary reinforcement decreases the tendency for surface sloughing 
        and face erosion. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, use of reinforced 
        fills can save on materials if fill material and polymer reinforcement 
        materials can be used in corrosive soils or harsh acidic, saline, or alkaline 
        environments because of their general resistance to chemical degradation.

      <b>6F.1.3 Applications</b> </font> </td>
    <td> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The primary application 
        of reinforced embankments is to construct an embankment with an oversteepened 
        face slope to fit a particular site and avoid the use of a retaining wall. 
        This is primarily a cost consideration. Other applications include sites 
        where the area of disturbance must be minimized, a slope toe is constrained 
        to a particular elevation or limit, or additional fill bench width is 
        needed (with a constrained toe location). Reinforced embankments built 
        into a roadcut have also been used as a drained "buttress" in a limited 
        space application. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reinforcement is 
        also used in the base of embankments as a way to improve the overall embankment 
        foundation stability by creating a "wide footing" over a soft subgrade 
        or poor foundation soils. This application is discussed in such publications 
        as Christopher and Holtz (1984) and is not commonly considered a "slope 
        stabilization" technique, so it will not be further discussed here.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although reinforced 
        embankments are typically constructed with select frictional backfill, 
        successful projects have also been constructed using marginal, silty backfill 
        materials as well as clay-rich plastic materials. The successful use of 
        poor backfill material requires special design and construction considerations 
        discussed later.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reinforcement 
        concept can also be applied in biotechnical slope stabilization where 
        layers of brush or vegetation, such as willows, are built into the fill. 
        This concept is commonly known as brush layering. Vegetation adds slope 
        reinforcement from the woody debris, breaks up the slope for erosion control 
        purposes, and offers long-term root strength for slope stability. Brush 
        layering should be regarded as a superficial slope stabilization measure, 
        rather than a "designed" deep-seated slope reinforcement. However, the 
        concept of primary reinforcement with material such as geogrid plus the 
        use of vegetation in the outer several feet of the lift or as secondary 
        reinforcement is likely ideal. </font> </p></td>

    <td> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Information needed 
        for predesign and design of reinforced fills includes site and materials 
        information similar to that needed for most other slope stabilization 
        alternatives. This includes knowledge of the local site geology, ground 
        water conditions, and mechanism of failure, and having an accurate site 
        cross-section, as outlined in section 3. Information on backfill materials' 
        strength and characteristics-including frictional and cohesive strength 
        parameters, gradation, plasticity, chemical characteristics, and other 
        properties-is typically necessary. Methods of obtaining this information 
        are discussed in section 4 and such other references as Forest Service 
        Retaining Wall Design Guide (1979).</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Information on materials 
        properties such as design long-term strength, creep characteristics, stress-strain 
        relationships, durability, corrosion resistance, and resistance to installation 
        damage is needed on the reinforcing material used in the slope. Much of 
        this information is available from manufacturers' literature, and the 
        topic is the subject of ongoing research. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pullout resistance 
        properties of the reinforcement material in contact with the soil are 
        particularly important for the function of the structure. Pullout resistance 
        is mobilized through a combination of both interface friction and passive 
        soil resistance against transverse elements of a reinforcing grid. Geogrids 
        with a high percentage of open area and thickness to the grid offer the 
        highest passive resistance, while a geotextile primarily mobilizes interface 
        frictional resistance. Pullout resistance design values or factors are 
        typically obtained from pullout tests performed by manufacturers on a 
        range of soil types or on backfill to be used on a large project. Standardized 
        pullout test methods are currently being developed. </font> </p></td>

      <b>6F.3 The Stability Design</b> </font> </td>
    <td> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stability of reinforced 
        slopes and fills is typically analyzed using versions of conventional 
        limit equilibrium analysis, modified to account for the added tensile 
        strength of the reinforcing material. A circular or wedge-shaped potential 
        failure surface is assumed, and the relationship between resisting and 
        driving forces or moments determines the FOS. Detailed design procedures 
        for reinforced fills have been well summarized by Christopher et al. (1990) 
        and outlined in text by Koerner (1990). Tall reinforced structures-over 
        roughly 20 feet high-and those in critical areas should be designed using 
        comprehensive slope stability analysis. Computer programs that handle 
        reinforced slopes include PCSTABL6 (1980), TENSLO (TENSLO1 ver. 2 1991), 
        STABGM (STABGM ver. 9.85 1985), UTEXAS2 (UTEXAS2 ver. 1.211 1987), and 
        a comprehensive design program currently being developed by the Federal 
        Highway Administration (FHWA). XSTABL (XSTABL ver 4.102 1992) can be used 
        for reinforced fill analysis, as shown in the design examples.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Simplified hand solutions 
        have been developed and published by the FHWA, and step-by-step design 
        charts are available from various manufacturers, such as Tensar Corporation. 
        Design charts are commonly used without detailed stability analysis to 
        design small projects. This approach appears appropriate for rural, non-critical 
        applications on relatively small fills (under 20 feet high) in good soils. 
        Also, the cost of reinforcing materials is a relatively small percentage 
        of the total repair cost of a site, so optimization of a design is not 
        critical and may not be cost effective. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Conventional design 
        of a reinforced fill involves determining: </font> </p>

          and settlement.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Appropriate minimum 
        factors of safety for the various aspects of internal and external design 
        are available in the FHWA design procedures. Recommended seismic design 
        procedures use a pseudo-static analysis outlined by the FHWA. Specific 
        design procedures and examples are also available in the U.S. Forest Service 
        Retaining Wall Design Guide (1979). A new edition of this guide is in 
        process. Design procedures developed to date are typically suited to sites 
        which have deep-seated rotational failure surfaces or to new fill embankments 
        where long reinforcing members can be used. However, the most common type 
        of slope failure in mountainous terrain is a shallow debris slide, so 
        the design procedure must be adapted to repair shallow fill failures over 
        bedrock. Basically, the reinforcement material and layer spacing is used 
        as required from published design procedures for the fill height needed, 
        but the reinforcement length is shortened from the recommended value to 
        fit the site geometry. Reinforcement length is determined to prevent sliding 
        or overturning of the reinforced mass. Because reinforcement spacing is 
        developed based on the most critical, typically deep-seated, failure surface, 
        and because only a shallow failure is likely to occur on a debris slide, 
        the design spacing is conservative. Internal stability of the reinforced 
        mass is thus conservative. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">External stability, 
        however, may be marginal. The critical mode of failure for this type of 
        design has been sliding along the fill-native material or fill-bedrock 
        interface. Limit equilibrium analysis of the fill as a sliding block has 
        shown an FOS with respect to sliding of less than one unless the interface 
        is stepped, forcing a failure through more competent in-place material 
        or through the reinforcing members. If a geocomposite drain is used under 
        the fill and placed along the fill-native material interface as is commonly 
        done, sliding failure is even more likely because the soil-to-geosynthetic 
        friction angle is typically assumed to be only 60 to 90 percent of the 
        friction angle of the soil itself (Eigenbrod and Locker, 1987). A graded 
        aggregate drain can minimize this problem. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As determined on 
        reinforced fills designed to date with a benched soil -- fill interface, 
        adequate terracing of the interface can achieve a desired FOS against 
        sliding of 1.5. Terracing, however, produces additional construction difficulties, 
        particularly for installation of a drain, which may increase the total 
        project cost. </font> </p></td>

    <td> <hr> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Internal reinforcement 
      material most commonly used in reinforced fills is a uniaxial or biaxial 
      geogrid material made of polymers, such as polyester, polypropylene, or 
      polyethylene. Each has its own creep, pullout, strength, and elongation 
      characteristics that should be considered in design. Ideally, stress-strain 
      characteristics of polymer geogrids or geotextiles should be as similar 
      to the soil as practical. Materials characteristics are commonly available 
      from the manufacturer, but test methods should follow those developed as 
      industry standards, such as Task Force 27 (AASHTO) and Geosynthetic Research 
      Institute (GRI-Drexel University) standards of practice and test methods. 
      </font> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Allowable 
        design tensile strength of reinforcing materials, particularly geogrids, 
        is determined from an ultimate strength laboratory value modified by several 
        FOS, including factors for creep deformation, installation damage, chemical 
        and environmental degradation, and weakness at seams and joints. Creep 
        tests should be conducted for a minimum duration of 10,000 hours and extrapolated 
        to a minimum 75-year design life. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pullout resistance, 
        which reflects the soil-reinforcement interaction, is a significant design 
        consideration. An advantage of geogrids or wire mesh is the high percentage 
        of soil-to-soil contact through the grid. Long-term pullout performance 
        is a function of pullout capacity (preferably determined from pullout 
        tests), allowable displacement, and long-term displacement (a function 
        of creep characteristics). </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Welded wire mesh 
        or other metals, such as chain link fencing, that are considered inextensible 
        will have less creep and long-term displacement, different load-deformation 
        characteristics and will be more susceptible to corrosion than are extensible 
        polymers (geogrids). Galvanized coating or additional sacrificial metal 
        are used to resist corrosion. Corrosion issues are addressed in Elias 
        (1990) and other publications. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In reinforced embankments 
        constructed with marginal or clay-rich embankment, material nonwoven geotextiles 
        are desirable due to their "wicking" or transmissibility characteristics. 
        The theory is that the nonwoven geotextile will provide both reinforcement 
        and drainage in the embankment. Drainage is desirable to dissipate pore 
        pressure during construction and to provide for a long-term drained condition, 
        as well as to reorient seepage forces to have a net stabilizing influence 
        on the slope. In cases where nonwoven fabrics lack needed tensile strength, 
        composite woven and nonwoven geotextiles have been used.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Expanded fiberglass 
        strands mixed pneumatically with backfill soil have been used both as 
        primary internal reinforcement for the entire reinforced fill and for 
        reinforcement of the zone at the fill face. This method, originally developed 
        in Europe under the name "Texsol," has been used by the Forest Service 
        in field fill face applications, and laboratory testing of its soil-interaction 
        properties has been conducted by the California Department of Transportation 
        Materials Laboratory. To date the design methodology is evolving, but 
        the concept appears promising. </font> </p></td>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These gradation requirements 
        are broad and can include excellent to marginal quality material. "Marginal" 
        soils are defined as fine grained, low plasticity materials which may 
        be difficult to compact, have poor drainage, or have strength parameters 
        sensitive to density. Plasticity index should not exceed 20. Soil pH should 
        be between 3 and 9 to avoid excessive corrosion. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On-site or local 
        materials, often of marginal quality, are consistently used by the Forest 
        Service for backfill in retaining walls and fills. Ideal coarse granular 
        free-draining backfill material often is not available at construction 
        sites or is very expensive to import. The coarse rockfill material, which 
        is occasionally available, often has enough oversize material to make 
        layer placement difficult, and rocks can damage the reinforcement material. 
        </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Local materials used 
        have varied from silty sands to silts and clays (SM, SC, ML, and CL Unified 
        Soil Classifications) with over 50 percent fines (passing the No. 200 
        sieve). Marginal materials should be tested to determine their strength 
        properties and strength-density relationships. Many soils found in a montane 
        environment have good frictional properties, usually exceeding a 30<sup>o</sup> 
        effective friction angle (&phi;) at the specified compaction density, 
        and so are desirable backfill materials. Note that peak shear strength 
        parameters should be used for analysis. Strength parameters should be 
        determined using direct shear or consolidated-drained triaxial tests. 
        </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Use of marginal backfill 
        has been acceptable, but its use can present problems in construction 
        and long-term performance. Compaction of fine-grained soils is sensitive 
        to moisture content, so close construction control is needed to ensure 
        that specified densities are achieved. Typically, a specified density 
        equal to 95 percent of the AASHTO T-99 maximum density has produced satisfactory 
        results. Unless settlement is severe it normally does not present a structural 
        problem for a reinforced fill. Cohesive soils have not yet been used in 
        Forest Service applications. Creep characteristics would have to be carefully 
        evaluated prior to use of a very cohesive backfill material. </font> </p></td>

      <b>6F.4.3 Fill Face Slope and Facing Needs</b> </font> </td>
    <td> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With reinforcement, 
        the final fill face most commonly designed and achieved is a 1<i>H</i>:1<i>V</i> 
        slope. However, this slope can vary between 1-1/4<i>H</i>:1<i>V</i> and 
        1/2<i>H</i>:1<i>V</i>, depending on the soil type used and extra measures 
        taken. A 1<i>H</i>:1<i>V</i> slope is about the steepest slope face achieved 
        using a dominantly granular, low plasticity backfill material typical 
        of mountainous terrain. Because the outer edge of the fill face is unsupported, 
        good compaction in this area is very difficult to achieve. Without adequate 
        density, soils placed on a steeper slope will typically not hold, and 
        local fill face instability will occur. Attempts to construct an unsupported 
        1/2<i>H</i>:1<i>V</i> fill face have failed, even using a slightly clayey 
        soil, and a 1<i>H</i>:1<i>V</i> slope was the result. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Use of a material 
        with significant clay content may allow a somewhat steeper slope to be 
        constructed, but performance probably is still controlled by construction 
        limitations at the fill face. In very granular, non-plastic material, 
        such as decomposed granitic soil, experience has shown that a 1-1/4<i>H</i>:1<i>V</i> 
        face is the most appropriate stable slope. A steeper slope either will 
        ravel or will need some additional type of support, such as wrapping the 
        reinforcement material around the face. Wrapping material has included 
        either the geogrid being used for reinforcement or a heavy erosion control 
        matting or netting. Tensar Corporation has constructed 3/4<i>H</i>:1<i>V</i> 
        slopes using the primary reinforcement grid wrapped around the face in 
        up to 3-foot lifts. However, if much wrapping is needed, a retaining structure 
        may become more economical. Eight-inch (20 cm) quarry rock has been used 
        on fill faces to achieve a stable 1<i>H</i>:1<i>V</i> slope. Also, a variety 
        of prefabricated concrete blocks is available for facing material. Some 
        promise exists for achieving a 1/2<i>H</i>:1<i>V </i>slope face on low 
        fills with the use of biotechnical measures such as vegetal stabilization. 
        Experience with fills up to 11 feet (3.3 m) high has shown that a 1/2<i>H</i>:1<i>V</i> 
        slope can be constructed, without forms, by placing a mixture of straw, 
        clay-rich soil, manure, and seed in 1-foot (0.3-m) lifts along the outer 
        couple feet of the fill face between geogrid reinforcing layers. The straw 
        provides both tensile strength to support the steep slope and erosion 
        protection until the seed germinates (which further adds root support). 
        These measures can become labor intensive, and cost currently has been 
        $9.50 per square foot. An aesthetic, well-stabilized face has been produced. 
        Also, using layers of brush as secondary reinforcement on any slope face 
        will likely improve the surface stabilization and provide erosion control 
        for the face. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 3/4<i>H</i>:1<i>V</i> 
        slope face has been achieved by pneumatically shooting expanded fiberglass 
        strands into the outer couple feet of the fill face as fill material was 
        being dumped with a backhoe. This method appears promising and inexpensive. 
        Only about 0.1 percent by weight of fiberglass reinforcement was added 
        to the soil, and cost was about $3.50 per square foot, including reinforcing 
        geogrid within the fill. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On any newly constructed 
        fill face, particularly when it is oversteepened, both surface water control 
        and erosion protection are needed. Surface water should be collected above 
        the slope and channeled around it. At a minimum, some type of erosion 
        control blanket or matting should be placed on the slope. Erosion control 
        and revegetation measures to protect the fill face should be an integral 
        part of the reinforced slope design, and should not be left to the discretion 
        of the contractor. </font> </p></td>

      <b>6F.4.4 Drainage Requirements</b> </font> </td>
    <td> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most reinforced 
        fills have had drainage provisions added, either to remove local ground 
        water or to ensure that the backfill remains in a drained condition (as 
        assumed for the design). Typically, chimney drains or geocomposite drains 
        are installed behind the fill. Alternatively, a layer of drainage material 
        could be incorporated into the fill. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Geocomposite drains 
        have been used extensively by the Forest Service. They are particularly 
        applicable behind fills and retaining structures where the excavation 
        backslope is steep or nearly vertical, making conventional gravel drains 
        very difficult to construct. Numerous manufacturers produce geocomposite 
        drains, and a variety of models has been used. A good study of their long-term 
        performance has not been done, but experience to date has been satisfactory. 
        Cost of the drains themselves is around $2 to $4 per square foot, installed. 
        </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Where considerable 
        ground water flow is encountered and gradients are low, such as in the 
        flatter toe-area of a slide, the capacity of some commonly available drains 
        may be exceeded. Conventional gravel drains enveloped in geotextile, or 
        a double layer of geocomposite drain, may be best suited for this area. 
        A combination of gravel drains and geocomposite drains has also been used 
        on one slide repair project to achieve adequate drainage in a cost-effective 
        manner. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In specifying geocomposite 
        drains for wall or fill applications, the items that appear most critical 
        are crushing strength, flow capacity, and use of a geotextile which will 
        satisfy needed filter criteria. Testing by the Forest Service and others 
        shows that many geocomposite drains available today have both good crushing 
        strength properties and high flow rates. However, some do not, and products 
        vary considerably. Frequently the Forest Service specifies a drain that 
        can maintain a flow of at least 1 gallon per minute per linear foot of 
        drain under a hydraulic gradient of 1. Crushing strength must exceed 1.5 
        tons per square foot. Either woven or nonwoven geotextiles are specified, 
        depending on local soils. The geotextile should be tight or glued to the 
        fin material for best performance. </font> </p></td>

    <td> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Construction of 
        reinforced fills is relatively simple and rapid once the design is well 
        laid out. A typical construction sequence is: </font> </p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> First, the area 
          is excavated to grade, and the subgrade is smoothed and compacted. To 
          ensure that a suitable foundation exists, the excavation should be inspected 
          by a geologist or geotechnical engineer.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Typically a horizontal 
          layer of the reinforcing material is placed on the subgrade to the dimensions 
          and orientation shown on the drawings or as directed by the engineer. 
          Correct orientation should be confirmed by the manufacturer to ensure 
          that the direction of maximum tensile strength is toward the embankment 
          face. The material may be secured with staples, pins, stakes, or backfill 
          material.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drainage, typically 
          a chimney drain using gravel or geocomposite material, is placed against 
          the back of the excavation and brought up as necessary to stay above 
          the lifts of backfill material. Perforated collection pipes and nonperforated 
          drain pipes are installed as required on the drawings.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Layers of backfill 
          material are placed and compacted similarly to normal earthwork lift 
          operations. Backfill should be spread and compacted in such a manner 
          that the reinforcing fabric or geogrid does not move and equipment does 
          not operate directly on the material. Compaction on clay-rich soils 
          should be in 6- to 8-inch lifts; on granular soils, 9- to 12-inch lifts. 
          Lift thickness may be governed by reinforcement spacing. Soil is normally 
          compacted to 95 percent of the AASHTO T-99 maximum density. Large, smooth 
          drum vibratory or rubber tire rollers should be used. Sheepsfoot rollers 
          may damage the reinforcement.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Facing elements 
          or erosion control measures, or both, are either brought up or wrapped 
          around as the lift sequence progresses, or facing is added upon completion 
          of the lifts in the structure.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The sequence, 
          spacing, and length of reinforcement layers and fill material lifts 
          is continued as shown on the drawings until the structure is completed. 
          Secondary reinforcement strips are commonly placed along the edge of 
          the fill face as each lift or two are placed.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Correct orientation 
        of the reinforcement is critical to the design of the structure, so it 
        should be double-checked and confirmed. Also, because it is almost impossible 
        to work with a single reinforcement roll width, either overlapping or 
        splicing must be considered. Splices should be avoided along the reinforcement 
        in the direction of the principal stresses (towards the face). The type 
        of splice or overlap distance will depend upon the type of reinforcing 
        material and direction of the splice. They should be installed in accordance 
        with the manufacturer's directions. </font> </p></td>

        are not familiar with this design concept, construction costs have not 
        been as low as expected. Bid prices in 1987-92 have averaged $10-$15 per 
        cubic yard for controlled compaction of the material, plus $4-$8 per square

        and intermediate reinforcement members. These same costs have ranged between 
        $3.50 and $12 per square foot of vertical fill face. The lower cost can 
        be realized on wide sites where equipment can operate efficiently, while

                possible construction damage, creep, and long term loss of strength. 
                In this case taking a partial factor 1.3 gives an in-service design

                <strong>5.</strong> Selecting an overall design safety factor
