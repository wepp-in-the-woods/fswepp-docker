      Introduction</font> </td>
    <td valign="top" colspan="4"> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        The Council of Environmental Quality Regulations for Implementing Procedural 
        Provisions of NEPA defines "cumulative impact" as "the impact on the environment 
        which results from the incremental impact of the actions when added to 
        other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless 
        of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such other 
        actions. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively 
        significant actions taking place over a period of time" (U.S. Congress, 
        1969). </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The legal definition 
        of cumulative effects is broad. NEPA regulations require that both positive 
        and negative impacts be analyzed. Because the term "impact" has developed 
        an association with primarily negative effects, the more neutral term 
        "effect" is often used. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In watersheds, effects 
        may occur at locations distant from land management activities (offsite 
        effects) and at times apparently unrelated to such activities (indirect 
        effects). Cumulative watershed effects concern water-related resources 
        that may be affected by changes in water quality, amount and timing of 
        streamflow, and stream channels. Stream channel changes may be caused 
        by increased sediment loads from landslides or surface erosion, changes 
        in supply of large woody debris or boulders, or modifications of basin 
        hydrology, such as increased peak flows. Potential changes in channel 
        conditions include: increased fines in gravel, increased cobble embeddedness, 
        filling of pools, channel widening, and loss of cover and refuge from 
        winter high-flow or summer low-flow conditions, all of which affect the 
        quality of fish habitat. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Land management 
        practices also have the potential to affect stream temperature, nutrient 
        levels, and turbidity, as well as flooding and low flows (Ice et al., 
        1990). Reduced low flows, overall reduction of water yield, and changes 
        in timing of flows are important concerns for irrigation (McDonald, 1990). 
        </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In addition to multiple 
        forest management activities through time, non-forest activities--such 
        as agricultural, residential, and urban development--are considered in 
        a thorough analysis of cumulative watershed effects. The responsibility 
        for assessing cumulative watershed effects generally resides in the soils/watershed/range 
        staff area. Geologists and geotechnical engineers can support this assessment 
        with the quantitative and qualitative tools and methodologies described 
        in this guide. </font> </p></td>

      Statistical Approach </font> </td>
    <td valign="top" colspan="4" width="490"> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        Cumulative watershed effects may be viewed as a chain of causes and effects, 
        where each link or process is subject to modelling with varying degrees 
        of certainty. Where causes and effects are not well understood or data 
        are insufficient, empirical correlations are often used rather than process-oriented 
        models (Prellwitz, 1993). For example, the volume of landslide sediment 
        produced during the last decade may correlate with turbidity at a particular 
        flow, but processes of sediment delivery and transport of fine sediments 
        are ignored in this correlation. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> On national forest 
        lands, sediment transport is dominated by colluvial and alluvial processes, 
        with volcanic, eolian, lacustrine, and coastal processes found locally. 
        Mass wasting of soil and rock materials and surface erosion are the mechanisms 
        of sediment transport on hillslopes, while debris flows and dam-break 
        floods (debris torrents) are those found within stream channels (Benda 
        and Miller, 1991). </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The several processes 
        and materials involved in slope movement produce a variety of movement 
        types (Selby, 1990). Varnes' (1978) classification of landslides describes 
        both process (mechanism of movement and mode of deformation) and rate 
        (velocity). </font> </p></td>

      Hillslope-Channel Linkages </font> </td>
    <td valign="top" colspan="4" width="490"> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        Hillslope-channel linkages vary across the landscape with geomorphic setting. 
        Patterns of landslides and associated hillslope processes have direct 
        and indirect effects on stream channels. Effects on the geometry and disturbance 
        regime of channels and streamside areas are expressed in valley-floor 
        landforms and stream ecosystems (Swanson et al., 1987). Ecosystem processes, 
        such as rates and patterns of succession and nutrient cycling, are affected. 
        </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Frequency, persistence, 
        and mechanisms of stream sediment transport are determined by interaction 
        of flow regimes with the abundance, timing, and size distribution of sediment 
        delivery. Landslides also affect delivery, redistribution, and removal 
        of large woody material in streams providing habitat structure and diversity 
        (Swanson et al., 1982). </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Natural and management 
        related disturbances may differ in their types, frequencies, intensities, 
        and extent of disturbance. Timing of triggering events relative to disturbance 
        (such as wildfire, road construction, or timber harvest) may result in 
        brief periods of dramatically increased sediment production (Swanson et 
        al., 1982). More frequent disturbance of channel and streamside areas 
        in response to triggering events is the expected result of accelerated 
        disturbance under management. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Hillslope-channel 
        linkages are strongly influenced by relative rates of hillslope sediment 
        delivery as compared with channel export. These linkages may occur over 
        a landscape/stream network or a stream reach. Caine and Swanson (1989) 
        describe two mountainous terrains with contrasting equilibrium and decay 
        states of landscape evolution. Landslide deposits resulting from slope 
        failures are typically delivered to streams in increments, rather than 
        as a single event. Catastrophic failures tend to be associated with natural 
        events, such as earthquakes and volcanism, and may result in river blockage 
        and valley filling (e.g., the Toutle River in western Washington during 
        the May 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens). </font> </p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Benda and Dunne 
        (1987) and Benda and Cundy (1990) characterized debris-flow initiation, 
        runout distance, and stopping location across a landscape/stream channel 
        network. Grant et al. (1984) described a method for assessing channel 
        response to different mechanisms of hillslope sediment and water delivery. 
        At the stream-reach scale, dramatic earthflow-channel linkages are observed. 
        Earthflows may deposit large boulders, constrict channels, accumulate 
        sediment upstream of the constriction, and cause toe-slope erosion and 
        failure of the opposite slope. Hillslope effects on channel structure, 
        streamside vegetation, and large woody material vary by channel characteristics. 
        </font> </p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Frequencies of hillslope 
        processes need to be interpreted in the context of long-term precipitation 
        and streamflow data. Channel responses to infrequent, high-magnitude flows 
        are linked with hillslope processes. Miller (1990) cited evidence of landslides 
        from a previous storm that affected hydraulic conditions and the magnitude 
        of erosion during a subsequent storm. Hillslope processes also respond 
        to channel movements and may develop feedback mechanisms in which channel 
        changes that result from delivery contribute to additional delivery by 
        streambank or toe-slope erosion. </font> </p></td>

      Sediment Budgets/Sediment Yields </font> </td>
    <td valign="top" colspan="4" width="490"> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        The sediment budget synthesizes what is known about cause-effect relations 
        and hillslope-channel linkages. Dietrich et al. (1982) defined a sediment 
        budget as follows: </font> </p>
      <blockquote> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A sediment 
        budget for a drainage basin is a quantitative statement of the rates of 
        production, transport, and discharge of detritus. In most studies, measurement 
        of sediment production is assumed equivalent to quantification of sources 
        of sediment discharged into streams. Sediment is also produced by the 
        chemical degradation and physical mixing of weathered bedrock to form 
        a soil, however, and material is transferred between size fractions as 
        a result of attrition during transport. In a sediment budget, the soil 
        mantle should be treated as a separate element of sediment storage having 
        a definable rate of inflow and outflow detritus. Quantification of debris 
        transport requires not only defining rates of sediment transfer between 
        major storage elements--such as between soil and stream channels--but 
        also computing rates of movement through these sediment reservoirs. The 
        latter is particularly difficult to do with the present understanding 
        of processes, but it is from such a quantification that predictions can 
        be made about the change in size of storage elements and the rapidity 
        and magnitude of the response of sediment discharge from a drainage basin 
        after some disturbance. Discharge of detritus is simply the rate of transport 
        of sediment past a monitoring station. </font> </blockquote>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> To construct a sediment 
        budget for a drainage basin, the temporal and spatial variations of transport 
        and storage processes must be integrated; to do so, these requirements 
        should be fulfilled: (1) recognition and quantification of transport processes, 
        (2) recognition and quantification of storage elements, and (3) identification 
        of linkages among transport processes and storage elements. To accomplish 
        this task, it is necessary to know the detailed dynamics of transport 
        processes and storage sites, including such problems as defining the recurrence 
        interval of each transport process at a place. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Sediment yield, 
        frequently confused with sediment budget, is defined by Swanson et al. 
        (1982) as part of an analysis of an individual erosion process, including 
        the measurement of sediment yield at one or more points along a river 
        system and the stratigraphic analysis of deposits. </font> </p></td>

      What Are Cumulative Effects? </font> </td>
    <td valign="top" colspan="4" width="490"> <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        Cumulative effects analysis (CEA) is a commonly misunderstood term. Some 
        prefer to substitute the word "impact" for "effects" because that seems 
        to make more sense. Others prefer the title "watershed cumulative effects 
        (impact) analysis," and some simplify this with the names "watershed analysis" 
        or "basin analysis." Our colleagues (Ice et al., 1990, p. 2) have defined 
        cumulative effects as: </font> </p>
      <blockquote> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> <font size="2">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;various 
        on-site and off-site impacts of multiple forest management activities 
        on resource values through time. Cumulative watershed effects (CWE) can 
        include any changes in water quality, amount and timing of streamflow 
        or impact to the stream channel which affect beneficial uses. Currently, 
        most cumulative watershed effects concerns are about changes in channel 
        conditions resulting from either increased sediment loads from mass-wasting 
        or surface erosion, change in in-channel obstructions (large woody debris) 
        or modification to basin hydrology such as increased peak flows. Potential 
        channel conditions changes related to these concerns include: increased 
        fines in gravel, increased cobble embeddedness, filling of pools, channel 
        widening, and loss of cover and refuge from winter high-flow or summer 
        low-flow conditions, all of which can influence the beneficial use of 
        streams for fish habitat. Other cumulative watershed effects about which 
        forest managers can and have been challenged include changes in stream 
        temperature, nutrient levels, and turbidity, as well as concerns about 
        flooding and low-flows. </font></font> </blockquote>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> From the perspective 
        of the Forest Service, this definition is not completely accurate. For 
        example, there are many non-forest management activities that affect resources, 
        such as those in areas containing a patchwork of different landowners 
        within a river basin. Agriculture, residential and urban development, 
        and non-forest recreation areas are some examples. Other environmental 
        changes include seasonal changes and general reductions of water yield. 
        These changes are important to irrigators (McDonald, 1990). Also, an increase 
        in sediment flux into a fluvial system is not always an adverse effect; 
        in some cases, an increase in the stream bedload can benefit fish and 
        other biota. </font> </p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So why is this a 
        concern for us in engineering, and specifically in geotechnical engineering? 
        Our colleagues in the soils / watershed / range staff certainly have the 
        responsibility to work in this arena; however, we have the professional 
        abilities to support them with the tools and methods described in this 
        guide. Frequently our colleagues use qualitative methods in their slope 
        stability assessments. This is a scientifically valid process, but we 
        have quantitative tools to reinforce the qualitative results which we 
        can (and should) share with these colleagues. </font> </p></td>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Engineering geologists 
        by definition have three scientific skills: we can identify the origin 
        of materials, describe the history of geologic events, and categorize 
        them by geologic processes (Williamson, 1979). This science is an important 
        element in the CEA process pertaining to slope stability and sediment 
        transport. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b><i>Origin of 
        Materials</i></b> </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In most Forest Service 
        CEA models there are two components that can be identified by the origin 
        of materials. These are materials transported and deposited by means of 
        natural (geologic, climatic, and fire) events and cultural (logging, roading, 
        range, and fire) processes. In a sense, geologists have been involved 
        in identifying natural events by means of CEA since Hutton presented the 
        theory of uniformitarianism (Hutton, 1795). We understand the relationships 
        among mechanical and chemical weathering, erosion, transportation, and 
        deposition of sedimentary materials. Engineering geologists have evaluated 
        depositional histories of transported sediments resulting from cultural 
        events since the 1920's, when Terzaghi took the lead in developing modern 
        engineering geology. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As we modify the 
        surface of the Earth by road construction, road obliteration, and other 
        management practices, we have the methods to identify and evaluate these 
        disturbed materials. By evaluating the cause-and-effect relationship of 
        what moves where, we can predict which materials will move downslope. 
        By knowing the process and rate, we know how these materials move and 
        when movement will occur. This becomes very important when the materials 
        move downslope in large volumes and severely affect resources. By identifying 
        and describing the origin of materials and how they are moved and deposited 
        within a basin of interest, the engineering geologist can develop a sediment 
        budget for input into the CEA model. </font> </p>

        </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A typical point 
        of reference in sediment transport CEA is what is colloquially referred 
        to as "background levels." This term commonly refers to natural hydrologic 
        and geomorphic conditions. In other words, what is the condition of the 
        watershed in an undisturbed state at a moment in time? This background 
        level is then used for comparing predicted conditions in the CEA model. 
        The major fallacy in this concept is the failure to recognize that landforms 
        evolve over geologic time. What is perceived to be a large flux of transported 
        sediment from a particular management activity might be surpassed by a 
        larger flux from natural hydrologic and geomorphic processes. It all depends 
        upon the specific time on the geologic clock. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Rather than using 
        supposed background levels, we should provide a history of the watershed 
        of interest. If a few decades worth of aerial photographs are available, 
        we can take advantage of these tools to develop a recent history. For 
        a geologic history beyond the most recent time (say the last 50 years), 
        we can work with soil scientists to establish the timing and location 
        of large fires and for development of the soil profile. By interpretation 
        of geologic and seismicity maps (available through the State geological 
        surveys and the U.S. Geological Survey), we can estimate the location 
        of possible recent fault activity and associated geomorphic features (rock 
        avalanches, alluvial fans, etc.). Hydrologists and climatologists can 
        estimate the climatic history for the last few centuries. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> By describing the 
        geologic history we can assist CEA modelers in developing more realistic 
        natural sediment yields. </font> </p>

        </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> On national forest 
        lands, the dominant processes in sediment transport CEA are colluvial 
        and alluvial. There are also the rare exceptions of volcanic, aeolian, 
        and lacustrine-coastal processes. Sheetwash and the mass-wasting of soil 
        and rock materials are the mechanisms of sediment transport on hillslopes, 
        while debris flows and dam-break floods (debris torrents) are those found 
        within stream and river channels (Benda and Miller, 1991). It is very 
        important to understand the hydrology; for example, what are the relationships 
        among the landform evolution, slope stability, and surface/subsurface 
        flow (Horton overland flow, subsurface flow, and return flow)? By putting 
        these process pieces together, we can be descriptive in explaining what 
        is occurring within a basin of interest. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Probably the most 
        common classification of landslide types and processes used by Forest 
        Service engineers and engineering geologists is the one developed by Varnes 
        (1978). However, there are other classifications that are useful (e.g., 
        Hutchinson, 1968). Varnes' classification is divided into two types of 
        materials--bedrock and engineering soils. The soils are further divided 
        by the dominant grain size (coarse-grained or fine-grained) and by the 
        moisture content. In this classification system the materials for flows 
        are described by rate of movement. The advantage of this method is that 
        it incorporates in descriptive fashion the process/rate of the landslide.

        of sediment transport models available to Forest Service specialists, 
        it is no wonder that confusion and lack of uniformity pertaining to CEA 
        are common in our agency. Despite this situation, we do have a clear framework 
        to work within; for example, NEPA and the National Forest Management Act 
        (U.S. Congress, 1976) provide the policy to follow in this process. A 
        process that has been successful for the Olympic National Forest uses 
        this framework for a sediment transport CEA (Webster and Koler, 1991). 
        The limiting factor in this process is not the model used but the legislated 
        policy; therefore, no specific sediment transport CEA model is required 
        to make this process successful. The following is extracted from Webster

      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In creating a 10-year 
        activity schedule, district rangers decide in which drainage basins management 
        activities will be conducted and how much activity will occur in each 
        basin. These managers need to know the condition of each basin in order 
        to minimize adverse cumulative effects and to document the need for rehabilitation 
        of highly damaged areas. Sediment-yield models can also be used for this 
        planning level; however, a more accurate method is to calculate the sediment 
        budget for the basin of interest, as summarized in section <a href="ssg_2f.html">2F</a>. 
        These sediment budgets will vary depending on the proposed management 
        activities within the basin. Sediment budgets calculated for several years 
        prior to the current scheduling are a great help in understanding the 
        most recent geologic processes occurring in response to "natural" and 
        "cultural" events. The typical map scale for this 10-year scheduling work

        identified during the scoping stage--boundaries are specified and the 
        presence and condition of the resources in the area are inventoried. Issues, 
        concerns, and opportunities can be defined from this information. If the 
        analysis area has sediment yields or budgets that reach or surpass an 
        arbitrary predetermined threshold, a hazard-risk assessment will quantify 
        the erosional processes. A hazard is an existing or potential erosional 
        feature or condition that has the potential to contribute sediment to 
        the fluvial system. A risk is a resource (e.g., fish and wildlife habitat) 
        that has the potential to be degraded in response to hazards. </font>

        topples, and slides). Several tools available to quantify the cause-effect 
        and process-rate of these hazards are: the Modified Universal Soil Loss 
        Equation (USLE) <a href="#Edt_Nt.1">*</a> for surficial erosion, LISA 
        (Level I Stability Analysis, 1991) for soil translational failures, SARA 
        (Stability Analysis for Road Access, in process) for soil rotational failures, 
        the Benda-Cundy Model (1990) for debris flows, and the rock slope engineering 
        method developed by Hoek and Bray (1981). The typical scale for this level

        to concentrate or avoid management activities on specific sites and consequently 
        to be proactive in predicting the degree of impact. This should be done 
        on lands where the sediment-yield model or sediment budget calculation 
        indicates a cause for concern. This step allows the district ranger to 
        control or mitigate the hazards that put resources at risk as a result

        models or calculated from sediment budgets. The materials that are delivered 
        to the fluvial system can be evaluated as they are routed if the channel 
        geometry, gradient, average particle size (D50), roughness, and 2-year 
        and 100-year flows are known. Bed-material flux can then be calculated 
        to determine scouring or aggradation effects on the stream channel for 
        individual stream segments of interest. By predicting the sediment volumes 
        delivered to the fluvial system for each alternative, and by routing the 
        bed material through the system under different flows, the engineering 
        geologist is able to provide valuable input to the interdisciplinary team 
        preparing the environmental analysis or environmental impact statement.

        at which the sediment levels will drop to the point such that further 
        activities in the analysis area can be planned. Currently, all of this 
        analysis can be completed using a personal computer; in the very near 
        future, most calculations can be performed within GISes. Therein lies 
        a problem: a scientist can "complete" the analysis in the office without 
        verifying the data by field work. Therefore, it is critical that a peer 
        or a senior scientist reviews this work before providing the information 
        to the district ranger or other line officer. </font> </p>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Management activities 
        seldom occur as planned; hence, the results of the forecasting routine 
        will have to be updated as activities occur. One effective monitoring 
        method is simply to update the inventory of the geomorphic and hydrologic 
        processes within the basin of interest. This includes a landslide inventory, 
        climate record, and changes in the fluvial geomorphology (geometry, gradient, 
        bedforms, and bed material size). Monitoring the fluvial processes may 
        at first seem an intensive process. To calculate areas of scouring and 
        aggradation effectively, the bed substrate must be evaluated to calibrate 
        the flux of material into and out of the stream segment of interest. This 
        can be done in a couple of field days for a river basin approximately 
        8 square miles in area. Monitoring field work includes the observation 
        of changes in the fluvial system, sketches, and general comments. Also, 
        a review of the aerial photographs of the area over a few decades helps 
        to better understand previous fluvial processes that responded to hillslope 
        processes similar to the ones you are monitoring. These data are put into 
        a GIS or other data base system for quick retrieval. The few days invested 
        in keeping these monitoring data updated will minimize future management 
        problems. </font> </p>

        quantify this understanding and place it in a framework, the results of 
        which will be a product that land managers can use to make decisions based 
        on good science. If the earth scientist can explain what is creating an 
        unstable slope (cause), where it will fail and move to (effect), how it 
        is moving (process), and when it will get to an area of interest (rate), 
        he or she will have a good start in telling the sediment transport story. 
        The other part of this story is the dimensions. What is the volume of 
        material in storage that has the potential to be transported downslope 
        into a fluvial system? What is the overall sediment budget for the watershed 
        of interest, and where are the critical input areas where the sediment 
        yield will be detrimental to resources such as fish habitat and municipal 
        water supply (hazard-risk)? This second part of the story interests land 
        managers the most; however, to get this part, the earth scientist needs 
        to complete the first part: sediment yield. </font> </p>

        descriptions of unstable (or potentially unstable) slopes provide answers 
        to the "what" and "where" questions. Causes for unstable slopes are based 
        in geology, soil and rock mechanics, and hydrogeology. Many engineers 
        and geologists have described these causes (e.g., Ladd, 1935; Sharpe, 
        1938; Bendel, 1948; Terzaghi, 1950; Rapp, 1960; Legget, 1962; Zaruba and

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Varnes (1978) has 
        probably provided the most lucid summary of unstable slope causes, which 
        he lists under two categories: factors contributing to increased shear 
        stress and factors contributing to low or reduced shear strength. The 
        location at which the slope might fail and how it will travel downslope 
        best define what the effects will be for an unstable or potentially unstable 
        slope. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In many cases, the 
        geomorphic feature that is moving does so incrementally, rarely reaching 
        the fluvial system in one movement. However, there are catastrophic examples 
        of large slide masses moving thousands of feet downslope and into a stream 
        channel. These can occur in response to management activities--such as 
        road construction and timber harvest--but are more frequently the result 
        of sudden natural events, such as earthquakes, volcanism, heavy rainfall, 
        or snowmelt. A typical effect of these catastrophic events is river blockage 
        and valley filling (e.g., the Toutle River in western Washington during 
        the May 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens). In the more typical case, 
        where the slide mass is much smaller and moves incrementally, the usual 
        result is a small increase in the sediment yield at a particular point 
        in a river system. This increase may degrade fish habitat or some other 
        resource. In the cumulative-effects perspective, however, if you have 
        several of these typical slide masses moving incrementally downslope over 
        a period of time, the total sediment budget can be quite large, approaching 
        a rate (tons/mi<sup>2</sup>/yr) similar to one large and sudden event. 
        Earth scientists, then, need to explain where a landslide feature will 
        travel and what the consequences will be as it moves downslope. </font>

      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> An understanding 
        of the process and rate of slope movement answers the "how" and "when" 
        questions of slope stability. There are several processes and materials 
        involved in slope movement with a consequent variety of movement types 
        (Selby, 1990). Therefore, there are several criteria to be followed in 
        classifying these features: velocity and mechanism of movement, material, 
        mode of deformation, geometry of the moving mass, and moisture content. 
        Varnes' (1978) classification of landslides covers both process and rate 
        and is the system used by most Forest Service engineering geologists and 
        geotechnical engineers. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As described earlier 
        in this section, Varnes' classification is divided into two types of materials: 
        bedrock and engineering soils. The soils are further divided by the dominant 
        grain size and relative moisture content. Types of movement are falls, 
        topples, rotational and translational landslides, lateral spreads, flows, 
        and complex movements. By using this classification, both the process 
        (mechanism of movement and mode of deformation) and rate (velocity) can

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In a geomorphic 
        watershed analysis, cause-effect and process-rate need to be integrated 
        within a sediment budget approach that also includes a product for management 
        to use in making decisions. This product should be a hazard-risk assessment 
        for the analysis area of interest. In a hazard-risk assessment, the geomorphic 
        processes are evaluated for a particular analysis area (such as a river 
        basin) at a given time and it is determined how these processes may affect 
        the resources in or downstream from the area. As defined above, a hazard 
        is a geomorphic feature or process that presently is, or has the potential 
        to become, unstable. At risk is the resource (e.g., timber, water quality, 
        fish and wildlife habitat) that may become degraded in response to a hazard 
        condition. Therefore, the hazard-risk analysis is a two-step method: (1) 
        Identify the hazard and the condition over time and (2) Identify the resources 
        susceptible to degradation over time as the result of the hazards. </font> 
      </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Identifying the 
        hazards and risks is only part of this geomorphological watershed analysis. 
        To get a complete picture of what is occurring in the analysis area, one 
        must link through hillslope processes, over time, the way material is 
        stored, transported, and delivered to a fluvial system. Once the material 
        enters the fluvial system, the suspended and bedload sediment being routed 
        through the system must be evaluated. The first step then is to develop 
        a sediment budget for the analysis area incorporating the hazard-risk 
        assessment. Using this sediment budget, one can then calculate where material 
        will travel during a particular timeframe and how it gets into the fluvial 
        system and is routed downstream. In essence, one identifies the geomorphic 
        processes for a timeframe and points to the "pathway" by which materials 
        move downslope and downstream. </font> </p></td>

        Providing Forest Service management with a hazard-risk assessment report 
        is not the only step in assisting management with their decision making 
        within the CEA process. Managers need predictions, based on good scientific 
        methods, of what will happen cumulatively in response to a proposed alternative. 
        In association with these predictions, they need some options for mitigating 
        areas of increased sediment-transported materials. For example, different 
        types of engineered structures may be viable for slowing and stopping 
        sediment (for the lifetime of the structure, typically 25 to 50 years); 
        living "structures" within the current state of biotechnology can provide 
        similar structures (usually with a lifetime of several decades). An analysis 
        area which is above background levels can still be managed; in fact, it 
        may make good ecological sense to manage the basin to stabilize and diminish 
        the sediment production and transport there. However, to provide this 
        type of recommendation, we must know our facts and assumptions and follow 
        a scientific process that quantifies the geomorphic processes in the analysis 
        area. </font> </p></td>

        The three-level system is a viable means that the geotechnical specialist 
        can use in evaluating cumulative effects within the planning process. 
        This system provides a quantitative analysis that enables a good understanding 
        of the cause-effect and process-rate of active and potential slope movements. 
        Using this system, we can delineate hazards and risks and provide empirically 
        and stochastically based data for CEA pertaining to slope stability. </font>
