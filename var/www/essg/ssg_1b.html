        Slope stability specialists must be able to predict how land management 
        activities -- such as logging operations and road construction -- will 
        impact land stability. This assessment is useful to the land manager, 
        usually a district ranger, in evaluating the level of the potential watershed 
        impacts among various alternatives. The land manager usually has no professional 
        background in evaluating slope stability and therefore must rely on the 
        knowledge, skills, and abilities of the district earth scientists and 
        engineers or specialists from a zone office or forest headquarters. This 
        predictive capability is the fundamental principle of the three-level 
        stability analysis concept. By using this method the specialist will be 
        successful in assisting the decision maker. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Determining which 
        technique to use can be confusing for the specialist who does not routinely 
        perform slope stability analyses. Effective communication between the 
        specialist and the person requesting the analysis can minimize this confusion. 
        With effective communication there is an understanding of the basic reasons 
        for the work. Effective communication also leads to a slope stability 
        analysis matched to the level and complexity of the problem and avoids 
        analysis simply for its own sake. The common result of ineffective communication 
        and inappropriate analysis is that the requester will not ask for this 
        service in the future. </font> </p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It is important 
        for the specialist to understand that the data gathered will be used to 
        define slope conditions. Moreover, he or she should know that the analysis 
        is being made to model the current land stability conditions and potential 
        impacts as a result of excavation, logging, construction, damming, or 
        other management activities. Also, the engineer or scientist should know 
        how the results fit into a rational decision-making framework. Considering 
        the wide range of land management decisions requiring a supporting slope 
        stability evaluation, it is important that the prudent specialist adapt 
        the investigation and analysis to the decision being made. </font> </p></td>

    <td valign="top" colspan="4" width="469"> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        Many forested lands in the western United States have the potential to 
        be unstable because of geologic and hydrologic conditions and material 
        strength properties. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 
        and the National Forest Management Act (NFMA) of 1976 require that the 
        management of these lands includes stability assessment at all planning 
        levels: resource allocation (forest plan, 10-year scheduling, and timber 
        sale planning), project planning (timber sale environmental assessment 
        and transportation planning), and project development and monitoring (site 
        stabilization and implementation of the preferred alternative). This requirement 
        has led to the development of the three-level stability analysis concept 
        (Prellwitz et al., 1983; Prellwitz, 1985). Figure 1B.1 is a flowchart 
        of this analysis system. </font> </p></td>

        The three levels are progressive in scale, detail, complexity, and accuracy. 
        This progression focuses attention on specific problems in a logical order. 
        It also allows the analyzer to draw from the previous analysis and data 
        bases as new data are developed to support the higher analysis levels. 
        At levels I and II, the analysis techniques have a probabilistic version 
        to allow for the determination of parametric values over the areal extent 
        of the analysis. Also, the probabilistic output lends itself well to the 
        decision making process. A comparison of the combination of slope failure 
        probability with the relative failure consequences eases this process, 
        allowing the manager to base the decision on acceptable risk levels. The 
        deterministic version of the analysis is still necessary to facilitate 
        sensitivity analysis, parametric value evaluation, and back-analysis.

        The types of decisions at this level are made from data gathered at a 
        watershed scale (usually 1:24,000 or greater), and the evaluation of the 
        relative stability assesses hazards involved in the proposed activity. 
        At this level the decision maker determines the resource allocations and 
        where to develop them. The stability assessment usually uses available 
        inventory data in the simplified stability analysis techniques. In most 
        cases, these data are from a geographic information system (GIS), a geologic 
        resource and conditions data base, or both. Because the stability of the 
        entire land mass is being considered, the analysis techniques must model 
        the failure mode of natural slopes. These failures may be either planar 
        (translational) or circular (rotational) in shape, and the analysis must 
        be able to model both modes. The stability of constructed slopes usually 
        is not evaluated at this level. </font> </p></td>

    <td valign="top" colspan="4" width="469"> <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        The next major level of decision making requiring slope stability input 
        occurs in the project planning phase (e.g., timber sale environmental 
        assessment, transportation planning, and road closure planning). Timber 
        harvest decisions on tree removal and the impacts on the stability of 
        natural slopes include the modeling of tree removal effects. The two important 
        factors in this analysis are root strength and ground water. The stability 
        of constructed slopes often is more significant than is that of natural 
        slopes at the project level; however, a simplistic analysis that estimates 
        the relative stability of the road slope is adequate at this level. Critical 
        locations identified at this level will be considered for level III analysis. 
        A primary difference between the level II and level III analyses is that 
        the latter must allow the analyzer to evaluate many unique site conditions 
        and stabilization measures. The data base used in the level II analysis 
        must be more accurate than that used in level I. Project reconnaissance 
        includes field-developed cross-sections measured at locations critical 
        for this level. Measurements of the field-developed cross-sections are 
        usually at a 1:600 to 1:3,600 scale; therefore, the data collected will 
        be more accurate than that collected for level I, but less accurate than 
        that collected for level III. </font> </p></td>

        Critical sites recognized during the level II analysis may require a level 
        III analysis if the site cannot be avoided. For example, to gain access 
        to a landing, the district transportation planner lays a proposed road 
        corridor across an inactive landslide. For economic or ecological reasons 
        the district ranger chooses this route. The level II analysis predicts 
        slope stability problems will occur. The next step, then, is to complete 
        a level III analysis to evaluate various stabilization methods -- such 
        as buttresses, drainage, retaining walls, or additional excavation -- 
        for the site. All options -- including the do-nothing alternative -- are 
        available for consideration so that the manager can have a perspective 
        of the inherent cost and resource risk of each. The report from this analysis 
        allows the decision maker to compare possible stabilization alternatives 
        and to make a decision based upon relative cost and resource risk. </font> 
      </p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Section 6 of this 
        guide includes a detailed description of these analyses. Measurements 
        for site stabilization investigations are usually at a 1:120 to 1:600 
        scale. These measurements and subsequent analysis techniques are more 
        complex than those for levels I and II. This increase in data resolution 
        is necessary to determine existing conditions and to evaluate all possible 
        stabilization alternatives. </font> </p></td>

        There is a danger in fixing a certain analysis method to a certain decision 
        level because there is some overlap in applicability. Consideration of 
        the type of slope (natural or constructed) and the failure mode (translational 
        or rotational) is always important. In a level I decision, stability of 
        large land masses is of primary concern, whereas in level III decisions, 
        stability of specific critical slopes (usually constructed) is the primary 
        focus. In level II the decisions are somewhere between these two levels.

        An explanation of this simple and versatile equation is presented in section 
        5 of this guide. Although simple, it still does an adequate job of allowing 
        one to model all of the important factors in analyzing the potential translational 
        failures of natural slopes. In addition, the analysis is applicable to 
        rotational characteristics (Prellwitz, 1975; Ristau, 1988). Together with 
        a Monte Carlo simulation technique, this equation is a powerful tool for 
        incorporating spatial variability of input parametric values and the uncertainty 
        of the analyzer in determining what those values are (Hammond et al.,

        The infinite slope equation is still applicable to evaluate the impacts

        anticipate changes in two important factors in his or her modeling that 
        might result from the removal of trees: root strength and ground water 
        in response to precipitation changes. To evaluate the relative stability

        At this level of decision making, the specialist must be able to model 
        many unique critical site conditions and stabilization measure characteristics. 
        This requires a more complex analysis technique than those used in levels 
        I and II. The most common technique is to divide the potential failure 
        mass into a series of slices and model the individual slice forces -- 
        first individually and then collectively -- in a summation process to 
        arrive at a prediction of the overall potential for failure. Several "method-of-slices" 
        solution techniques are available, all having a common soil mechanics 
        base but differing in the manner in which they are satisfied, the more 
        complex and more difficult the analysis becomes. The computer program 
        XSTABL (XSTABL Ver. 4.1, 1992) developed by Sharma for Level III analysis 
        uses the simplified Bishop method for rotational failures and the simplified 
        Janbu method for failures of any general shape. These methods are sufficiently 
        accurate for most forest road applications. Sharma (1992) gives a comparison 
        of these methods to other methods of slices. </font> </td>
