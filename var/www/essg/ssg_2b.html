    <td valign="top" colspan="4" width="534"> 
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Geomorphic terranes 
        are units of the landscape defined by similar soil and rock properties, 
        slope-forming processes, topography, climate, and vegetation. Landscapes 
        of western North America have relatively complex geomorphic histories 
        that result in complex landscapes. To make analysis easier, landscapes 
        can be divided into units. The behaviors of landslides and other hillslope 
        and channel processes occurring in distinct geomorphic terranes often 
        require unique analyses. For instance, debris slides in steep terrain 
        of shallow soils respond to high-intensity precipitation occurring over 
        time scales of hours to weeks, while earthflows respond to precipitation 
        over time scales of weeks to years. When associated with an historical 
        landslide inventory, geomorphic terranes can be used to estimate landslide 
        sediment production and delivery over large areas. The Salmon River Basin 
        sediment analysis, presented in section <a href="ssg_2f.html">2F</a>, 
        is an example of this approach. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The site conditions 
        for geomorphic terranes that influence landsliding are either intrinsic 
        characteristics of the site (such as soil mechanics properties, soil hydrologic 
        properties, slope gradient, and vegetation composition and distribution) 
        or extrinsic characteristics (such as climate, precipitation intensity, 
        and seismic loading). It is these extrinsic influences that often trigger 
        landslides. By analyzing the landslide response to past events, we can 
        estimate the threshold intensity and frequency of landslide movement. 
        The spectrum of types of landslide episodes is bounded by combinations 
        of extremes of site conditions. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Landslides may be 
        classified using such criteria as mechanism and velocity of movement, 
        character of the soil and rock, mode of deformation, geometry of the moving 
        mass, and moisture content. This variety of classification schemes presents 
        difficulty, and the landslide classification scheme most commonly used 
        is that of Varnes (1978). Varnes distinguished two types of premovement 
        materials: bedrock and soil. Soil is described by the dominant grain size 
        and by moisture content. Rock masses are described by the frequency or 
        lack of discontinuities, their orientations, and shear strength. Landslides 
        are further described by rate of movement. It is important to identify 
        the classification scheme in use or to provide definition of these terms 
        in these observations. </font> </p>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Climate has a strong 
        influence on the distribution of water in and on the landscape. It is 
        important to have a good characterization of the range of precipitation 
        rates in both site stabilization design and assessment of effects. Landsliding 
        may be initiated by precipitation intensity and duration on a scale of 
        inches per hour to inches per decade. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Consider the variation 
        of landslide response between an intense thunder shower on an otherwise 
        dry landscape and a season of continuous, light rainfall on a landscape 
        saturated by antecedent rain. In the intense thunder shower, the intensity 
        of precipitation interplays primarily with soil permeability and the efficiency 
        of surface drainage. In this case, we might expect to see mass movement 
        dominated by surface-erosion and debris-flow processes. In a season of 
        prolonged light rainfall, the permeability of the landscape and efficiency 
        of subsurface drainage may be the limiting factors, and mass movement 
        may be dominated by subsurface erosion (such as piping) and movement of 
        earthflow landslides. These two situations might be viewed as end members 
        of a spectrum of precipitation that contributes to landsliding. </font> 
      </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A given landscape 
        will respond uniquely according to the character of other elements of 
        landsliding as well as rainfall. Where the rates of change associated 
        with other elements (such as soil formation, soil textural evolution, 
        and landform evolution) are relatively very slow, characterizing precipitation 
        associated with past landslide episodes is the best way of assessing future 
        behavior. </font> </p>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Widespread debris-flow 
        activity that occurred on windward hillslopes from northern California 
        to Utah in January 1982 and February 1986 is a good example of landslide 
        response to intense short-term precipitation. In these cases, landsliding 
        occurred in the middle of the winter rainy season, so the influence of 
        antecedent precipitation presumably was important. What was learned has 
        been summarized by Keefer et al. (1987). Previous investigations (Keefer 
        et al., 1987) reported hourly precipitation rates and antecedent rainfall 
        (expressed as amount since beginning of the rainy season). This opens 
        the possibility that the return probability of the precipitation landslide 
        event might be calculated. Keefer et al. (1987) suggested that an empirical 
        formula can be developed for local conditions using estimates of the rate 
        of loss of soil water and the critical volume of water in the soil at 
        the time of landsliding. Similar assessments of debris-flow activity can 
        be made for summer thunderstorms. </font> </p>

        (1987) described the methods and results of precipitation monitoring of 
        the event. They found 4 days of continuous precipitation at 20-50 mm/day, 
        peak precipitation rates at 21-102 mm/hr, and 177 percent of normal rainfall 
        during the 2 months prior to the event. Progress of the storm was monitored

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Where annual precipitation 
        is relatively high, variation occurring over decades may have a significant 
        influence on the occurrence of landslides. On the Pacific coast of North 
        America there is typically a strong decreasing gradient in annual precipitation 
        from the coast to the east side of the coastal mountain ranges. As a result, 
        a broad spectrum of landslide regimes is present. </font> </p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In northern California, 
        the annual precipitation gradient is about 1 inch of rain per mile from 
        the coast. Near the coast, average annual precipitation approaches 100 
        inches. At Yreka, on the north flank of Mount Shasta about 100 miles from 
        the coast, average annual precipitation is about 18 inches, ranging from 
        6 to 33 inches. At Happy Camp, on the Klamath River 30 miles from the 
        coast, average precipitation is about 50 inches, ranging from 23 to 88 
        inches. Much of the difference in landslide behavior between these two 
        locations can be explained by analysis of the weather records (see the 
        case history below). Most interesting is the effect on landslide behavior 
        of the larger range of variation of annual precipitation at Happy Camp. 
        The distribution of average annual precipitation through time is not random. 
        Years of below-average precipitation tend to be associated in time. The 
        result is occasional, prolonged climatic wet periods, with which is associated 
        most of the historical landslide activity. This effect may not be so pronounced 
        where the long-term range of annual precipitation is smaller. </font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Case History: 
        Distribution of Average Annual Precipitation and Landsliding in the Central 
        Klamath Mountains, CA </b> A detailed picture of the local climate is 
        useful in understanding the behavior of erosion, landsliding, and the 
        structure of stream channels. The annual precipitation during the period 
        of record (1915-1990) at Happy Camp ranges from 23 to 88 inches. The average 
        annual precipitation at the ranger station is about 51 inches. Annual 
        precipitation increases with elevation and to the west is 80 or more inches 
        per year. About 90 percent of precipitation occurs from October through 
        May during north Pacific cyclonic storms. The remainder occurs during 
        summer thunderstorms. The snow level varies from valley floor to summit 
        elevation during the winter season. Winter precipitation occurs mainly 
        as snow above 3,000 feet in elevation, and mainly as rain below that elevation. 
        The fluctuation of snow level occasionally results in rain falling on 
        snow, causing it to melt rapidly. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The precipitation 
        record is characterized by two distinct climate trends (Baldwin and de 
        la Fuente, 1986; Coghlan, 1984). These alternating trends of wet and dry 
        conditions last for a few decades. Climate change is not understood well 
        enough to forecast shifts in trends. Approximately 40 inches average annual 
        precipitation falls in the drier trends, and about 56 inches falls during 
        the wetter trends (see <a href="#2B_table2B.1">table 2B.1</a> 
        and <a href="#2B_Fig2B.1">figure 2.B1</a>). In comparing these 
        precipitation trends with the snow depth record from Crater Lake, OR, 
        it is apparent that fluctuations in temperature influence the proportion 
        of precipitation falling as snow. The Happy Camp record, along with longer 
        records from Eureka and other stations in northwestern California, indicate 
        that the period from 1870 to 1910 was a wet time, 1911 to 1937 dry, 1938 
        to 1975 wet, and 1976 to present dry. Similar fluctuations in climate 
        have been described by Coghlan (1984) for northwestern California, by 
        Meko and Stockton (1984) from stream flow records in the western United 
        States, and by LaMarche (1974) from interpretation of tree rings in the 
        White Mountains of California. Significant exceptions to the pattern include 
        the over 80 inches of precipitation of the 1982 and 1983 seasons associated 
        with the relatively strong El Ni�o/Southern Oscillation event and volcanic 
        eruptions of that time. <a name="#2B_table2B.1"></a> Table 2B.1.&mdash;Temporal

        rainfall. Activity of earthflows and attending debris-flows occurs during 
        series of years with higher levels of surplus precipitation and residual 
        ground water from preceding years of surplus precipitation. Because intense 
        precipitation (on a scale of inches per hour) also occurs in years of 
        above-average annual precipitation, episodes of widespread landsliding 
        of thin colluvial soils may also occur. Episodes of widespread landsliding

        many earthflows were active, but the rate of debris sliding in thin soils

        (1) Precipitation intensities necessary to activate many debris slides 
        were not achieved during this period, or (2) The potential for debris 
        sliding was reduced by the occurrence of debris slides during intense 
        precipitation in the period 1964-1975 (or both). The true explanation 
        might be answered by further analysis of the precipitation record.<i>

      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> When the precipitation 
        trigger has been characterized in terms of short- and long-term time distribution, 
        the return probability of such an event can be approximated. In western 
        North America, the greatest problem is the lack of a long-term precipitation 
        record, the longest records being only about 100 years old. This results 
        in poor quality estimates of events that have a return probability less 
        than a few times in a hundred years. However, records longer than 100 
        years have been interpreted from tree-ring analyses. The dendrochronology 
        laboratory at the University of Arizona is the source of much of this 
        work. When using climatic interpretations of tree rings, it is important 
        to remember that ring development is influenced by the seasonal distribution 
        of precipitation and temperature, as well as by annual precipitation. 
        Helley and LaMarche (1973) used alluvial stratigraphy and radio carbon 
        dating of included wood to recognize floods of the magnitude of the 1964-65 
        event during the last thousand years in the Klamath Mountains. Because 
        evidence of some floods may have been obscured by subsequent events, this 
        can be considered the minimum frequency. Pollen stratigraphy of lake deposits 
        in western North America is being interpreted for climatic information 
        relevant to Quaternary geomorphic history. This can be an important aspect 
        of landslide assessments because many of the erosion processes occurring 
        today are strongly influenced by landform evolution over the past hundred

        al. (1986) noted a clustering of minimum ages of radio carbon-dated colluvial 
        deposits of coastal northern California around 12,000 years ago, suggesting 
        a time of higher rate of landsliding. Adam and West (1983) and Adam (1988) 
        have described the transition from the last glacial advance that occurred 
        10,000 to 15,000 years ago. Their interpretation of pollen stratigraphy 
        at Clear Lake (Lake County, CA) suggests that climatic warming and substantial 
        drying occurred during the transition. </font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In the central Klamath 
        Mountains of California, a large proportion of landslides originates in 
        thick, red residual soils that lie on broad terraces a few hundred feet 
        above river elevation. Infrequent rounded quartz boulders found in the 
        otherwise fine grained soil suggest that these soils developed from alluvial 
        deposits. Based on radio carbon dates of similar soils in the Pacific 
        Northwest, Dietrich (personal communication, 1989) believes these soils 
        are typically over 40,000 years old. These surfaces are interpreted as 
        being formed during a period of climate wetter than that of Holocene time 
        and possibly lower levels of tectonic activity (Baldwin and de la Fuente, 
        1987 and 1989). Soils developed of deeply weathered granitic rocks occupy 
        concordant topographic positions. Rates of landslide production from these 
        soils are two to six times higher than metamorphic terrane in the same 
        area (de la Fuente and Hessig, 1992). The elevated landslide rate is attributed 
        to Holocene uplift and the incision of river channels through the deposits, 
        50-inch annual rainfall, and mechanical properties of the soils. Under 
        the influence of the modern climate, large (up to 10-acre) earthflow landslides 
        are common in the weathered alluvial/colluvial deposits. Debris flow is 
        the dominant landslide process in the granitic residuum. Topographic expression 
        of old scarps of earthflows of a few hundred acres indicate more extensive 
        activity of earthflows in the past, presumably under wetter climates and 
        possibly associated with great earthquakes of the Cascadia subduction

        base of the landslide. Seasonal pressure waves associated with above-average 
        annual precipitation controlled attainment of threshold piezometric levels.
