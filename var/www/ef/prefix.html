<p>In 1911, Priest River Experimental Forest was among the first experimental forests set aside
as a forestry research center.
The forest served as the headquarters for the Priest River Forest Experiment Station
until 1930 when the forest was incorporated into the Northern Rocky Mountain Forest
and Range Experiment Station.
The forest is currently administered by the Rocky Mountain Research Station from the
Moscow, Idaho, 
<a href="/">Forestry Sciences Laboratory</a>.
</p>
            <p>Since the establishment of the Priest River Experimental Forest, numerous educators, 
              Forest Service researchers, and state and private forestry personnel 
              have used the forest. Research conducted by Bob Marshall, Harry 
              Gisborne, Ken Davis, Charles Wellner, and Irvine Haig provided information 
              on basic forestry principles still used today for managing Rocky 
              Mountain forests. These and other researchers throughout the Forest's 
              history have made it a key location for conducting forest research. 
              <br />
              <br />
<b>            INTRODUCTION</b><br><br>
Established in 1911, the Priest River Experimental Forest (PREF) has a long history of research in a variety of natural resource disciplines.  PREF contains approximately 2,758 ha (6,368 ac.) of mountainous forestland, with small areas of talus and alpine grassland.  Within its boundaries is a diversity of forest successional stages that are representative of forested ecosystems found in the northern Rocky Mountains.  There are two Research Natural Areas, Canyon Creek, 395 ha (977ac.), which was established in 1937, and Wellner Cliffs, 125 ha (310ac.), established in 2006.  At the headquarters area, there is housing, laboratory space, and a conference building.  Long-term data sets of daily weather (1911), snow pack (1937), tree growth (1914) and streamflow (1938) have been collected and archived.  PREF became a monitoring site (site # ID02) of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) in 2003.
The site contains a variety of managed and reserve areas, a multitude of ecological site choices from wild to extremely disturbed situations, and all of the significant forest types and habitat associations of the region.  PREF has a long history of research in the disciplines of forest resource management.  Forest Service researchers and their partners from regional Universities have a history of cooperation and commitment to long-term ecological research. 

<br><br>GENERAL<br><br>
In terms of climate, topography, flora, and fauna, the Northern Rocky Mountains is a diverse region.  Within this context, PREF is an excellent representation of the forested ecosystems that are common to an area west of the continental divide and north of the Snake River Plain.
The Forest lies on the westward slope of a spur of the Selkirk Mountains.  Elevation varies from 671m at the Priest River on the west boundary, to 1798m at Experimental Point, 9km to the east.  Mountainous land occupies approximately 90% of the area.  This high land is cut by a number of streams flowing from east to west, leaving between them ridges which run in a general east and west direction.  The ridges are further dissected by tributary drainages.  Thus, though the main slopes are those facing north and south, there are also some of considerable extent having east and west exposures.  The slopes range from moderately steep to very steep.  Priest River cuts across the sw corner of the area and receives the drainage of Benton Creek, Canyon Creek, and Fox Creek.  Along these watersheds are low elevation, poorly drained alluvial bottoms, comparatively narrow and of small extent.  A little higher in elevation, are terraces or flats of stream-laid or lake-laid origin.

<br><br>CLIMATE<br><br>
In general terms, the Priest River-northern Rocky Mountain climate is transitional between a northern Pacific coastal type and a continental type.  The Pacific influence is noted particularly by the late autumn and winter maximum in cloudiness and precipitation; also in the relatively moderate average winter temperatures, compared with areas east of the continental divide.  Summer is characteristically sunny and dry, though July and August are the only distinct summer months (Finklin, 1983).
The average annual (water year) precipitation at the Forest headquarters is 817mm (32.17in).  At higher elevations, precipitation slightly increases as noted by the Benton Spring rain gage (elev. 1455m), which has an annual average of 925mm (36.42in).  The wettest months are November through January and close to 60% of the annual total occurs from November through March.  Snowfall accounts for more than 50% of the total precipitation at elevations above 1400m.  Snow cover usually persists in the valleys from early December through the end of March; the seasonal maximum depth averages 49cm (19.29in).  High elevation snowpack can reach an average depth of 132cm (51.97in) at the end of March and sometimes remain into June.
The monthly mean temperatures at the headquarters range from -4�C (25�F) in January to 18�C (64�F) in July; these are midpoint values between the average daily max and min temperatures based on a 1700 hours observation time.  The annual mean temperature is 7�C (45�F).  Extreme temperatures have ranged from a high of 40� C (103� F) to a low of -38� C (-36� F).
The climate at PREF provides a transition between the strong maritime influence on the coniferous forests of the coastal Pacific Northwest domain and the dryer, colder interior flora found east of the continental divide.  The long-term daily weather record, coupled with the snow pack record, allow researchers to document subtle changes in weather patterns.  This is particularly relevant to stakeholders within the drainages of the Priest, Pend O'Reille, Snake, Clearwater, and Columbia River systems.

The soils of the mountain slopes are underlain by rocks which grade on the coarse side into granites and imperceptibly into gneiss and schist.  The major rock type appears to be gneiss.  The schist contains prominent biotite and muscovite mica, and is thinner bedded than the gneiss.  
Soils at elevations up to 1,000m on southerly aspects are associated with shallow Saltese soils with minor amounts of deeper Jughandle soils on concave slopes of the drainages.  Above this threshold, the Jughandle soils and associated phases of exposure, except the subalpine phase above 1400m, are mapped in the zone of maximum soil moisture and soil temperature effectiveness.  Fertility is high on these sites.  Above 1,400m, the colder soils predominate, though moisture is near maximum.  South-facing slopes near this elevation and above contain the Horsehead soils which represent a prairie-forest transition to the subalpine environment.
Moisture is usually limiting to high timber production on soils of the river terraces and lacustrine benches, and the south-facing slopes at lower elevations.  Relatively high evaporation from prevailing southwest winds helps make these sites dry.  The stream terraces and fans of Benton and Canyon Creeks have favorable run-in moisture from side slopes, and fertility and productivity are near maximum in the area.  Soils of the middle elevations and on northerly, easterly, and westerly slopes have highest fertility and productivity associated with favorable moisture-temperature relationships.  Soils of the high elevations have less favorable soil temperature and lowest fertility (McConnell 1965).
The soils of PREF, Jughandle, Cabinet, Springdale, and Chamokane, are extensively mapped in forest lands in northern Idaho.  Saltese and Horsehead soils have been mapped in Montana in the St. Regis and Ninemile area.  A detailed geologic map of the Sandpoint Quadrangle, which includes the entire Priest River drainage, was completed in 1979.

<br><br>VEGETATION<br><br>
About 2/3 of PREF is covered in mixed conifer forest over 100 years old.  Most of this is timber in the 120 to 140-year age class (resulting from a fire ca. 1860).  The remainder is in timber over 200 years old.  The other third of PREF is in non-stocked areas or in young timber on harvest units and burns that have occurred since PREF was established (Wellner 1976).
The most detailed and intensive sampling of habitat types and cover types at PREF was reported by Daubenmire (1973) (also see Wellner 1976).  Reconnaissance surveys and mapping have helped determine cover types and habitat types.  Habitat types within PREF are best described as "complex" because of the extremely rapid changes in aspects and from wet to dry habitats.  Plant species diversity is high due to the number of different habitat types that are intimately intermixed.  Within the Wellner Cliffs RNA are plants indicative of wet habitats - western redcedar (Thuja plicata), wild ginger (Asarum caudatum), baneberry (Actaea rubra), and devils club (Oplopanax horridum).  These occur within a few feet of dry habitats that support species such as ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosae), lodgepole pine (P. contorta), Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis), and bluebunch wheatgrass (Agropyron spicatum).  A species list of vascular plants was developed by the Idaho Native Plant Society on July 26-27, 1997 (Ferguson, Zack 2006). (LINK TO SPECIES LIST)
Mosses and lichens were inventoried along the lower section of Canyon Creek within the RNA in 2001.  During this inventory, the moss Ulota megalospora was recorded for the first time in Idaho.  A list of lichens observed by Mike Hays at Wellner Cliffs RNA was complied in July 1997.  (LINK TO MOSS/LICHEN LIST)

<br><br>AQUATIC<br><br>
A survey of lower Canyon Creek was conducted by Fred Rabe in 1995 (Rabe 1995).  The surveyed portion of the stream was the last 0.3 miles (0.5 km) of Canyon Creek before it exits the Wellner Cliffs RNA.  In this section of the stream, Canyon Creek is a 2nd order stream with v-shaped valley form and 4-6% gradient.  Stream size is 5-15 ft (1.5-4.6 m), averaging 11 ft (3.4 m).  Sinuosity index is 1.3 (average) with many debris dams caused by windthrown trees falling into the stream.  This riffle-pool stream had a pH 7.3 and 45 �F (7.2 �C) temperature on September 25, 1995.  Canopy coverage was estimated at 60-75% of the channel shaded by vegetation, which were mostly shrubs and conifers.
Rabe compiled a list of 40 macro invertebrate taxa found in the RNA.  A low biotic index was calculated from these data, indicating the macro invertebrate community is quite intolerant of poor water quality conditions.  (LINK TO SPECIES LIST)
In his summary, Rabe notes that lower Canyon Creek would be a good choice as a reference site for comparison with impacted streams of similar size and flow."

<br><br>RESEARCH<br><br>
Since 1911, Forest Service scientists and their cooperators have examined forest fire and fuels, hydrology, silviculture, forest ecology, insects, and diseases of Rocky Mountain conifers.  Recent and ongoing projects have evaluated adaptability of native conifers to climate change, compared strategies for restoration of western white pine (Pinus monticola), compared mechanical site preparation as an alternative to prescribed fire, and will evaluate the impact of wildfire and management activities on sediment migration and soil productivity.

The University of Idaho has been an active participant at PREF, conducting research and mentoring students since 1928.  For more than a decade, the Priest River Experimental Forest has been a center of stable carbon isotope analysis in the Rockies, where the work focused first on elevation and species differences, then on CO2 effects, and more recently on tree height and foliar N effects. To support model parameterization, there have also been extensive studies of allometric functions, vertical trends in leaf mass per area, leaf turnover, leaf area index, and d13C & 18O. Recent as-yet unpublished work has included extensive analyses of sap flow, nocturnal transpiration, and isotopic mass balance of soil water, LIDAR and hyperspectral remote sensing.  (LINK TO UOFI)

<br><br>FACILITES<br><br>
The headquarters site at PREF consists of an office/lab building, three residential buildings, a bunkhouse/mess hall, and modest shop.  A full-time resident and employee occupy a fourth residence.  All were constructed by Civilian Conservation Corps between 1934 and 1939 and are listed in the National Register of Historic Places.  A conference building, with a capacity of 50, was constructed in 1998.  A detailed archaeological survey of PREF was conducted in 1978 and is on file at the Moscow Forestry Science Lab; the Gisborne fire lookout is listed on the National Historic Lookout Register.
During the field season, PREF averages 1000 days use by Forest Service personnel and their cooperators.  The residential buildings and bunkhouse have a capacity of 27 beds.  During the winter months, a cabin and the bunkhouse/mess hall are shutdown, reducing bed space to 18.  All residential buildings have full kitchens and linens are provided.
