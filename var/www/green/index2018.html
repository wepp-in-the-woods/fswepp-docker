      We encourage you to participate in the <i>Summit Mount Sustainability Footprint Reduction Contest</i>.
      Participants will compete as individuals and as part of a team primarily based on location, so go out and encourage your co-workers to participate!
      We all win by learning how to be more sustainable and by reducing our environmental footprint!

      <li>Participants will work toward one or two two-hour time-off awards.</li>
      <li>Two group locations will be awarded $250 each for Sustainable Operations improvements of their choice.</li>
     </ul>
     To participate, enter your Forest Service e-mail address (or a reasonable facsimile, only letters and numbers allowed) and your duty location,
     check out the actions, and then return at any time to record the 'green' activities you have completed.
     Some activities are weekly, some daily, and some are one-time actions within the contest period.<br><br>
     You can visit this web page and check on or correct the recording of your accomplishments,
     and see how your actions and your location's actions compare to others', at any time during the contest.
    <br><br>
