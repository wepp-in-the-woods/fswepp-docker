     The Rocky Mountain Research Station Sustainable Operations Green Team created this contest
     to help encourage the adoption of 'green' activities in your day to day work.
     <br><br>
     We challenge you to step up and participate in the <i>Summit Mt. Sustainability Footprint Reduction Contest</i>.
     Participants will compete as individuals and as part of a team based primarily on location.
     <ul>
      <li>Participants will work toward one or two 2-hour time-off awards.</li>
      <li>Two group locations will be awarded $250 each for Sustainable Operations improvements of their choice.</li>
     </ul>
     So, go out and encourage your co-workers to participate.
     We all win by learning how to be more sustainable and reduce our environmental footprint!
    <br><br>
     To participate, enter your Forest Service email address (or a reasonable facsimile, only letters and numbers allowed) and your duty location,
     check out the actions, and then return weekly to record the 'green' activities you have completed.
     Some activities are weekly, some daily, and some are one-time within the contest period.<br>
     You can visit this web page and check on or correct the recording of your accomplishments,
     and see how your actions and your location's actions compare to others', at any time during the contest.
