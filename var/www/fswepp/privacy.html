   <blockquote>
    For site management, information is collected as the 
    <font color="crimson">standard logging</font> done
    by the server software. These records are
    used to create summary statistics for such analysis as assessing
    which pages are of most and least interest, and
    identifying system performance or problem areas.
    <br><br>
    We keep
    <font color="crimson">log files for each FS&nbsp;WEPP model run</font>.
    These log files record the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the machine
    which initiated the run, the date and time of the run, and the input parameters used.
    We use these logs to assess the interest in and distribution of use of the FS&nbsp;WEPP software
    and to aid users.
    Neither the user's name nor his or her e-mail address is recorded
    (nor are they available to us).
    <br><br>
    The WEPP:Road <font color="crimson">user's log</font>
    (if the user requests one) is stored on our server for a period of time.
    This log contains only the information displayed in the log, and is associated with
    the user only by the IP address of the computer requesting the model run.
    <br><br>
    Each user may have several <font color="crimson">personal climates</font>
    stored for a period of time on the server.  
    These also are associated with the user only by the IP address of the computer requesting the model run.
    <br><br>
    At times there are input and output files for the model runs stored on the server.
    These are flushed out but may be captured during routine backups. These files can be
    connected to the IP address of the computer requesting the model run.
    <br><br>
    "Cookies" are used to attempt to
    <a href="id_info.html">distinguish between users</a> in certain situations
    (which are sometimes encountered in group training sessions) or
    between groups of runs from the same computer.
    <br><br>
    We gather from the web site no other information on FS WEPP users
    except for the names and addresses optionally supplied by
    users in the <font color="crimson">comment forms</font>.
