   <blockquote>
    Custom climate files and log files are connected to the user by what is
    known as an Internet Protocol or IP address -- a four-part numeric code
    that is the address of the computer on which your browser is running.  
    If one starts two FS&nbsp;WEPP sessions from different computers, each will
    show different personal climates and log files unique to that machine.
    The situation can get confused, however, when several people are actually
    running FS&nbsp;WEPP from one computer at the same time (such as in a training
    session, where the students are sitting at terminals running off of one
    central computer on which the Internet browser is running).
    We allow users in such a situation to select an identity (one letter "a" to "z")
    to distinguish their climates and log files from those of other users on
    the computer.
    <br><br>
    If two or more users select the same identity (or select no identity) and
    are running FS&nbsp;WEPP from the same browser, then the runs from each user
    will be jumbled together in the logs, and one user's personal climate
    might get overwritten without notification by another user.  
    <br><br>
    The user may select, on the initial FS&nbsp;WEPP screen, a one-letter
    identity to distinguish herself or himself from others using FS&nbsp;WEPP on
    the same computer.  Again, this is important only for users whose browser
    software is located on a central computer with multiple users using FS&nbsp;WEPP.
    Your selected identity is stored in a "cookie" on your computer
    for at most one day.  Your browser must be configured to allow cookies
    (which they generally are, by default) and, if asked, you must accept the
    cookie, for your identity to work.
