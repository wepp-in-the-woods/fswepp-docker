<blockquote>
The custom climates and log files are connected to the user by what is
known as an Internet Protocol or IP address -- a four-part numeric code
that is the address of the computer on which your browser is running.  
If one starts two FS WEPP
sessions from different computers, each will show different personal
climates and log files unique to that machine.  The situation can get
confused, however, when several people are actually running FS WEPP from
one computer at the same time (such as in a training session, where the
students are sitting at terminals running off of one central computer on
which the Internet browser is running).  Temporarily, we are allowing
users in such a situation to select an identity (one letter "a" to "z")
to distinguish their climates and log files from those of other users on
the computer.
<p>
If two or more users select the same identity (or select no identity) and
are running FS WEPP from the same browser, then the runs from each user
will be jumbled together in the logs, and one user's personal climate
might get overwritten without notification by another user.  
<p>
For now, the user may select, on the initial FS WEPP screen, a one-letter
identity to distinguish herself or himself from others using FS WEPP on
the same computer.  Again, this is important only for users whose browser
software is located on a central computer with multiple users using
FS WEPP.  Your selected identity is stored in a "cookie" on your computer
for at most one day.  Your browser must be configured to allow cookies
(which they generally are, by default) and, if asked, you must accept the
cookie, for your identity to work.
<p>
We are developing a more robust and satisfactory solution.
