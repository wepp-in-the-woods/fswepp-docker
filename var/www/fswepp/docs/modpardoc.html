<h2 align=center>Modify Climate Parameters instruction</h2>
This screen, which is reached by clicking the "modify climate" button from
the WEPP:Road or Disturbed WEPP input screens, has a <b><i>lot</i></b> of
numbers on it.
<p>

Generally, users who wish to customize a climate have knowledge of mean
precipitation or temperatures for a given site.
They seldom have enough information to develop values for standard
deviation or skew statistics.
Hence, a technology was developed to allow users to customize the mean
values for the site of interest, while using the other statistics from an existing
(presumably nearby) CLIGEN station.
As a minimum users can enter the average monthly precipitation amounts.
Users can either enter exact values, or specify a percent increase or
decrease over those at the existing station.
If they have the data, they can also enter the number of wet days in a
month, and the average monthly maximum and minimum temperatures.  

<h3>Left-hand side: the base values</h3>
The left-hand half of the table always shows a selection of climate parameters 
from the climate station that is being modified.  
These values can not be changed by the user.
The station climate file has many other values which are not displayed.
These include dewpoint, storm type, solar radiation, and wind parameters.

<h3>Right-hand side: modified values</h3>
The right-hand side of the table is adjustable by the user to hold any desired values.
At the moment, not much error-checking is performed on the input values, so be careful.
<p>
There are a number of ways to modify the climate values displayed in the
right-hand side of the table.

<h4>Brute Force, cell by cell</h4>
The user may enter a value for any or all monthly or annual values for
mean maximum and minimum temperature, mean precipitation, and number of
wet days.
<h4>Change an entire column by a percentage or temperature</h4>
At the bottom of the columns for mean maximum and minimum temperature,
mean precipitation, and number of wet days
are boxes into which one may specify a change to be applied to all of the
monthly
and annual values in the respective column.
The values will not be updated on screen until the user presses the "tab"
key or clicks the cursor into a different cell.
<b><i>All of this type of adjustment are based on the base values displayed on the
left-hand side of the table.  Existing values in the column are ignored.</i></b>
For the temperature columns, the number of degrees increase or decrease is specified.
For precipitation and number of wet days, a percentage change is specified.
Entering a value of "0" (zero) for any column will reset the values to those shown
in the respective left-hand column.

<h4>Adjust temperatures for lapse rate</h4>
The temperature values can be changed based on the difference in elevation for the
base station and that shown at the top of the right-hand side of the table.
<p>
Lapse rates are specified as 6°C/km [17.4°F/mi]
for maximum temperature and 5°C/km [14.5°F/mi] for minimum temperature.
These values are comparable to 4.8 to 6.8°C/km found by Johnson et al.
(1998) and the average 6°C/km given by Trewartha and Horn (1980).
Generally, average minimum temperature lapse rates are not as great as maximum rates 
because of temperature inversions that can occur during the evenings or during very 
cold winter days.

<h4>Retrieve PRISM precipitation data</h4>
The PRISM (Parameter-Regressions on Independent Slopes Model) database was developed 
cooperatively by the USDA-NRCS and ARS, and Oregon State University (Daly et al. 1997).
The database contains the average monthly precipitation values and average elevations
for a 2.5-min. grid covering the entire conterminous U.S.
It was developed by interpolating and extrapolating precipitation amounts between 
weather stations.
Factors to allow for elevation, aspect, and other local effects were considered in 
the development.  
Numerous state climatologists have reviewed the PRISM database, and their observations 
incorporated into it.
<p>
The user may retrieve monthly and annual precipitation data for any location in the
conterminous U.S. by entering the location's decimal latitude and longitude in the
boxes provided, and clicking on the "PRISM" button.
When the "PRISM" button is pressed, a new screen (figure 2)
will be displayed, from which one may roam around the PRISM dataset until just the
right location is found (or the user may elect not to use the database).
<p>

<p>
If one clicks on [PRISM], then the screen changes to:
<p>
<img src="images/mprism.gif" align=center>
<p>
The left-hand table displays the monthly and annual precipitation values for the 
base station on the left and the values from the PRISM database on the right.
<p>
The right-hand table displays two 3-by-3 grids of PRISM data.
The top grid displays the annual PRISM precipitation values for the 2.5-minute
cell encompassing the specified latitude and longitude along with the precipitation
values for the eight surrounding cells.
The lower grid shows the equivalent for the PRISM elevation values.
<p>
The user may roam about the landscape by clicking on any of the eight surrounding
cell values in either the precipitation grid or the elevation grid.
The left-hand table will be updated with the new PRISM values, as will the
right-hand grids.
<p>
When the user is satisfied with the PRISM values displayed in the left-hand
table, he or she may press the [Use PRISM values] button to proceed to the
screen shown in figure 3.
Alternatively, the user may [Retreat] to the screen in figure 1.
<p>
<img src="images/modp.gif" align=center>
<p>
When press [Use PRISM values] button in screen in figure 2, the screen in
figure 3 will be displayed.  It is the same as the screen in figure 1, except
that one column heading is changed, and the latitude, longitude, elevation, and
monthly and annual precipitation values from the PRISM query will be displayed.
<p>
One may well wish to check the "Adjust temperature for elevation by lapse rate"
to modify the monthly and annual temperature values.
<b>One should not enter a value in the "PRISM precipitation" cell in the 
"Change entire column" row or the PRISM values will be lost.</b>
<p>
Change the text in the "New climate name" field to represent the new data,
and press [Use these values] to create a new climate parameter file for yourself.
