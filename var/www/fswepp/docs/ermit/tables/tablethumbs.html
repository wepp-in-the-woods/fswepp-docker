     With each year of postfire recovery, the assigned occurrence probabilities and the selection of burn severity
     Overland Flow Element (OFE) arrangements (H=high burn severity overland flow element; L=low burn severity overland flow element)
     are shifted toward lower burn severity.

     The postfire value ranges for interrill erodibility (<i>Ki</i>), rill erodibility (<i>Kr</i>),
     effective hydraulic conductivity (<i>Ke</i>), and critical shear (<i>&tau;c</i>) are based on soil texture and
     soil burn severity user selections.
     For range and chaparral lands, user-designated pre-fire canopy cover proportions provide an additional level of
     classification for <i>Ki</i> and <i>Ke</i> values.

     To model change over time, the assigned occurrence probability of 'Soil 1' and 'Soil 2'
     (the less erodible soil parameters sets) are increased and 'Soil 3,' 'Soil 4,' and 'Soil 5'
     (the more erodible soil parameters sets) are decreased for each year of postfire recovery.

     The assigned occurrence probabilities for the rain events, burn severity downslope spatial arrangements
     (H=high burn severity overland flow element; L=low burn severity overland flow element),
     and the soil parameter sets are combined to provide 100 occurrence probabilities associated with
     100 event erosion predictions for postfire year 1. Ten of the 100 permutations are shown completely.

     The exceedance probability for each event sediment delivery prediction is computed as the sum of
     one plus the occurrence probabilities for all greater sediment yield predictions.
     The example illustrated below shows that an event sediment delivery of 20.6 t ha<sup>-1</sup>
     has an exceedance probability of 9.9%.
     Note that only a portion of the 100 sediment delivery predictions are shown.
