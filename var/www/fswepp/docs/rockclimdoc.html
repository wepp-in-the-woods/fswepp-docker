Introduction</h3>

<i>Rock:Clime,</i> the Rocky Mountain Research Station Stochastic Weather Generator,
is a web browser-based interface to the 
<a href="cligench2.pdf"><i>CLIGEN</i></a> climate generator developed by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service (ARS)
as a part of the <i>WEPP</i>
(<a href="http://forest.moscowfsl.wsu.edu/engr/wepp0.html">Water Erosion Prediction Project</a>)
computer model.
<p>
<center><table bgcolor="#f0f0f0" border=1 cellpadding=10>
<tr><td>
Rock:Clime builds the climate files for the
FS&nbsp;WEPP interfaces to the
WEPP model.
</table></center>
<p>
Behind <i>Rock:Clime</i> lies a database of more than 2,600 weather stations from all 50 states,
the Pacific Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
The climate database was derived from weather station data received from the
ARS Hydrology Laboratory (USDA-ARS 1999).

<img src="images/backtotop.gif" border="0"
 onMouseOver="window.status='Return to top'; return true"
 onMouseOut="window.status='Rock:Clime documentation'; return true"></a>
Applications</h3>
<i>Rock:Clime</i> has two applications.  
It can be accessed directly from the initial <i>FS&nbsp;WEPP</i> interface screen to 
generate a climate file for use outside of the <i>FS&nbsp;WEPP</i> suite of interfaces, 
or as a secondary application through one of the <i>FS&nbsp;WEPP</i> interfaces, 
to select a climate for that application.

<blockquote>
<h4>Download climate file</h4>
If <i>Rock:Clime</i> is run directly from the initial <i>FS&nbsp;WEPP</i> screen,
it can generate a climate file for the climate station and number of years specified.
<a href="#appendix2">Appendix&nbsp;2</a> shows a sample climate file.

The file is a <i>WEPP</i> continuous storm <tt>.cli</tt> file as created by
<i>CLIGEN</i> version&nbsp;4.3.
The generated climate file is downloaded and saved to the user's client computer for 
use by <i>WEPP</i> or other programs that can make use of a daily weather file.
<p>
<i>WEPP</i> users will find this application to be useful because of the significant 
increase in the number of climates available from <i>Rock:Clime</i> (2,600) over that in 
the <i>WEPP</i> distribution (1,200).
Of equal import is that the data for many of the stations distributed with the 
ARS version of <i>WEPP</i> contained minor errors, and many of these errors have been 
corrected for <i>Rock:Clime</i> (see <a href="#improvements">Improvements in Database</a>).
The climate files generated by <i>Rock:Clime</i> should more accurately represent observed 
weather patterns.
<p>
The generated climate files typically should be saved to the directories listed in 
<a href="#table1">table&nbsp;1</a> for use with <i>WEPP</i>.

<h4><i>FS&nbsp;WEPP</i> Applications</h4>
<i>Rock:Clime</i> can be accessed from one of the other
<i>FS&nbsp;WEPP</i> programs, such as <i>WEPP:Road.</i>
In this application, the user runs <i>Rock:Clime</i> through the "Custom Climate" button 
to view a summary of the climate data for a selected station or to add or remove climate 
stations in the "personal climates" list.
<p>
"Personal climates" are climates associated with an individual user's computer
which can be selected for use in <i>WEPP:Road</i> and the
other <i>FS&nbsp;WEPP</i> interfaces in addition to the short original list of climates.
In the <i>FS&nbsp;WEPP</i> climate selection menus, personal climates are marked with an asterisk 
(e.g. <b>*&nbsp;TELLURIDE&nbsp;CO</b>).  
In <i>WEPP:Road,</i> each user can have up to five personal climates listed.  
Climates can be added to or removed from this list at any time.

Screen Descriptions
</h3>

When <i>Rock:Clime</i> is selected from the <i>FS&nbsp;WEPP</i> interface,
an initial screen allows the user to select the desired region
(<a href="javascript:popup('images/d-rcin.gif','figs')">figure&nbsp;1</a>).
Regions include the 50 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,
and the Pacific islands.
<p>
On the initial screen, the user can scroll through the list of regions to select the desired
state or island group.
Clicking the "SHOW ME THE CLIMATES" button accesses the Climate Station Screen for the 
selected region (<a href="javascript:popup('images/d-rcshow.gif','figs')">figure&nbsp;2</a>).
The user must select a station and specify the number of years of climate desired.  
For climates with more than 500 mm (20 in.) of precipitation, 30 years are generally adequate.  
For climates with less than 500 mm of precipitation, 50 or more years of climate may be 
necessary to capture the high variability of rainfall associated with drier climates
(Baffaut and others 1996).
<p>
Sometimes the closest climate may not be the best descriptor for a given site.  
The user may wish to compare several climates to determine which climate best suits the site.  
The station latitude, longitude, and elevation, and the monthly average values for maximum 
and minimum temperature, precipitation amount, and number of wet days can be viewed by 
clicking "DESCRIBE CLIMATE" (<a href="javascript:popup('images/d-rcshow.gif','figs')">figure&nbsp;3</a>).
The units will be degrees Fahrenheit and inches or degrees Celsius and millimeters according 
to the units selection made on the <i>FS&nbsp;WEPP</i> screen.
<p>
If <i>Rock:Clime</i> is called from within <i>WEPP:Road</i>
(by clicking on the "Custom Climate" button),
or from within other <i>FS&nbsp;WEPP</i> interfaces,
the initial <i>Rock:Clime</i> screen will be
different than it is when <i>Rock:Clime</i> is called directly
(<a href="javascript:popup('images/d-rcwrin.gif','figs')">figure&nbsp;4</a>).
This <i>FS&nbsp;WEPP</i> application interface works in the same way as does the direct
application screen with the addition of the ability to manage the 'personal climates' stored on the 
server. 
This option is not available if <i>Rock:Clime</i> is not started from within another
<i>FS&nbsp;WEPP</i> application.  
An asterisk beside the station name indicates that the climate is a personal climate 
stored on the <i>FS&nbsp;WEPP</i> server under the user's computer name.  
This is consistent with the display in <i>WEPP:Road</i> where the stations with
asterisks are personal climates and the stations without are the stock climates.
<p>
When <i>Rock:Clime</i> is run from an <i>FS&nbsp;WEPP</i> application,
<i>Rock:Clime</i> will not ask for the number of years of simulation.
Instead, the number of years of simulation is specified on the <i>FS&nbsp;WEPP</i>
application screen.
<p>
After a new climate has been generated, the browser's "back" button should not be 
used to return to <i>WEPP:Road,</i> because that will simply redisplay the
<i>WEPP:Road</i> screen as it was before changes were made.
If the previous climate list is displayed, return to the <i>FS&nbsp;WEPP</i>
screen, and rerun <i>WEPP:Road.</i>
(The browser "refresh" or "reload" button will not work here for the stand-alone version.)

The <i>Rock:Clime</i> Database
</h3>
Each climate parameter file in the <i>Rock:Clime</i> database consists of station 
identification information and monthly statistical weather data for the station
(see <a href="#appendix1">appendix&nbsp;1</a> for a sample file).  
These files are in the <i>CLIGEN</i> parameter file format (Flanagan 1998)
except that each <i>Rock:Clime</i> station has its own file
(rather than having all stations concatenated into one state file), and extra station
information has been appended to the <i>Rock:Clime</i> files.

Current versions of <i>CLIGEN</i> will handle the additional lines.
<p>
The station identification includes
<ul><li>station name, state, and identification number
    <li>station latitude and longitude
    <li>station elevation (ft.)
    <li>number of years of record on which the statistics are based
    <li>climate type (1 to 4)
    <li>maximum 30-min precipitation depth (in.) and maximum 6-hr precipitation depth (in.)
</ul>
The statistical weather data are monthly values for:
<ul><li>mean, standard deviation, and skew coefficient of liquid equivalent precipitation depth for a day in which precipitation occurs (in.)
    <li>probability of a wet day following a wet day (fraction)
    <li>probability of a wet day following a dry day (fraction)
    <li>means and standard deviations for maximum and minimum daily air temperature (ºF) 
    <li>mean and standard deviation of daily solar radiation (Langleys) 
    <li>maximum daily half-hour precipitation depth (in.) 
    <li>mean daily dew point temperature (ºF) 
    <li>cumulative distribution function shape for computed time to peak rainfall intensity
    <li>mean, standard deviation, and skew coefficient of wind speed (mi. hr<sup>-1</sup>) from each of 16 compass points, and percent of time wind comes from that direction (decimal percent) 
    <li>percent of time air is calm (decimal percent)
</ul>
<p>
The precipitation and temperature data are from 40 or more years of weather records at the named station.  
The remaining climate statistics are estimated from sets of data with fewer weather stations and for 
generally shorter periods of record (Nicks and others 1995).  
For each named station, the two or three "nearby" stations with more detailed information for a given 
statistic were selected to estimate the appropriate values for the named station using weighted averages.  
The "nearby" stations are selected according to distance and position relative to the desired station 
using methods similar to those which created the original <i>CLIGEN</i> parameter files for
<i>WEPP</i> (Jane Thurman, personal communication, ARS Water Data Center, Beltsville, MD).  
The weighting factors are part of the <i>Rock:Clime</i> data base which can be viewed with a
text editor with the standalone version of <i>FS&nbsp;WEPP,</i> but are not accessible from 
the network sites.
The path name to the database on the standalone version is:
<blockquote>
    X:\fswepp\cgi-bin\fswepp\rc\<i>ID</i>\
</blockquote>
where <i>X:</i> is the drive containing the <i>FS&nbsp;WEPP</i> program
(usually <tt>C:</tt> or <tt>D:</tt>), and <i>ID</i> is the desired  state.  
The key to the station codes (matching station name to station identification
number and file name) is contained in the file named <tt><i>ID</i>_climates</tt>
in each state directory.
The last few lines of 
<a href="#appendix1">appendix&nbsp;1</a> are an example of the weighted average report.

Generated Climate File
</h3>
The generated climate file is a standard <i>WEPP</i> multiple year continuous storm <tt>.cli</tt> 
climate input file, which consists of a daily sequence of simulated representative weather 
for the number of years requested.
The file has a ten-line header providing summary data for the file followed by one line of 
weather values for each day of simulation.
<a href="#appendix2">Appendix&nbsp;2</a> shows the beginning of a representative file.
<p>
For each day of simulation, the file contains the following information (Flanagan and Livingston 1995):
<ol><li>day, month, and ordinal year of simulation
    <li>precipitation amount (mm), duration (hours), time to peak intensity (fraction of duration) and peak intensity (ratio of maximum rainfall intensity to average rainfall intensity)
    <li>maximum and minimum temperature (ºC)
    <li>daily solar radiation (Langleys per day)
    <li>average wind velocity (m s<sup>-1</sup>)
    <li>wind direction (degrees from North)
    <li>dew point temperature (ºC)
</ol>

The size of a generated climate file is about 26,000 bytes per year of simulation.
<p>
The <i>CLIGEN</i> version number (presented on the first line of the climate file) is set to 4.30.
Some versions of <i>WEPP</i>  will not recognize that <i>CLIGEN</i> version.
If you are in this situation, we recommend that you update your <i>WEPP</i> software.
In the mean time, it should be safe to edit your new <i>CLIGEN</i> file to report version&nbsp;4.00 on the
first line.

Improvements in the <i>Rock:Clime</i> Database
</h3>
We found and corrected a number of errors in the <i>CLIGEN</i> database distributed with <i>WEPP.</i>
<ul>
    <li>We worked with Agricultural Research Service Water Data Center, Hydrology Laboratory personnel
	to realign certain shifted data in the data files used for calculating the precipitation and
	temperature statistics.
    <li>We adjusted several station names to correspond to the correct station numbers based on data from
	the National Weather Service (NWS).
    <li>The NWS data also were used to correct errors in elevation, latitude, longitude, and spelling.
    <li>A record of the weather stations used for parameter interpolation, and the weighting factors,
	was appended to each station climate parameter file.
	This information was added in the same format as the existing records for interpolation of wind
	data already listed in the CLIGEN parameter files.
	We added records of the stations used for solar radiation and maximum half-hour precipitation,
	dewpoint, and time to peak.
    <li>We increased the number of wind stations available for interpolation.
    <li>The disproportionate maximum half-hour precipitation values for November and December in
	Boise, ID, were lowered.
	This affected all stations that used Boise, ID for interpolating maximum half-hour precipitation. 
    <li>A maximum distance check was added to the parameter file creation program so stations in
	Hawaii, Alaska, and California no longer used with each other for interpolation.
    <li>Some of the interpolation data contained zero values, which were verified to be incorrect.
	Where we could not estimate proper values, the files were removed from the database.
	Elevation values of zero also were checked and corrected if necessary.
    <li>To make some of the new parameter files, storm type values were either found in the
	Arlin Nicks database at the USDA-ARS Hydrology Laboratory Water Data Center, or were
	chosen based on the predominant storm type reported for nearby stations.
</ul>

Validation of Rock:Clime
</h3>
<i>Rock:Clime</i> is an interface for the USDA ARS
<i>CLIGEN</i> Version&nbsp;4.3 climate generator.  
Version&nbsp;4.3  reads individual parameter files instead of the state files which are 
concatenations of many parameter files but is otherwise unchanged from version&nbsp;4.2 
released with <i>WEPP.</i>
There are numerous references providing validation support for <i>CLIGEN.</i>
These should be valid for <i>Rock:Clime</i> in as far as they analyze the
<i>CLIGEN</i> algorithms 
rather than the specific generated climates.
<p>
The technical description and validation for small watersheds for <i>CLIGEN</i>
(Nicks and others 1995) is in the <i>WEPP</i> Documentation.
Nicks and Gander (1977) also performed a spatial analysis of the weather generator parameters.
Baffaut and others (1996) studied the number of years of <i>CLIGEN</i> simulation
necessary to obtain  an average erosion rate, and compared the erosivity of
<i>CLIGEN</i>-generated climates to RUSLE erosivity values.  
Elliot and others (1992) studied the suitability of <i>CLIGEN</i> version&nbsp;1 for
driving a subsurface drainage model, and determined that this early version of
<i>CLIGEN</i> was over-predicting storm duration.
The predicted duration values have since been reduced, and Elliot and Arnold (under review) 
indicated that current duration values are likely to be similar to observed values.  

Arnold and Elliot (1996) found that monthly probability density functions for wet and dry 
spells predicted by <i>CLIGEN</i> were similar to observed spell lengths for
lower-elevation, storm-driven climates.  
<i>CLIGEN</i> did not perform as well for higher elevation precipitation patterns with
a greater frequency of low-intensity rains.

Climate file life expectancy
</h3>
With stand-alone operation, the personal climates will remain on the user's computer until the 
user deletes them, or they are overwritten by new personal climates within <i>Rock:Clime.</i>
<p>
For network users, a user's "personal climates" for the <i>FS&nbsp;WEPP</i> programs are
stored on the server and are associated with the user by the Internet Protocol (IP) address of
his or her machine.
The user can expect that the personal climate files may be purged on the server from time to time,
but that they will generally be available for at least a week after creation.

Future work
</h3>
We are investigating several methods to allow the user to customize the parameters from a given 
station to more closely match known climate parameters.
