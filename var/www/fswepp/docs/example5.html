<font color=green size=+3>Q</font>

A native surface road is located about 10 m from the sensitive Salmon River in central Idaho.
The buffer gradient is 10 percent, and the road is 4 m wide, insloped with a 4 percent gradient.
The vegetated ditch is stable, and the soil is a sandy loam.
Current cross drain spacing is about 120 m.
The best climate is Riggins, ID.
<p>
What will be the reduction in sediment delivery by graveling a 120-m section of this road?
<p>
<font color=green size=+3>A</font>

If the road has no gravel, the road will likely be rutted, and the cross drain spacing
will be 120&nbsp;m.
Because the ditch is stable, only the road traveled way will be eroding, so the width is 4 m.
The estimated sediment yield is 88 kg of sediment.

If the road is graveled, the flow path is reduced to 10 m, so the road is modeled
 by 10 m cross drain spacings.  The estimated sediment yield
is 0.84 kg from 10 m, or 0.84&nbsp;x&nbsp;120/10&nbsp;=&nbsp;10&nbsp;kg from 120&nbsp;m of road.

<p>
The benefit of adding gravel to this section of road is a reduction in sediment delivery of
(88 - 11)/88=88 percent.
