   <h3 align="center">Disturbed WEPP Rock Content</h3>
We added the rock content feature to Disturbed WEPP because we have
received a number of requests to improve the ability of the interface to
consider rock outcrops.

  <font face="trebuchet, tahoma, arial, sans serif">
Rock fragments in WEPP are considered rocks in the soil. As such, WEPP
assumes that as water moves through soil, it must flow around the
rocks.  Therefore, WEPP reduces the hydraulic conductivity of the soil in
direct proportion to the rock content (i.e. 20 percent rock will reduce
the hydraulic conductivity by 20 percent).  WEPP will not accept a value
for rock content higher than 50 percent, so even when the user puts 100
percent rock into the rock content box, WEPP assumes that it is only 50
percent.  In this context, as rock content increases up to 50 percent,
runoff increases, as does rill erosion.  Above 50 percent, there is no
further impact modeled from increased rock content.

Any surface rocks need to be accounted for in the surface cover.  For
example, if after a fire there is 50 percent surface cover remaining from
vegetation, and 20 percent of the bare soil is covered with rock, the
correct surface cover including vegetation and rock is 60 percent (50
percent vegetation + 20 percent rock * 50 percent bare).  In this context,
as surface cover due to rock increases, the cover should be
increased; both runoff and erosion will be reduced.

Our interface currently does not automatically add rock content to surface
cover, as there are cases where that may be inappropriate.
