Soil Texture</h3>

The erosion potential of a given soil depends on the vegetation cover, the
surface residue cover,
the soil texture, and other soil properies that influence soil strength.

Because research in forest and range conditions is limited and data are
not available to support a detailed database,
only four soil textures (sand, silt, clay, and loam) are listed for
<b><i>Disturbed WEPP.</i></b>

<a href="#table2">Table&nbsp;2</a> can aid in selecting the desired soil texture.  
The specific soil properties associated with each selection can be seen by selecting the
desired soil and vegetation,and clicking the Soil Texture title.  As new information is accumulated,
the values of the soil parameters and new soil options may be added to the database.
<p>
To fully describe each set of soils for WEPP requires 24 soil parameter values.
Further details describing these parameters are available in the WEPP
Technical Documentation (<a href="#Alberts">Alberts and others 1995</a>).

   <a name="rock"></a><h3>Rock fragment</h3>
Rock content provides the ability of the interface to consider rock outcrops.
<p>
Rock fragments in WEPP are considered rocks in the soil. As such, WEPP
assumes that as water moves through soil, it must flow around the
rocks.  Therefore, WEPP reduces the hydraulic conductivity of the soil in
direct proportion to the rock content (i.e. 20 percent rock will reduce
the hydraulic conductivity by 20 percent).  WEPP will not accept a value
for rock content higher than 50 percent, so even when the user puts 100
percent rock into the rock content box, WEPP assumes that it is only 50
percent.  In this context, as rock content increases up to 50 percent,
runoff increases, as does rill erosion.  Above 50 percent, there is no
further impact modeled from increased rock content.
<p>
Any surface rocks need to be accounted for in the surface cover.  For
example, if after a fire there is 50 percent surface cover remaining from
vegetation, and 20 percent of the bare soil is covered with rock, the
correct surface cover including vegetation and rock is 60 percent (50
percent vegetation + 20 percent rock * 50 percent bare).  In this context,
as surface cover due to rock increases, the cover should be
increased; both runoff and erosion will be reduced.  
<p>
Our interface currently does not automatically add rock content to surface
cover, as there are cases where that may be inappropriate.
