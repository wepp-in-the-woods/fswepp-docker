WEPP:Road is an interface to the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) soil erosion 
model that allows users to easily describe numerous road erosion conditions.  

The interface presents the results as a summary and extended WEPP output, and has an 
optional log to store the results from a series of runs.  
WEPP:Road is linked to the Rock:Clime climate generator with a database from more
than 2600 weather stations.

WEPP:Road is one in a series of the U.S.D.A. Forest Service's Internet-based computer 
programs based on the Agricultural Research Service's <a href="https://forest.moscowfsl.wsu.edu/engr/wepp0.html">Water Erosion Prediction Project</a> 
(WEPP) model.  
<p>
WEPP:Road is designed to predict runoff and sediment yield from:
<ul><li>roads
<li>compacted landings
<li>compacted skid trails
<li>compacted foot, cattle, or off-road vehicle trails
</ul>

WEPP:Road allows the user to specify the characteristics of the road in terms of
<ul><li>climate 
<li>soil and gravel addition
<li>local topography
<li>drain spacing
<li>road design and surface condition
<li>ditch condition
</ul>
Roads have been identified as the major source of sediment in most forest watersheds due to surface erosion or mass failure.
Practices to control sedimentation from roads are well known, and have been incorporated into road designs for many years (for example, see <a href="#Packer">Packer and Christensen 1977</a>).
Such guidelines, however, merely provide estimates of percentage of sediment reduction at best, and their applications are limited to the specific soils and climates where they were developed.
There have been numerous cases in recent years in which forest planners have wanted to know the sediment yield from a given length of road, but have had no means to estimate the amount.  
<p>
One of the most common forest road conditions leading to sedimentation of streams is shown in <a href="#fig1">figure&nbsp;1</a>, where a forest road experiences erosion between cross drains.
The runoff from the cross drain is routed over the fill slope and across a buffer area to the stream.

<img src="images/backtotop.gif" border="0"

 onMouseOut="window.status='WEPP:Road documentation'; return true"></a>The WEPP Model</h3>
The WEPP model (<a href="#Flanagan">Flanagan and Livingston 1995</a>) is a physically-based soil erosion model that can provide estimates of soil erosion and sediment yield considering the specific soil, climate, ground cover, and topographic conditions.  
It was developed by an interagency group of scientists including the U.S. Department of Agriculture's 
Agricultural Research Service (ARS), 
Forest Service, and Natural Resources Conservation Service; 
and the U.S. Department of Interior's Bureau of Land Management and 
Geological Survey.  
<p>
WEPP simulates the conditions that impact erosion--such as the amount of vegetation canopy, the surface residue, and the soil water content for every day in a multiple-year run.
For each day that has a precipitation event, WEPP determines whether the event is rain or snow, and calculates the infiltration and runoff.
If there is runoff, WEPP routes the runoff over the surface, calculating erosion or deposition rates for at least 100 points on the hillslope.
It then calculates the average sediment yield from the hillslope.  
<p>
<center>
<table bgcolor="#f0f0f0" border=1 cellpadding=10>
<tr><td>
The WEPP:Road template has three overland flow elements: a road, a fillslope, and a forested buffer.
</table>
</center>
<p>
The WEPP model allows a hillslope to be divided into segments with similar soils and vegetation, called overland flow elements.
For the scenario shown in <a href="#fig1">figure&nbsp;1</a>, WEPP:Road assumes there are three overland flow elements: a road, a fillslope, and a forest.
<p>
WEPP consists of a simulation engine and an interface.
WEPP was released for public use in 1995 with an MS-DOS text-based interface.
Updated versions of the engine were released in 1997, 1998, and 1999.

The MS-DOS interface can be used to run WEPP in a DOS window on most personal computers.
The management file builder, however, can be run only with a personal computer running 
in DOS mode, and will not run in a DOS window.
Elliot and Hall (<a href="#ElliotHall">1997</a>) developed a set of templates for forest road applications 
for the MS-DOS interface.
<p>
There is also available a Windows-based interface for WEPP.
Forest templates are under development for the Windows version.
Both the DOS and Windows interfaces run the same WEPP engine.  The interface and the format of
some of the internal data files are different.
Both interfaces of the WEPP computer program can be retrieved from the USDA ARS National Soil Erosion Research
Laboratory web site at
 (<a href="https://topsoil.nserl.purdue.edu/weppmain/wepp.html">https://topsoil.nserl.purdue.edu/weppmain/wepp.html</a>).

Because WEPP is process-based, it can be applied to any condition where the necessary input data are known.
WEPP is difficult to apply, however, because of the amount of input data required.
To simplify the application of WEPP to forest roads anywhere in the U.S., a custom interface 
was developed for the road/buffer template described by <a href="#fig1">figure&nbsp;1</a>.
Users can select any climate they desire from a climate database.
Soil properties are based on research findings.
The road is assumed to be free of vegetation, the fillslope to be covered with sufficient vegetation to give about 50&nbsp;percent ground cover, and the buffer surface covered with litter from a 20-year old forest, generally 100&nbsp;percent.
Climates with less than 500&nbsp;mm of precipitation may have somewhat less cover, as drought conditions will limit vegetation growth in WEPP.
<p>
<a name="climate"></a>
<h3><a href="#topofpage" target="_top">
<img src="images/backtotop.gif" border="0"
 onMouseOver="window.status='Return to top'; return true"
 onMouseOut="window.status='WEPP:Road documentation'; return true"></a>Climate</h3>
Several climates (currently Birmingham, AL; Flagstaff, AZ; Mount Shasta, CA; 
Denver, CO; Moscow, ID; and Charleston, WV) are listed in the climate list.  
These climates are provided to allow the user to quickly select a regional climate for an 
initial run.  
Most users will prefer to click the
<img src="images/wr-custclim.gif">
button and use the Rock:Clime weather generator to select desired climates from the
2600 sets of climate statistics in the database.  
Users may prefer to select several nearby climates to determine the sensitivity of 
their site to climate effects.  
Up to five sets of custom climate statistics can be selected for the WEPP:Road interface.  
<p>
<center>
<table bgcolor="#f0f0f0" border=1 cellpadding=10>
<tr><td>30 years of simulation is generally adequate
</table>
</center>
<p>
The user must specify the number of years of simulation.  
For climates with more than 500&nbsp;mm of precipitation, 30&nbsp;years of simulation is generally adequate to obtain an estimate of erosion.
For drier climates, 50 or more years of simulation may be necessary to achieve an average value.
In dry climates, there are more years with little or no erosion, so a greater total number of years is necessary to ensure that there have been an adequate number of wet years.
Users may wish to carry out some preliminary runs for some typical local climates to determine how many years of run are necessary for their conditions to ensure a stable average erosion value.
The interface limits the number of years of simulation to 200.


<p>
When the
<img src="images/wr-runwepp.gif">
button is activated, the ARS CLIGEN weather generator, distributed with WEPP,
uses the climate statistics from the selected station to generate a daily weather
sequence for the number of years specified.
The WEPP model reads the generated daily weather to complete the erosion estimates.

The erosion potential of a given soil depends more on the vegetation cover than on the soil texture.
Therefore, only four soil textures (sand, silt, clay, and loam) are listed for WEPP:Road.
<a href="#table1">Table&nbsp;1</a> can aid in selecting the desired soil texture.
<p>
To fully describe each set of soils for WEPP requires 48 soil parameter values.
These values are listed in <a href="#apdx1">appendix 1</a>.
Further details describing these parameters are available in the WEPP Technical Documentation (<a href="#Alberts">Alberts and others 1995</a>).

<img src="images/backtotop.gif" border="0"
 onMouseOver="window.status='Return to top'; return true"
 onMouseOut="window.status='WEPP:Road documentation'; return true"></a>Road Design</h3>
There are four road designs options on the WEPP:Road menu (<a href="#fig2">figure 2</a> and <a href="#table2">table&nbsp;2</a>).

<h4>Insloped, bare ditch</h4>
The simplest road design is the "Insloped, bare ditch" design.
This template assumes that there are no ruts on the road, and that all runoff is diverted to an inside road ditch.
Road surface erosion is due to raindrop splash and shallow overland flow, and the road ditch is experiencing rill erosion from concentrated flow.
The spacing of rills on the road in the WEPP management file is set by the interface at 4&nbsp;m 
and the soil properties are assumed to be those measured by field researchers (<a href="#ElliotFoltzL">Elliot, Foltz and Luce 1995</a>; <a href="#Flerchinger">Flerchinger and Watt 1987</a>).
This design is most applicable to new roads and road systems where ditch cleaning is practiced regularly.
<p>
If the insloped road has wheel ruts which are carrying runoff between cross drains, then
the "outsloped, rutted" design may be more appropriate.

</table>
</center>

<h4>Insloped, vegetated or rocked ditch</h4>
The
"Insloped, vegetated or rocked ditch"
design option uses a critical shear for the road element of 10&nbsp;N&nbsp;m<sup>-2</sup>.
The majority of erosion occurs on the road surface only due to raindrop splash and shallow overland flow.
The main function of the ditch is to transport the sediment eroded from the road surface.
Selecting this option will generally reduce road erosion by 50&nbsp;percent to 90&nbsp;percent.
For example, for established roads in Oregon, Luce and Black (<a href="#Luce">1999</a>) observed that 
road segments with vegetated ditches delivered only 10 to 20&nbsp;percent as much sediment as did
segments with freshly graded ditches.
Rocking or vegetating a ditch is particularly effective in reducing sediment delivery at stream crossings.
It is less effective in reducing delivery across a forested buffer where sediment transport by runoff rather
than detachment dominates the sediment delivery.
<p>
This design best models an older road where the traveled way is devoid of vegetation,
but the ditches are completely covered in vegetation.
It is also suited to conditions where rock or gravel is used to line the ditch to limit erosion.
There may be some deposition of sediment in a vegetated ditch, but research has not been able to 
support this supposition.
Lining a channel with rock has not been effective in causing deposition (<a href="#Grace">Grace 1998</a>).

<b>Figure 2.</b>  <i>Diagram of flow directions for road designs in WEPP:Road program</i>
</center>
<p>

<h4>Outsloped, unrutted</h4>
Two outsloped options are available--with and without ruts.
The "Outsloped, unrutted" design best descibes the road condition immediately following blading.
With traffic, however, wheel tracks soon begin to flatten, and runoff tends to follow wheel tracks--even if 
rutting is barely discernable--from one surface cross drain to the next.
The "Outsloped, rutted" option generally is the most appropriate selection for an outsloped road.
Only in cases where a road is outsloped, and traffic is light or restricted, is the "Outsloped, unrutted"
design appropriate.
This may occur on a road that is closed, but prior to closure is bladed and outsloped. 
<p>
The "Outsloped, unrutted" option assumes that the road has an outslope slope of <font color=red>4&nbsp;percent</font>.
The effective slope of the road is assumed to be the resolution of the road gradient and the outslope slope, calculated as
<p>
<center><img src="images/wr-eqn1.gif"></center>
<p>
The effective length (<a href="#fig2">figure 2</a>) of the flow path over the road surface is:
<p>
<center><img src="images/wr-eqn2.gif"></center>
<p>
In order to maintain the correct total road surface area, an effective width of the element is then calculated as
<p>
<center><img src="images/wr-eqn3.gif"></center>
<p>
These calculations are all carried out by the WEPP:Road interface.  
In order to see the calculated values, users can request the
<img src="images/wr-exout.gif">  
option on the input screen.
The <i>EffectiveLength</i> in meters is the length of the first overland flow element, and the <i>EffectiveWidth</i> is noted with the sediment yield data (<a href="#apdx2">appendix&nbsp;2</a>).

<h4>Outsloped, rutted</h4>
The outsloped, rutted option assumes a rill spacing of 2&nbsp;m, similar to the spacing of the wheel tracks.
The user should enter the width of road contributing flow to the wheel ruts.
If there is a ditch carrying runoff and subject to erosion, then the user should include the width of the ditch as well as the road (<a href="#ex6">Example 6</a>).
<p>
The "Outsloped, rutted" design may be appropriate for an insloped road with 
wheel ruts which are carrying runoff between cross drains.
This option specifies a rill spacing of 2&nbsp;m, whereas the insloped design uses
2&nbsp;m.
This will change the predicted road erosion rates.
The user should enter the width of the road plus the ditch.  

<h4>Crowned</h4>
If the road is crowned with a ditch on either side, the erosion rate can be estimated by selecting
either "insloped" (if there are no ruts) or "Outsloped, rutted" (if ruts are generally present).
The width entered should include the ditches.
If the ditches are vegetated, then the "Insloped, vegetated ditch" option--including the ditch width--or
the rutted option--excluding the ditch--are the most appropriate choices.
<p>
For a crowned road, the user will need to consider both sides of the crown and one or both ditches.
If there is only an uphill ditch, then half of the road width is insloped and half of the road width is outsloped.
The total erosion is the sum of the insloped and outsloped erosion values.
If the road has a ditch on both sides, then the road is effectively made up of two narrow insloped sections, 
and it can be modeled with one of the insloped designs by summing the widths of the traveled way and the
ditches in the width box.

<img src="images/backtotop.gif" border="0"
 onMouseOver="window.status='Return to top'; return true"
 onMouseOut="window.status='WEPP:Road documentation'; return true"></a>Gravel Addition</h3>
One can predict the impacts of adding gravel by selecting 
<img src="images/wr-grav.gif">.
This selection alters the soil file by increasing the rock content and the hydraulic conductivity of the soil (<a href="#apdx1">appendix&nbsp;1</a>).
<p>
The addition of gravel has two major impacts on erosion rate.
Research has shown that gravel alters the hydraulic conductivity of a soil, and it changes the flow path
length of the road (<a href="#FoltzT">Foltz and Truebe 1995</a>).
Generally, the addition of gravel increases the porosity and increases the hydraulic conductivity of the road, 
which decreases the runoff (<a href="#Flerchinger">Flerchinger and Watts 1987</a>).
<p>
The increase in conductivity may not result in a decrease in erosion.
In areas where runoff is due to saturated conditions rather than to rainfall rates exceeding hydraulic
conductivity, runoff may be similar, or even greater, following an increase in road conductivity,
because the road is more likely to be saturated.
<p>
The impacts of gravel on soil properties, however, are not as important in reducing road erosion rates 
as is the impact of gravel on flow path length.
Gravel reduces the formation of ruts (<a href="#FoltzT">Foltz and Truebe 1995</a>).
On a gravel road that is outsloping, or that has a nonerodible ditch, the flow path is generally 10&nbsp;m long.
On roads without gravel where flattening or rutting of wheel tracks is common, the flow path length will be
the spacing between cross drains.
The reduction in flow path length with the addition of gravel is likely the reason for the 80&nbsp;percent
reduction in erosion often credited to the addition of gravel.
<a href="#ex3">Example 3</a> demonstrates how gravel reduces road erosion through alteration of topography.

<img src="images/backtotop.gif" border="0"
 onMouseOver="window.status='Return to top'; return true"
 onMouseOut="window.status='WEPP:Road documentation'; return true"></a>Topography</h3>
The WEPP:Road interface allows users to specify any values for the horizontal lengths, road widths,
and slopes within an acceptable range.
<p>
The topographic limitations for WEPP:Road are shown in <a href="#table3">table&nbsp;3</a>.
All lengths in the WEPP model are horizontal, as would be measured directly from a contour map.
WEPP adjusts the horizontal length internally to determine the true overland length.
If the user has measured overland lengths during a site survey, the horizontal length can
be found by multiplying the overland length by the cosine of the slope angle.
The slope angle is the inverse tangent (arctangent) of the slope in decimal units (see <a href="#ex1">example 1</a>).
<p>
The effect of changes in topography tends to be consistent, so interpolation between values is acceptable.
However, the effect is not linear, so extrapolation beyond predicted values is not recommended.
On roads with no cross drains, flow path lengths along the road surface seldom exceed 
120&nbsp;m unless the road is severely rutted, or the road is insloped with a long inside ditch.

<p>
To estimate the sediment delivery at a stream crossing, the user can assume that all of the road prism
erosion enters the stream.
This method does not include any erosion from the fill slope.
Alternatively, the minimum lengths can be selected for the fillslope and buffer lengths
and the sediment leaving the buffer can be used as an estimate of sediment delivery.
This method may overestimate deposition on the fill or buffer.
<p>
In some situations, runoff over the buffer may be channelized.
WEPP:Road will not predict erosion or deposition in a channel.
It will give only an estimate of the amount of sediment that was delivered to the channel.
Templates using the WEPP watershed version are under development to address this condition.

The road width specification should include the width of the ditch or ditches if they are eroding.
If the road is outsloped and rutted, only that portion of the width of road contributing runoff to the
ruts should be specified.
This generally is the rut spacing plus the distance from the inside rut to the cutslope.

 onMouseOut="window.status='WEPP:Road documentation'; return true"></a>Management (Vegetation Cover)</h3>

The most complex input file in the WEPP model is the management file, which describes the vegetation.
For the WEPP:Road program, the road has no vegetation, the fillslope has sufficient vegetation to provide
about 50&nbsp;percent ground cover, and the forest buffer has a 20-year old forest with 100&nbsp;percent
ground cover.
The values are similar to those described for the PLUME3 template for WEPP in Elliot and Hall (<a href="#ElliotHall">1997</a>).
For other conditions, such as a burned buffer or vegetated road, users will have to run the WEPP model.
<p>
If applied to skid trails or similar temporary trails, WEPP:Road can be run to determine the erosion rate
for the first year.
Generally, following revegetation, erosion rates rapidly decline to near zero within five years.
The WEPP:Road erosion rate can be reduced by 20&nbsp;percent each year for five years following the disturbance
to obtain an estimate of total erosion associated with the skid trail.
<p>
If the buffer is not forested, then the user may need to consider some other tool to predict sediment delivery.
The sediment yield from the road will still be correct.
Further work on the WEPP:Road interface may include alternative vegetation scenarios for the buffer.

The results page can be printed or saved, or the information can be copied and pasted in such other programs as

<h4>Mean Annual Averages</h4>
The WEPP predictions are summarized in a table presenting the mean annual values from the generated weather
sequence for the selected climate (<a href="#fig3">figure&nbsp;3</a>).
<p>
<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> shows that the average annual precipitation for the climate selected was 823&nbsp;mm per year,
from a total of 3434 storms during the 30-year period simulated, which is about 100 storms per year.
The average runoff from the rainfall-only events was less than 0.5&nbsp;mm per storm from 40 events,
and the average runoff from snowmelt, or rain-on-snow, events was 1&nbsp;mm from 140 events.
The average annual amount of sediment leaving the road traveled way or ditch was 18.27&nbsp;kg,
and the average annual amount of sediment leaving the forest buffer and entering a stream system was 4.6&nbsp;kg.
For many conditions, there will be some sediment delivered every year.
For drier climates, the average value may include a number of years when there was little erosion, with only a
few major runoff events during the period of simulation.

<p>
Any predicted runoff or erosion value--by any model--will be, at best, within plus or minus 50&nbsp;percent

Erosion rates are highly variable, and the models predict only a single value.
Replicated research has shown that observed erosion values vary widely for identical plots,

The extra output is added to the bottom of the results screen and can be accessed by scrolling down the page.
An example extended output is shown in <a href="#apdx2">appendix&nbsp;2</a>.

<h4>Size of Eroded Sediments</h4>
Users may wish to estimate the percent of the eroded sediment that is in the sand size class
for environmental impact analysis.
Some scientists say that sand is the size of concern, because it is readily deposited in stream systems,
filling in spawning areas around and under gravel.
Others are more concerned with the silt content as it is more of a problem because it decreases the clarity of
the water and reduces the quality of the aquatic ecosytem on the channel bottom.  
<p>
WEPP predicts the size distribution of eroded sediment by dividing the sediment into sand, silt, and clay
particles; small aggregates made up of organic matter, clay and silt; and large aggregates made up of organic
matter, clay, silt, and sand.
Typically, sand deposits first, and clay and small aggregates deposit last.
At the end of the extended output is a table that shows the distribution of sediment in each of the size
classes in the soil, and in the eroded sediment.
<a href="#ex7">Example 7</a> shows how to calculate the sand content from the table at the end of <a href="#apdx2">appendix&nbsp;2</a>.

The primary application of WEPP:Road is to estimate the runoff and amount of sediment entering a stream
system from a given road segment.
If the user needs to analyze a large road network, it may be more efficient to run the X-DRAIN program 
first to determine which segments are the primary sources of sediment.
These segments can then be analyzed in more detail with WEPP:Road, to obtain more accurate estimates of
sediment yields from problem road segments (examples <a href="#ex2">2</a> and <a href="#ex3">3</a>).
<p>
The second application of this program is to evaluate the impact of road topography on any road
(including skid trails) on sediment delivery.
The necessary input information is collected, and the output table is studied to determine what spacing
will give an acceptable sediment yield (examples <a href="#ex4">4</a> and <a href="#ex5">5</a>).
<p>
Another application is as an aid to identifying sections of road that are the best candidates for closure
or for mitigation measures, making best use of limited funding (<a href="#ex4">example 4</a>).
<p>
A summary of the application of WEPP:Road to various other road designs is given in <a href="#table4">table&nbsp;4</a>.

<p>

These results show that the second segment is not a great source of sediment, but the stream crossings
(segments 3 and 4) are.
The total sediment generated from these four problem segments is about 240&nbsp;kg.
<a href="#ex3">Example 3</a> will consider outsloping and graveling all of these problem segments to see whether sedimentation
can be reduced to an acceptable level.
The addition of gravel will help to ensure that the outslope is not lost to rutting on these sensitive
road segments.  
<a name="ex3">
<h4>Example 3</h4>
What is the impact on the road segments in <a href="#ex2">example 2</a> if the problem segments are graveled and outsloped?
If road segments 3 and 4 are outsloped, then the amount of road with only 1&nbsp;m of buffer is likely to
be reduced to about 15&nbsp;m for each segment.
This assumption requires field or map verification to see whether the road crossed directly over the stream as we have assumed,
or was running parallel to the stream for some distance.  The buffer lengths for the <b>remaining</b> road segments
 will be approximately 50 m for segment 3 and 45 m for segment 4.
<p>
<b>Solution:</b><br>
The "graveled" button is clicked, and the shorter road lengths are specified for segments 3 and 4.
The results are entered into a log file.

<p>
The total sediment from these four segments has been reduced from about 240&nbsp;kg to 35&nbsp;kg,
a soil loss reduction of about 85&nbsp;percent due to gravel.
Reductions of this magnitude have been measured by numerous researchers including Burroughs and King (<a href="#Burroughs">1989</a>)
and Swift (<a href="#Swifta">1984a</a>).
<a name="ex4">
<h4>Example 4</h4>
There are three old logging roads located on a hillside in the Boise National Forest with the same 
climate, soil, and fillslope characteristics as in example 2.
The road traveled way is 4&nbsp;m wide, and may experience some rutting.
The forest wishes to retain the lowest road possible to allow access for recreational fishing and related
wildlife administration.
They wish to put in cross drains only every 120&nbsp;m to allow for ease of maintenance, and to minimize
discomfort to road users.
The gradients of all three roads are 4&nbsp;percent.
The lower road is 10&nbsp;m from the stream with a 10&nbsp;percent buffer slope,
the middle road is 80&nbsp;m from the stream with a 25&nbsp;percent buffer slope,
and the upper road is 200&nbsp;m from the stream with a 60&nbsp;percent buffer slope.
Which road should be retained?
<p>
<b>Solution:</b><br>
For a road with ruts the width will be less than 4&nbsp;m because the part of the road between the
outside rut and the fillslope generally does not contribute to the rut flow.
Therefore, we will assume that the width is 3&nbsp;m.
<p>
Each of the three road segments is analyzed to produce the following results:

<p>
It appears that the middle road will be the best one to keep open.
The upper road, located on a steeper part of the hillside, is delivering more sediment.
Users may wish to run the WEPP model for this template to be able to describe the hillside
in greater detail than the WEPP:Road interface allows.
<a name="ex5">
<h4>Example 5</h4>
A road is in the planning stages near Charleston, WV on a site with silt loam soil.
The hillsides have slopes of about 25&nbsp;percent.
The desired cross drain spacing is 60&nbsp;m.
The fill has a slope of 50&nbsp;percent and is 5&nbsp;m long.
The road width is 4&nbsp;m.
How far should the road be located from the stream to ensure that there is a minimum amount of sediment reaching the stream?  Assume that the road will have a stable ditch.
<p>
<b>Solution:</b><br>
The given values are entered into the WEPP:Road interface, selecting 40&nbsp;m as the length of the buffer.
The
<img src="images/wr-exout.gif">
option is selected.  
<p>
The extended output from this analysis is given in <a href="#apdx2">appendix&nbsp;2</a>.
The third column in section C of the extended output shows the predicted deposition rates for 100 points
along the buffer.
The negative numbers in this element show "negative" erosion, or net deposition in that part of the element.
When the amount of deposition drops to 1&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup> or less, the depth of deposition is less than
1&nbsp;mm.
This is the extent of the sediment plume, although sediment may be carried farther.
In this example, the deposition first reaches zero at 91&nbsp;m, which is 26&nbsp;m from the toe of the fill.
Hence, the minimum buffer length should be at least 26&nbsp;m.
Note that at even 40&nbsp;m, there is still some sediment delivery to this stream.
Greater buffer lengths will likely result in less sediment delivery, but reductions in sediment delivery
will be small at buffer lengths greater than 26&nbsp;m.
<a name="ex6">
<h4>Example 6</h4>
A graveled county road is located near Rhinelander, WI.
It is crowned with a ditch on each side.
The ditches are vegetated.
The soil is loam.
The width of the road including both ditches is 10&nbsp;m.
A segment of the road intersects a sensitive stream.
In the vicinity of the intersection,
the road gradient is 1&nbsp;percent, and
the length of road contributing to the stream is 220&nbsp;m from either side.
How much sediment is entering the stream from both lengths of the road?
<p>
<b>Solution:</b><br>
Select Rhinelander, WI as a custom personal climate.  Because the road intersects the stream, the length of the fill and buffer are set to the minimum allowable value of 0.3&nbsp;m.
The gradient of the fill and buffer are set to be 1 percent--the same as the road.
The "Insloped, vegetated or rocked ditch" design option is selected, and the width is entered as 10&nbsp;m.
<p>
The resulting predicted sediment delivery value is 1130&nbsp;kg of sediment from one side of the stream intersection.
The value is doubled to an average annual value of 2260&nbsp;kg of total sediment delivered from both road
segments to the stream.

The sand fraction makes up <font color=red>60.1</font>&nbsp;percent of size class 4 and <font color=red>100</font>&nbsp;percent of size class 5.  
The total fraction of sand in the delivered sediment is 
    <blockquote><i>60.1% x 0.262 + 100% x 0.116 = 0.273.</i></blockquote>
This value can be compared to <font color=red>0.3</font> as the sand fraction of a silt soil for the road element (<a href="#apdx1">appendix&nbsp;1</a>).
<p>
The predicted annual amount of sediment delivered is 176&nbsp;kg.
The average annual amount of sand delivered is 
    <blockquote><i>176 x 0.273 = 48&nbsp;kg</i>.</blockquote>

There has been no direct validation of the WEPP:Road program, and little data have been
collected on the amount of sediment that enters a stream that was detached from a road 
and transported across a forested buffer.
There have been field observations on erosion rates from road surfaces and road prisms,
and on lengths of sediment plumes.
Some of these observations are presented in <a href="#table5">table&nbsp;5</a>, along with the sediment yields and
sediment plume lengths predicted by the WEPP:Road program.
