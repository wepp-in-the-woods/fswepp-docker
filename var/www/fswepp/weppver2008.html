   <blockquote>
WEPP version 2008.907 contains extensive improvements to the winter hydrology and 
frost/thaw calculations which greatly enhance the ability of the model to 
perform better in colder climates and the Palouse area in the NW U.S., 
through extensive cooperative efforts with Dr. Joan Wu and her staff 
at Washington State University.
<br><br>
It uses much more intense calculations and much finer soil 
layer heat and moisture flow calculations.
<br><br>
The new winter calculations will often result in greater winter runoff 
values (and total runoff), though for many locations changes in predicted 
soil loss are minimal.
<br><br>
There was also a modification for multiple OFE strip 
simulations, in which excessive soil erosion was being calculated below 
grass strips. Ultimately, all multiple OFE model simulations can be 
impacted.

 <hr>
 We are suspending use of WEPP version 2008.907 because a couple of problems have been found in the winter routines.
