<blockquote>

For site management, information is collected as the 
<font color="red">standard logging</font> done
by the server software. These records are
     used to create summary statistics for such analysis as assessing
which pages are of most and least interest, and
     identifying system performance or problem areas.
<p>
     We keep a 
<font color="red">log of each execution of WEPP:Road and Disturbed
WEPP</font>.  
This log records the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the machine
which initiated the run, the date and time of the run, the climate
used, and the number of years run.  We use these logs to assess
the interest in and distribution of use of the FS&nbsp;WEPP software.
Neither the user's name nor his or her e-mail address is recorded
(nor are they available to us).
<p>
     The WEPP:Road <font color="red">user's log</font>
(if the user requests one)
is stored on our server for a period of time.  This log contains
only the information displayed in the log, and is associated with
the user only by the user's computer IP address.  
<p>
Each user may have several <font color="red">personal climates</font>
stored for a period of time on the
server.  
These also are associated with the user only by the user's computer
IP address.
<p>
     We gather from the web site no other information on FS WEPP users
except for the names and addresses optionally supplied by
users in the <font color="red">comment forms</font>.
<p>
The cookies one might encounter on our web were used for two purposes
(one of which is an artifact and will be removed eventually).
The outdated purpose was to record the user's unit system selection.
The other purpose is an attempt to
<a href="id_info.html">distinguish among simultaneous users</a>
running FS&nbsp;WEPP using a remote browser (as one might with a browser
on a Unix machine with multiple X Terminals).
