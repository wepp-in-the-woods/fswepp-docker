 The biggest changes from WEPP version 2000 to 2010 are in the winter routines,
 where generally winter runoff rates are higher, depending on climate, and in
 the lateral flow in the forest buffer, which will have a tendency to increase
 lateral flow on steeper slopes, decreasing surface runoff.
 The net effect of these two major changes varies with climate and topography.
