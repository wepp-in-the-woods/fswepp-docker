   <h2 align="center">WEPP:Road Traffic Level</h2>
    <b>High traffic</b> is generally associated with a timber sale,
    hauling numerous loads of logs over the road,
    or roads that receive considerable traffic during much of the year.
    <b>Low traffic</b> roads are roads with administrative or light
    recreational use during dry weather.
    <b>No traffic</b> roads are roads with restricted or no access,
    and have vegetation growing on more than half of the road surface.
    <p>
    Traffic has three main impacts on roads:
     <ol>
      <li>Generation or exposure of fine, easily detached sediment;
      <li>Prevention of plant growth on road surfaces; and
      <li>Formation of ruts to channelize water on the road surface
     </ol>
     In WEPP:Road, the rill erodibility value is reduced by 75% on roads with
     <b>low</b> or <b>no traffic.</b> 
     On roads with <b>high</b> and <b>low traffic,</b>
     we assume minimal vegetation on the road surface,
     50 percent ground cover from vegetation on the fillslope,
     and 100 percent ground cover in the forest buffer.
     For <b>no traffic,</b> we assume the road has 50% vegetative cover,
     and the fillslope and forest buffer both have 100 percent vegetative
     ground cover.
     Users can model a road with 100 percent vegetation cover by setting the
     road length equal to 1 m (3 ft), and then inputting the remainder of the
     road length and grade in the fill line, and adding the length of fill to
     the length of buffer in the forest buffer line.
     A similar approach can be used for the <b>high</b> and <b>low traffic</b>
     selections when the fillslope has 100 percent cover,
     by minimizing the fill length, and adding the remainder of the fill length
     to the buffer length line.
    <p>
     Generally, roads with higher levels of traffic also receive regular
     maintenance, which may decrease rutting and erosion risk,
     but it can bring fines to the surface and prevent revegetation,
     both of which tend to increase erosion risk. 
    <p>
     High traffic roads generally have ruts or wheel tracks deep enough to
     assume that an outslope design is inappropriate.
     In most cases, a rutted design is the most appropriate for high traffic
     roads.
     Low traffic roads may or may not be rutted, depending on maintenance and
     times of the year when the traffic occurs.
     To minimize sediment generation from low use roads or roads with
     no traffic, the road should be outsloped,
     and traffic restricted during wet seasons.
