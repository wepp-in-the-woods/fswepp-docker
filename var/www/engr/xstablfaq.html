<hr><h3><font color=blue size=+3>Q:</font>
How do I install XSTABL under Windows 95?</h3>
<p>
<font color=blue size=+3>A:</font>
 Although XSTABL is still a DOS program, it can be operated successfully
 within Windows 95.
<p>
If you install XSTABL to <tt>C:\XSTABL</tt> (unzip to <tt>c:\</tt>)
then all should be right with XSTABL.
<p>
   If XSTABL was installed elsewhere, 
   you may have to set the XSTABL working directory to be the one
   in which XSTABL is installed and you may also specify where to find
   the custom XSTABL icon.
<p>
Locate <tt>XSTABL.EXE</tt>
       using Windows Explorer (you may want to turn on "display
       all file types" to show you the ".exe" part so you can find it
       more easily),
<blockquote><img src="find_xst.gif"></blockquote>
 highlight <b>XSTABL.EXE</b>, and right-click on it.  A menu should
       appear on your desktop; select <b>Properties</b> and then
       the <b>Program</b> tab.  For the <b>Working Directory</b>
       enter the name of the drive and directory in which
       XSTABL is installed.

  You may also want to click
       the "change icon" button under program properties,
       and specify file "XSTABL.ICO" in the XSTABL directory.

<h3><font color=blue size=+3>Q:</font>
I can not get XSTABL to print when run under Windows 95. What gives?</h3>
<p>
<font color=blue size=+3>A:</font>
 XSTABL is a DOS program.  In order for DOS programs to print under
 Windows 95, the printer driver must be installed with the <i>Print
 from DOS</i> option specified.  
<p>
 Add a new printer (actually, a new driver for an existing printer)
 under <b>Start-Settings-Printers.</b>

Choose an existing printer on your system or network.
If you have an HP Laserjet, or one that understands HP commands,
use that one.  I haven't yet tried a corporate Lexmark printer.
<p>
Answer <b>yes</b> that you you want to
<b>print from MS-DOS-based programs</b>,
<blockquote><img src="prt_msd.gif"></blockquote>
and specify that you want to <b>capture printer port</b> LPT1.
<blockquote><img src="cap_port.gif"></blockquote>
You should now be able to print XSTABL output on the newly-installed
printer.

<hr><h3><font color=blue size=+3>Q:</font>
How do I select the printer for XSTABL?</h3>
<p>
<font color=blue size=+3>A:</font>
  Good question.    Before you print, you can: <b>Start-Settings-Printers</b>,
  right-click on the DOS printer, check <b>Set as Default</b>.
<blockquote><img src="set_def.gif"></blockquote>

It does not seem to matter to XSTABL which printer you select here, though -- the
one (if any) that has been set to capture printer port <b>LPT1</b> seems
to get used.
<p>

<hr><h3><font color=blue size=+3>Q:</font>
I want to use XSTABL graphs in my documents.  How can I import them?</h3>
<font color=blue size=+3>A:</font>
When the graph is displayed on screen during operation of XSTABL, you
can press <tt>Alt-PrintScrn</tt> to place the graph (the content of the
active Windows window) in the Windows clipboard,
from which you can paste it into many other Windows applications.
<p>
But, this doesn't work as well as one might hope with Microsoft Word
because the background is all black, and I haven't found a satisfactory
way to reverse or change the image colors in Word.
<p>
You can paste the image into a graphics application such as WinJPEG or
Windows Paint.
<ul><li>In WinJPEG, choose <tt>negative</tt> colors from the menu bar
(exact location may vary with WinJPEG version).
    <li>In Windows Paint, convert the image to black-and-white (under "attributes"),
then invert colors.
</ul>
<p>
A more satisfactory method may be to have XSTABL 
save the graphic as a <tt>.WP?</tt> file, then open a Word document and
<b>Insert Picture</b> into the document.
That works pretty nicely.
You have to specify that the file is a <b>Word Perfect</b> format, 
and the Word Perfect import filter has to be loaded into
Office the first time you try to insert such a picture.
But it is slick and resizeable, and you can write your report around the plot.
