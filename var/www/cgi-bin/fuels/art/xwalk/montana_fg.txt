Subseries represented in this Fischer and Bradley (1987) fire group fall within one fire regime of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Fischer and Bradley (1987):</b>  Fuel loads tend to be light, and the most abundant surface fuel is cured grass.
 Downed woody fuels in mature, open-grown ponderosa pine stands consist of scattered, large trees and concentrations of needles, twigs, branch wood, bark flakes, and cones.
 Fuel loads in these stands may be less than 1 ton/acre; however, fuel loads in dense pole and saw-timber stands may be much higher.
 The natural role of fire in this group is to maintain grasslands, maintain open ponderosa pine stands and encourage ponderosa pine regeneration.
 In productive sites, the absence of fire has resulted in overstocking and increased fuels.
 During severe fire danger, wind-driven fires may spread through the sparse dry fuels.
 In the absence of fire, stands may become overstocked and accumulate enough fuel to support a severe stand destroying fire.

Subseries represented in this Fischer and Bradley (1987) fire group fall within one fire regime of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Fischer and Bradley (1987):</b>  The average fuel load is approximately 11 tons/acre.
 Dense thickets of Douglas-fir regeneration may become established during fire-free periods.
 Overstories become susceptible to stand-destroying crown fire when such situations develop.
 A grass/forb community with shrubs and conifer seedlings becomes established following a severe stand-destroying fire.
 In the absence of fire, the herb/shrub stage gives way to conifer seedlings, and hazardous fuel situations often develop.
 A light to moderate severity fire tends to thin out Douglas-fir saplings and badly suppressed ponderosa pine saplings.
 Naturally occurring fire will maintain grasslands, open stands of Douglas-fir or seral ponderosa pine and prepare seedbeds.

<b>Fire Group Five:</b> Cool, dry Douglas-fir habitat types

Habitat types in this fire group are listed below, assigned to subseries of McDonald and others (2000).

Subseries represented in this Fisher and Bradley (1987) fire group fall within one fire regime of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Fischer and Bradley (1987):</b>  Downed dead fuel loads average about 10 tons/acre.
 Because undergrowth and regeneration are sparse and stands are usually open, the probability of crown fires is low.
 However, if sufficient ground fuels are available, torching can occur.
 Fire\'s role in seedbed preparation is confounded by the difficulty of regeneration to progress beyond the seedling stage on these droughty sites because of undergrowth and overstory competition.
 Frequent fire could maintain sites as grassland.
 A fire in the herb/shrub stage will prepare a seedbed.
 A light surface fire in a pole-size stand usually thins out the susceptible stems.
 However, a severe fire in a pole-size stand is likely to kill all trees and revert the site to the herb/shrub stage.
 A severe fire in a climax or near climax stand would either destroy the stand and revert the site to the herb/shrub state or thin the overstory and leave an open parklike stand.

Subseries represented in this Fischer and Bradley (1987) fire group fall within two fire regimes of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Fischer and Bradley (1987):</b>  Downed, dead fuel loads average about 12 tons/acre, but can be much heavier.
 The most hazardous fire conditions occur in well-stocked stands with dense Douglas-fir understories. These stands have large amounts of downed twigs and small stems and branch wood less than 3 in. in diameter beneath partially fallen and standing dead saplings and small pole-sized stems.
 The density of overstory trees and the presence of dead branches near ground level create a crown fire potential under severe burning conditions.
 Gradual accumulation of downed dead fuel greater than 3 in. in diameter increases the damage potential of surface fires.
 Fire can be used to favor ponderosa pine and western larch at the expense of Douglas-fir.
 A relatively light surface fire can be used to remove Douglas-fir understories, thereby reducing the competition for moisture and nutrients.

<b>Incidental Habitat Types:</b>  ABLA/VACA-VACA, ABLA/LIBO-VASC

Subseries represented in this Fischer and Bradley (1987) fire group fall within three regimes of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Fischer and Bradley (1987):</b>  This group has an average downed woody loading of approximately 18 tons/acre.
 Fuel loads are characterized by relatively large amounts of material 3 in. or greater in diameter.
 On sites below about 7,500 feet, the role of fire in seral lodgepole pine is to perpetuate or renew lodgepole pine.
 Without periodic disturbance, the shade-tolerant species replace lodgepole pine because lodgepole pine does not regenerate well on duff or under shaded conditions.
 Fire interrupts the course of succession and increases the proportion of lodgepole pine with each burn.
 Opportunities for fire use are limited in natural stands because of the low fire resistance of lodgepole pine, spruce, and subalpine fir.
 Prescribed fire has been suggested as a management tool for controlling dwarf mistletoe, but its primary use is for hazard reduction and site preparation in conjunction with tree harvesting and regeneration.

<b>Incidental Habitat Types:</b>  TSME/XETE

Subseries represented in this Fischer and Bradley (1987) fire group fall within one fire regime of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Fischer and Bradley (1987):</b>  Downed dead woody fuel loadings average about 18 tons/acre, but maximum loads may exceed this value.
 Stands are characterized by relatively large amounts of downed woody fuel of all size classes, but especially large amounts of material greater than 3 in. in diameter.
 Dense understories develop in many stands and provide fuel ladders to the overstory tree crowns.
  Deep duff layers may form, and fire in the duff can cause considerable mortality by heating the shallow roots of subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce.
 Fire protection is an important management consideration during severe burning conditions.
 Fire can be use to dispose of logging slash on harvest areas, but broadcast burning for site preparation is often hampered by high duff moisture and scarcity of acceptable burning days during traditional fall prescribed burning periods.

<b>Incidental Habitat Types:</b>  TSME/MEFE

Subseries represented in this Fischer and Bradley (1987) fire group fall within two fire regimes of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Fischer and Bradley (1987):</b> Downed dead woody material averages about 25 tons/acre, a large percentage of which is greater than 3 in. in diameter.
 The combination of deep duff and large amounts of dead rotten fuel can result in severe surface fire during unusually dry moisture conditions.
 Where dense understories exist, fires can spread to the crowns and destroy the stand.
 Under normal moisture conditions, a lush undergrowth of shrubs and herbs serves as a barrier to rapid fire spread.
 A stand-destroying fire in the climax or near-climax stage results in an herb/shrub stage.
 A moderate or severe fire could remove much of the Douglas-fir, leaving the site to be regenerated by either serotinous lodgepole pine or remnant larch.
 Broadcast burning is an effective method for reducing slash hazards and for preparing seedbeds in clearcuts and in larch/Douglas-fir shelterwoods.

Subseries represented in this Fischer and Bradley (1987) fire group fall within one fire regime of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Fischer and Bradley (1987):</b>  This fire group has sparse fine fuels and moderate to heavy loadings of widely scattered large-diameter fuels.
 The average downed woody loading is about 18 tons/acre.
 Overall fire potential is mitigated by the normally cool, moist sites, short fire season and sparse and discontinuous fine surface fuels.
 Lightning does ignite fires, but the lack of continuous fine surface fuels coupled with the rain that usually accompanies thunderstorms limits fire spread and severity.
 Stand destroying fires are most likely to occur during extended drought conditions when severe wind-driven crown fires develop in the forests below and burn into the upper subalpine and timberline forests.
 Due to the wilderness location of many whitebark pine stands, fire may be the major practical means of regenerating this species.

Subseries represented in this Fischer and Bradley (1987) fire group fall within four fire regimes of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Fischer and Bradley (1987):</b>  Fuel loadings average 25 tons/acre which exceeds that of any other fire group in western Montana.
 Because of the often heavy grand fir and cedar component, a heavy load of twigs and small branch wood is included in the fuel load.
 Despite the heavy fuel loadings, fire hazard is low to moderate under normal weather conditions.
 The potential for serious conflagrations is usually mitigated by the high humidity of these moist sites.
 Moist weather conditions predominate, but the region is occasionally subject to severe summer drought.
 Heavy fuel loadings exist in most stands, and, when combined with drought conditions, set the stage for severe, widespread fires.
 Stands are then replaced and sites revert to pioneer species.
 The use of fire for site preparation will usually result in increased spring and summer browse for big game in addition to successful regeneration of seral tree species.
