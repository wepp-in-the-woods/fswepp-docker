Subseries represented in this Smith and Fischer (1997) fire group fall within two fire regimes of McDonald and others (2000).


<b>Summary of Smith and Fischer (1997):</b>  This fire group consists of the warmest, driest forest habitat types in northern Idaho, and fuel loads are generally the lightest.
 The amount of woody fuel less than 3 in. in diameter averages &lt; 1 ton/acre and rarely exceeds 5 tons/acre.
 Lightning produces relatively frequent ignitions in this fire group.
 Fire can be used to enhance forage, maintain grassland or open forest, reduce fuels and enhance tree regeneration.
 Many sites are grazed by livestock during the summer and used by elk and mule deer in the winter.
 Grazing decreases fine fuels and increases tree regeneration.
Underburning, often in combination with partial cutting, can be used to maintain vigorous, open ponderosa pine stands.
 Broadcast burning after harvesting can recycle nutrients and control the severe competition for moisture.
 Severe fire reduces soil and nutrient reserves and impedes tree regeneration.

<b>Incidental Habitat Types:</b>  PSME/CAGE, PSME/VAGL

Subseries represented in this Smith and Fischer (1997) fire group fall within three fire regimes of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Smith and Fischer (1997):</b>
 This fire group consists of warm habitat types in the Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine and grand fir series that can support a dense layer of tall shrubs or a dense sward of
 <i>Carex geyeri</i> or <i>Calamagrostis rubescens</i>.
 Relatively deep duff, containing considerable rotting wood, develops during succession.
 On sites recently underburned, fine fuels consist mainly of litter and light duff.
 As time since fire increases, a dense growth of tall shrubs develops which can slow fire spread under moderately moist conditions.
 Where seral tree species dominate the canopy, underburning can be used to decrease fuels, maintain open stand structure, enhance tree growth, and reduce the proportion of Douglas-fir in the understory.
 Fire can be used to enhance tree regeneration because it removes duff and reduces competition from grassy species for 1 to 2 years.

<b>Fire Group Three:</b>  Habitats and community types dominated by persistent lodgepole pine

Habitat types in this fire group are listed below, assigned to subseries of McDonald and others (2000):

<table border=1 cellpadding=2>

 <tr><th>CoolP/DH</th><td>  PICO/VACA, PICO/VASC, PICO/XETE</td></tr>

<b>Incidental Habitat Types:</b>  ABLA/VACA, ABLA/VASC

Subseries represented in this Smith and Fischer (1997) fire group fall within one fire regime of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Smith and Fischer (1997):</b>
 Fire group three stands have relatively low productivity, which is often reflected in light fuel loadings  Fuels are discontinuous, both horizontally and vertically.
 Litter and duff are shallow; downed woody fuel loadings depend on the quantity of small branches from self-pruning, level of dwarf mistletoe infestation, and extent of overstory mortality.
 Effects of fire exclusion are subtle and slow to develop, but probably include increased infestation by dwarf mistletoe and increased incidence of mountain pine beetle irruption.
 Most stands in this group are small and isolated, so they are likely to be strongly affected by changes in the fire regime in neighboring stands.

<b>Incidental Habitat Types:</b>  ABLA/CARU, ABLA/VAGL

Subseries represented in this Smith and Fischer (1997) fire group fall within two fire regimes of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Smith and Fischer (1997):</b>  Fuel loadings and continuity vary depending on species composition, fire history, natural thinning, snow breakage and levels of dwarf mistletoe and mountain pine beetle.
 Dead and downed woody fuels are often dominated by the large size classes.
 Spruce and subalpine fir regeneration enhance fuel continuity, increasing the potential for rapid fire spread, torching and crowning.
 Dwarf mistletoe and lichen-draped trees also increase the potential for vertical fire spread.
 Heavy dead and downed woody fuels, increase the potential for severe fire.
 Where duff and woody fuels are heavy, smoldering persists for a long time after ignition, increasing the probability of fire spread.

<b>Incidental Habitat Types:</b>  ABLA/CACA-CACA

Subseries represented in this Smith and Fisher (1997) fire group fall within two fire regimes of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Smith and Fischer (1997):</b>  During most summers, moist stands support a lush understory that impedes fire spread.
 Stands are more susceptible to damage from fires that sweep in from adjoining areas than from fires starting within the stands.
 Fire intensity is limited in most years by fuel conditions.
 Duff is often deep, fuel loads may be heavy, and live fuels are often vertically continuous.
 However, fuels dry very slowly.
 Ignitions usually burn very small areas or burn large areas in a patch pattern.
 With sustained drying, the potential for severe fire increases.
 Moist subalpine stands can act as firebreaks during moderate weather, but not during severe fire weather.
 Where duff is deep, fire can smolder for long periods, increasing the potential for numerous fires to break out when burning conditions become severe.

<b>Fire Group Six:</b>  Upper subalpine habitat types

<b>Incidental Habitat Types:</b>  TSME/LUHI
<b>Incidental Community Types:</b>  LALY-ABLA, PIAL-ABLA

Subseries represented in this Fischer and Clayton (1997) fire group fall within one fire regime of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Smith and Fischer (1997):</b>  Stands are characterized by relatively sparse fine fuels and moderate to heavy loadings of widely scattered, large-diameter fuels.
 Potential for severe fire from heavy fuels is mitigated by normally cool locations, short fire season, and sparse and discontinuous fine fuels.
 Fires are of low or mixed severity except where canopy cover is dense and fuels are heavy.
 Extensive fire spread may be most likely in early succession, when herbaceous cover provides sufficient fine fuels, and late succession when downed woody fuels increase and shade-tolerant species provide fuel ladders.

<b>Fire Group Seven:</b>  Moderate and moist grand fir habitat types

<b>Incidental Habitat Types:</b>  ABGR/VAGL

Subseries represented in this Smith and Fischer (1997) fire group fall within three regimes of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Smith and Fischer (1997):</b>  Stands in this group tend to produce heavy fuels.
 Large, severe fires can occur during droughts, killing most trees in mature stands.
 Even moist sites are vulnerable because they are usually small or narrow.
 Stands with openings and those with ample moisture support dense herbs and shrubs which impede drying.
 The closed canopy of mature forests keeps fuels moist, but dense structure and ladder fuels can enhance fire spread during drought.
 Severe, stand-replacing fires do not consume all of the duff and woody fuels.
 Fuels in a stand opened by fire dry more quickly and may be subject to severe reburns.
 Changes caused by fire exclusion from moderate stands have been exacerbated by the decline of western whitepine as an important seral species.

<b>Fire Group Eight:</b>  Moderate and moist western hemlock and western redcedar habitat types

Habitat types in this fire group are listed below, assigned to subseries of McDonald and others (2000):

 <tr><th>CH/WF</th><td>  TSHE/GYDR</td></tr>
</table>

Subseries represented in this Smith and Fischer (1997) fire group fall within two fire regimes of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Smith and Fischer (1997):</b>  Despite heavy fuels, fire hazard remains low to moderate during most summers.
 In old growth and where low-severity fires have occurred, tree crowns are high and ladder fuels sparse.
 Taxus brevifolia may form a dense shrub layer or an understory tree layer that is slow to burn.
 Under very dry conditions, duff and woody fuels become dry and herbaceous material cures.
 Surface and ground fires may smolder for months, and severe fire behavior becomes possible.
 Fuels in a stand opened by fire or other disturbance dry more quickly in subsequent years, so these stands may be subject to reburns with severe fire behavior.
 Management-ignited fire is used to enhance wildlife habitat, reduce fuel loadings, and favor seral tree species.

Subseries represented in this Smith and Fischer (1997) fire group fall within three fire regimes of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Smith and Fischer (1997):</b>  Group nine sites are famous for their large trees and lush undergrowth.
 Duff is usually continuous and deep.
 Woody fuels may be light or heavy depending on site history, stand structure and moisture conditions.
 During moist and moderate summers, the likelihood of extensive fires is low; very moist cedar groves may serve as firebreaks.
 Deep, moist undergrowth accounts for low flammability of surface fuels and duff.
 During drought years, stands occasionally support low and mixed severity fire.
