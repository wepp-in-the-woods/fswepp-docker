<b>Summary of Crane and Fischer (1986):</b>
 Productivity of trees and undergrowth is low.
 Fuels are sparse and scattered, and limit fire spread.
 Sparse fuels make fire return less frequent than in slightly moister habitat types.
 Fuels management is usually unnecessary.
 Stands often serve as natural fuel breaks under most fire conditions, except on steep, wind-swept slopes and ridges.
 Under conditions poor for regeneration, fire converts some sites into grassland.

Subseries represented in this Crane and Fischer (1986) fire group 1 fall within one fire regime(s) of McDonald and others (2000).
 Fire regime(s) and expected fire return intervals for subseries are as follows:

Fire regime for Subseries DF/DG is the: "Low" fire regime type, which under natural conditions may have an underburn interval of 5-20 years, and rare mixed severity and stand replacement fires.

<b>Summary of Crane and Fischer (1986) Fire Group 2:</b>
 Downed fuels are often light, most in diameter class of &gt; 3 in.
 Fuels are from dead branches and witches brooms from disease (especially mistletoe), mortality from competition, insects, snow damage, and logging slash (fire hazard remains higher for 3-5 years after logging).
 Fire was historically frequent, maintaining open multiclass structure except after rare stand-replacement fires.
 Stand replacement is more frequent in mistletoe or insect-infested stands.
 Prescribed burns can reduce fuels; to prevent
 damage to stand with high fuel loads, an initial low-intensity burn may be followed by a high intensity burn.

Subseries represented in this Crane and Fischer (1986) fire group 2 fall within  one fire regime(s) of McDonald and others (2000).
 Fire regime(s) and expected fire return intervals for subseries are as follows:

Fire regime for Subseries PP/DG, PP/DS, DF/DG and DF/DS is the:
"Low" fire regime type, which under natural conditions may have an underburn interval of 5-20 years, and rare mixed severity and stand replacement fires.

<b>Incidental Habitat Types:</b> PIPO/PHMA, PSME/PHMA-CARU

<b>Summary of Crane and Fischer (1986) Fire Group 3:</b> Fuels can be heavy.
 Fire exclusion can cause dense canopies, hazardous fuels, and severe fires.
 Moderate severity fire favors ponderosa pine; stand replacement fire may produce pine, Douglas-fir, or mixed stands.

 Light to moderate intensity burns can thin stands and favor ponderosa pine by eliminating young Douglas-fir as well as many older Douglas-fir compromised by root disease.
 Use of fire on some sites may favor development of pinegrass sod, which inhibits future conifer regeneration.
  Excessive thinning may also promote dense snowbrush Ceanothus undergrowth at some sites.

Subseries represented in this Crane and Fischer (1986) fire group 3 fall within two fire regime(s) of McDonald and others (2000).
 Fire regime(s) and expected fire return intervals for subseries are as follows:

Fire regime for Subseries PP/DS and DF/DS is the:
"Low" fire regime type, which under natural conditions may have an underburn fire return interval of 5-20 years, and rare mixed severity and stand replacement fires.

Fire regime for Subseries DF/DH is the:
"Moderate" fire regime type, which under natural conditions may have an underburn fire return interval of 25-75 years, mixed severity fire return interval of 25-75 years, and stand replacement fire return interval of 150-300 years.

<b>Incidental Habitat Types:</b> PSME/CELE

<b>Summary of Crane and Fischer (1986) Fire Group 4:</b>
 Downed fuel loads are relatively light, and fire hazard is usually low.
 Dwarf mistletoe in a stand increases fire hazard.
 Douglas-fir is dominant in all successional stages, except in spruce habitat types in which Engelmann spruce persists after Douglas-fir and limber pine.
 Only low-intensity prescribed burns should be used, to eliminate fine fuels while leaving large debris/logs that can shelter seedlings.

Subseries represented in this Crane and Fischer (1986) fire group fall 4 within one fire regime(s) of McDonald and others (2000).
 Fire regime(s) and expected fire return intervals for subseries are as follows:

Fire regime for Subseries DF/DS, DF/DG and COLDF/DG is the:

<b>Summary of Crane and Fischer (1986) Fire Group 5:</b>
 Fuel loads can be light to heavy, depending on the density of Douglas-fir understory, and are primarily of twigs and branches of diameter &lt; 3 in.
 Douglas-fir can be seral in all habitat types, but lodgepole and ponderosa pine are also present as serals at cooler and lower sites, respectively.
 Mistletoe in Douglas-fir increases fire hazard.
 Ladder fuels are much less prevalent in lodgepole pine-dominated stands.

Subseries represented in this Crane and Fischer (1986) fire group 5 fall within two fire regime(s) of McDonald and others (2000).
 Fire regime(s) and expected fire return intervals for subseries are as follows:

<b>Summary of Crane and Fischer (1986) Fire Group 6:</b>
 Downed fuels are highest in habitat types and associated subseries along moist streams and lowest in dry uplands.
 Understory fir and pine are significant live ladder fuels.
 Seral species include ponderosa and lodgepole pine, Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, western larch, and aspen.
 Fir-dominated understories could be removed by low-temperature underburn during mild conditions, depending on ladder fuels.
 Unproductive, diseased stands may benefit from stand replacement fire or clearcutting with broadcast burning to provide a seedbed favoring seral species.

Subseries represented in this Crane and Fischer (1986) fire group 6 fall within two fire regime(s) of McDonald and others (2000).
 Fire regime(s) and expected fire return intervals for subseries are as follows:

Fire regime for Subseries COOLF/DS and COOLF/DH is the:

<b>Summary of Crane and Fischer (1986) Fire Group 7:</b>
 Fuels are highest in young and overmature lodgepole stands and lodgepole stands with mistletoe, recent fire, or mountain pine beetle attack.
 Thinning of lodgepole pine by beetle attack can allow multiaged stands to develop, with an understory of lodgepole pine in habitat types where it is climax, Douglas-fir at lower elevations, and Engelmann spruce or subalpine fir at higher elevations.
 Fire of all severities favors lodgepole pine regeneration, however prescribed fire may be difficult to use, due to the tradeoff between conditions that allow spread, versus the susceptibility of lodgepole pine to damage.

Subseries represented in this Crane and Fischer (1986) fire group 7 fall within four fire regime(s) of McDonald and others (2000).
 Fire regime(s) and expected fire return intervals for subseries are as follows:

Fire regime for Subseries COOLP/DS is the:
"Low" fire regime type, which under natural conditions may have an underburn fire return interval of 5-20 years, and rare mixed severity and stand replacement fires.

Fire regime for Subseries COLDF/DS is the:
"Moderate" fire regime type, which under natural conditions may have an underburn fire return interval of 25-75 years, mixed severity fire return interval of 25-75 years, and stand replacement fire return interval of 150-300 years.

Fire regime for Subseries COLDF/DH is the:
"Mixed" fire regime type, which under natural conditions may have few underburns, mixed severity fire return interval of 50-100 years, and stand replacement fire return interval of 150-300 years.

Fire regime for Subseries COLDF/WH is the:
"High" fire regime type, which under natural conditions may rarely have underburns, mixed severity fire return interval of 100+ years, and stand replacement fire return interval of 300-400 years.

<b>Summary of Crane and Fischer (1986) Fire Group 8:</b> Fuel loads in this variable fire group can be very high, and contain a high proportion of large diameter fuels.
 Living and dead standing firs and lichen-covered dead branches act as ladder fuels.
 Underburns can eliminate fire-promoting fir, but under dry conditions, roots of all species may be damaged by fire as it consumes the typically deep duff layer.
 Moderate to low severity fire should spare large, thick barked Douglas-fir and eliminate lodgepole pine, but severe fire can promote lodgepole regeneration.
 A few stands may progress to late successional grand fir stands.

Subseries represented in this Crane and Fischer (1986) fire group 8 fall within three fire regime(s) of McDonald and others (2000).
 Fire regime(s) and expected fire return intervals for subseries are as follows:

Fire regime for Subseries COLDF/DG is the:

<b>Summary of Crane and Fischer (1986) Fire Group 9:</b>
 Fuel loads in this fire group can be very high, and contain a high proportion of large diameter fuels.
 Since these habitat types are normally very moist, moist duff layers and lush undergrowth limit damage and spread of surface fire under normal conditions.
 Surface fire can be severe under unusually dry conditions.
 Crowning fire most often sweeps in from adjacent areas.
 Cool to moderate severity fire during pole stage may favor Douglas-fir and larch.
 Fuels may be burned in small piles; broadcast burning may be ineffective under normal moisture conditions, and burning of large piles can degrade soil conditions and lower future forest productivity.

Subseries represented in this Crane and Fischer (1986) fire group 9 fall within two fire regime(s) of McDonald and others (2000).
 Fire regime(s) and expected fire return intervals for subseries are as follows:

Fire regime for Subseries COLDF/DH and COLDF/MH is the:
"Mixed" fire regime type, which under natural conditions may have few underburns, mixed severity fire return interval of 50-100 years, and stand replacement fire return interval of 150-300 years.

<b>Summary of Crane and Fischer (1986) Fire Group 10:</b> Fuels are generally discontinuous, range widely in amount, and contain few fine fuels.
 Fuels are largely due to scattered downfalls and breakage, from meteorological damage and insect and disease mortality.
 Scattered, low-density stands may have ignition from lightning.
 For more continuous stands, stand-destroying fires may result from spread from lower elevations.
 Fire is a natural component necessary for seedling establishment of whitebark pine, a pioneer and keystone species at timberline whose numbers have been greatly reduced by white pine blister rust.

Subseries represented in this Crane and Fischer (1986) fire group 10 fall within three fire regime(s) of McDonald and others (2000).
