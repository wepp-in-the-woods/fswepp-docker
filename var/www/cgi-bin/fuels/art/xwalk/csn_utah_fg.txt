<b>Fire Group One:</b>  Pinyon-juniper woodlands

Habitat types for juniper or pinyon climax sites have not been identified for Utah.
 This fire group consists of all stands dominated by pinyon, juniper or both at climax.

<b>Summary of Bradley, Noste, and Fischer (1992):</b>  Fine surface fuels in many open pinyon-juniper stands range from 600 to 1000 lbs./acre of fine surface fuels. Pinyon-juniper stands most likely to burn by wildfire have small scattered trees with abundant herbaceous fuel between the trees, or have dense, mature trees capable of carrying crown fire during dry, windy conditions.
 Pinyon pine burns more readily than juniper.
 Sites with good growth of cheatgreass are at higher risk for large fires.
 Sparse ground fuels make burning into closed stands of pinyon and juniper relatively safe.
 Burning at intervals of 30 years or less can prevent tree invasion into neighboring shrubland.

<b>Fire Group Two:</b>  Montane maple-oak woodland

Habitat type classifications are not available for these sites.

<b>Summary of Bradley, Noste, and Fischer (1992):</b>  This fire group is made up of montane communities where Gambel oak or bigtooth maple is considered the climax or long-term seral dominant or codominant species.
 Specific fuel-loading information for this fire group is scant.
 Generally, the oak zone is not considered highly combustible.
 It is sometimes treated as a "green belt" among other more flammable types.
 However, a potentially dangerous situation occurs when a late spring freeze kills the spouting oak leaves, which remain as dried tinder during the summer or early fall.
 Where conifers are accidental or are encroaching, flammability of the stand will increase because of their resinous foliage and persistent litter.
 Dense understory oak increases fire risk to ponderosa pine.
 Oak can serve as a ladder fuel that carries fire to overstory tree crowns during both prescribed and wild fires.
 Gambel oak is known to be a vigorous resprouter after fire.
 Fire temporarily reduces cover and height of oak clones but increases stem density.

<b>Fire Group Three:</b>  Ponderosa pine habitat types

Habitat types in this fire group are listed below, assigned to subseries of McDonald and others (2000):
<table border=1 cellpadding=2>
 <tr><th>PP/DG</th><td> PIPO/ARPA, PIPO/ARNO, PIPO/CELE, PIPO/FEID-FEID, PIPO/MUMO, PIPO/PUTR
 <tr><th>PP/DS</th><td>  PIPO/CAGE, PIPO/FEID-ARPA, PIPO/FEID-ARTR, PIPO/QUGA-SYOR, PIPO/QUGA-QUGA, PIPO/SYOR
</table>
Subseries represented in this Bradley, Noste, and Fischer (1992) fire group fall within one fire regime of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Bradley, Noste, and Fischer (1992):</b>  Average fuel loadings for Utah ponderosa pine habitat types are not available. Many decades of fire exclusion have altered the fire regime in most stands.
 Without fire, unnatural accumulations of litter and downed woody fuels and overstocking have become more common.
 Stands with heavy dead or live fuel loads are susceptible to severe fire.
 High flammability results from the typically abundant annual needle-fall of ponderosa pine.
 Without periodic low-intensity ground fire, litter and woody fuels build up to levels that promote high burning intensities.
 Fire creates good seedbed conditions for pine, but it also stimulates oak resprouting.
 Partial burning of forest floor fuels helps retain site productivity in ponderosa pine stands.
 Mistletoe infected trees develop witches\' brooms whose dense branching and tendency to catch dead needles provide a source of easily ignited fuel.
 Prescribed fire can appreciably reduce understory and surface fuels.

<b>Fire Group Four:</b>  Drier Douglas-fir habitat types

Habitat types in this fire group are listed below, assigned to subseries of McDonald and others (2000).

</table>
Subseries represented in this Bradley, Noste, and Fischer (1992) fire group fall within one fire regime of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Bradley, Noste, and Fischer (1992):</b>  Ground fuels are discontinuous with deep needle mats possible in stands dominated by ponderosa pin.
 Open ponderosa pine stands have a dry, warm ground surface microclimate conducive to fire ignitions.
 Dense shrub understories in some types may be significant live fuel during dry, windy weather.
 On the other hand, the typically sparse herbaceous layer is not likely to carry fire.
 The presence of witches\' brooms increases crown flammability.
 The role of fire is to open stands, promote the establishment and dominance of seral ponderosa pine and prepare seedbeds for Douglas-fir and pine.
 Fire may be used to reduce the susceptibility of Douglas-fir stands to western spruce budworm.

<b>Fire Group Five:</b>  Cool or moist Douglas-fir habitat types

Habitat types in this fire group are listed below, assigned to subseries of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Incidental Habitat Types:</b>  PSME/BERE-SYOR, PSME/CARU, PSME/OSCH-PAMY, PSME/PHMA-PAMY

Subseries represented in this Bradley, Noste, and Fisher (1992) fire group fall within one fire regime of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Bradley, Noste, and Fischer (1992):</b>  Downed fuel loads average 13 tons/acre or heavier.
 Closed stands with dense Douglas-fir understories present the highest fire hazard.
 Downed as well as standing dead trees resulting from dwarf mistletoe mortality and associated witches\' brooms may add greatly to fuel loads and corresponding fire hazard.
 Fuel conditions in stands dominated by either lodgepole pine or aspen are less hazardous than in those dominated by Douglas-fir.
 Fire may serve as a means of thinning otherwise inaccessible stands and can be used to sanitize postlogging stands by removing residual trees infested with dwarf mistletoe.
 Where aspen is a seral species, fire can stimulate suckering and rejuvenate stands.

<b>Fire Group Six:</b>  White fir and blue spruce habitat types (mixed conifer types)

Habitat types in this fire group are listed below, assigned to subseries of McDonald and others (2000).

</table>
Subseries represented in this Bradley, Noste, and Fischer (1992) fire group fall within two fire regimes of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Bradley, Noste, and Fischer (1992):</b>  Summarized fuel loading information for Utah white fir and blue spruce habitat types is not available.
 Low or moderate fires thin stands and top-kill the resprouting species.
 White fir and blue spruce are the least fire-resistant conifers present and are probably eliminated by all but the coolest fires.
 Fire serves to prevent white fir or blue spruce from dominating because of their fire tolerance.
 The fire frequency and longevity of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir assure that stands retain a more diverse species composition under a natural fire regime.
 Severe fires cause the site to revert to an herbaceous condition and encourage aspen, oak or maple resprouting where viable roots or rhizomes are present.
 Frequent low-severity fires and less frequent moderate fires maintain open stands of ponderosa pine or Douglas-fir and provide favorable microsites for the establishment of other seral species.

<b>Fire Group Seven:</b>  Aspen dominated habitat types and community types

<b>Incidental Community Types:</b>  POTR/AMAL/PTAQ, POTR/AMAL/TALL FORB, POTR/AMAL/THFE, POTR/AMAL-SYOR/CARU, POTR/AMAL-SYOR/TALL FORB, POTR/ARTR, POTR/CARU, POTR/CARO, POTR/FETH, POTR/TALL FORB, POTR/JUCO/CAGE, POTR/JUCO/LUAR, POTR/PTAQ, POTR/SARA, POTR/STCO, POTR/SYOR/CARO, POTR/SYOR/CARU, POTR/SYOR/THFE, POTR/SYOR/FETH, POTR/SYOR/TALL FORB, POTR/VECA, POTR-ABLA/AMAL, POTR-ABLA/CAGE, POTR-ABLA/CARO, POTR-ABLA/JUCO, POTR-ABLA/SYOR/THFE, ABLA/SYOR/TALL FORB, POTR-ABLA/TALL FORB, POTR-ABCO/ARPA, POTR-ABCO/POPR, POTR-ABCO/SYOR, POTR-PIPU, POTR-PIFL, POTR-PIPO COVER TYPE, POTR-PIPO/CAGE, POTR-PSME/AMAL, POTR-PSME/JUCO, POTR/ASMI, POTR/BRCA, POTR/POPR, POTR/JUCO/ASMI

<b>Summary of Bradley, Noste, and Fischer (1992):</b>  Loadings of downed woody fuel 0-1 inches and 0-3 inches in diameter vary substantially from stand to stand.
 Differences in dead fuel loadings between the aspen/shrub and mixed/shrub types are small.
 However, conifers in the mixed types are likely to torch, thus creating a severe fire.
 Fire in aspen stands will not spread unless flame lengths are 1-1.5 ft. which requires at least 50% cured herbaceous vegetation in the aspen/shrub and aspen/tall forb types.
 The presence of conifers increases flammability significantly.
 Although aspen depends on fire for successful regeneration, it is extremely fire-sensitive.
 Even low-severity fires can cause mortality because of aspen\'s thin bark.
 Moderately severe fire may be more likely to produce good suckering when compared with low-severity fires, which may not kill enough stems, or high-severity fires, which may kill shallow aspen roots.

<b>Fire Group Eight:</b>  Habitat types with persistent lodgepole pine

Habitat types in this fire group are listed below, assigned to subseries of McDonald and others (2000):

</table>
<b>Incidental Habitat Types:</b>  ABLA/VASC-VASC

Subseries represented in this Bradley, Noste, and Fischer Clayton (1992) fire group fall within two fire regimes of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Bradley, Noste, and Fischer (1992):</b>  Published fuel summaries are unavailable for persistent lodgepole pine stands in Utah.
 In lodgepole pine stands, fire perpetuates or renews the species.
 Where pine is a seral species, shade-tolerant species will replace it without fire or other disturbance because of its intolerance and mineral seedbed requirement.
 Fires in lodgepole pine-dominated stands may either smolder and creep slowly on the soil surface consuming litter and duff, or act as severe stand-replacing crown fires.
 During periods of drought and severe fire weather, fires can become holocausts if the lodgepole pine stand structure and fuel moistures are prime for burning.
 The primary use of prescribed fire in lodgepole pine is hazard reduction and site preparation; however, it has been suggested as a management tool for controlling dwarf mistletoe.
 
!FG09###########################
<b>Fire Group Nine:</b>  Climax stands dominated by limber pine or western bristlecone

Habitat types in this fire group are listed below, assigned to subseries of McDonald and others (2000).
<table border=1 cellpadding=2>
 <tr><th>DF/DS</th><td> PIFL/BERE, PIFL/CELE</td></tr>
</table>
Subseries represented in this Bradley, Noste, and Fischer (1992) fire group fall within one fire regime of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Bradley, Noste, and Fischer (1992):</b>  Limber pine and bristlecone pine climax stands occur on sites where fire-sustaining fuels are light to nearly non-existent.
 The greatest hazard to these habitat types is due to their generally small area and proximity to more flammable stands.
 Downed woody fuel loadings average between 5-15 tons/acre.
 Fire potential is low, and flames are unlikely to enter tree crowns on those sites where there is enough fine fuel available to carry a fire.
 Frequent low-severity fires may favor limber pine by keeping fuel loadings to a minimum.
 Although fire does not appear necessary to maintain most limber pine and bristlecone pine stands, important understory forage species may benefit from periodic burning to remove decadent growth and stimulate resprouting.

<b>Incidental Habitat Types:</b>  ABLA/VAMY, ABLA/VASC-CAGE, ABLA/VASC-VASC

Subseries represented in this Fischer and Clayton (1983) fire group fall within three fire regimes of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Bradley, Noste, and Fischer (1992):</b>  A combination of deep duff and large amounts of dead, rotten fuel can result in hot, smoldering surface fires during unusually dry conditions.
 When a dense understory exists, fire can easily spread to the tree crowns and destroy the stand.
 Even if surface fires don\'t crown, the overstory spruce and subalpine fire will likely be killed by cambium heating.
 Because of the predominantly cold, moist conditions in subalpine fir, even those stands having relatively heavy fuel loads may not experience fires for many decades or centuries.
 Fire has been used to remove stands of mistletoe-infested lodgepole pine to reduce the food supply of spruce beetles in cull logs or windthrows.

<b>Incidental Habitat Types:</b>  PIPU/EQAR

<b>Incidental Community Types:</b>  CONIFER/COSE, CONIFER/ACCO

Subseries represented in this Fischer and Clayton (1983) fire group fall within three fire regimes of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Bradley, Noste, and Fischer (1992):</b>  Fires are infrequent due to the moist environment and lush shrub and herb component.
 There may be much rotten material and duff on the forest floor.
 Stands are susceptible to severe fires when droughts occur and may be killed by either surface fires or by crown fires that encroach from surrounding stands.
 Thin bark and shallow roots make spruce susceptible to mortality from hot surface fires that consume organic layers around trees.
 Severe fires are rare, but they can invade from adjacent stands during dry, windy weather.
 Low-severity fires open stands, provide microsites for seedling establishment, and may stimulate aspen and shrub sprouting.

<b>Incidental Habitat Types:</b>  ABLA/RIMO-TRSP, ABLA/VASC-VASC

Subseries represented in this Bradley, Noste, and Fischer (1992) fire group fall within two fire regimes of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Bradley, Noste, and Fischer (1992):</b>  Moist conditions and discontinuous fine fuels keep fire hazard low in upper subalpine forests.
 The low productivity of these sites may decrease the rate of fuel accumulation, and average diameters of large woody fuels will probably be smaller than those in lower stands.
 Surface fires may kill trees by heating the cambium or root tissue in krummholz.
 Fire has its greatest impact when occasional large high-severity fires invade from lower elevation forests during severe fire conditions.
 Because of their susceptibility to fires at lower elevations, subalpine stands can be affected by excessive fuel buildups in lower, more fire-prone forests.
