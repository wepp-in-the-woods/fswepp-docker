<b>Fire Group One:</b>  Limber pine habitat types

Habitat types in this fire group are listed below, assigned to subseries of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Incidental Habitat Types:</b> PIFL/FEID-FEID

Subseries represented in this Bradley, Fischer and Noste (1992) fire group fall within one fire regime of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Bradley, Fischer and Noste (1992):</b>  The greatest fire hazard to stands in this group is their proximity to more flammable vegetation.
 Downed woody fuel loadings in Montana limber pine stands range between 5-15 tons/acre with about 80% of the loading in material greater than 3 in. in diameter.
 Fire intensity in this group remains low, and flames are unlikely to enter tree crowns even on sites where there is enough fine fuel available to carry a fire.
 Periodic burning may benefit important understory forage species by removing decadent growth and stimulating resprouting.

<b>Fire Group Two:</b>  Habitat types supporting cool, dry Douglas-fir forests

Habitat types in this fire group are listed below, assigned to subseries of McDonald and others (2000).

 <tr><th>Subseries</th><th>Habitat type</th></tr>
 <tr><th>DF/DG</th><td> PSME/ARCO-ARCO, PSME/ARCO-ASMI</td></tr>

</table>
<b>Incidental Habitat Types:</b>  PSME/FEID-FEID

Subseries represented in this Bradley, Fischer and Noste (1992) fire group fall within one fire regime of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Bradley, Fischer and Noste (1992):</b>  Stands in this fire group remain scattered to open and do not develop dense overstory canopies.
 Downed, dead, woody fuels are relatively light (about 13 tons/acre).
 Twigs and small branchwood less than 3 in. in diameter are the predominant woody fuels.
 Large witches\'-brooms caused by dwarf mistletoe in Douglas-fir on living or standing dead trees may promote crown fires and spot fires.
 Fire can open stands and rejuvenate sprouting shrubs.
 Fire may be used to reduce the susceptibility of Douglas-fir stands to western spruce budworm.

<b>Incidental Habitat Types:</b>  PSME/BERE-CAGE, PSME/PHMO, PSME/SYAL-SYAL, PSME/VAGL-VAGL

Subseries represented in this Bradley, Fischer and Noste (1992) fire group fall within two fire regimes of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Bradley, Fischer, and Noste (1992):</b>  Closed stands with dense Douglas-fir understories have the highest fire hazard.
 Downed as well as standing dead trees killed by dwarf mistletoe add to fuel loads and fire hazard.
 Fire can reduce fuel hazards, recycle nutrients and provide mineral seedbed.
 Fire can reduce the susceptibility of Douglas-fir stands to western spruce budworm by thinning stands and can sanitize postlogging stands by removing residual trees infected with dwarf mistletoe.

<b>Fire Group Four:</b>  Aspen-dominated community types

POTR-PSME/CARU
POTR-PSME/SYOR

<b>Incidental Community Types that are grazing disclimaxes:</b>
	POTR/ASMI
	POTR/POPR
	POTR/BRCA

<b>Summary of Bradley, Fischer, and Noste (1992):</b>  Fire plays a significant role in maintaining and regenerating aspen on even aged stands; however, the role of fire in uneven aged stands is unclear.
 Despite its dependence on fire for regeneration, aspen is extremely fire-sensitive because of its thin bark.
 Determining when fuels are ready to burn is more complicated in aspen forests than in other vegetation types.
 Live fuels must be adequately cured and windspeed and dead fuel moistures must be conducive to fire spread.
 Moderate severity fire may be more likely to produce good suckering when compared with low fires which may not kill enough stems or high-severity fires, which may kill shallow aspen roots.

<b>Fire Group Five:</b>  Persistent lodgepole pine community types

Community types in this fire group do not correspond to subseries of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Incidental Community Types:</b>  PICO/ARCO, PICO/CAGE, PICO/CARO, PICO/CARU, PICO/JUCO, PICO/LIBO, PICO/SHCA, PICO/SPBE, PICO/VAGL/ PICO/VASC

<b>Summary of Bradley, Fischer, and Noste (1992):</b>  In this fire group, the type and degree of vegetation mortality affects the fuel buildup which determines the severity of later fires and subsequent stand regeneration.
 Historically, fire probably generated most of the surface fuel in lodgepole pine stands.
 Competition between densely stocked trees can result in further fuel buildup from suppression mortality.
 Fires may smolder and creep slowly on the soil surface, consuming litter and duff or act as high-intensity, stand replacing crown fires.
 Most fires are low intensity due to sparse undergrowth and stand growth habit.
 Opportunities for fire use are limited in natural stands because of the low fire resistance of lodgepole pine, spruce and subalpine fir.

<b>Fire Group Six:</b>  Mid and lower elevation subalpine forest

Habitat types in this fire group are listed below, assigned to subseries of McDonald and others (2000).

</table>
<b>Incidental Habitat Types:</b>  ABLA/ACGL-PAMY, ABLA/BERE-CAGE, ABLA/CAGE-CAGE, ABLA/XETE-VAGL, ABLA/XETE-VASC

Subseries represented in this Bradley, Fischer, and Noste (1992) fire group fall within three fire regimes of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Bradley, Fischer, and Noste (1992):</b>  Live and standing dead fuel can contribute significantly to the overall fire hazard.
 Generally moist conditions and slower rates of fuel accumulation make large fires in subalpine forests unlikely except during periods of drought and high wind.
 A combination of deep duff and large amounts of dead, rotten fuel can result in hot, smoldering surface fires during unusually dry conditions.
 Fire can sanitize and reduce fire hazard, provide good seedbed conditions for spruce in areas where it is an important timber species and regenerate aspen for wildlife and livestock browse.
 Fire has been used to remove stands of mistletoe infested lodgepole pine and to reduce the food supply for spruce beetles in cull logs or windthrows.

<b>Fire Group Seven:</b>  Moist or wet subalpine fire and Engelmann spruce habitat types.

Habitat types in this fire group are listed below, assigned to subseries of McDonald and others (2000):
<table border=1 cellpadding=2>
 <tr><th>  ColdF/DH</th><td> ABLA/CACA-CACA, PIEN/LIBO</td></tr>

</table>
<b>Incidental Habitat Types:</b>  ABLA/ACRU, ABLA/CACA-LEGL, ABLA/CACA-VACA, ABLA/MEFE-MEFE, ABLA/STAM-STAM, PIEN/PHMA

Subseries represented in this Bradley, Fischer, and Noste (1992) fire group fall within two fire regimes of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Bradley, Fischer, and Noste (1992):</b>  Fires are infrequent due to a moist environment and lush shrub and herb component.
 There may be much rotten material and duff on the forest floor.
 In colder, high elevation habitat types, the proportion of sound to rotten woody fuel may be greater because of slow decomposition rates.
 When droughts occur, stands are susceptible to severe burns.
 Stands may be killed by either duff fire or crown fires.
 Following a stand-replacement fire, there is a brief herb stage followed rapidly by shrub resprouting.
 Thin bark and shallow roots make spruce susceptible to mortality from hot surface fires that consume organic layers around trees.

<b>Fire Group Eight:</b>  Cold, upper subalpine and timberline habitat types

<b>Incidental Habitat Types:</b>  ABLA/LUHI-VASC
	        
Subseries represented in this Davis, Clayton, and Fischer  (1980) fire group fall within three fire regimes of McDonald and others (2000).

<b>Summary of Bradley, Fischer, and Noste (1992):</b>  The low productivity of these sites decreases the rate of fuel accumulation, and average diameter of large woody fuels will probably be smaller than on more favorable sites.
 Downed and dead woody fuel loadings are formed by scattered large-diameter downfall resulting from wind and snow breakage, windthrow, and insect and disease mortality.
 Fire is usually restricted to the lightning-struck tree and the area of litter and herbaceous growth around it.
 Small groups of trees will torch where spruce and fir are a significant part of the understory.
 Stand-replacing fires are rare.
 Fire retains seral species, creates a mosaic of stand ages and species composition, and opens dense stands.
 Retention of whitebark pine depends on periodic fires that remove more tolerant conifers and create openings where regeneration is more successful.
