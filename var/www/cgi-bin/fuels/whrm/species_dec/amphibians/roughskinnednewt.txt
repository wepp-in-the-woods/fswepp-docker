Distribution
Pacific coast from southern Alaska to northern California
General Habitat
grasslands, woodlands and forests; prefers older forests
Home or Activity Range
< 2.5 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
proximity to creeks and breeding ponds; bare ground; deciduous forest types; found crawling in the open, under rocks, logs, bark, and in rotton wood
Nestsite Characteristics
migrate to ponds, lakes, slowly flowing streams or reservoirs for breeding; Butts and McComb (2000) found bare soil to be important in migrating to breeding sites
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
no information available
Diet
amphibian eggs and larvae, aquatic invertebrates, worms, small slugs
Predators
common garter snake can withstand its toxins
Shelter Habitats
under rocks, logs, bark, and in rotton wood
Response to Disturbance
no information available

Study Location: Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Evidence from this study suggests that rich, abundant populations of herpetofauna occur in naturally regenerating stands in Oregon and Washington. Few differences were found in amphibians between wet, moderate, and dry old-growth sites and between young, mature, and old-growth stands. Three salamanders in Oregon were found associated with downed logs or bark on the ground or on logs. These salamanders differed in their preference for age/class of downed logs.

Study Location: western Oregon Cascades
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Study areas that varied widely in CWD amounts were sampled for terrestrial amphibians and small mammals. Regression models containing habitat variables were constructed for 5 species of amphibians and small mammals. As CWD volume was important to some organisms, the authors suggest a retention of CWD in the range of 100-300 m3/ha to provide habitat for most terrestrial salamanders.

Study Location: Umpqua National Forest, southwestern Oregon
Habitat Description: mature PSME, with past history of thinning or salvage logging
Summary: The association between small vertebrate richness and coarse woody debris volume was tested, with a positive correlation demonstrated across all taxa and also within the taxanomic groups of small mammals, insectivores, and amphibians. A number of individual species appear to be associated with coarse woody debris; the majority of these associations were positive. No evidence of an associtian between snag volume and small vertebrate richness was found. Because the coarse woody debris volumes in the study area were well above regional guidelines, the author predicts reduced small vertebrate richness in those areas where coarse woody debris guidelines are strictly followed.

Study Location: northwestern California, southwestern Oregon
Habitat Description: PSME- low to mid elevations
Summary: Abundances and community composition of reptiles and amphibians were compared across forest types of coastal and inland DF forests. Habitat associations of 10 common species are given. Salamanders comprise the majority of the herpetofauna of this area. Species diversity was greater in older forest age classes with mesic conditions. A comparison of sampling methods is also presented.
