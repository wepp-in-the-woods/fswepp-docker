Belk, Mark C.; Smith, H. Duane; Lawson, John. 1988. Use and partitioning of montane habitat by small mammals. Journal of Mammalogy. 69:688-695.

Study Location: Utah Co., Utah
Habitat Description: PSME and aspen interspersed with herbaceous and shrub-dominated meadows
Summary: Habitat associations of four small mammal species (deer mouse, western jumping mouse, western redbacked vole, montane vole) were examined for montane sites in Utah. Species microhabitat preferences are given. Microhabitat preferences shifted from fallen logs and brush in early summer to areas of herbaceous growth in mid and late summer. Females occupied more structured microhabitat than males (higher levels of fallen trees, trees, and shrubs).

Brown, L.N. 1967. Distribution of mice in the Medicine Bow Mountains of Wyoming. Ecology. 48:677-680.

Study Location: southern Wyoming
Habitat Description: 8 types: sagebrush, mountain mahogany, aspen, subalpine meadow, willow-alder, lodgepole pine, spruce-fir, alpine tundra
Summary: The distributions of six mammal species were examined across eight types of plant communities. This summary will only address plant community types of interest to this project (aspen, PICO, spruce-fir). Jumping mice were common in aspen but were rare in PICO and spruce-fir forest unless bogs and/or meadows were present. They prefered wet areas with dense groundcover. Western redbacked voles were common in PICO and spruce-fir forest, and did not show a preference for water or ground cover. Deer mice were abundant in all types, but were rare in PICO and spruce-fir. They avoided wet areas and exhibited no preference for ground cover. Overall, plant communities with dense ground cover had twice the number of small mammals as those with sparse ground cover.

Study Location: northern Rocky Mountains; western Montana, Idaho, northwestern Wyoming, northern Utah
Habitat Description: spruce-fir zone; including ABLA, PSME, aspen, PICO, also extended into PIPO zone
Summary: Four year study on the ecology of the boreal owl in the northern Rocky Mountains. All owls were detected above 1292 m elevation, and the majority of detections were in ABLA habitat types. PICO was the only dominant forest type that was avoided, despite being common in the study area. It was used when no other forest type was available, and was characterized as having large trees. Nest sites were restricted to mature/old stands with complex physical structure; many habitat types were used, including mixed conifer forest (PIPO and PSME) 39% of the time as well as aspen 21% of the time despite covering <1% of the available forest. PICO was avoided for nesting. Boreal owls were selective in summer roosts sites, choosing sites with greater canopy cover, higher tree density, and higher basal area. The best foraging habitat was associated with mature/old spruce-fir stands where prey was most abundant. Diet, population and breeding were also examined. Habitat associations by vegetation type are given for primary prey species. Management strategies that focus on snag retention and harvest practices that retain forest structure are recommended for maintaining quality habitat.

In: Management of amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals in North America symposium: proceedings; Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-166. Fort Collins, CO: USDA, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station. 359-367.

Study Location: southern Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO (60%), PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Abundance of small mammals was associated with generalized habitat types within the supalpine zone. Moisture and stand maturity were two habitat features that separated patterns of abundance of various species. Specific habitat associations are given for 8 species of small mammals. The southern red-backed vole was confirmed as a suitable indicator of old-growth forest; the masked and dusky shrew may be as well.
