Distribution
western and central California; western Oregon
General Habitat
large conifers; heavy chaparral, streamside thickets, deciduous or mixed woods
Home or Activity Range
0.4-0.6 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
sapling/pole, small- large tree stages; hardwood understory ("other trees" in model are tanoaks), dense shrub cover
Nestsite Characteristics
builds stick houses on ground or in trees
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages in shrubby vegetation, can also forage arboreally
Diet
seeds, nuts, acorns, fruits, green vegetation, fungi, flowers; stores food in houses near nest; feeds on foods high in fiber, tannins, and phenolics
Predators
Northern spotted owl
Shelter Habitats
builds stick houses on ground or in trees; finds shelter from avian and mammalian predators in areas of high vegetative cover
Response to Disturbance
no information available

Study Location: Washington and Oregon
Habitat Description: three vegetation zones: Western Hemlock, Mixed-Conifer, Mixed-Conifer/Mixed-Evergreen
Summary: The local abundance and regional distributions of the bushy-tailed and dusky-footed woodrats were examined. In Washington, the bushy-tailed woodrat was rare in upland forest, but common along rocky streams on the eastern Olympic Peninsula and in rock bluffs on the west slope of the Cascades. In Oregon, it was common in old forests and along streams. The dusky-footed woodrat was rare in Oregon PSME-TSHE forests, but was occassionally abundant early and present in late stages of forest development. The distribution of the dusky-footed woodrat is explained by its preference for dense cover and its ability to consume plants potentially toxic to other mammals. These woodrats are limited in distribution because the seral stages that contain preferred habitat are relatively ephemeral. 

Murray, Keith F.; Barnes, Allan M. 1969. Distribution and habitat of the woodrat: Neotoma fuscipes, in northeastern California. Journal of Mammalogy. 50(1): 43-48.

Study Location: northeastern California
Habitat Description: variety- juniper
Summary: Description of dusky-footed woodrat distribution east of the Sierra-Cascade divide. In this part of its range, it was most commonly found in dense, well-developed juniper woodland. Juniper trees were used as support for lodges, and berries and leaves were food items. Woodrats were also found in shrubby or dense brushy, semiarboreal vegetation associated with lava rims. It appears that the presence of dense cover is a consistent component of each habitat type.

In: Management of amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals in North America symposium: proceedings; Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-166. Fort Collins, CO: USDA, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station. 359-367.

Study Location: southern Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO (60%), PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Abundance of small mammals was associated with generalized habitat types within the supalpine zone. Moisture and stand maturity were two habitat features that separated patterns of abundance of various species. Specific habitat associations are given for 8 species of small mammals. The southern red-backed vole was confirmed as a suitable indicator of old-growth forest; the masked and dusky shrew may be as well.

Sakai, Howard F.; Noon, Barry R. 1993. Dusky-footed woodrat abundance in different-aged forests in northwestern California. Journal of Wildlife Management. 57(2): 373-382.

Study Location: northwestern California
Habitat Description: PSME-tanoak
Summary: Dusky-footed woodrat abundance was examined in five seral stages of PSME-tanoak forest in northwestern CA. Nest densities were highest in sapling/brushy poletimber stands, followed by seedling/shrub and large old-growth stands. The authors propose that sapling/brushy poletimber stands adjacent to mature and old-growth PSME forest are source areas for woodrats that may be prey items of northern spotted owls.
