Distribution
coastal southern British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, northern California
General Habitat
moist areas in shady ravines and along streams
Home or Activity Range

Nestsite Characteristics
rotting stumps or logs
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
herbaceous cover, woody plant cover
Diet
small invertebrates
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
herbaceous cover, woody plant cover
Response to Disturbance
most abundant in uncut plots, followed by unburned clearcut, least abundant in slash-burned clearcut (Hooven and Black 1976), more abundant in young stands than clearcuts (Corn et al. 1988)
Sources of Information used in the Model

Butts, Sally R.; McComb, William C. 2000. Associations of forest-floor vertebrates with coarse woody debris in managed forests of western Oregon. Journal of Wildlife Management. 64(1):95-104.

Study Location: western Oregon Cascades
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Study areas that varied widely in CWD amounts were sampled for terrestrial amphibians and small mammals. Regression models containing habitat variables were constructed for 5 species of amphibians and small mammals. As CWD volume was important to some organisms, the authors suggest a retention of CWD in the range of 100-300 m3/ha to provide habitat for most terrestrial salamanders.

Study Location: Oregon and Washington Cascade Mountains
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Abundance of small mammals was associated with seral stage and moisture of PSME forests. Habitat associations are given for a number of species. Comparisons between clearcut and young forests were made for a few species.

Study Location: western Oregon (Cascades)
Habitat Description: PSME; also TSHE, THPL, ABGR
Summary: Changes in small mammal populations were documented in two clearcut (one with slash burned) and one uncut PSME stand. Shrews and chipmunks were adversely impacted by logging, while deer mice and Oregon creeping voles were affected favorably by both logging and slash burnings

Study Location: Umpqua National Forest, southwestern Oregon
Habitat Description: mature PSME, with past history of thinning or salvage logging
Summary: The association between small vertebrate richness and coarse woody debris volume was tested, with a positive correlation demonstrated across all taxa and also within the taxanomic groups of small mammals, insectivores, and amphibians. A number of individual species appear to be associated with coarse woody debris; the majority of these associations were positive. No evidence of an associtian between snag volume and small vertebrate richness was found. Because the coarse woody debris volumes in the study area were well above regional guidelines, the author predicts reduced small vertebrate richness in those areas where coarse woody debris guidelines are strictly followed.
