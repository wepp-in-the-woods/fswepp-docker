Buchanan, Joseph B.; Lundquist, Richard W.; Aubry, Keith B. 1990. Winter populations of Douglas' squirrels in different-aged Douglas-fir forests. Journal of Wildlife Management. 54(4): 577-581.

Study Location: southern Washington Cascades
Habitat Description: PSME, THPL, TSHE
Summary: Douglas squirrel populations in winter were generally higher in old-growth forests, but varied dramatically from year to year in synchrony to the annual production of conifer cones. Older forests appeared to be better habitat, as they produced a greater and more reliable quantity of conifer seeds. Silvicultural strategies to increase levels of cone production would be an effective means of improving the habitat quality of young PSME forest for squirrels. Such strategies include retaining green trees to ensure local cone production, planting mixed species to provide alternate seed sources, and harvesting trees such that multilayered or irregular canopies are the result.

Gashweiler, Jay S. 1970. Plant and animal changes on a clearcut in west-central Oregon. Ecology. 51:1018-1026.

Study Location: west-central Oregon (west Cascades)
Habitat Description: PSME, TSHE, THPL
Summary: Study documents changes in plant and mammal communities for 11 years following a clearcut with a fall burn. Deer mice increased in the experimental area soon after the burn was completed. Other species that increased at various times after the burn include Townsend's chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and the Oregon vole. Red-back voles, northern flying squirrels, and Douglas' squirrels were not found in the clearcut/burn. California squirrels migrated into the clearcut/burn.

Study Location: British Columbia
Habitat Description: PSME, TSHE, THPL, ALRU, ACMA
Summary: This study examined the importance of aspect and height in nest site selection (using nest boxes) for tree and flying squirrels. Both species chose higher nest boxes but there was no apparent selection for north or south aspect. Multiple nests were located in some boxes containing flying squirrels.

Study Location: south coast of British Columbia
Habitat Description: old- and second-growth stands of TSHE, THPL, PSME, ABAM
Summary: This study tested the hypothesis that old-growth forest stands were higher quality habitat than second-growth stands for two squirrel species. No major differences in movement, density, recruitment, mass of males, survival, percentage of the population breeding, and the duration of habitation of the study plots were found between the two stand types for flying squirrels. For Douglas squirrels, the only difference found was in recruitment, which was higher in the second growth stand. Therefore, old-growth habitat does not appear to be higher quality habitat for either species. When considering the contradictory results from other studies on northern flying squirrels, the authors noted that two overall patterns: abundance can be variable within a stand type and the relative difference between stand types varies from year to year. This pattern limits the inference from short-term studies.

In: Management of amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals in North America symposium: proceedings; Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-166. Fort Collins, CO: USDA, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station. 359-367.

Study Location: southern Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO (60%), PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Abundance of small mammals was associated with generalized habitat types within the supalpine zone. Moisture and stand maturity were two habitat features that separated patterns of abundance of various species. Specific habitat associations are given for 8 species of small mammals. The southern red-backed vole was confirmed as a suitable indicator of old-growth forest; the masked and dusky shrew may be as well.
