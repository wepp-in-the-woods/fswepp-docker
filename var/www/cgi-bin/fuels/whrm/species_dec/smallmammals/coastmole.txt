Corn, Paul Stephen; Bury, R. Bruce; Spies, Thomas A. 1988. Douglas-fir forests in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon and Washington: Is the abundance of small mammals related to stand age and moisture? In: Management of amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals in North America symposium: proceedings; Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-166. Fort Collins, CO: USDA, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station. 340-352.

Study Location:  Oregon and Washington Cascade Mountains
Habitat Description:  PSME
Summary:  Abundance of small mammals was associated with seral stage and moisture of PSME forests. Habitat associations are given for a number of species. Comparisons between clearcut and young forests were made for a few species.
