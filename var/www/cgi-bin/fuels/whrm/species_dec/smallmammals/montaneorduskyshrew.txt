Belk, Mark C.; Pritchett, Clyde L.; Smith, H. Duane. 1990. Patterns of microhabitat use by Sorex monticolus in summer. Great Basin Naturalist. 50(4): 387-389.

Study Location: Utah Co., Utah
Habitat Description: aspen and PSME interspersed with herbaceous meadows and shrub-dominated ridges
Summary: Montane shrews showed temporal variation in habitat association in the summer months. Habitat use in July was characterized by areas with higher densities of fallen logs, greater number of woody species, and larger size of understory trees, which was characteristic of shrubby areas in early successional stages. In August, no obvious associations were present. In September, shrews used habitat with a lower density of fallen logs, few numbers of woody species, and smaller understory trees, which represented areas dominated by climax aspen stands. The authors attribute these patterns to the development and persistence of herbaceous ground cover in the summer months.

Study Location: Utah Co., Utah
Habitat Description: PSME and aspen interspersed with herbaceous and shrub-dominated meadows
Summary: Habitat associations of four small mammal species (deer mouse, western jumping mouse, western redbacked vole, montane vole) were examined for montane sites in Utah. Species microhabitat preferences are given. Microhabitat preferences shifted from fallen logs and brush in early summer to areas of herbaceous growth in mid and late summer. Females occupied more structured microhabitat than males (higher levels of fallen trees, trees, and shrubs).

Study Location: Oregon and Washington Cascade Mountains
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Abundance of small mammals was associated with seral stage and moisture of PSME forests. Habitat associations are given for a number of species. Comparisons between clearcut and young forests were made for a few species.

Hayward, Gregory D.; Hayward, Patricia H. 1995. Relative abundance and habitat associations of small mammals in Chamberlain Basin, Central Idaho. Northwest Science. 69(2): 114-125.

Study Location: Frank Church Wilderness, central Idaho
Habitat Description: PICO-dominated, also PIPO, PSME, ABLA, PIEN
Summary: Small mammal populations were sampled in a wilderness area in netral Idaho. Spruce-fir forests had the highest abundance of small mammals, while PICO forest had the lowest. Species richness was low in all habitats, though it was highest in PICO forest. Habitat associations are given for some small mammals. The patchy distribution of small mammals in this study area mimics the patchy nature of forests in this region.

In: Management of amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals in North America symposium: proceedings; Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-166. Fort Collins, CO: USDA, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station. 359-367.

Study Location: southern Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO (60%), PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Abundance of small mammals was associated with generalized habitat types within the supalpine zone. Moisture and stand maturity were two habitat features that separated patterns of abundance of various species. Specific habitat associations are given for 8 species of small mammals. The southern red-backed vole was confirmed as a suitable indicator of old-growth forest; the masked and dusky shrew may be as well.
