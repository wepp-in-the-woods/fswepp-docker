Distribution
Pacific northwest
General Habitat
forests, brush, grassy areas; usually on dry slopes; young seral stages, more common in riparian than upland habitat
Home or Activity Range
<1 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
grassy areas, deciduous and evergreen herbs, deciduous shrubs, abundance is found to be negatively associated with number and biomass of decayed logs, litter depth and cover, and density, basal area, and dbh of live trees (Doyle 1987).
Nestsite Characteristics
No information available
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forage on ground or underground
Diet
grasses, forbs, huckleberries, subterranean fungi; variety of green vegetation and includes leaves of forbs, grasses, berries, roots, bulbs, and hypogeous fungi. In old growth forest they eat truffles.
Predators
No information available
Shelter Habitats
burrows through duff on forest floor or among grass roots
Response to Disturbance
more abundant in clearcut than young stands (Corn et al. 1988); increased 3 years after clearcut/burn (Gashwiler 1970)
Sources of Information used in the Model

General Sources of Background Information
Gashwiler 1970, Burt 1980, Doyle 1987, Corn et al. 1988, reviewed in O'Neil et al. 2001

Corn, Paul Stephen; Bury, R. Bruce; Spies, Thomas A. 1988. Douglas-fir forests in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon and Washington: Is the abundance of small mammals related to stand age and moisture? In: Management of amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals in North America symposium: proceedings; Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-166. Fort Collins, CO: USDA, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station. 340-352.

Study Location:  Oregon and Washington Cascade Mountains
Habitat Description:  PSME
Summary:  Abundance of small mammals was associated with seral stage and moisture of PSME forests. Habitat associations are given for a number of species. Comparisons between clearcut and young forests were made for a few species.

Doyle, A.T. 1987. Microhabitat separation among sympatric microtines, Clethrionomys californicus, Microtus oregoni and M. richardsoni. The American Midland Naturalist. 118: 258-265.

Study Location:  western Cascade Range, Oregon
Habitat Description:  primarily PSME; also TSHE, THPL, ABGR, TABR
Summary:  Microhabitat separation and preferences were investigated for Clethrionomys californicus, Microtus oregoni and M. richardsoni. Specific habitat preferences are given for the three species. Microhabitat separation was a function of canopy cover of deciduous trees, percent cover of lichen, and distance from streamside.
