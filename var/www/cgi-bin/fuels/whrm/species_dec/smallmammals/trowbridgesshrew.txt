Distribution
coastal southern British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, northern California; central California
General Habitat
coniferous forest and other wooded areas
Home or Activity Range
< 2.5 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
thickets of vegetation, high basal area and tree dbh, late decay-class DWD, deep litter depth; avoids areas with grasses and herbs
Nestsite Characteristics
no information available
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages on ground, underground, on downed wood, on tree boles/bark; Capable of burrowing; will forage in soil beneath duff, also climbs trees 
Diet
insects, isopods, small invertebrates, Douglas fir seeds
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
thickets of vegetation
Response to Disturbance
most abundant in uncut plots, followed by unburned clearcut, least abundant in slash-burned clearcut (Hooven and Black 1976), more abundant in young stands than clearcuts (Corn et al. 1988)
Sources of Information used in the Model
Hooven and Black 1976, Corn et al. 1988, Butts and McComb 2000
General Sources of Background Information
Hooven and Black 1976, Burt 1980, Corn et al. 1988, Butts and McComb 2000, reviewed in O'Neil et al. 2001

Butts, Sally R.; McComb, William C. 2000. Associations of forest-floor vertebrates with coarse woody debris in managed forests of western Oregon. Journal of Wildlife Management. 64(1):95-104.

Study Location: western Oregon Cascades
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Study areas that varied widely in CWD amounts were sampled for terrestrial amphibians and small mammals. Regression models containing habitat variables were constructed for 5 species of amphibians and small mammals. As CWD volume was important to some organisms, the authors suggest a retention of CWD in the range of 100-300 m3/ha to provide habitat for most terrestrial salamanders.

Study Location: Oregon and Washington Cascade Mountains
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Abundance of small mammals was associated with seral stage and moisture of PSME forests. Habitat associations are given for a number of species. Comparisons between clearcut and young forests were made for a few species.

Study Location: western Oregon (Cascades)
Habitat Description: PSME; also TSHE, THPL, ABGR
Summary: Changes in small mammal populations were documented in two clearcut (one with slash burned) and one uncut PSME stand. Shrews and chipmunks were adversely impacted by logging, while deer mice and Oregon creeping voles were affected favorably by both logging and slash burnings
