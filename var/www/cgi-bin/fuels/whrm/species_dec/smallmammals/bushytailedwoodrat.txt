Summaries of Specific Studies
Bull, Evelyn L. 2000. Seasonal and sexual differences in American Marten diet in northeastern Oregon. Northwest Science. 74(3): 186-191.

Study Location:  Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon
Habitat Description: PICO, ABLA, PSME, ABGR
Summary: Diet of American marten included mostly vole-sized prey,  but also squirrel-sized prey, insects, birds, plant material, and lagomorphs. A significantly higher proportion of vole-sized prey was taken in summer, while larger prey was taken in winter. Insects and plant material was more common in summer than winter. Females preyed on a higher proportion of shrews, while males preyed on a higher proportion of southern red-backed voles. Includes a detailed table (Table 1) of prey items and their frequency of occurrence.

Carey, Andrew B.; Maguire, Christine C.; Biswell, Brian L.; Wilson, Todd M. 1999. Distribution and abundance of Neotoma in western Oregon and Washington. Northwest Science. 73(2): 65-80.

Study Location: Washington and Oregon
Habitat Description: three vegetation zones: Western Hemlock, Mixed-Conifer, Mixed-Conifer/Mixed-Evergreen
Summary: The local abundance and regional distributions of the bushy-tailed and dusky-footed woodrats were examined. In Washington, the bushy-tailed woodrat was rare in upland forest, but common along rocky streams on the eastern Olympic Peninsula and in rock bluffs on the west slope of the Cascades. In Oregon, it was common in old forests and along streams. The dusky-footed woodrat was rare in Oregon PSME-TSHE forests, but was occassionally abundant early and present in late stages of forest development. The distribution of the dusky-footed woodrat is explained by its preference for dense cover and its ability to consume plants potentially toxic to other mammals. These woodrats are limited in distribution because the seral stages that contain preferred habitat are relatively ephemeral.

Study Location: northern Rocky Mountains; western Montana, Idaho, northwestern Wyoming, northern Utah
Habitat Description: spruce-fir zone; including ABLA, PSME, aspen, PICO, also extended into PIPO zone
Summary: Four year study on the ecology of the boreal owl in the northern Rocky Mountains. All owls were detected above 1292 m elevation, and the majority of detections were in ABLA habitat types. PICO was the only dominant forest type that was avoided, despite being common in the study area. It was used when no other forest type was available, and was characterized as having large trees. Nest sites were restricted to mature/old stands with complex physical structure; many habitat types were used, including mixed conifer forest (PIPO and PSME) 39% of the time as well as aspen 21% of the time despite covering <1% of the available forest. PICO was avoided for nesting. Boreal owls were selective in summer roosts sites, choosing sites with greater canopy cover, higher tree density, and higher basal area. The best foraging habitat was associated with mature/old spruce-fir stands where prey was most abundant. Diet, population and breeding were also examined. Habitat associations by vegetation type are given for primary prey species. Management strategies that focus on snag retention and harvest practices that retain forest structure are recommended for maintaining quality habitat.

Ward Jr., James P.; Block, William M. 1995. Mexican spotted owl prey ecology. Chapter 5. In Recovery Plan for the Mexican Spotted Owl. Vol II. Albequerque, New Mexico: USDI Fish and Wildlife Service. pp 1-48.

Study Location: range of Mexican spotted owl; case studies in northern Arizona and New Mexico
Habitat Description: not stated; PIPO
Summary: Literature review and synthesis of data from past studies concerning the ecology of prey of the Mexican Spotted Owl, including information on owl diet, identification of prey that might influence owl fitness, and quanitification of habitat correlates of prey species. The authors found variation in diet regionally. Reproductive success of spotted owls was not linked to any single prey species, rather to many species in combination, or total prey biomass. However, certain species may be more important in specific regions. Overall, food resources were quite variable among vegetation communities and through time. Owl food is most abundant during the summer when young are being raised. Prey biomass decreases in late fall and early winter. Habitat correlates are presented from one study in northern Arizona (deer mouse, brush mouse, Mexican woodrat) and one in New Mexico.
