Summaries of Specific Studies
Hayward, Gregory D., Hayward, Patricia H.; Garton, Edward O. 1993. Ecology of boreal owls in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. Wildlife Monographs. 124:159.

Study Location: northern Rocky Mountains; western Montana, Idaho, northwestern Wyoming, northern Utah
Habitat Description: spruce-fir zone; including ABLA, PSME, aspen, PICO, also extended into PIPO zone
Summary: Four year study on the ecology of the boreal owl in the northern Rocky Mountains. All owls were detected above 1292 m elevation, and the majority of detections were in ABLA habitat types. PICO was the only dominant forest type that was avoided, despite being common in the study area. It was used when no other forest type was available, and was characterized as having large trees. Nest sites were restricted to mature/old stands with complex physical structure; many habitat types were used, including mixed conifer forest (PIPO and PSME) 39% of the time as well as aspen 21% of the time despite covering <1% of the available forest. PICO was avoided for nesting. Boreal owls were selective in summer roosts sites, choosing sites with greater canopy cover, higher tree density, and higher basal area. The best foraging habitat was associated with mature/old spruce-fir stands where prey was most abundant. Diet, population and breeding were also examined. Habitat associations by vegetation type are given for primary prey species. Management strategies that focus on snag retention and harvest practices that retain forest structure are recommended for maintaining quality habitat.
