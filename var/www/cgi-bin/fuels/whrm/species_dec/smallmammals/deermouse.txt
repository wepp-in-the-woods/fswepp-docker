Study Location:  Utah Co., Utah
Habitat Description:  PSME and aspen interspersed with herbaceous and shrub-dominated meadows
Summary:  Habitat associations of four small mammal species (deer mouse, western jumping mouse, western redbacked vole, montane vole) were examined for montane sites in Utah. Species microhabitat preferences are given. Microhabitat preferences shifted from fallen logs and brush in early summer to areas of herbaceous growth in mid and late summer. Females occupied more structured microhabitat than males (higher levels of fallen trees, trees, and shrubs).

Study Location:  Black Hills, South Dakota
Habitat Description:  PP, pine-grassland savannah
Summary:  Bird and deer mouse abundance was examined 1 and 2 years post-prescribed fire. Bird species composition was similar between burned and control plots. However, 7 bird species (American robin, Mountain bluebird, Solitary vireo, Yellow-rumped warbler, Western tanager, Dark-eyed junco, Chipping sparrow) were more abundant on burned plots the first year post-fire. In the second year post-fire, only one species was more abundant on the burns (Vesper sparrow), while 2 were more common on the controls (American robin, red-breasted nuthatch). Deer mice were similarly more abundant on burned plots the first year post-fire, but were not so the second year. The major difference in vegetation post-fire was the reduction of litter and small pines in the burned areas. The authors attribute the observed patterns of wildlife abundance to a temporary increase in the quantity or quality of local food supply as opposed to the documented changes in vegetative structure.

Study Location:  Bridger-Teton National Forest, Wyoming
Habitat Description:  PIEN-ABLA, PICO, PSME, PIFL
Summary:  Deer mouse and red-backed vole populations were monitored in sites that had been clearcut or had undergone selective logging. Selective logging removed 54% of the trees but retained mesic conditions. Clearcutting removed 84% of the trees and the resulted in a transition to xeric condition. As time since treatment progressed, voles were more common on uncut and selectively logged sites, whereas deer mice were more common on the clearcut sites. There was no difference between sites in sex-ratios, timing of reproduction, litter size, and body measurements.

Study Location:  northern Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Deer mice were less abundant in high density stands of ponderosa pine (live trees and small snags); more abundant in high forb cover and Gambel oak tree basal area.  Author predicts that deer mice will continue to increase in density in treated units for several years following treatment; then populations will stabilize.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Small mammals were trapped in PIPO forest stands that had undergone a variety of treatments, including strip shelterwood cutting, clearcutting, severe thinning, and no treatment. Habitat relationships and diet composition are given for a variety of small mammals. The populations of some small mammals, particularly deer mice, were higher on treated plots than untreated plots; the presence of slash and other debris as well as the prevalence of food items (forbs and grasses) seems to be responsible for this pattern.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Relationships between small mammal species and wildfire severity categories were examined in northern Arizona. Average number of species was similar among high and moderate severity burn plots as well as controls, though species composition differed. Deer mice were more abundant on high-severity plots compared to moderate-severity plots. Patterns of habitat correlation for deer mice were not consistent across fire severities or spatial scales, suggesting that habitat use patterns differ between fire severities. The author suggests that deer mice are responded to habitat variables that are limiting in the specific severity type under consideration.

Study Location:  west-central Idaho
Habitat Description: dominated by DF and PP; scattered stands of ABGR, LP, PIEN
Summary:  Small mammals were trapped from 1-3 years after diameter-cut logging. Deer mouse populations were not different between logged and unlogged plots. Yellow-pine chipmunks were higher on logged sites, while Gapper's red-backed voles disappeared from the small mammal community after logging. The major changes to to the vegetation included a reduction in large-diameter trees and a loss of shrub cover due the logging activities and slash burning. Herbaceous vegetation recovered more quickly.

Study Location:  northwestern Montana
Habitat Description: ABLA habitat-types
Summary:  The effects of clearcutting on mammalian prey species of the wolverine were studied in northwestern Montana. Deer mice were more abundant in 5-year old clearcuts than 15-year old clearcuts and uncut forest. Redbacked vole densities were highest in uncut forest. Clearcuts provided diverse habitats for small mammals through different stages of succession, much like wildfire did at one point in time.

Study Location:  southern Wyoming
Habitat Description:LP (60%), PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Abundance of small mammals was associated with generalized habitat types within the supalpine zone. Moisture and stand maturity were two habitat features that separated patterns of abundance of various species. Specific habitat associations are given for 8 species of small mammals. The southern red-backed vole was confirmed as a suitable indicator of old-growth forest; the masked and dusky shrew may be as well.

Study Location:  northwestern California
Habitat Description:  DF forest
Summary: This study describes the relative abundance of amphibians, reptiles and mammals in six seral stages of forest in NW California. Seral stages preferred by individual species are given (Table 2). Late brush/sapling and old growth seral stages provided the most productive wildlife habitat. Habitat components that correlated with the relative abundance of 9 species are also presented. Species that would increase or decrease in numbers after harvest of old-growth DF forest are predicted.

Study Location:  Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming
Habitat Description: mixed conifer: ABLA, LP, PIEN
Summary:  This study examined small mammal diversity across a chronosequence of burned sites and controls in Grand Teton National Park. Densities of deer mice and southern red-backed voles were not associated with successional status of the forest, or any other gross features of the habitats other than the assocation of southern red-backed voles with unburned forest , and higher densities of deer mice in burned forest, particularly those that had recently burned. The deer mouse was associated with forests of all succesional states, but primarily with more open habitats. The southern red-backed vole was far more common in mature forests with various combinations of spruce, fir, and lodgepole pine. Specific microhabitat variables that predicted densities of deer mice and southern red-backed voles were identified for unburned forests, but no discriminating variables were found in burned forests. Forests in this area contain an assemblage of small mammal species of varying habitat specificities that show unpredictable responses to highly variable post-fire conditions. As some results contradict those found in other studies, the authors suggest that generalizing about microhabitat use by small mammals in different ecosystems should be done with caution.

Study Location:  range of Mexican spotted owl; case studies in northern Arizona and New Mexico
Habitat Description: not stated, presumably PIPO
Summary:  Literature review and synthesis of data from past studies concerning the ecology of prey of the Mexican Spotted Owl, including information on owl diet, identification of prey that might influence owl fitness, and quanitification of habitat correlates of prey species. The authors found variation in diet regionally. Reproductive success of spotted owls was not linked to any single prey species, rather to many species in combination, or total prey biomass. However, certain species may be more important in specific regions. Overall, food resources were quite variable among vegetation communities and through time. Owl food is most abundant during the summer when young are being raised. Prey biomass decreases in late fall and early winter. Habitat correlates are presented from one study in northern Arizona (deer mouse, brush mouse, Mexican woodrat) and one in New Mexico.
