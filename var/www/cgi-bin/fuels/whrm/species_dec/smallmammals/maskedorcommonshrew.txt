Distribution
northern N. America, south along Rocky and Appalachian mountain chains
General Habitat
wet/moist sites; also dry coniferous forests when sympatric with vagrant shrew
Home or Activity Range
1.5 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
shrubs along marsh; high woody stem density; prefers sites with ground structural complexity- downed woody material and grass cover;herb and grass cover; Hayward and Hayward (1995) found a positive association with large snags and a negative association with upper forest canopy cover, heavy grass cover, and density of medium-sized trees, but this species was combined with the vagrant shrew in analysis
Nestsite Characteristics
constructs nests in decaying logs
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
downed woody material and grass cover
Diet
invertebrates: from beetles to worms, insect eggs and pupae in winter; mice (especially newborns); salamanders
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
downed woody material and grass cover for predator avoidance
Response to Disturbance
no information available
Sources of Information used in the Model

Hayward, Gregory D.; Hayward, Patricia H. 1995. Relative abundance and habitat associations of small mammals in Chamberlain Basin, Central Idaho. Northwest Science. 69(2): 114-125.

Study Location: Frank Church Wilderness, central Idaho
Habitat Description: PICO-dominated, also PIPO, PSME, ABLA, PIEN
Summary: Small mammal populations were sampled in a wilderness area in netral Idaho. Spruce-fir forests had the highest abundance of small mammals, while PICO forest had the lowest. Species richness was low in all habitats, though it was highest in PICO forest. Habitat associations are given for some small mammals. The patchy distribution of small mammals in this study area mimics the patchy nature of forests in this region.

In: Management of amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals in North America symposium: proceedings; Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-166. Fort Collins, CO: USDA, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station. 359-367.

Study Location: southern Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO (60%), PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Abundance of small mammals was associated with generalized habitat types within the supalpine zone. Moisture and stand maturity were two habitat features that separated patterns of abundance of various species. Specific habitat associations are given for 8 species of small mammals. The southern red-backed vole was confirmed as a suitable indicator of old-growth forest; the masked and dusky shrew may be as well.

Spencer, Albert W.; Pettus, David. 1966. Habitat preferences of five sympatric species of long-tailed shrews. Ecology. 47(4): 677-683.

Study Location: Colorado
Habitat Description: marsh, mixed conifer forest (subclimax PICO, also spruce and fire), clearcut
Summary: The habitat preferences of five species of sympatric shrews were analyzed from sites in Colorado. Dwarf shrews were found more than expected in forested and clear-cut habitats, but less than expected in a marsh. Vagrant shrews were found more than expected at clearcut and marsh habitats, but less at forested and intermediate habitats. Pygmy shrews exceeded expectation in the forest and marsh-forest intermediate habitats, and were deficient everywhere else. Common shrews were found more than expected in the marsh and forest-clearcut types but were deficient everywhere else. The authors hypothesize that vagrant and dwarf shrews are less dependent, physiologically, on a moist environment, than the common or pygmy shrew. The common and vagrant shrew populations appeared to interact, with similar population fluctuations, habitat preferences, and habitat segregation at one location.
