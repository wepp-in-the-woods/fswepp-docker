Summaries of Specific Studies
Gashweiler, Jay S. 1970. Plant and animal changes on a clearcut in west-central Oregon. Ecology. 51:1018-1026.

Study Location: west-central Oregon (west Cascades)
Habitat Description: PSME, TSHE, THPL
Summary: Study documents changes in plant and mammal communities for 11 years following a clearcut with a fall burn. Deer mice increased in the experimental area soon after the burn was completed. Other species that increased at various times after the burn include Townsend's chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and the Oregon vole. Red-back voles, northern flying squirrels, and Douglas' squirrels were not found in the clearcut/burn. California squirrels migrated into the clearcut/burn.

Hooven, Edward F.; Black, Hugh C. 1976. Effects of some clearcutting practices on small-mammal populations in western Oregon. Northwest Science. 50(4):189-208.

Study Location: western Oregon (Cascades)
Habitat Description: PSME; also TSHE, THPL, ABGR
Summary: Changes in small mammal populations were documented in two clearcut (one with slash burned) and one uncut PSME stand. Shrews and chipmunks were adversely impacted by logging, while deer mice and Oregon creeping voles were affected favorably by both logging and slash burnings
