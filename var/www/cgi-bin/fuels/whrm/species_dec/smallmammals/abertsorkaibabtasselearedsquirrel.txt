<blockquote>
<b>Study Location:</b>  north-central Arizona
<b>Habitat Description:</b>  PP forests
<b>Summary:</b>  Tassel squirrel recruitment was strongly and positively related to the number of interlocking canopy trees and fungal content of August fecal samples. Fungal content was related to basal area. Squirrel densitiy was related to fungal diversity. Managment techniques that include intensive widespread thinning may adversly impact tassel eared squirrels and the fungi they rely on. Managing for interlocking canopies could be beneficial to squirrel populations.

<blockquote>
<b>Study Location:</b>  Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona
<b>Habitat Description:</b> PIPO, pinyon-juniper woodland, spruce-fir
<b>Summary:</b>  The natural history of the Kaibab squirrel on the Kaibab Plateau is outlined. Most life history traits are tied specifically to PIPO. Quality of feeding habitat is reflected in the density of larger trees, trunk diameter, crown density and height, and foliage weight. Nests are constructed in large pines near one or more neighboring pines. Nests are made close to the trunk of large PIPO, and are often 10 m above the ground. Several nests are used yearly. The author also discusses home ranges, daily behavior, food availability, the impact the Kaibab squirrel has on PIPO and spatial and temporal population fluctuations.

<b>Study Location:</b>  Apache, Coconino, and Kaibab National Forests, Arizona
<b>Habitat Description:</b>  PIPO forest
<b>Summary:</b> Abert squirrel habitat was modeled in PIPO forests using tree size, density, and dispersion pattern as habitat characteristics. The author recommends managing for stands with trees >12" dbh, >120 trees/acre, and some clumpiness, as these areas provide good nesting habitat. Specific management techniques are suggested.

<blockquote>
<b>Study Location:</b>  Kaibab plateau, Arizona
<b>Habitat Description:</b>  PIPO forest
<b>Summary:</b> Timber harvesting on the Kaibab plateau reduced habitat quality and consequently Kaibab squirrel density. Squirrel densities were smaller and home ranges larger on sites where timber harvest occurred. The impacts of timber harvests on squirrel densities were directly related to the amount of tree patchiness (+), the number and diameter of trees remaining for food and cover (+), and to the size of a cut area (-).

<blockquote>
<b>Study Location:</b>  Abajo Mountains and Elk Ridge Plateau of San Juan County,  southeastern Utah
<b>Habitat Description:</b> PIPO forest
<b>Summary:</b>  The habitat requirements of the Navajo subspecies of the Abert squirrel are described. Diameter of PIPO trees (12-19" dbh) was the most significant variable in delineating Abert squirrel habitat. Other life history traits are examined, including distribution, use of nest and feed trees, movement and home range, and an evaluation of squirrel populations in a logged area. Logging resulted in a decrease in squirrel populations, as potential nest and feed trees were removed and conditions were created that enhanced habitat for competitors. Specific recommendations are made for logging within the range of the Abert squirrel.

<blockquote>
<b>Study Location:</b>  Kaibab National Forest, Arizona
<b>Habitat Description:</b>  PP forest
<b>Summary:</b> Kaibab squirel numbers were most consistently correlated with the basal area of ponderosa pine, including all PIPO and those > 6" dbh. A conceptual model for assessing quality of kaibab squirrel habitat was made by ranking basal area per acre of PIPO and number of squirrel nests per trapsite.
