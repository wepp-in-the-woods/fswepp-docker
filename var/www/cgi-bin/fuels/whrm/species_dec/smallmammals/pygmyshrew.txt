Summaries of Specific Studies
Spencer, Albert W.; Pettus, David. 1966. Habitat preferences of five sympatric species of long-tailed shrews. Ecology. 47(4): 677-683.

Study Location: Colorado
Habitat Description: marsh, mixed conifer forest (subclimax PICO, also spruce and fire), clearcut
Summary: The habitat preferences of five species of sympatric shrews were analyzed from sites in Colorado. Dwarf shrews were found more than expected in forested and clear-cut habitats, but less than expected in a marsh. Vagrant shrews were found more than expected at clearcut and marsh habitats, but less at forested and intermediate habitats. Pygmy shrews exceeded expectation in the forest and marsh-forest intermediate habitats, and were deficient everywhere else. Common shrews were found more than expected in the marsh and forest-clearcut types but were deficient everywhere else. The authors hypothesize that vagrant and dwarf shrews are less dependent, physiologically, on a moist environment, than the common or pygmy shrew. The common and vagrant shrew populations appeared to interact, with similar population fluctuations, habitat preferences, and habitat segregation at one location.
