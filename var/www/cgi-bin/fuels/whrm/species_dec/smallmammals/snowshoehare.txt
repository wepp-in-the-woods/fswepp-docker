Response to Disturbance
hares present in a stand were not caught again after clearcut (Hooven and Black 1976); in general, less abundant in stands harvested for fuels reduction (Bull and Blumton 1999); increased 10 years after treatment in clearcut/burned stands (Gashwiler 1970); lowest hare abundance in site pre-commercially thinned 5-10 years ago (Shick 2003); hare abundance increased with time since pre-commercial thinning to levels equal to unthinned forest within 10-25 years of thinning (Shick 2003)

Bull, Evelyn L.; Blumton, Arlene K. 1999. Effect of fuels reduction on American martens and their prey. Research Note PNW-RN-539. Portland, OR: USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station. 9 p.

Study Location: northeastern Oregon
Habitat Description: PICO, mixed conifer: ABLA, ABGR, LAOC, PIEN, PSME
Summary: The effect of fuels reduction on American marten was investigating by examining prey response to harvesting in lodgepole and mixed conifer stands. In general, the harvest activities resulted in fewer post-harvest numbers of red-backed voles and snowshoe hares and in more chipmunks. Red squirrels declined in the control and scattered treatment, and slightly increased in the island treatment. Harvest techniques that retained some cover in the form of downed logs or pockets of regeneration were favored by small mammals to techniques where cover was removed. The declines of red-backed voles, red squirrels and snowshoe hares as a result of harvesting would negatively impact marten, as these small mammals comprise a majority of the marten diet. Furthermore, the structures that many small mammals use for cover, including downed logs, are also used by marten. Therefore, it appears that although marten could be negatively impacted by the fuels reduction methods used in this study, the technique that retained certain structures should be further investigated as an option for managers. The authors note that extrapolation of the data should be done with caution, as sample size and sampling period were limited.

Study Location: west-central Oregon (west Cascades)
Habitat Description: PSME, TSHE, THPL
Summary: Study documents changes in plant and mammal communities for 11 years following a clearcut with a fall burn. Deer mice increased in the experimental area soon after the burn was completed. Other species that increased at various times after the burn include Townsend's chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and the Oregon vole. Red-back voles, northern flying squirrels, and Douglas' squirrels were not found in the clearcut/burn. California squirrels migrated into the clearcut/burn.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: western Oregon (Cascades)
Habitat Description: PSME; also TSHE, THPL, ABGR
Summary: Changes in small mammal populations were documented in two clearcut (one with slash burned) and one uncut PSME stand. Shrews and chipmunks were adversely impacted by logging, while deer mice and Oregon creeping voles were affected favorably by both logging and slash burnings

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: mixed conifer; includes: PSME, PIPO, PICO, LAOC, ABLA, PIEN
Summary: This study examined variation in hare abundances in managed forest stands in two regions of western Montana. Horizontal cover variables above 0.5 m were most predictive of hare pellet densities. Understory components were more predictive than other strata of vegetation. Significant differences in hare abundance existed in a variety of managed stand types in western Montana. Unthinned stands had the highest pellet densities, while pole stands had the lowest densities. The relationship between pre-commercial thinning and pellet densities varied with the temporal scale under consideration. Stands that underwent pre-commercial thinning 5-10 years ago had significantly lower hare abundances than stands that had not been pre-commercially thinned. Pellet densities increased as time since thinning increased. This study also found a limited number of landscape variables that significantly predicted hare pellet densities. Two variables, perimeter to area ratio and disturbance within a 600 m buffer, significantly predicted pellet densities across all stand types, though their ability to explain variation in pellet density was weak. The relationship of pellet densities to explanatory variables at a landscape scale was inconsistent and often contradictory between the two study regions. Integration of stand-level vegetation with landscape metrics resulted in an improved ability to predict hare pellet densities. However, as stand-level vegetation was much more predictive of pellet densities than landscape variables, it is recommended that management focus on individual stand units to optimize the distribution of habitat capable of supporting high densities of snowshoe hares.
