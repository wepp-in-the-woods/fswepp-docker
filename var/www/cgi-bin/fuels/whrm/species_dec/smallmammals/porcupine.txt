Study Location: Utah Co., Utah
Habitat Description: TSHE, THPL, sitka spruce, annabilis fir
Summary: Tree species composition and size-class distribution were examined in relation to porcupine den selection. In this region, porcupines denned in areas with higher proportions of sitka spruce. Porcupines selected for spruce trees 15-19 cm dbh and against hemlock trees < 14.9 cm dbh when selecting winter den sites. By looking at preferred forage species, the authors assert that porcupines do not choose winter den sites based on forage availability. In this study, it appears that species composition was more important than size class in determining preferred habitat.

Study Location: northwestern Nevada
Habitat Description: sagebrush, saltbrush, bitterbrush, Utah juniper
Summary: To examine ecological and behavior strategies to reduce predation, this study tested whether habitat use varied with activity level and age class and whether increased nutritional stress led individuals to increase predation risk to avoid starvation. Compared to foraging animals, sleeping porcupines of all ages avoided high risk areas. Loss of body mass varied by habitat, with individuals foraging in open, high risk areas experiencing less mass loss than those foraging in low risk areas. Juveniles remained in low risk foraging areas, even when more risky habitats offered better quality forage. Sub-adults shifted to higher risk foraging areas as body condition deteriorated, but adults did not show this pattern.
