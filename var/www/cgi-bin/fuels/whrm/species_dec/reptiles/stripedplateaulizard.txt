Smith, Geoffrey R. 1996. Habitat use and fidelity in the striped plateau lizard Sceloporus virgatus. American Midland Naturalist. 135:68-80.

Study Location: Chiricahua Mountains, southeastern Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO/oak woodland
Summary: Habitat preferences and fidelity to habitats, slope, and substrate were examined for the striped plateau lizard. The substrates most commonly used by striped plateau lizards included rocks and logs; trees were never used. Most of the lizards were observed in woods habitat as opposed to rock slide habitat. Individuals tended to use one type of substrate, one type of habitat, and one slope in a given year. Substrate preference changed for individuals from year to year more often than it stayed the same, while habitat and slope remained constant. The author suggests that habitat and slope would be a more appropriate scale than substrate for considering potential differences in individuals.
