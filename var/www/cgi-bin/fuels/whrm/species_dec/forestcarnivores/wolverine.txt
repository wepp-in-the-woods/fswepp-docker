Distribution
range widespread through northern Canada and Alaska, south through British Columbia; patchy in Montana, Colorado, and central California
General Habitat
open forests at high elevations and in alpine areas; avoid lowland grass and shrub cover types as well as PIPO forests
Home or Activity Range
more than 24700 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
avoid lowland grass and shrub cover types as well as PIPO forests; open to moderate understory
Nestsite Characteristics
den in complex snow tunnels; alpine or subalpine habitats associated with tree roots, boulders, rock ledges; must have dependable deep snow; seldom den in low elevation, dense coniferous forest
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
summer: medium density/scattered mature forests at high elevation; winter: montane coniferous forest
Diet
No information available
Predators
wolves as well as other large mammalian predators, golden eagle
Shelter Habitats
No information available
Response to Disturbance
human disturbance at den sites resulted in den abandonment, but not kit abandonment;increased human presence as a result of management activities may have adverse effects on rare forest carnivores

Summaries of Specific Studies
Hahr, Meg. 2001. Winter distribution and habitat use of lynx, fisher, and wolverine in Glacier National Park, Montana. Missoula, MT: University of Montana. 97 p. M.S. Thesis.

Location of Study:  northwest Montana
Habitat Description: entire Glacier National Park; includes dry herbaceous, mesic herbaceous, deciduous trees and shrubs, dense mesic coniferous forest, open dry coniferous forest, barren rock, snow or ice
Summary: Lynx, fisher, and wolverine use of forest age classes and vegetative cover types was assessed in winter in Glacier National Park. Lynx use of deciduous and dry coniferous forest types was greater than expected while dry herb/shrub and mesic conifer cover types were used less than expected. Fisher used deciduous and dry coniferous forest types more than both shrub cover types. Wolverines used both conifer cover types less than expected while deciduous forest stands and dry herb/shrub were used significantly more than expected. Tracks of a variety of other carnivores, including marten, coyote, and mountain lion,  were also recorded. 

Magoun, Audrey J.; Copeland, Jeffrey P. 1998. Characteristics of wolverine reproductive den sites. Journal of Wildlife Management. 62(4) 1313-1320.

Location of Study:  northwestern AK and central ID
Habitat Description: AK: treeless tundra, alpine ridges; ID: various elevations of coniferous forest
Summary: Den sites of wolverines were described in Alaska and central Idaho. While most dens in Alaska were long, complex snow tunnels with no association to trees and boulders, dens in Idaho were always associated with fallen trees or boulders. All dens were covered in at least 1 m of snow. Wolverine dens described to date have all been located in alpine, subalpine, taiga, or tundra habitat. Dens in low elevation, densely forested habitat are rare. Den site selection may be influenced by thermoregulatory advantages, protection from predators, suitability of the site during the spring thaw, and location of rearing habitat.
