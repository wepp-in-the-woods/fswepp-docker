# Literature
Distribution
widespread across Alaska and Canada, south into coastal Washington, Oregon, and California, parts of central California, along Rocky Mountain chain south to New Mexico; parts of New England
General Habitat
mature, coniferous, mesic forests with complex structure
Home or Activity Range
250-6800 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
forests with several vertical layers of vegetation, mossy ground cover, full canopy cover in winter; high levels of CWD; may use logged forests in foraging, travelling, or dispersing
Nestsite Characteristics
may use squirrel middens associated with CWD as denning sites; use tree cavities, old stumps, rock piles; natal sites may be in a tree cavity or underground, while post-natal sites also include hollow logs and slash piles
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
encompasses a wide range of habitats that support a varied diet; in winter uses holes in snow created by CWD and the lower branches of small trees as subnivean access points for hunting prey; may cache food in a variety of structures including stumps, hollow logs, snags, or rock crevices
Diet
generalist predators: snowshoe hares, microtine rodents,  red squirrels, red-backed voles, mice, shrews, birds, eggs, fruits, berries, carrion
Predators
coyote, bobcat, fishers, mountain lions, northern goshawk, great-horned owl, other marten, foxes, golden eagle
Shelter Habitats
Thermal protection provided by canopy closure; in winter uses holes in snow created by CWD and the lower branches of small trees as subnivean access points for resting sites; summer dens in snags, stumps, logs, canopy of trees, willow clumps, brush, rock slides; Hiding cover provided by canopy closure, CWD, complex structure of understory vegetation; extremely important for young; resting sites include natural platforms created by broom rust or dwarf mistletoe
Response to Disturbance
little use is made of clearcuts and selective cuts, often for decades, populations decline after clearcut logging; preferred mesic habitats to burned areas or openings created by burns; avoided stands harvested for fuels reduction (Bull and Blumton 1999)

Study Location:  Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon
Habitat Description: PICO, ABLA, PSME, ABGR
Summary: Diet of American marten included mostly vole-sized prey,  but also squirrel-sized prey, insects, birds, plant material, and lagomorphs. A significantly higher proportion of vole-sized prey was taken in summer, while larger prey was taken in winter. Insects and plant material was more common in summer than winter. Females preyed on a higher proportion of shrews, while males preyed on a higher proportion of southern red-backed voles. Includes a detailed table (Table 1) of prey items and their frequency of occurrence.

Study Location:  Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon
Habitat Description: PICO, ABLA, PSME
Summary: Resting sites for American marten were located in trees with natural platforms, in trees with cavities, subnivean locations, in hollow logs or slash piles, and underground. Natal and post-natal dens were located in trees with cavities, in hollow logs, underground, or in slash piles. Resting and denning sites in cavities and hollow logs were typically large-diameter structures with heartwood decay. Natural platforms in trees were largely formed by broom rust and dwarf mistletoe. Retaining coarse woody debris and trees with brooms are management strategies that would address one component of the habitat needs of American marten.

Habitat Description: PICO, ABLA, PSME, ABGR
Summary: Home range and dispersal patterns were evaluated in northeastern Oregon. In general, home ranges were mutually exclusive for same-sex adults, while females and males often overlapped. Site fidelity was high. There was no significant relationship  between home range size and unharvested forest.

Summary: Movement patterns and habitat use by martens was studied in Glacier National Park. Adult animal locations were concentrated in mesic spruce types, while juveniles showed no concentration in any one type. All marten showed a preference for canopy cover above 17%. Daytime resting spots were located more often in trees than on the ground.

Habitat Description: Not stated 
Summary:  Literature review of basic marten ecology, includes information on distribution, population ecology, reproductive biology, food habits, home range, habitat relationships, and response to disturbance. The importance of mature, mesic coniferous forest is stressed, with an emphasis on the presence of coarse woody debris. The authors also point out that marten habitat use may vary based on age, sex, and season.

Study Location:  southern Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO (60%), PIEN, ABLA
Summary:  Marten subnivean access points were assessed for both structure and microhabitat features. Subnivean access sites were typically openings in the snow created by logs or stacks of logs at low snow depths and the lower branches of small live trees at greater snow depths. In LP stands, structural complexity of logs, rock cover, and number of snags around subnivean access points was higher than at random plots. Subnivean acces plots in PICO stands had less fully decayed CWD and fewer root masses than random plots. Management for winter marten habitat should include a consideration of CWD.

Location of Study:  northwest Montana
Habitat Description: entire Glacier National Park; includes dry herbaceous, mesic herbaceous, deciduous trees and shrubs, dense mesic coniferous forest, open dry coniferous forest, barren rock, snow or ice
Summary: Lynx, fisher, and wolverine use of forest age classes and vegetative cover types was assessed in winter in Glacier National Park. Lynx use of deciduous and dry coniferous forest types was greater than expected while dry herb/shrub and mesic conifer cover types were used less than expected. Fisher used deciduous and dry coniferous forest types more than both shrub cover types. Wolverines used both conifer cover types less than expected while deciduous forest stands and dry herb/shrub were used significantly more than expected. Tracks of a variety of other carnivores, including marten, coyote, and mountain lion,  were also recorded.

Study Location: Yosemite National Park, CA
Habitat Description: primarily PICO, also TSME, PIAL
Summary: This study focused on the specific winter habitat requirements and food habits of pine martens in Yosemite National Park. Marten hinting in this area regularly took place in PICO forest, but not adjacent meadow habitat. Travel points took place in all habitat types, but pause points only occurred in forests, ecotones, or on frozen streams. Marten activity took place where dense, low cover was present; open areas were avoided when travelling and were not used for hunting or resting. A detailed diet analysis was also performed.

Habitat Description:  4 types from hardwood to mixed to conifer
Summary: This report attempts to produce a habitat suitability model for marten based on the year-round suitability index of thermal and hiding cover from a variety of vegetative attributes using a 700 ha home range. The model's output assigns a suitability index value for cover habitat suitability to each 25 m pixel of forested habitat. Input data and results as predicted by model are not presented.

Study Location:  Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area, north-central Idaho
Habitat Description:  spruce-fir zone, also PICO
Summary: Martens and their prey were trapped in an area that had experienced wildfire at a wide range of times in the past. Marten preferred mesic habitat types (most often found in PIEN/ABLA stands) with canopy cover >30% and an overstory age greater than 100 years. Open meadows and burns were avoided by martens in the winter (greater snow depths), but may be used in summer and fall if they provide adequate cover and food. Microtine voles were the main prey item. Mesic forest types supported the greatest number of rodents and the greatest number of understory plant species. However, the authors assert that wildfire creates a mosaic of forest communities, including openings that support abundant insects, fruits, and ground squirrels that support marten in the summer. A diversity of forest types with a variety of fuel loads could promote smaller, cooler burning fires that would not result in a loss of marten habitat, as may be the case with large, stand-replacing fires.

Study Location:  Northen Sierra Nevada, California
Habitat Description:  PICO, Jeffrey Pine
Summary: Marten used a variety of structures as den sites, with snags used most often (23% of all sites). Deadwood dens, including snags, stumps, and logs, comprised 68% of all den sites. Marten appeared to be opportunistic in den selection, using the deadwood structure that was most common on the landscape most commonly as their den site. Snags would most likely be highly important den sites in areas where logging has not recently occurred, or in areas where stump and log densities are naturally low.

Habitat Description: PICO forest
Summary:  This case history (4) outlines the key habitat-wildlife relationships in the PICO forests of the central Oregon Pumice Zone. Areas of focus include the American marten and forest songbirds. The impact of salvage logging is discussed for some bird species.

Thompson, Ian D. 1994. Marten populations in uncut and logged boreal forests in Ontario. Journal of Wildlife Management. 51: 824-835.

Study Location:  Ontario (out of region)
Habitat Description: Unknown
Summary:  Marten demography was compared in uncut and logged boreal forest. Marten density, ages, production were higher in uncut forest, and daily natural and trapping mortality were lower than in logged forest. The author hypothesizes a preferences for uncut boreal forest because of a reduced predation risk.
