Distribution
from British Columbia south through western USA to central Mexico; some isolated eastern populations
General Habitat
habitat generalist; inhabits a range of habitat types including mesic PSME forest, arid juniper-limber pine, deserts, native prairie, riparian communites, coniferous forests, agricultural and coastal regions
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
cold caves or mine shafts for roosting
Nestsite Characteristics
maternal colony in mine near open ponderosa pine forest
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages in open areas, including sagebrush shrub-steppe and open PIPO woodlands with dense shrub cover; spends little time foraging in dense forest
Diet
primarily small moths; beetles, flies, wasps
Predators
Mexican spotted owl
Shelter Habitats
cold caves or mine shafts for roosting
Response to Disturbance
highly sensitive at winter hibernacula, summer nursery colonies and day and night roosting sites to disturbance from recreational use and vandalism (Perkins and Levesque 1987)
Sources of Information used in the Model

Study Location: Washington and Oregon

Summary: Review of the basic biology of bats inhabitating PSME forests of the Pacific Northwest, including a discussion of natural history, habitat requirements, and their ecological relations with old-growth forests.

Study Location: central Oregon
Habitat Description: PIPO, PICO
Summary: Townsend's big-eared bats were followed to investigate movement, foraging behavior, and roost use. Bats returned to the same foraging areas on successive nights but shifted foraging areas over large time scales as prey availability shifted. Foraging areas were largely open, including sagebrush-steppe habitat and open PIPO forest with dense shrub cover.  Bats moved as much as 24 km between roost sites. Little fidelity was seen in roosting sites. Many suitable daytime roosts were available and widely dispersed in locations with extensive lava-flow topography, which allowed bats to  move relatively large distances to locate foraging habitat. This pattern indicates that the area of habitat needed to manage this bat species is larger than what is indicated by locations of hibernacula and maternity caves.

Study Location: across Oregon
Habitat Description: state-wide; focused on caves mine shafts, and isolated water areas
Summary: This five-year study examined caves, mines, bridges, and buildings to determine important areas for winter hibernacula, summery nursery colonies, and day or night roosting sites. Many historic sites in Oregon had zero or greatly reduced numbers of bats. Habitat correlates other than the presence of caves or mine shafts are not given. Management recommendations are made for general species recovery and for specific areas where important hibernacula, nursery colonies, and roosting sites were found.

Study Location: southern Washington Cascades, Oregon Coast Range
Habitat Description: PSME-TSHE sere
Summary: Bats were examined in different-aged PSME stands. Bats were grouped by nesting strategy and by echolocation signal. Bat activity was higher in old-growth sites than in mature or young sites; these results suggest that bats are 3-10 times more abundant in the old-growth sites. The author attributes this pattern to roosting habitat, due to the availability of large-diameter snags in older forest. Foraging opportunities did not contribute to the observed pattern of bat abundance. Differences in sex-ratio, reproductive activity and age distribution were seen between the two regions. Reduction in old-growth forest would negatively impact bat populations, though the degree of impact may vary regionally.
