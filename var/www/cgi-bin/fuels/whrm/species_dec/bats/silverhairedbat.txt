Mexican spotted owl, hawks and falcons
Shelter Habitats
roosts in trees and snags, buildings; may overwinter in trees and beneath bark of older trees: winter roosts in caves, mine shafts, houses

Study Location: northeastern Oregon
Habitat Description: mosaic of pine and fir forests of various ages and species composition
Summary: Maternity roost sites were located for silver-haired and big brown bats in northeastern Oregon. Both species used large live and dead trees, though the big brown bat used larger trees than the silver-haired bat. Roost sites tended to be high, uncluttered, in no particular direction. Big brown bats tended to roost in more open sites, have larger maternity colonies, and move farther between roosts than the silver-haired bat. Silver-hair bats tended to stay within the same drainage. Both species used multiple roost sites, and multiple individuals were found at roost locations.

Study Location: Selkirk Mountains, northeastern Washington
Habitat Description: THPL, TSHE,  LAOC, ABGR, PICO, PIPO, PSME
Summary: Roosting habitat of silver-haired bats was examined. Roost trees were large and were usually snags in an advanced state of decay (mean dbh of 47 cm.). Roost trees were also taller than neighboring trees. Roost sites were often in PIPO and white pine snags, tree species that were not common across the landscape. Plots containing roosts exhibited significantly less canopy cover, shorter understory height, and less vegetative cover than random plots. These conditions would impede flight less and would allow a greater vertical space for young bats to practice flying. Finally, all roost sites were > 100m upslope from riparian areas. The authors suggest that the retention and recruitment of snags, and the protection of greater widths of riparian areas, are an important component of managing forests for bat conservation.

Study Location: southern Washington Cascades, Oregon Coast Range
Habitat Description: PSME-TSHE sere
Summary: Bats were examined in different-aged PSME stands. Bats were grouped by nesting strategy and by echolocation signal. Bat activity was higher in old-growth sites than in mature or young sites; these results suggest that bats are 3-10 times more abundant in the old-growth sites. The author attributes this pattern to roosting habitat, due to the availability of large-diameter snags in older forest. Foraging opportunities did not contribute to the observed pattern of bat abundance. Differences in sex-ratio, reproductive activity and age distribution were seen between the two regions. Reduction in old-growth forest would negatively impact bat populations, though the degree of impact may vary regionally.

Study Location: southern British Columbia
Habitat Description: not stated; includes aspen, PIPO, PSME, PICO, LAOC, ABGR, PIST, THPL
Summary: Summer roost-site selection was determined for silver-haired and big brown bats by radio-tracking reproductive females. Roost-sites for both species included natural hollows and cavities made by primary excavators. Both species used large trees that were uncluttered by surrounding trees relative to available trees in the immediate area of the roost, and in other areas of the same stand. Both species preferred aspen; big brown bats had a specific decay-stage preference but silver-haired bats had none. The only distinguishing feature of roost trees used by the different species was a preference of big brown bats for trees higher relative to the canopy than silver-haired bats. Managment recommendations are given.

Study Location: southern British Columbia
Habitat Description: variety: THPL, TSHE, PIEN, ABLA, PSME, PIPO, LAOC, aspen
Summary: Roost-site preferences were examined for four species of tree-roosting bats. Most roost sites were under tree bark, but woodpecker-made and natural cavities were also used. Roost entrances tended to be located beneath the canopy. Bats preferred tall trees associated with low percent canopy closure and a short distance to the nearest available tree. Roosts were switched frequently, with a low distance between roost sites. In this area, bats preferred to roost in western white pine, and to a lesser extent western larch and ponderosa pine.
