Rabe, Michael J.; Morrell, Thomas E.; Green, Heather; DeVos, James C. Jr.; Miller, C. Richard. 1998. Characteristics of ponderosa pine snag roosts used by reproductive bats in northern Arizona. Journal of Wildlife Management. 62(2): 612-621.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: primarily PIPO; also PSME, aspen, PIFL, ABCO
Summary: Eight species of bats roosted primarily in large-diameter PP snags with exfoliating bark. Forest surrounding roosts had higher tree densities, greater tree species diversity, and trees with larger basal area than random snag areas. Almost hlaf of the bats used more than one roost site. Snags in one study area were more likely to be located near water; snags in the other study area were less likely to be located within a harvested area. Snag retention and creation is especially important for bat species because of the short time period during which snags actually have exfoliating bark for bats to roost under.
