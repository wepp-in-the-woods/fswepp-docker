# Literature
Distribution
widespread on most of N. American continent
General Habitat
variety of forest types; proximity to waterbodies overriding factor
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
waterbodies for foraging, aspen trees with heartrot
Nestsite Characteristics
maternity colonies in warm areas such as buildings; can occur in tree cavities, especially primary-excavator cavities in aspen
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages over water surfaces
Diet
aquatic insects : primarily chironomids
Predators
small carnivores, raptorial birds, domestic cats, fish, bullfrogs, snakes
Shelter Habitats
summer colonies of buildings, caves, mines, trees, rock crevices, snags. Hibernates in caves and buildings chosen to protect from low temperatures and provide moisture level > 90%
Response to Disturbance
detections reduced after clearcutting (reviewed in Christy and West 1993)

Study Location: Saskatchewan
Habitat Description: PICO, PIGL, aspen
Summary: Roost sites of both male and female little brown bats were largely in aspen trees. The authors suggest that cavities in aspen are selected over conifers because an intact sapwood shell provides protection against harsh ambient conditions and predators, and provides a unique thermal microclimate. Multiple roosts were used by individuals. Variation in roost-site fidelity and differential use of torpor was observed in males.

Study Location: southern Washington Cascades, Oregon Coast Range
Habitat Description: PSME-TSHE sere
Summary: Bats were examined in different-aged PSME stands. Bats were grouped by nesting strategy and by echolocation signal. Bat activity was higher in old-growth sites than in mature or young sites; these results suggest that bats are 3-10 times more abundant in the old-growth sites. The author attributes this pattern to roosting habitat, due to the availability of large-diameter snags in older forest. Foraging opportunities did not contribute to the observed pattern of bat abundance. Differences in sex-ratio, reproductive activity and age distribution were seen between the two regions. Reduction in old-growth forest would negatively impact bat populations, though the degree of impact may vary regionally.
