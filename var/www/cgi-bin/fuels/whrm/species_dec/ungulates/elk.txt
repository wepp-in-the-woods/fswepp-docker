Response to Disturbance
clearcuts received greatest use in spring, early summer, and late fall, though they were used in proportion to their availability (Hershey and Leege 1982); when using clearcuts, elk selected for areas where slash was removed by broadcast burning and areas within 92 m of timber (Hershey and Leege 1982); two collared elk did not shift activity centers in response to low-intensity clearcuts, overstory removal of seed tree cuts 1-3 km away (Hershey and Leege 1982); one collared elk shifted her activity center in response to a high intensity timber harvest within her summer activity range (Hershey and Leege 1982); elk use of clearcuts is largely determined by the size and age of the opening as well as the amount of slash and down timber in and around the opening (Lyon 1976); elk used clearcuts less than 10 years old in proportion to their availability, but avoided cuts older than 10 years (Hershey and Leege 1976); clearcuts > 81 ha were preferred, and the majority of elk sitings in clearcuts occurred near a timbered edge (Hershey and Leege 1976); elk showed a clear avoidance of areas with roads (Hershey and Leege 1976)

Habitat Description:  elk and mule deer range
Summary: The consequences of timber management decisions on potential mule deer and elk habitat use are developed, using a model that integrates a ratio of cover and forage areas. Optimum habitat is described as a ratio of 40% cover and 60% forage. Particular requirements for birthing, hiding, and thermal cover are given. Habitat for mule deer and elk can be enhanced by considering travel lanes, road construction, shaded or other fuel breaks, and timber management operations.

Summary:  Elk summer habitat was evaluated in the Garnet Mountains of Montana. The most important habitat variables were slope, the amount of foraging area within 200 m of location, and distance to open roads and human disturbance. However, site-specific characteristics were not apparent because elk made use of a broad range of available habitats, and if microsite preferences were noted, they were apparently only important in specific months. Evaluating habitat needs for specific life history traits, such as bedding or feeding, is needed to understand specific, fine-scale habitat associations.

Habitat Description:  variety
Summary:  Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Summary: Elk in their summer range in Idaho showed a selection against using clearcuts. Elk used clearcuts less than 10 years old in proportion to their availability, but avoided cuts older than 10 years. Clearcuts > 81 ha were preferred, and the majority of elk sitings in clearcuts occurred near a timbered edge. Elk use of clearcuts was highest in the "green-up" periods of July and November. The authors attribute use of clearcuts to available forage and a warmer thermal environment in the spring. Elk showed a clear avoidance of areas with roads. However, it did not appear that elk moved away from low-intensity, short-term logging disturbance.

Summary:  Seasonal elk movements, distribution, and habitat preferences were investigated in north-central Idaho. Migrations were correlated with snow conditions and temperature. Cow elk showed a strong fidelity for summer and winter areas, while bulls did not. Elk did not use habitat types in their activity areas selectively, as habitat composition was largely homogenous. However, elk used dense (>70% crown coverage) timber cover types more than other cover types in all seasons. Late summer and early fall habitat was characterized as old-growth, grand fir, poorly drained, moist and cool land types. Clearcuts received greatest use in spring, early summer, and late fall, though they were used in proportion to their availability. When using clearcuts, elk selected for areas where slash was removed by broadcast burning and areas within 92 m of timber. The reactions of a few elk to local timber harvests were evaluated. Elk were easily displaced by human activities including logging, hunting, and motor vehicle presence.

Habitat Description:  Thuja-Tsuga zone; includes TSHE, ABGR, TSME, ABLA, PIEN, PSME, PIMO
Summary:  Home range use and habitat selection of non-migratory elk were studied. In the spring, elk preferred grass-shrub and seral shrub successional stages for feeding and tall seral brushfields or pole-timber stands for resting. In summer, elk fed inclear-cuts and seral shrub communities and rested within pole-timber stands on ridges. Elk shifted to pole-timber communities on mesic slopes in the fall. There was no significant habitat preferences found for winter range. Overall, elk preferred to rest in areas > 400 m from roads. Home ranges were more related to forage production than thermal and hiding cover. The authors recommend a mosaic of forest successional stages, including clearcuts and adjacent mature forest, to provide optimal elk habitat.

Summary:  Hiding cover and forage for elk on their winter range was evaluated following prescribed burning. Hiding cover dropped immediately post-burn but returned to pre-fire levels within 25-30 years. Hiding cover in unburned areas was 52%, whereas mean treatment hiding cover was 16%. Winter range forage species (primarily grasses) increased after the burn and remained elevated for approximately 15 years. The mean percentage cover of highly preferred grasses was 15% on control plots and 22% on treated plots. The small scale of these prescribed burns renders the loss of hiding cover less of an issue, as dense forested areas are common in the lanscape. Larger-scale burns may have more of a negative impact on elk winter range.

Habitat Description:  not stated
Summary: Elk use of clearcuts is largely determined by the size and age of the opening as well as the amount of slash and down timber in and around the opening. Elk presence increases with vegetation height in the openings until the vegetation reaches about 1.2 m in height. However, this relationship is diminished when opening size exceeds 40 ha, slash exceeds 0.5 m in height, and dead and down timber materially exceeds 0.5 m. The author  suggests that small, 4-16 ha clearcuts with good slash clean-up provide the most acceptable summer habitat. Where adjacent forest is clear of understory debris, openings up to 40 ha may be acceptable. Smaller openings are still preferred, though use will remain low until vegetation reaches 0.6-1m in height.

Habitat Description:  not stated
Summary: Pellets of elk and combined mule and white-tailed deer were examined in and adjacent to clearcuts. Pellet distributions suggest that animals enter clear-cut openings in search of high quality and quantity forage, though require security in the form of cover in these areas. Elk and deer both preferred openings with cover except where such cover inhibiting forage growth. Both preferred openings where logging slash was not a barrier to movement. Predictive models for elk in use of clearcuts in western Montana included vegetation height within the opening (+, largely shrubs), depth of dead and down timber in adjacent forest, slash depth within opening, and area of the opening. Models for elk in eastern Montana included elevation of opening, cover quality of the uncut adjacent forest, vegetation height inside the opening (-, largely PICO seedlings), and vehicle access. Elk preferred smaller openings than deer, but were more tolerant of large openings. Open roads and inadequate cover severely depressed elk use of clearcuts.

Location of Study:  Custer State Park, South Dakota
Habitat Description:  PIPO forest, deciduous woodland, prairie grassland
Summary:  Elk summer diurnal bed sites were evaluated for habitat characteristics. Overstory canopy closure, number and basal area of trees, litter and ground cover were greater at bed sites than random points. Northern aspects were also selected for. The authors attribute the observed patterns to the thermoregulatory benefits offered by the habitat characteristics. Although part of the study area was affected by wildfire 3-7 years previously, this disturbance was not considered for this analysis.

Summary: Review of the interactions between wildlife and aspen in Rocky Mountain National Park. Focuses on wildlife that impact aspen stands in such a way that promotes fungal infection (such as elk and sapsuckers) or alter aspen structurally and prevent reproductive growth (mule deer). Wildlife is treated as a threat to the viability of aspen stands in the region. Largely anecdotal.

Location of Study:  Glacier National Park, Montana
Habitat Description:  Eight veg. types:grasslands, spruce forests, wash/cottonwood, PICO savanna, PSME, PICO/ABLA, willow/sedge, aspen 
Summary:  The seasonal habitat preferences of moose, elk, and white-tailed deer were examined in Glacier National Park. Each species showed significant preferences that shifted through the season. In the winter, elk preferred PICO savanna and spruce forest, mule deer preferred DF and spruce forest, and moose preferred aspen, willow/sedge, and spruce forest. In spring and fall, elk and deer preferred the grassland complex. The reliance of all species on spruce forest in winter was related to the ability of spruce to intercept snow and to provide better cover. Snow depth was the key factor determining habitat partitioning in the winter. Whereas all species preferred spruce stands, they were rarely found together in them. Wildfire was judged to be largely responsible for some of the preferred habitat types, including the open lodgepole savanna and aspen stands. The absence of fire in the system has been mediated by other habitat-altering disturbance, namely the flooding of the North Fork River. Food habits are given for the three cervids. Dietary overlap occurred between elk and the other two species. Spring feed was primarily grasses for elk, forbs for white-tailed deer, and browse for moose.

Study Location: eastern Cascades, Washington
Habitat Description: overmature PICO-ABLA stand, mature PICO thicket
Summary: One year after a prescribed, stand-replacing fire, plant cover and diversity decreased, as did microbial respiriation. Nitrogen fixation and nitrification increased after burning. Overall bird diversity increased after the fire. Diversity of woodpeckers increased the year after burning, while needle-foraging species declined or were absent after fire. There was no definitive response of small mammals to burning, though the Townsend's chipmunk did markedly decline. Forage for elk in the burn was higher in crude protein, but low productivity and distance from water diminished the value of the burned area for elk.
