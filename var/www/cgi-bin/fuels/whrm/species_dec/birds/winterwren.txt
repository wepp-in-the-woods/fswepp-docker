Distribution
year-round resident along Pacific coast; breeds in band across central Canada, New England, south from British Columbia into parts of Washington, Idaho and Montana; winters in south and southeastern USA
General Habitat
nests in dense brush, especially along stream banks, in moist coniferous forests; in winter may be in any type of woodland
Home or Activity Range
0.1-2 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
large trees, >70% canopy cover, litter, logs, respond negatively to edge; prefer homogenous landscapes
Nestsite Characteristics
cavity nester in snags, downed wood, stumps; needs lots of litter; nests in dense brush, especially along stream banks, in moist coniferous forests
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages on ground, downed wood, and in shrubs and other understory vegetation
Diet
PSME seed; insects and spiders make up the bulk of their diet, rarely take berries during winter
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
greater abundance in cut-over forest (Hagar 1960); less abundant in low shrub-stage clearcuts and partial cuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); not found in stands burned by stand-replacement wildfire, found in unburned controls (Kreisel and Stein 1999)
Sources of Information used in the Model

General Sources of Background Information
Hagar 1960, Verner 1980, Zarnowitz and Manuwal 1985, Hejl et al. 1995, reviewed in Hagar et al. 1995, National Geographic Society 1996, Kreisel and Stein 1999, reviewed in O'Neil et al. 2001

Study Location: inner coast ranges of northwestern California
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Bird species were surveyed in cutover areas of PSME forest as well as virgin forest. Bird species are identified that prefer cutover forest, intact forest, or occur in both. Accounts of habitat preferences are given for several bird species, including detailed dietary information.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: northeast Washington
Habitat Description: mixed conifer, includes: PSME, PIPO, ABLA, PIEN, LAOC, PICO
Summary: This study examined bird use of burned and unburned forest in the winter season. Species richness was similar, but composition was distinctly different. Composition and abundance also changed with time; some species disappeared from the area while others moved in. Trunk and branch foraging species were more abundant in burned forest, though their abundance significantly decreased from the first to the fourth winter post-fire. Foraging behavior was documented for four woodpecker species within the burned area. Foraging took place on snags > 23 cm dbh.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.

Study Location: Olympic National Forest, northwest Washington
Habitat Description: THPL-PSME zone
Summary: Breeding populations of cavity-nesting birds were examined across four forest successional stages with varying snag densities. Species richness, diversity, and density increased with snag density. Nest site preferences for some species are given. Overall, larger taller snags with broken tops were preferred by cavity nesters. Management recommendations are made, including a minimum number of hard and soft snags per hectare, and size and species suggestions.
