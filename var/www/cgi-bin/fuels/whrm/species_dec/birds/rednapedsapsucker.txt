Diet
Strong excavator; sapsucker, gleans insects; ants,.beetles and wasps, fruits of some deciduous shrubs and trees
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
roosts in snags and aspen trees
Response to Disturbance
more numerous on overstory removal sites (Franzreb 1978); less abundant in low shrub-stage clearcuts and more abundant in high shrub- and pole-stage clearcuts and partial cuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995)

Study Location: Colorado and Wyoming
Habitat Description: aspen and mixed conifer by site, includes PIPO, PSME, PICO, PIFL, ABCO, PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Nest site selection by Williamson's and red-naped sapsuckers was examined. Though a variety of conifer species were present, both species showed a strong selection for aspen as nesting trees. The majority of these aspen were infected with a shelf fungus. Both species nested in trees averaging approximately 23 cm in diameter. In areas where aspen was not available, the Williamson's sapsucker used pine trees averaging 51 cm in diameter. The size and density of aspen stands was also important.

Study Location: Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO, PIST, PSME, aspen, ABCO, PIEN
Summary: Tree species preferences were analyzed for 5 species of birds on logged and unlogged forest. Niche widths and bird densities are given for the individual species. In unlogged forest, the entire avifauna indicated preferences for PSME, ABCO, and PIEN. PIPO, PIST, and snags were not used to the extent to which they were available. In the logged area, avian use of aspen, PIPO, and PIST was less than expected, while PSME and PIEN were preferred. Overall, the unaltered sites supported a considerably larger avian community. The mountain chickadee, ruby-crowned kinglet, and yellow-rumped warbler were more numerous on unlogged sites, while the yellow-bellied sapsucker and the gray-headed junco were more numerous on logged sites. The brown creeper was entirely missing from logged sites.

Study Location: south-central British Columbia
Habitat Description: primarily PSME, also aspen, paper birch, hybrid spruce, PIPO
Summary: Nests of primary cavity nesters were located in primarily PSME forests in south-cnetral British Columbia. Heartwood decay was the most important factor in nest tree selection by primary cavity-nesting birds. Strong excavators preferred to nest in aspen with heartwood decay, while weak excavators preferred dead trees or dead tops of live trees. Overall, primary cavity-nesters selected larger diameter classes of trees. Piliated woodpeckers and yellow-bellied sapsuckers showed preferences for specific diameter nest trees, while other species did not. Average selected tree diameter was lower for many species compared to other studies, suggested that regional variability in tree size may influence tree selection, and that patterns of nest selection may depend on local conditions.

Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: central Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO, ABCO, PSME, PIST, aspen, Gambel oak
Summary: Habitat features for successful and unsuccessful nest sites, nest sites vs. random sites, and differences among coexisting species of cavity nesting birds were identified. Species-specific characteristics are presented both for nest site and nest tree; birds differed in some of their habitat preferences. Aspen (mostly dead) were a preferred nesting species and were common in foraging patches, despite their low density in the study area. High density of aspen provides both more nesting sites and protects nests from predation, as predators have to search more sites to find nests. Foraging areas also had more conifers and fewer deciduous trees (other than aspen) than random areas. Preference for conifers is attributed to increased foraging opportunities.Failed nests were surrounded by denser foliage and were closer to conifers. Reduced nest success was also linked to lower nest height. Nonexcavating species had lower nesting success than excavator species.

Study Location: South Dakota
Habitat Description: PIPO, aspen/birch
Summary: Habitat relations of breeding songbirds were examined in PIPO and aspen/birch forests at three scales: in two vegetation types, structural stages within vegetation types, and vegetative structure. Species richness was greater in the aspen/birch forest type, which the authors attribute to greater invertebrate food resources. A number of species differed depending on overstory canopy closure. A few species were associated with snag presence.

Study Location: southwestern Montana
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Avian species composition and abundance were examined in old-growth, mature, and harvested PSME forest. The greatest total abundance was detected in the old-growth forest. In general, the old-growth contained the greatest number of species, though there was no detected difference in species richness between the stand types. Higher elevation old-growth stands contained a greater abundance of birds than the lower eleveation old-growth stands. Trees with cavities were also examined in this study. The majority of cavity trees were old PSME with broken tops, and cavities tended to be located in the top one-third of the tree. Some primary and secondary cavity-nesting birds demonstrated dbh preferences for nest trees.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: PSME, LAOC, PICO, PIEN, PIPO, ABLA, ABGR, THPL, PIMO, aspen, birch
Summary: A comparison of bird communities was performed between control sites and those undergoing traditional overstory removal harvests and those harvested using "New Forestry" techniques. Only four species showed significant differences in abundance between treatments, though the author suspects that other trends in the data would be clearer with additional post-treatment data. In general, for species that did differ in abundance, numbers in New Forestry stands were intermediate between overstory removal and controls. Foliage foragers declined similarly in both harvest types, while ground foragers increased. Conifer nesters decreased similarly in both harvest types, while ground nesters increased. Important habitat variables for a number of species are given.

Study Location: Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado
Habitat Description: Aspen, PICO, ABLA, PIEN
Summary: Review of the interactions between wildlife and aspen in Rocky Mountain National Park. Focuses on wildlife that impact aspen stands in such a way that promotes fungal infection (such as elk and sapsuckers) or alter aspen structurally and prevent reproductive growth (mule deer). Wildlife is treated as a threat to the viability of aspen stands in the region. Largely anecdotal.

Study Location: southwestern Idaho
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME
Summary: Cavity nesting birds were grouped as strong, weak or non-excavating species. Patterns of cavity occupancy were tied to various microhabitat features as well as temporal and spatial scales. Time since fire had the greatest influence on occupancy of nest cavities for all species; site characteristics were secondarily important. Preffered snag characteristics differed by type of excavator and changed over time. The majority of cavities (80%) were not reused. Both number of cavities and number of cavity-nesting birds increased with time since fire. The authors stress the ephemeral nature of fire-created habitat.

Habitat Description: ABGR
Summary: This case history (1) evaluates bird-habitat relationships in primarily grand fir forests. The goals of this study were to assess how forest stand structure influences habitat selection by birds, to investigate bird use of specific forest structural classes, and to relate bird habitat use to potential management options that consider breeding bird habitat.

Study Location: northwest Montana
Habitat Description: LAOC cover type; includes ABLA, LAOC, PSME, PIEN, PICO, BEPA, aspen, cottonwood
Summary: Ten species of birds differed in abundance between stands with seed tree removal and adjacent uncut forest. Foliage-foraging species and tree gleaners were less abundant in harvested areas, while flycatching species and ground foragers were more common there (Same information as contained in Tobalske et al. 1991). The success of red-nape sapsucker fledging was positively associated with the percent of home territory logged and the number of birch and aspen 10-30 cm dbh within the home territory. Thus it appears that retaining potential nesting trees in logged areas does not create an ecological sink for red-naped sapsuckers. Negative correlates of fledging success included the number of birch as aspen > 30 cm dbh, canopy height, percent home territory burned, and number of snags > 30 cm dbh.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.

Study Location: Olympic National Forest, northwest Washington
Habitat Description: THPL-PSME zone
Summary: Breeding populations of cavity-nesting birds were examined across four forest successional stages with varying snag densities. Species richness, diversity, and density increased with snag density. Nest site preferences for some species are given. Overall, larger taller snags with broken tops were preferred by cavity nesters. Management recommendations are made, including a minimum number of hard and soft snags per hectare, and size and species suggestions.
