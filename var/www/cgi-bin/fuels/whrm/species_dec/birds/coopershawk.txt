Diet
90% of their diet consist of birds and 10%of small mammals: Turdus migratorius, Cyanocitta auratus, Colaptes aruatus, Sturnus vulgaris, Tamias, Eutamias, ring necked pheasants (Phasiacus colchicus), Bonasa umbellus, Sciurus cardinensis, Colinus virginianus, Peromyscus spp, Ixobrychus exilis, Sciurus, Tamiasciurus, Corvus brachyrhonchos, Agelaius, Quiscalus, Molothrus, Sturnella, Passer domesticus, Junco hyremalis, Tadarida,  Ammospermophilus spermophilus
Predators
Great-horned owl, northern goshawk
Shelter Habitats
dense trees, high canopy closure for predator avoidance
Response to Disturbance
less abundant in low shrub-stage clearcuts and partially cut forest compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995)

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: northeastern Oregon
Habitat Description: PIPO, PICO, ABGR, ABLA, LAOC
Summary: Habitat data were collected around northern goshawk, sharp-shinned hawk and Cooper's hawk nest sites. Cooper's and sharp-shinned hawks commonly nested in younger successional stages than the goshawk, preferring high density of foliage in layers from 3-15 m. Cooper's hawks preferred northern aspects and often used mistletoe growth as a nest platform, which may explain their preference for PSME. Goshawks preferred nesting in PSME and LAOC and sometimes used snags. All species avoided PICO. All three species had high canopy coverage over nest sites (88.1-97.9%).

Study Location: western and eastern Oregon
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: Nest sites of the three accipiter species had similar physiographic but dissimilar vegetative structures. Most nests were on moderate slopes with northerly exposures and were near quiet ephemeral streams or ponds, with nest trees located on the lower portions of the slope near the water. Most nest sites had high canopy closure and tree density. The major difference between accipiter species was related to stand age, with the sharp-shinned hawks preferring 25-50 year old stands, Cooper's hawks preferring 30-70 year old stands, and goshawks preferring >150 year old stands for nesting. Goshawks demonstrated much higher and longer nest fidelity than the other two species. Home ranges for the three species were also documented. The author states that management for these three accipiter species needs to include not only potential nest sites but the stands surrounding them, including upslope habitat and riparian areas if they are present. Sites should not be isolated by silvicultural treatments. Nesting habitat for the two smaller accipiters is temporally unstable, as these species use younger stands that change quickly through time. Therefore, the suitability of some areas as accipiter habitat may not be long-term, or may progress from the preferred habitat of one species to that of another. The author outlines specific densities of nesting sites.
