Specific Habitat Preferences
stands with short trees and open canopies; pole-medium sized trees, 0-39% canopy cover, shrubby areas; respond positively to edge
Nestsite Characteristics
nests in mid and understory; nest sites positively associated with seedling cover;  Sallabanks et al. (2003) found canopy closure and number of saplings positively associated with nest sites, while Mannan and Meslow (1984) found this relationship negative

Diet
Insects are important during summer, and include beetles, leafhoppers, caterpillars, grasshoppers, true bugs, ants, and wasps. Seeds of grasses and forbs.
Predators
No information available
Shelter Habitats
use dense small trees for cover
Response to Disturbance
responded postively to single-tree selective logging (Medin and Booth 1989); would respond positively to silvicultural treatments that open the forest canopy (Sallabanks et al. 2003); increased one year post-prescribed burn (Bock and Bock 1983); more abundant on logged plots  (Szaro and Balda 1986); more abundant in forests 10-40 years post-burn (Hutto 1995); common in logged stands and interspersed, unlogged forest, but were relatively rare in contiguous old growth (Tobalske et al. 1991); more abundant on managed vs. old growth stands (Mannan and Meslow 1984); attracted to areas clearcut 17 and 37 years previously (Austin and Perry 1979); more abundant in low shrub-, high shrub-, and pole-stage clearcuts and partial cuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); highest density on irregular strip plots, absent from clearcuts (Szaro and Balda 1979)

Study Location: Uinta Mountains, Utah
Habitat Description: PICO as main overstory tree; also includes PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Birds were censused in wet and dry meadows, mature and stagnated PICO stands, and regenerating PICO stands (17 and 37 years post-clearcut). The richest avifauna was found in the dry meadows. While a few birds were adversly affected by the clearcutting, many individual species were more numerous in the clearcuts, and the overall number of species was similar.

Study Location: central Sierra Nevada
Habitat Description: mixed conifer (PIJE, PICO, ABCO, CADE) and ABMA stands
Summary: Bird communities in open- and closed-canopy stands in two forest types were compared. Closed-canopy forest had lower bird densities, diversities, species richness, and consuming biomasses than open-canopy forests in both vegetative zones. With the exception of hummingbirds, all feeding guilds were present on each transect, though the reduction in understory vegetation and forest clearings in closed-canopy forest caused pronounced decreases in three understory guilds as well as in the flycatchers.

Bock, Carl E.; Bock, Jane H. 1983. Responses of birds and deer mice to prescribed burning in ponderosa pine. Journal of Wildlife Management. 47(3): 836-840.

Study Location: Black Hills, South Dakota
Habitat Description: PIPO, pine-grassland savannah
Summary: Bird and deer mouse abundance was examined 1 and 2 years post-prescribed fire. Bird species composition was similar between burned and control plots. However, 7 bird species (American robin, Mountain bluebird, Solitary vireo, Yellow-rumped warbler, Western tanager, Dark-eyed junco, Chipping sparrow) were more abundant on burned plots the first year post-fire. In the second year post-fire, only one species was more abundant on the burns (Vesper sparrow), while 2 were more common on the controls (American robin, red-breasted nuthatch). Deer mice were similarly more abundant on burned plots the first year post-fire, but were not so the second year. The major difference in vegetation post-fire was the reduction of litter and small pines in the burned areas. The authors attribute the observed patterns of wildlife abundance to a temporary increase in the quantity or quality of local food supply as opposed to the documented changes in vegetative structure.

Bosma, Andrew. 1993. Foraging site selection by insectivorous forest brids in western Montana. Missoula, MT: University of Montana. 76 p. M.A.Thesis.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME
Summary: Foraging habitat was described for four species of insectivorous birds (gray jay, westen tanager, yellow-rumped warbler, chipping sparrow), including foraging tree species, dbh, and estimated insect frass. The influence of potential competitors was also examined. Foraging site selection for all birds but the gray jay was most influenced by tree species (PIPO selected), which the author attributes to a greater abundance of food. Competitor presence did not clearly influence selection. Birds also selected large trees. Annual variation existed in foraging habitat patterns.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: western Montana and northern Wyoming
Habitat Description: range of habitat types: includes PIPO, PSME, LAOC, PICO, PIAL, PIFL, Picea sp,, ABLA, ABGR, THPL, aspen, cottonwood
Summary: Fifteen bird species are generally more abundant in early post-fire communities than in any other cover type in the northern Rockies (includes olive-sided flycatcher, three-toed woodpecker, black-backed woodpecker, Clark's nutcracker, mountain bluebird, red crossbill, Cassin's finch, pine siskin, American robin, dark-eyed junco, yellow-rumped warbler). Six species (common nighthawk, calliope hummingbird, northern flicker, Stellar's jay, orange-crowned warbler, chipping sparrow) were most abundant in stands 10-40 years post-fire. Three species (American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, dark-eyed junco) were detected in early an mid-successional burned forest 100% of the time. One species, the black-backed woodpecker, was restricted to standing dead forest created by stand-replacing fires. Bird communities are different in recently burned forest, primarily because members of three feeding guilds (woodpeckers, flycatchers, and seedeaters) are especially abundant. Larger-diameter (>10 cm dbh) PP, DF, and LAOC were most often used for feeding by woodpeckers. Standing, fire-killed trees were used by the majority of birds nesting in recently burned forest. Many of the structures used in nesting (broken-topped snags) were present before the fire. Large-scale, stand-replacing fire may be necessary for long-term maintenance of many bird populations. Commentary is offered on the need to alter present fire and post-fire forest management.

Mannan, R. William; Meslow, E.Charles. 1984. Bird populations and vegetation characteristics in managed and old-growth forests, northeastern Oregon. Journal of Wildlife Management. 48:1219-1238.

Study Location: northeastern Oregon
Habitat Description: ABGR zone, includes PIPO, PSME, LAOC, PICO, ABGR
Summary: Bird communities and vegetation differences were examined in managed and old-growth stands. Three variables, including large snags, large trees, and understory tree components, appeared to be responsible for the higher abundance of some species in old growth forest. Species more abundant in managed forest appeared to be attracted to the open structure of managed stands. Managed forest supported more breeding birds, due largely to the abundance of a few species.

Study Location: Idaho
Habitat Description: PSME, PIPO
Summary: Populations of birds and small mammals were monitored in conjunction with a single-tree selection logging operation. Total numbers of breeding birds remained relatively stable, but some individual species responded either positively or negatively to the treatment. Timber gleaners were the only feeding guild adversely affected by the logging treatment. Secondary cavity nesters were the only nesting guild adversely affected by the logging treatment. The most notable small mammal response was the positive response of yellow-pine chipmunks to the treatment. Fewer deer mice were found in the treatment area.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: PSME, LAOC, PICO, PIEN, PIPO, ABLA, ABGR, THPL, PIMO, aspen, birch
Summary: A comparison of bird communities was performed between control sites and those undergoing traditional overstory removal harvests and those harvested using "New Forestry" techniques. Only four species showed significant differences in abundance between treatments, though the author suspects that other trends in the data would be clearer with additional post-treatment data. In general, for species that did differ in abundance, numbers in New Forestry stands were intermediate between overstory removal and controls. Foliage foragers declined similarly in both harvest types, while ground foragers increased. Conifer nesters decreased similarly in both harvest types, while ground nesters increased. Important habitat variables for a number of species are given.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Bird species diversity and species richness were not significantly affected by forest cutting and logging except in a clearcut treatment. Bird population densitities significantly increased on silvilculturally cut and irregular strip shelterwood plots and significantly decreased  on the severely thinned and clearcut plots. Impact on individual species is discussed.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Seasonal avian communities were examined for their response to weather condition and treatment (logging) effects. While birds responded to climate, most notably precipitation, treatment effects appeared to be more influential. Species preferring open habitat (rock wren, American robin, western wood pe-wee and western bluebird) were highest on medium and heavy cut stands. Treated stands also had the highest abundance of chipping sparrows, broad-tailed hummingbirds, Grace's warbler, and dark-eyed juncos. Species preferring dense foliage (western flycatcher, pygmy nuthatch, red-faced warbler, hermit thrush, black-headed grosbeak) were less abundant in modified habitats.

Study Location: northwestern Montana
Habitat Description: LAOC cover type; includes ABLA, LAOC, PSME, PIEN, PICO, BEPA, aspen, cottonwood
Summary: Populations of 10 breeding bird species were monitored in harvested and immediately adjacent uncut areas. A number of species were more abundant in harvested areas. Responses by feeding and nesting guilds are also included. Foliage-foraging species and tree gleaners wre less abundant in harvested areas, while flycatching and ground foragers were more common there. Conifer tree-nesting species were least abundant in clearcuts, while ground nesters were more common within the cutover habitats.Management recommendations are made, including the retention of broadleaf trees within cutting units and investigating the importance of slash piles in logged habitat. Slash piles were used by winter wrens, Townsend's solitaires, and dark-eyed juncos as perches, food sources, or nest sites.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.
