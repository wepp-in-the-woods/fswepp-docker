Distribution
Pacific coastal states, British Columbia
General Habitat
late seral stage forest
Home or Activity Range
1300-15000 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
large trees, >70% canopy cover, multiple canopy layers and heterogenous structure
Nestsite Characteristics
nests in hollow tree, cave, or crevice; prefers areas with large diameter trees, high levels of canopy cover, high canopy
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
dense forest; lack of hardwood understory:"other trees" in foraging habitat in the model are tanoaks (Sakai and Noon 1993)
Diet
northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) are the predominant diet item by biomass and frequency in Washington, and in the Coast and Cascade Ranges of Oregon. Dusky-footed woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes) predominate in southwestern Oregon and northwestern CA
Predators
great-horned owls, northern goshawks
Shelter Habitats
roosts in dense cover during the day
Response to Disturbance
reproductive success lower in recently clearcut stands (Thome et al. 1999)
Sources of Information used in the Model
Verner 1980, Sakai and Noon 1993
General Sources of Background Information

Ripple, William J.; Lattin, Peter D.; Hershey, K.T.; Wagner, Frank F.; Meslow, E. Charles 1997. Landscape composition and pattern around northern spotted owl nest sites in southwest Oregon. Journal of Wildlife Management. 61:151-158.

Study Location: southwestern Oregon
Habitat Description: Mixed Evergreen Zone (PSME, LIDE, PIPO, PILA, variety of deciduous hardwood species), Mixed Conifer Zone (PSME, PIPO, PILA, LIDE, ABCO), White Fir Zone (ABCO, PSME)
Summary: The landscape composition and pattern surrounding northern spotted owl nest sites were examined in southwest Oregon. Nest sites contained significantly more old-conifer forest than random sites. Conclusions regarding landscape pattern variables were not possible because these variables were highly correlated with the amount of old-conifer forest. Inference is limited due to the small number of nest sites.

Study Location: Northwestern California
Habitat Description: PSME-tanoak
Summary: Dusky-footed woodrat abundance was examined in five seral stages of PSME-tanoak forest in northwestern CA. Nest densities were highest in sapling/brushy poletimber stands, followed by seedling/shrub and large old-growth stands. The authors propose that sapling/brushy poletimber stands adjacent to mature and old-growth PSME forest are source areas for woodrats that may be prey items of northern spotted owls.

Study Location: Northwestern California
Habitat Description: young-growth SESE, SESE-PSME, PSME-oak
Summary: Spotted owls on young-growth timberlands were positively associated with stands characterized by middle-aged and larger trees and negatively associated with stands that were younger and comprised of smaller trees. However, reproductive success was highest in intermediate-aged stands (21-40 years old), stands that did not exhibit the highest tree basal area. The authors attribute this pattern to the availability of woodrats as a prey item. Reproductive success was lowest in recent clearcuts. The authors advocate restricting clearcuts from areas where spotted owls nest, and maintaining a high residual tree density. The authors caution that their results and suggestions only apply to north-coastal California forests managed with clear-cut silvicultural practices, as conditions here are very different from other area's within the owl's range.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.
