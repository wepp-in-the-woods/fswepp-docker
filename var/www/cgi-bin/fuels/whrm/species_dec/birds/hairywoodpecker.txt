Response to Disturbance
favored 1-2 years post-fire due to abundant snags, wood and insects (Johnson and Wauer 1996); disfavored 2-4 years post-fire as snags fall, wood insects decline (Johnson and Wauer 1996); more abundant in salvage logged LP than reference stands (reviewed in Sallabanks et al. 2003); lower mean detection rate and % occurrence in clearcuts without snags (Marcot 1983); more abundant in early post-fire conditions (Taylor and Barmore 1980); greater abundance in cut-over forest; more abundant on burned PIPO sites (Blake 1982);  most abundant in 27 year-old clearcut vs. mature forest, younger clearcut and meadow types (Austin and Perry 1979); less abundant in low shrub- and high shrub-stage clearcuts and partially cut forest and more abundant in pole-stage clearcuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); more successful n esting in unlogged vs. salvage logged forest 2-4 years after high-intensity wildfire (Saab and Dudley 1998); recorded more consistently in thinned and burned PIPO sites than controls (Woolf 2003); concentrated foraging on higher severity areas of burn (Woolf 2003); found more in stands burned by stand-replacement wildfire compared to unburned controls 1-4 winters after fire (Kreisel and Stein 1999); breeding pairs found in PICO-ABLA forest one year after prescribed stand-replacing fire (Tiedemann and Woodard 2002)

Study Location: Uinta Mountains, Utah
Habitat Description: PICO as main overstory tree; also includes PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Birds were censused in wet and dry meadows, mature and stagnated PICO stands, and regenerating PICO stands (17 and 37 years post-clearcut). The richest avifauna was found in the dry meadows. While a few birds were adversly affected by the clearcutting, many individual species were more numerous in the clearcuts, and the overall number of species was similar.

Study Location: Prescott National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Breeding birds were surveyed on burned and unburned PIPO forest plots. Individual species' occurrence and abundance of foraging guilds on plots are listed by season. Foliage-gleaning insectivores were more abundant on unburned sites, while bark-gleaning birds were more common on burned sites. Granivores were more abundant on burned and clearcut sites in fall and winter. During all seasons, more bird species were detected in unburned study plots and more species were restricted to these plots. Species composition in certain areas was related to foraging substrate availability and season. Habitat alteration by fire and logging appeared to have similar effects on bird communities; openness of habitat appeared to be a primary discriminating factor in the study areas, suggesting that the extent of habitat modification may be more influential than the precise type of alteration.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Snags used by secondary cavity nesters (SCN) in PP forests were evaluated for their characteristics. The majority of used snags were > 60cm dbh, >20 m tall, were mostly covered in bark, had bark near the cavity entrance, and had broken tops. The largest and tallest snags available were chosen. SCNs preferred snags that were dead 5- 20 years ago, with the exception of the pygmy nuthatch that preferred older snags. Snag density accounted for more than half the variability in density of SCNs. Removal of snags in coniferous forests would have a serious negative effect on the density of SCNs.

Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: Coronado National Forest, southeast Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO dominated, also PIST, PSME, QUHY, QUAR
Summary: This study compared the number and characteristics of snags used by cavity-nesting birds before and after broadcast understory fires in PP stands. Avian species were monitored to investigate their response to prescribed fire. Before the fire, many avian species used large snags (> 50 cm dbh) for cavity nesting, with smaller snags used primarily for foraging. Nearly half of all snags were burned or drastically changed by the prescribed fire. A snag's likelihood to be consumed depended on both dbh and decay class. Few large live trees were killed immediately, leading to a 45% net decrease in snags 1 year post-treatment. Small snags (< 15 cm dbh) increased 20-fold after the treatment. Logs decreased post-treatment. No avian species were lost post-treatment, though northern flickers and violet-green swallows decreased in experimental stands, while mountain chickadees increased. The authors attribute these patterns to changes in prey populations or shifts in areas used in foraging, and not to any limitation in nest sites.

Study Location: western Montana and northern Wyoming
Habitat Description: range of habitat types: includes PIPO, PSME, LAOC, PICO, PIAL, PIFL, Picea sp,, ABLA, ABGR, THPL, aspen, cottonwood
Summary: Fifteen bird species are generally more abundant in early post-fire communities than in any other cover type in the northern Rockies (includes olive-sided flycatcher, three-toed woodpecker, black-backed woodpecker, Clark's nutcracker, mountain bluebird, red crossbill, Cassin's finch, pine siskin, American robin, dark-eyed junco, yellow-rumped warbler). Six species (common nighthawk, calliope hummingbird, northern flicker, Stellar's jay, orange-crowned warbler, chipping sparrow) were most abundant in stands 10-40 years post-fire. Three species (American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, dark-eyed junco) were detected in early an mid-successional burned forest 100% of the time. One species, the black-backed woodpecker, was restricted to standing dead forest created by stand-replacing fires. Bird communities are different in recently burned forest, primarily because members of three feeding guilds (woodpeckers, flycatchers, and seedeaters) are especially abundant. Larger-diameter (>10 cm dbh) PP, DF, and LAOC were most often used for feeding by woodpeckers. Standing, fire-killed trees were used by the majority of birds nesting in recently burned forest. Many of the structures used in nesting (broken-topped snags) were present before the fire. Large-scale, stand-replacing fire may be necessary for long-term maintenance of many bird populations. Commentary is offered on the need to alter present fire and post-fire forest management.

Habitat Description: mixed conifer, includes: PSME, PIPO, ABLA, PIEN, LAOC, PICO
Summary: This study examined bird use of burned and unburned forest in the winter season. Species richness was similar, but composition was distinctly different. Composition and abundance also changed with time; some species disappeared from the area while others moved in. Trunk and branch foraging species were more abundant in burned forest, though their abundance significantly decreased from the first to the fourth winter post-fire. Foraging behavior was documented for four woodpecker species within the burned area. Foraging took place on snags > 23 cm dbh.

Habitat Description: PIPO, ABCO, PSME, PIST, aspen, Gambel oak
Summary: Habitat features for successful and unsuccessful nest sites, nest sites vs. random sites, and differences among coexisting species of cavity nesting birds were identified. Species-specific characteristics are presented both for nest site and nest tree; birds differed in some of their habitat preferences. Aspen (mostly dead) were a preferred nesting species and were common in foraging patches, despite their low density in the study area. High density of aspen provides both more nesting sites and protects nests from predation, as predators have to search more sites to find nests. Foraging areas also had more conifers and fewer deciduous trees (other than aspen) than random areas. Preference for conifers is attributed to increased foraging opportunities.Failed nests were surrounded by denser foliage and were closer to conifers. Reduced nest success was also linked to lower nest height. Nonexcavating species had lower nesting success than excavator species.

Study Location: northwestern California
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Bird abundance was compared in clearcut PSME forests where snags had been retained or removed. Nine species of primary and secondary cavity-nesting birds had a lower mean detection rate and percent occurrence in clearcuts where snags had been removed. One species, the chesnut-backed chickadee, increased in mean detection rate and percent occurrence in clearcuts without snags. The authors hypothesize that most cavity nesters shifted nesting to neighboring stands and used clearcut areas for foraging.

Study Location: Northwestern Montana
Habitat Description: LAOC, PSME
Summary: Characteristics of nest-hole trees are described. Nesters clearly preferred LAOC over PSME. PIPO was also preferred, though it was not abundant in the study area. Nearly as many live trees as dead snags were used. Average dbh of nest trees for a variety of species is listed. Some species, such as pileated woodpeckers and American kestrels, used only a small range of tree diameters, while others, like the yellow-bellied sapsucker and red-breasted nuthatch, were found in a variety of tree sizes.

Study Location: South Dakota
Habitat Description: PIPO, aspen/birch
Summary: Habitat relations of breeding songbirds were examined in PIPO and aspen/birch forests at three scales: in two vegetation types, structural stages within vegetation types, and vegetative structure. Species richness was greater in the aspen/birch forest type, which the authors attribute to greater invertebrate food resources. A number of species differed depending on overstory canopy closure. A few species were associated with snag presence.

Habitat Description: PIPO/PSME
Summary: The responses of nine cavity-nesting bird species to high-intensity wildfire with three post-fire treatments were studied in southwestern Idaho. In general, nesting continues increased up to four years after wildfire. Among treatments, overall densities were similar though species composition varied. All bird species selected nest sites with higher tree densities than that measured at random sites, and cavity-nesters as a group selected clumps of snags rather than snags that were retained in uniform, evenly-spaced distributions. Larger-diameter, more heavily decayed snags were chosen by cavity-nesters. Most used trees also had broken tops that pre-dated the wildfire. Also includes a table predicting the response of 11 bird species to high-intensity fire, prescribed fire with stand management, and fire suppression.

Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME
Summary: The authors identified snag characteristics, including diameter and density, preferred by a number of cavity-nesting birds. Models of landscape-scale habitat preference were also presented for black-backed and Lewis's woodpeckers, and were consistent with findings at a smaller scale. As these two species represent opposite extremes of a continuum of habitat use amongst the birds studied, managing for these particular species will incorporate the needs of many other cavity-nesting birds.

Study Location: southwestern Idaho
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME
Summary: Cavity nesting birds were grouped as strong, weak or non-excavating species. Patterns of cavity occupancy were tied to various microhabitat features as well as temporal and spatial scales. Time since fire had the greatest influence on occupancy of nest cavities for all species; site characteristics were secondarily important. Preffered snag characteristics differed by type of excavator and changed over time. The majority of cavities (80%) were not reused. Both number of cavities and number of cavity-nesting birds increased with time since fire. The authors stress the ephemeral nature of fire-created habitat.

Study Location: Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: The requirements of cavity nesting birds were examined, with an emphasis on the impact of logging and snag removal on cavity nesting birds. For nest sites, birds usually selected PIPO snags >18" dbh that had been dead for at least six years and had >40% bark cover. A few species responded to logging and snag removal. The most heavily impacted birds were those that nested in PIPO. The density of cavity nesting birds decreased by 53% on those stands that had been treated. The authors recommend a snag density of 2.6 snags/acre, with snags >19" dbh.

Habitat Description: PICO, ABLA/PIEN
Summary: Bird density, composition, and diversity were monitored across a series of fire severities in burned PICO or spruce-fir forest in Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks. Highest populations and greatest biomass occurred from 5-29 years post-fire. Density, composition, and diversity on moderately burned spruce-fir-PICO were more like those on unburned spruce-fir than other seral stages. Changes in bird communities by feeding category were also examined. Overall, canopy closure was a habitat variable that appeared to affect avifauna more than the presence of fire.

Study Location: eastern Cascades, Washington
Habitat Description: overmature PICO-ABLA stand, mature PICO thicket
Summary: One year after a prescribed, stand-replacing fire, plant cover and diversity decreased, as did microbial respiriation. Nitrogen fixation and nitrification increased after burning. Overall bird diversity increased after the fire. Diversity of woodpeckers increased the year after burning, while needle-foraging species declined or were absent after fire. There was no definitive response of small mammals to burning, though the Townsend's chipmunk did markedly decline. Forage for elk in the burn was higher in crude protein, but low productivity and distance from water diminished the value of the burned area for elk.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Stands in western Montana underwent PIPO restoration treatments that included selective tree removal followed by a prescribed burn. Bird and small mammal populations were monitored on these and control sites. While some bird species showed a preference for treated vs. untreated stands, the treatment did not have major effects on avian species composition. The foraging behavior of bark-gleaning birds was also examined on treated vs. untreated sites. Birds selectively foraged on larger trees, with PIPO preferred to PSME in this study area. Thinning and burning is compatible with providing forage substrates for the species in this area, as the encounter rate for bark-gleaners was higher in the treated sites. Small mammal communities changed in both abundance and composition as a result of treatment, with deer mice exhibiting the most positive response to treatment.

Study Location: Olympic National Forest, northwest Washington
Habitat Description: THPL-PSME zone
Summary: Breeding populations of cavity-nesting birds were examined across four forest successional stages with varying snag densities. Species richness, diversity, and density increased with snag density. Nest site preferences for some species are given. Overall, larger taller snags with broken tops were preferred by cavity nesters. Management recommendations are made, including a minimum number of hard and soft snags per hectare, and size and species suggestions.
