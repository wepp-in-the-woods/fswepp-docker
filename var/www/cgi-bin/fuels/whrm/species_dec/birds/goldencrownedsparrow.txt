Distribution
breeds in British Columbia and Alaska; winters along Pacific coast of USA
General Habitat
common in stunted boreal bogs and in open areas near treeline, especially in willows; winters in dense woodlands, tangles, and brush
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
brushy cutovers; respond positively to edge
Nestsite Characteristics
nests on ground, hidden in foliage and vines, sometimes on branch of small tree or bush; nest made of sticks, rootlets, moss, grass, leaves and bark
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages mostly on the ground, also gleans from foliage and sallies into air from perch or ground
Diet
PSME seeds; seeds, fruits, buds, flowers, and terrestrial arthropods; some insects including ants, wasps, bees, larvae and adults of moths, butterflies, beetles, and crane flies
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
greater abundance in cut-over forest (Hagar 1960)

Study Location: inner coast ranges of northwestern California
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Bird species were surveyed in cutover areas of PSME forest as well as virgin forest. Bird species are identified that prefer cutover forest, intact forest, or occur in both. Accounts of habitat preferences are given for several bird species, including detailed dietary information.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.
