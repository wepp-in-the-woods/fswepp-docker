Distribution
breeds across much of Alaska, Canada and USA; winters in southern USA and Mexico
General Habitat
any wooded habitat near water
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
prefers heterogenous landscapes, abundance of dead trees
Nestsite Characteristics
cavity nester in dead trees, also uses fence posts, barn eaves and nest boxes; nests in early successional stages: open plant cover composed of bushes and tree seedlings
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
often forages over water or open areas such as pastures and fields
Diet
mostly flying insects, but able to feed on berries and seeds during poor weather; insect species include flies, beetles, ants, stoneflies, mayflies, and caddisflies
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
abundant in clearcuts and not detected in unlogged stands (Tobalske et al. 1991); more abundant in low shrub-stage clearcuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995)
Sources of Information used in the Model

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: Northwestern Montana
Habitat Description: LAOC, PSME
Summary: Characteristics of nest-hole trees are described. Nesters clearly preferred LAOC over PSME. PIPO was also preferred, though it was not abundant in the study area. Nearly as many live trees as dead snags were used. Average dbh of nest trees for a variety of species is listed. Some species, such as pileated woodpeckers and American kestrels, used only a small range of tree diameters, while others, like the yellow-bellied sapsucker and red-breasted nuthatch, were found in a variety of tree sizes.

Study Location: northwestern Montana
Habitat Description: LAOC cover type; includes ABLA, LAOC, PSME, PIEN, PICO, BEPA, aspen, cottonwood
Summary: Populations of 10 breeding bird species were monitored in harvested and immediately adjacent uncut areas. A number of species were more abundant in harvested areas. Responses by feeding and nesting guilds are also included. Foliage-foraging species and tree gleaners wre less abundant in harvested areas, while flycatching and ground foragers were more common there. Conifer tree-nesting species were least abundant in clearcuts, while ground nesters were more common within the cutover habitats.Management recommendations are made, including the retention of broadleaf trees within cutting units and investigating the importance of slash piles in logged habitat. Slash piles were used by winter wrens, Townsend's solitaires, and dark-eyed juncos as perches, food sources, or nest sites.

Study Location: Olympic National Forest, northwest Washington
Habitat Description: THPL-PSME zone
Summary: Breeding populations of cavity-nesting birds were examined across four forest successional stages with varying snag densities. Species richness, diversity, and density increased with snag density. Nest site preferences for some species are given. Overall, larger taller snags with broken tops were preferred by cavity nesters. Management recommendations are made, including a minimum number of hard and soft snags per hectare, and size and species suggestions.
