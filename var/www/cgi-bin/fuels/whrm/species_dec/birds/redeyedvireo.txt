Pletschet, Sandra M. 1987. Habitat preferences and interspecific competition: red-eyed and warbling vireos. Missoula, MT: University of Montana. 61 p. M.A. Thesis.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: riparian woodland: black cottonwood, PIPO, aspen
Summary: The habitats and spatial relationships of warbling and red-eyed vireos was studied. Intraspecific territorial overlap was virtually non-existent. Red-eyed vireos preferred habitat with denser cover than warbling vireos. Red-eyed vireos foraged in the middle of trees, and used aspen more than warbling vireos. Both specied sang primarily from the top of trees.
