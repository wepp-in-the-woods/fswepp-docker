Summaries of Specific Studies
Beedy, Edward C. 1981. Bird communities and forest structure in the Sierra Nevada of California. Condor. 83: 97-105.

Study Location: central Sierra Nevada
Habitat Description: mixed conifer (PIJE, PICO, ABCO, CADE) and ABMA stands
Summary: Bird communities in open- and closed-canopy stands in two forest types were compared. Closed-canopy forest had lower bird densities, diversities, species richness, and consuming biomasses than open-canopy forests in both vegetative zones. With the exception of hummingbirds, all feeding guilds were present on each transect, though the reduction in understory vegetation and forest clearings in closed-canopy forest caused pronounced decreases in three understory guilds as well as in the flycatchers.

Study Location: eastern Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: primarily PIPO
Summary: The authors review the habitat needs of bird species of concern in eastern Oregon and Washington, focusing on how disturbances (natural and anthropogenic) would alter habitat for these species.

Ligon, J. David. 1973. Foraging behavior of the white-headed woodpecker in Idaho. Auk 90:862-863.

Study Location: western Idaho
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: White-headed woodpeckers foraging behavior was observed in open, second-growth PIPO stands in western Idaho. PIPO was exclusively used for foraging. Sexual differences in foraging behavior was not observed, though there was a seasonal difference in the location of foraging sites on PIPO trees. 

Milne, Kathleen A.; Hejle, Sallie J. 1989. Nest-site characteristics of white-headed woodpeckers. Journal of Wildlife Management. 53:50-55.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: not explicitly stated; nests occurred in a variety of pines (including PICO and PIPO) and firs
Summary: White-headed woodpeckers nested in open-canopied stands of mature and overmature trees with a southerly exposure. Nests occured mainly in snags, fallen logs and stumps. Mean dbh of nest trees was 73 cm. The results indicate less restriction to pine-dominated habitats than previously suggested.

Study Location: review of western Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: intensively managed and unmanaged PSME
Summary: A comprehensive review of the importance of snags as wildlife trees in managed and unmanaged PSME forests. Includes information on the ecological role of snags and cavity users, wildlife snag requirements, snag management, and guidelines for selecting wildlife trees to meet logging safety requirements. Much detail is presented on calculated the number of snags needed to maintain specfic densities of cavity-users. Forestry practices that impact snag production and retention are also outlined. The economic role of snags and cavity-using wildlife is addressed.

Study Location: Boise National Forest, southwestern Idaho
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME
Summary: The authors identified snag characteristics, including diameter and density, preferred by a number of cavity-nesting birds. Models of landscape-scale habitat preference were also presented for black-backed and Lewis's woodpeckers, and were consistent with findings at a smaller scale. As these two species represent opposite extremes of a continuum of habitat use amongst the birds studied, managing for these particular species will incorporate the needs of many other cavity-nesting birds.

Study Location: southwestern Idaho
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME
Summary: Cavity nesting birds were grouped as strong, weak or non-excavating species. Patterns of cavity occupancy were tied to various microhabitat features as well as temporal and spatial scales. Time since fire had the greatest influence on occupancy of nest cavities for all species; site characteristics were secondarily important. Preffered snag characteristics differed by type of excavator and changed over time. The majority of cavities (80%) were not reused. Both number of cavities and number of cavity-nesting birds increased with time since fire. The authors stress the ephemeral nature of fire-created habitat.

Study Location: Blue Mountains, OR
Habitat Description: PICO
Summary: This case history (4) outlines the key habitat-wildlife relationships in the LP forests of the central Oregon Pumice Zone. Areas of focus include the American marten and forest songbirds. The impact of salvage logging is discussed for some bird species.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.
