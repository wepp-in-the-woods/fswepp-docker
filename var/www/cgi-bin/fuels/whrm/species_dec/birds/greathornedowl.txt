Distribution
widespread over most of N. America
General Habitat
found in deciduous bottom, bunch grass, and riparian habitat types
Home or Activity Range
170-2200 ha
Specific Habitat Preferences
respond positively to edge, open shrub habitats
Nestsite Characteristics
nests in tree cavities, snags, abandoned nests of other birds, ledges, caves, or on ground
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
hunts from perch, while walking, from the air, and over open water for waterfowl; may hawk in forest canopy for crow nestlings, but mostly forage in open habitats 
Diet
generalist: mammals 90%, birds 10%; miscellaneous amphibians, reptiles, invertebrates, insects, and worms. Mammals include voles, deer mice, bushytailed woodrats, mountain cottentails, pocket gophers, rats, rabbits, kangaroo rats, squirrels, snowshoe hares, pocket mice, weasels, jackrabbits, marmots, skunks, house cats, and opossums. Birds include coots, pheasants, gray partridges, pigeons, chickens, starlings, grouse, ducks, owls, magpie, quails, nestling hawks, crows, and rhinoceros auklets. Also feed on snakes, carps, crayfish, beetles, and Jerusalem crickets
Predators
red-tailed hawk, crows, jays, other great-horned owls

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Summary:Resource partitioning at the macro- and microhabitat scale was studied for five abundant species of forest owls. Owls differed in habitat preferences as well as activity periods and food habits. Screech owls had the most restricted niche, while pygmy and great-horned owls were more generalist in habitat ust. Patterns of resource use was interpreted as resulting from environmental factors, morphological limitations, behavioral adaptations, and interspecific competition.
