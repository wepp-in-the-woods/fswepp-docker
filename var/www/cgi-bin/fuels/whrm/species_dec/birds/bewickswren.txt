Distribution
year-round resident in Pacific coastal USA, as far north as southern British Columbia, east to Oklahoma and Texas, south into Mexico
General Habitat
dense, brushy habitats

3-12 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
responds positively to edge; prefers heterogenous landscapes; needs cavities for nesting
Nestsite Characteristics
nests in any available cavity, including trees, man-made structures, logs, posts, baskets
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages on ground or shrubs and understory vegetation
Diet
mostly small insects and spiders such as beetles, leafhoppers, treehoppers, ants, wasps, caterpillars, moths, and grasshoppers; also seeds and some fruits 
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
lower mean detection rate and % occurrence in clearcuts without snags (Marcot 1983)

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: northwestern California
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Bird abundance was compared in clearcut PSME forests where snags had been retained or removed. Nine species of primary and secondary cavity-nesting birds had a lower mean detection rate and percent occurrence in clearcuts where snags had been removed. One species, the chesnut-backed chickadee, increased in mean detection rate and percent occurrence in clearcuts without snags. The authors hypothesize that most cavity nesters shifted nesting to neighboring stands and used clearcut areas for foraging.
