Distribution
winters along rocky Atlantic and Pacific coasts, breeds in northeastern Canada and from Alaska south to Wyoming
General Habitat
winter in coastal areas, migrate inland to nest along swiftly flowing mountain streams
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
streams used usually in mature to old-growth forest or areas with shrubby riparian vegetation and young PSME overstory
Nestsite Characteristics
on the edge of swift-flowing mountain streams; could be impacted if logging removes habitat or alters stream flow/siltation.
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forage while walking on the bottom of swift streams; search among rocks for food, and dive (3 - 5 ft deep) for food as well

crustaceans, mollusks (chitons, chink shells, perwinkles, top shells, limpets, and blue mussels), aquatic insects (stone flies, etc.),  echinoderms, and fish
