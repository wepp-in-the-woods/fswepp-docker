Airola, Daniel A.; Barrett, Reginald H. 1985. Foraging and habitat relationships of insect-gleaning birds in a Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forest. Condor. 87:205-216.

Study Location: central Sierra Nevada, California
Habitat Description: PIPO, PILA, ABCO, PSME, CADE, QUKE
Summary: Foraging habitat preferences, niche relationships, patterns of relative abundance vs. niche breadth and differences between migrant and resident species were examined for 12 species of insect gleaning birds in the Sierras. Tree species, and to a lesser extent, tree height were used selectively by the guild. Incense-cedar was avoided by all species, while other tree species were preferred by individual or groups of gleaners. In differentiating between niche of each species, foraging site was the most important foraging characteristic, followed by tree species, foraging technique, and foraging height. No correlation was found between niche breadth and species abundance, though a positive correlation existed for all 5 resident species.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.
