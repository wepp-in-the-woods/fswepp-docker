Response to Disturbance
initially reduced by fire and remained low  (Johnson and Wauer 1996); more abundant on logged plots  (Szaro and Balda 1986), disfavored 1-2 years post-fire due to forest and foliage loss (Johnson and Wauer 1996); favored 4-14 years post-fire as tree foliage recovers (Johnson and Wauer 1996); highest density on silviculturally cut and irregular strip plots vs. controls, severely thinned, and clearcut plots (Szaro and Balda 1979)

Study Location: Bandelier National Monument, NM
Habitat Description: PIPO, montane meadow, mixed conifer, pinyon-juniper
Summary: Breeding birds were surveyed before and for many years after a wildlfire in Bandelier National Monument. Species diversity increased after the fire, but breeding populations in general declined for several years before increasing above prefire levels. This pattern was more pronounced on severely burned forest. In all but the severely burned forest, breeding bird diversity and populations were higher than prefire levels 14 years after the wildfire. Patterns are presented for different foraging and nesting guilds, as well as some individual species (including particular habitat changes that impacted bird species).

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Bird species diversity and species richness were not significantly affected by forest cutting and logging except in a clearcut treatment. Bird population densitities significantly increased on silvilculturally cut and irregular strip shelterwood plots and significantly decreased  on the severely thinned and clearcut plots. Impact on individual species is discussed.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Seasonal avian communities were examined for their response to weather condition and treatment (logging) effects. While birds responded to climate, most notably precipitation, treatment effects appeared to be more influential. Species preferring open habitat (rock wren, American robin, western wood pee-wee and western bluebird) were highest on medium and heavy cut stands. Treated stands also had the highest abundance of chipping sparrows, broad-tailed hummingbirds, Grace's warbler, and dark-eyed juncos. Species preferring dense foliage (western flycatcher, pygmy nuthatch, red-faced warbler, hermit thrush, black-headed grosbeak) were less abundant in modified habitats.
