Distribution
Pacific coastal states, British Columbia
General Habitat
common in coniferous or mixed forests in coastal ranges, usually at low elevations and moist forest
Home or Activity Range
0.5-15 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
snags; trees for cavities
Nestsite Characteristics
cavity nester in dead or live trees
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
frequently hawks insects over lakes, meadows, and other open habitats; use snags as feeding substrate
Diet
insects, especially carpenter ants; drills and strips bark to produce perennial sap wells; feeds on sap, cambium and other soft tissues especially from aspen and willow; also some berries and other fruits.
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
snags for roosting and as thermally regulated habitat
Response to Disturbance
lower mean detection rate and % occurrence in clearcuts without snags (Marcot 1983)
Sources of Information used in the Model
Marcot 1983, Neitro et al. 1985
General Sources of Background Information

Study Location: northwestern California
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Bird abundance was compared in clearcut PSME forests where snags had been retained or removed. Nine species of primary and secondary cavity-nesting birds had a lower mean detection rate and percent occurrence in clearcuts where snags had been removed. One species, the chesnut-backed chickadee, increased in mean detection rate and percent occurrence in clearcuts without snags. The authors hypothesize that most cavity nesters shifted nesting to neighboring stands and used clearcut areas for foraging.

Study Location: review of western Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: intensively managed and unmanaged PSME
Summary: A comprehensive review of the importance of snags as wildlife trees in managed and unmanaged PSME forests. Includes information on the ecological role of snags and cavity users, wildlife snag requirements, snag management, and guidelines for selecting wildlife trees to meet logging safety requirements. Much detail is presented on calculated the number of snags needed to maintain specfic densities of cavity-users. Forestry practices that impact snag production and retention are also outlined. The economic role of snags and cavity-using wildlife is addressed.
