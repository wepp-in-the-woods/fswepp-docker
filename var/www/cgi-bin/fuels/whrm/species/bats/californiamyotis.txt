Study Location: southern British Columbia
Habitat Description: PSME, ABGR, PICO, PIPO, PIMO, TSHE, THPL, aspen
Summary: Female California bats were radio tagged and roost site preferences were documented. Bats used multiple roosts within the sampling period. Roost were under loose bark or in holes or cracks in the tree. Roost trees had significantly larger diameters and were further away from trees of the same or greater height. Roost trees were also in areas with lower canopy closure. Bats chose PIPO more than expected, and PSME less than expected based on availability. Trees were most often of advanced decay classes. Substantial numbers of large snags, particularly PIPO, should be retained to support such bat populations.

Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Review of the basic biology of bats inhabiting PSME forests of the Pacific Northwest, including a discussion of natural history, habitat requirements, and their ecological relations with old-growth forests.

Study Location: British Columbia; southeastern Rocky Mountain Trench
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: Relative abundance, diversity, and roosting habitat characteristics of bats were determined in the Upper Kootenay River area. Little brown bats were the most commonly trapped of the six species detected. Most roosts were located in buildings, though they were also found in snags, stumps, and rock crevices. No size preference was noted for snags or stumps; they appeared to be used in proportion to their availability.

Study Location: southwestern California
Habitat Description: variety, includes desert areas as well as deciduous and coniferous forest
Summary: General natural history of the California myotis in a variety of habitat types in southwestern California. This myotis appears is primarily a crevice-dweller and roosts in any crevice available after evening foraging. Anecdotal descriptions of roosting, reproduction.

Study Location: British Columbia
Habitat Description: not stated: includes THPL and TSHE
Summary: The diversity, relative abundance, and roosting ecology of bats were studied in the Mica Wildlife Compensation Area. The little brown bat was the most abundant bat species. Roosts were located in rocky outcrops and in trees. Bats moved roosts often, but remained faithful to a particular roosting area. Therefore, management for these bats should occur on a stand or landscape level, preserving areas where multiple roosting areas are present.

Study Location: southern Washington Cascades, Oregon Coast Range
Habitat Description: PSME-TSHE sere
Summary: Bats were examined in different-aged PSME stands. Bats were grouped by nesting strategy and by echolocation signal. Bat activity was higher in old-growth sites than in mature or young sites; these results suggest that bats are 3-10 times more abundant in the old-growth sites. The author attributes this pattern to roosting habitat, due to the availability of large-diameter snags in older forest. Foraging opportunities did not contribute to the observed pattern of bat abundance. Differences in sex-ratio, reproductive activity and age distribution were seen between the two regions. Reduction in old-growth forest would negatively impact bat populations, though the degree of impact may vary regionally.
