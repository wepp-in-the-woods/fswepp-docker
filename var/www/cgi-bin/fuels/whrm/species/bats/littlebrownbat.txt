# Literature
Distribution
widespread on most of N. American continent
General Habitat
variety of forest types; proximity to waterbodies overriding factor
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Canopy Cover
low canopy closure at roost sites (Rasheed and Holroyd 1995, Grindal 1997)
Specific Habitat Preferences
waterbodies for foraging, aspen trees with heart rot
Nestsite Characteristics
maternity colonies in warm areas such as buildings; can occur in tree cavities, especially primary-excavator cavities in aspen
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages over water surfaces
Diet
aquatic insects : primarily chironomids
Predators
small carnivores, raptorial birds, domestic cats, fish, bullfrogs, snakes
Shelter Habitats
summer colonies of buildings, caves, mines, trees, rock crevices, snags. Hibernates in caves and buildings chosen to protect from low temperatures and provide moisture level > 90%
Response to Disturbance
detections reduced after clear-cutting (reviewed in Christy and West 1993)

Study Location: Washington and Oregon

Summary: Review of the basic biology of bats inhabiting PSME forests of the Pacific Northwest, including a discussion of natural history, habitat requirements, and their ecological relations with old-growth forests.

Study Location: British Columbia; southeastern Rocky Mountain Trench
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: Relative abundance, diversity, and roosting habitat characteristics of bats were determined in the Upper Kootenay River area. Little brown bats were the most commonly trapped of the six species detected. Most roosts were located in buildings, though they were also found in snags, stumps, and rock crevices. No size preference was noted for snags or stumps; they appeared to be used in proportion to their availability.

Study Location: Saskatchewan
Habitat Description: PICO, PIGL, aspen
Summary: Roost sites of both male and female little brown bats were largely in aspen trees. The authors suggest that cavities in aspen are selected over conifers because an intact sapwood shell provides protection against harsh ambient conditions and predators, and provides a unique thermal microclimate. Multiple roosts were used by individuals. Variation in roost-site fidelity and differential use of torpor was observed in males.

Study Location: British Columbia
Habitat Description: not stated: includes THPL and TSHE
Summary: The diversity, relative abundance, and roosting ecology of bats were studied in the Mica Wildlife Compensation Area. The little brown bat was the most abundant bat species. Roosts were located in rocky outcrops and in trees. Bats moved roosts often, but remained faithful to a particular roosting area. Therefore, management for these bats should occur on a stand or landscape level, preserving areas where multiple roosting areas are present.

Study Location: southern Washington Cascades, Oregon Coast Range
Habitat Description: PSME-TSHE sere
Summary: Bats were examined in different-aged PSME stands. Bats were grouped by nesting strategy and by echolocation signal. Bat activity was higher in old-growth sites than in mature or young sites; these results suggest that bats are 3-10 times more abundant in the old-growth sites. The author attributes this pattern to roosting habitat, due to the availability of large-diameter snags in older forest. Foraging opportunities did not contribute to the observed pattern of bat abundance. Differences in sex-ratio, reproductive activity and age distribution were seen between the two regions. Reduction in old-growth forest would negatively impact bat populations, though the degree of impact may vary regionally.
