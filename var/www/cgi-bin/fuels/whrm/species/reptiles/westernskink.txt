Rutherford, Pamela L.; Gregory, Patrick T. 2003. Habitat use and movement patterns of northern alligator lizards (Elgaria coerulea) and western skinks (Eumeces skiltonianus) in southeastern British Columbia. Journal of Herpetology. 37(1): 98-106.

Study Location: southeastern British Columbia
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME, aspen
Summary: Northern alligator lizards and western skinks often used the same habitat, and no seasonal migration was observed. Both species were rarely found in the open, hiding more often under rocks than vegetation or logs. They remained close to shrubs and forest edges. Most lizards associated with grass and moss. Northern alligator lizards are associated with clearings.
