Distribution
northern North America, with range following Rocky Mountain chain south into New Mexico and Arizona; spotty populations in states west of the Rocky Mountains
General Habitat
highly aquatic, living in marshes, wet meadows, ponds, and reservoirs
Home or Activity Range
< 1 ac
Canopy Cover
No information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
vegetative cover for concealment
Nestsite Characteristics
eggs attached to emergent vegetation in shallow water
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
no information available
Diet
invertebrates, worms, snails, other small frogs
Predators
bullfrogs, garter snakes, raccoons, herons
Shelter Habitats
vegetative cover for concealment: cockleburs, grasses, other aquatic vegetation
Response to Disturbance
negatively impacted by bull frog introduction (reviewed in Sallabanks et al. 2003); agricultural chemicals have been implicated in decline in some areas (reviewed in Bull and Wales 2001); any disturbance (land conversion, climate, livestock grazing) that affects water level or water quality during the frog's embryonic and larval periods may negatively affect their populations (reviewed in Bull and Wales 2001); highly susceptible to mortality from cars when moving from breeding to overwintering habitat (reviewed in Bull and Wales 2001)

Summaries of Specific Studies
Bull, Evelyn; Wales, Barbara C. 2001. Effects of disturbance on amphibians of conservation concern in eastern Oregon and Washington. Northwest Science. 75:174-179.

Study Location: eastern Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: primarily PIPO
Summary: The authors review the habitat needs of amphibian species of concern in eastern Oregon and Washington, focusing on how disturbances (natural and anthropogenic) would alter habitat for these species. Species of concern include the Oregon spotted frog, Columbia spotted frog, northern leopard frog, Cascades frog, Tailed frog, Larch Mountain salamander, and Cope's giant salamander.
