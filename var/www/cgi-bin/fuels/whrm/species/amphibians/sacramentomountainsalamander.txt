Study Location: Sacramento Mountains, New Mexico
Habitat Description: mixed conifer: ABCO, PSME, PIEN, PIPU, PIPO, aspen
Summary: Habitat preferences were explored for the Jemez and Sacramento Mountain salamanders. Abundance of the Jemez Mountain salamander was best predicted by slope, total pine, and large spruce. Abundance of the Sacramento Mountain salamander was correlated to elevation, slope, total pine, and total spruce. These variables were not accurate in predicting salamander presence, therefore the authors urge caution in using models to predict their presence. Interim management guidelines are given for the length of time predictive models are still in question.
