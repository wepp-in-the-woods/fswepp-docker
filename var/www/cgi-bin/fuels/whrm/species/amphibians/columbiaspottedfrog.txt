Distribution
western Canada south along Rocky Mountain chain through eastern Washington, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming; fragmented populations in Oregon, Wyoming, Nevada and Utah
General Habitat
closely associated with ponds, marshes, streams, and rivers
Home or Activity Range
< 2.5 ac
Canopy Cover
No information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
wet areas, including pond and stream margins; presence of willows for protection and maintenance of stable water table
Nestsite Characteristics
breeds in warm, shallow margins of ponds or streams; eggs are deposited in eddies of streams, backwash pools and oxbows, beaver ponds, improved spring ponds
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
favor areas that are moist, with vegetative cover and an abundance of insect prey
Diet
opportunistic, adults feed mostly on invertebrates; tadpoles feed on aquatic vegetation (mostly algae) and detritus
Predators
introduced trout, garter snakes, sandhill cranes, giant water bugs, ravens, crows, raptors, black bears, minks, coyotes, weasels, California gulls, great gray owls, great horned owls, Swainson's hawk, northern harrier, American robins, gray jays, great blue herons, dabbling ducks, osprey, Brewer's blackbirds
Shelter Habitats
hibernate in spring-fed ponds or permanent and intermittent streams with willows, subterranean channels of spring seeps; newly metamorphosed frogs need most vegetative cover as they disperse from natal ponds in late summer and fall
Response to Disturbance
negatively impacted by grazing (reviewed in Sallabanks et al. 2003); road building has eliminated breeding sites (reviewed in Bull and Wales 2001); high- and low-water events, ice events, beaver activity, livestock grazing, and introduction of exotic predators could influence populations (reviewed in Bull and Wales 2001); water pumping systems that eliminate or change habitat may have resulted in 78% decline over decades in a population in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (Patla 1997)

Study Location: northeastern Oregon
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: High elevation lakes in Oregon were surveyed to determine if amphibian abundances were related to introduced fish species, habitat characteristics, or both. Long-toed salamander and Pacific treefrog abundances were negatively affected by introduced trout, while habitat characteristics, including CWD, exerted more influence on the abundance of eggs and larvae of western toads and Columbia spotted frogs.

Study Location: eastern Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: primarily PIPO
Summary: The authors review the habitat needs of amphibian species of concern in eastern Oregon and Washington, focusing on how disturbances (natural and anthropogenic) would alter habitat for these species. Species of concern include the Oregon spotted frog, Columbia spotted frog, northern leopard frog, Cascades frog, Tailed frog, Larch Mountain salamander, and Cope's giant salamander.

Study Location: southwest Idaho
Habitat Description: sagebrush-steppe
Summary: The natural history of a specific population of Columbia spotted frogs is outlined, including information on breeding and movement. Unlike other studies, movements of frogs in this area was restricted to riparian corridors. Numerous barriers existed that limited movement potential for individual frogs. Livestock grazing is cited as the most common land-use activity impacting breeding, overwintering, and foraging areas.

Study Location: Yellowstone National Park, WY
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: This study aimed to verify and describe a suspected decline in spotted frog populations in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Hypotheses to explain the decline included adverse weather patterns and habitat changes. Spotted frogs populations experienced a 78% decline since an earlier study, with currently low reproductive rates and recruitment. Environmental conditions have occurred in the area, as have had frog spatial relationships such as activity ranges, dispersion, distribution, and seasonal movements. This decline and change in life history traits is attributed to habitat alterations, specifically water pumping, which has resulted in changes in the location, quality, importance, and connectivity of habitat features.

Study Location: central Idaho
Habitat Description: ABLA, PICO
Summary: Habitat use and movement patterns were examined for Columbia spotted frogs in a high mountain basin in central Idaho. Juvenile and adult frogs occupied a variety of widely distributed wetlands from June to September. The portion of frogs moving from breeding ponds to summer habitat varied between juveniles, males, and females. The scale of movement ranged between hundreds and thousands of meters annually to reach complementary resources, though migratory males stayed much closer to breeding sites than migratory females. Migration to overwintering lakes occurred quickly and followed the shortest-distance travel routes through dry, open forest even when stream corridors were available nearby. These results suggest that both spatially separated complementary resources and corridors between them need to be protected.
