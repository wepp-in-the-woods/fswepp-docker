Distribution
coastal Washington, south into northwestern Oregon
General Habitat
larvae and neotone inhabit small, cold, rocky streams and seeps; adults found in surface debris on the margins of water
Home or Activity Range
No information available
Canopy Cover
No information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
found in cold rocky streams, seepages, mountain lakes and ponds, usually in moist coniferous forest
Nestsite Characteristics
lays eggs in underwater chambers formed between large rocks or under large, woody debris
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
No information available
Diet
insects, fish, eggs, and larvae of their own and tailed frogs
Predators
No information available
Shelter Habitats
concealed during the day beneath rocks or other hidden cavities in the stream
Response to Disturbance
a loss of canopy cover from forest insects, tree disease, or fire would likely have a detrimental effect as stream temperatures would rise and sedimentation would increase (reviewed in Bull and Wales 2001)
Sources of Information used in the Model
No information available
General Sources of Background Information
Leonard et al. 1993, reviewed in O'Neill et al. 2001, Stebbins 2003
Summaries of Specific Studies
Bull, Evelyn; Wales, Barbara C. 2001. Effects of disturbance on amphibians of conservation concern in eastern Oregon and Washington. Northwest Science. 75:174-179.

Study Location: eastern Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: primarily PIPO
Summary: The authors review the habitat needs of amphibian species of concern in eastern Oregon and Washington, focusing on how disturbances (natural and anthropogenic) would alter habitat for these species. Species of concern include the Oregon spotted frog, Columbia spotted frog, northern leopard frog, Cascades frog, Tailed frog, Larch Mountain salamander, and Cope's giant salamander.
