Distribution
coastal Oregon into northwestern tip of California
General Habitat
PSME forest
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Canopy Cover
No information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
inhabit large decaying logs and stumps that have burrows of other organisms (ants, termites, other invertebrates); also found under bark of undecayed logs and stumps, in rock crevices in outcrops and road cuts, under surface debris, also climb into snags
Nestsite Characteristics
lay eggs in large logs or stumps, or in openings deep in rocks
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
no information available
Diet
wide range of small invertebrates, especially insects: isopods, snout beetles, European earwig, ants
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
inhabit large decaying logs and stumps that have burrows of other organisms (ants, termites, other invertebrates); also found under bark of undecayed logs and stumps, in rock crevices in outcrops and road cuts, under surface debris, also climb into snags
Response to Disturbance
common in clearcuts (Bury and Corn 1988); old burns and clearcuts containing large woody debris may host large populations for many years until the continued decay of the wood forces them out (Leonard et al. 1993)

In: Management of amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals in North America symposium: proceedings; Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-166. Fort Collins, CO: USDA, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station. 11-22.

Study Location: Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Evidence from this study suggests that rich, abundant populations of herpetofauna occur in naturally regenerating stands in Oregon and Washington. Few differences were found in amphibians between wet, moderate, and dry old-growth sites and between young, mature, and old-growth stands. Three salamanders in Oregon were found associated with downed logs or bark on the ground or on logs. These salamanders differed in their preference for age/class of downed logs.

Study Location: northwestern California
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: This study describes the relative abundance of amphibians, reptiles and mammals in six seral stages of forest in NW California. Seral stages preferred by individual species are given (Table 2). Late brush/sapling and old growth seral stages provided the most productive wildlife habitat. Habitat components that correlated with the relative abundance of 9 species are also presented. Species that would increase or decrease in numbers after harvest of old-growth PSME forest are predicted.

Study Location: northwestern California, southwestern Oregon
Habitat Description: PSME- low to mid elevations
Summary: Abundances and community composition of reptiles and amphibians were compared across forest types of coastal and inland DF forests. Habitat associations of 10 common species are given. Salamanders comprise the majority of the herpetofauna of this area. Species diversity was greater in older forest age classes with mesic conditions. A comparison of sampling methods is also presented.
