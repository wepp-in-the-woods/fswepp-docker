Airola, Daniel A.; Barrett, Reginald H. 1985. Foraging and habitat relationships of insect-gleaning birds in a Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forest. Condor. 87:205-216.

Study Location: central Sierra Nevada, California
Habitat Description: PIPO, PILA, ABCO, PSME, CADE, QUKE
Summary: Foraging habitat preferences, niche relationships, patterns of relative abundance vs. niche breadth and differences between migrant and resident species were examined for 12 species of insect gleaning birds in the Sierras. Tree species, and to a lesser extent, tree height were used selectively by the guild. Incense-cedar was avoided by all species, while other tree species were preferred by individual or groups of gleaners. In differentiating between niche of each species, foraging site was the most important foraging characteristic, followed by tree species, foraging technique, and foraging height. No correlation was found between niche breadth and species abundance, though a positive correlation existed for all 5 resident species.

Study Location: Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PSME and PIPO dominated
Summary: Birds were significantly more abundant in unlogged plots than modified plots, while composition overlapped. Species richness was more influenced by year than treatment. Birds gleaning on foliage or timber were most adversely affected by logging. Ground or slash foragers were much more abundant in harvested plots. Aerial foragers and most flycatchers were more abundant on logged plots. Cup nesting species were more abundant on unlogged plots.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location:northeast Washington
Habitat Description: mixed conifer, includes: PSME, PIPO, ABLA, PIEN, LAOC, PICO
Summary: This study examined bird use of burned and unburned forest in the winter season. Species richness was similar, but composition was distinctly different. Composition and abundance also changed with time; some species disappeared from the area while others moved in. Trunk and branch foraging species were more abundant in burned forest, though their abundance significantly decreased from the first to the fourth winter post-fire. Foraging behavior was documented for four woodpecker species within the burned area. Foraging took place on snags > 23 cm dbh.

Study Location: northeastern Oregon
Habitat Description: ABGR zone, includes PIPO, PSME, LAOC, PICO, ABGR
Summary: Bird communities and vegetation differences were examined in managed and old-growth stands. Three variables, including large snags, large trees, and understory tree components, appeared to be responsible for the higher abundance of some species in old growth forest. Species more abundant in managed forest appeared to be attracted to the open structure of managed stands. Managed forest supported more breeding birds, due largely to the abundance of a few species.

Study Location: Blue Mountains, OR
Habitat Description: ABGR
Summary: This case history (1) evaluates bird-habitat relationships in primarily grand fir forests. The goals of this study were to assess how forest stand structure influences habitat selection by birds, to investigate bird use of specific forest structural classes, and to relate bird habitat use to potential management options that consider breeding bird habitat.

Study Location: Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks, Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO, ABLA/PIEN
Summary: Bird density, composition, and diversity were monitored across a series of fire severities in burned PICO or spruce-fir forest in Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks. Highest populations and greatest biomass occurred from 5-29 years post-fire. Density, composition, and diversity on moderately burned spruce-fir-PICO were more like those on unburned spruce-fir than other seral stages. Changes in bird communities by feeding category were also examined. Overall, canopy closure was a habitat variable that appeared to affect avifauna more than the presence of fire.

Study Location: northwestern Montana
Habitat Description: LAOC cover type; includes ABLA, LAOC, PSME, PIEN, PICO, BEPA, aspen, cottonwood
Summary: Populations of 10 breeding bird species were monitored in harvested and immediately adjacent uncut areas. A number of species were more abundant in harvested areas. Responses by feeding and nesting guilds are also included. Foliage-foraging species and tree gleaners were less abundant in harvested areas, while flycatching and ground foragers were more common there. Conifer tree-nesting species were least abundant in clearcuts, while ground nesters were more common within the cutover habitats.Management recommendations are made, including the retention of broadleaf trees within cutting units and investigating the importance of slash piles in logged habitat. Slash piles were used by winter wrens, Townsend's solitaires, and dark-eyed juncos as perches, food sources, or nest sites.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.
