# Literature
Distribution
breeds in northeastern and parts of western USA; winters south in Mexico
General Habitat
second-growth woodlands, riparian areas, spruce bogs
Home or Activity Range
1-3 ac
Canopy Cover
found in areas with 0-39% canopy closure (Verner 1980); found in open, second-growth forests (Williams 1996)
Specific Habitat Preferences
pole-large trees; respond positively to edge; never found in unbroken forest; prefer shrubby or brushy areas
Nestsite Characteristics
ground nester; often found nesting in shrubby areas or riparian areas near PIPO/PSME forest
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
foliage gleans in shrubs and trees, and occasionally on branches or the trunk
Diet
adult and larval insects including flies, young grasshoppers, leaf hoppers, plant lice, caterpillars (i.e. spruce budworm), wood-boring beetles, and Douglas fir tussock moth egg masses
Predators
small owls, domestic cats
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
as a species favoring second-growth and cut-over areas, may actually benefit from cutting and lumbering in breeding range and be less vulnerable to habitat change than other neotropical migrants (Williams 1996)
Sources of Information used in the Model

General Sources of Background Information

Summaries of Specific Studies
Airola, Daniel A.; Barrett, Reginald H. 1985. Foraging and habitat relationships of insect-gleaning birds in a Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forest. Condor. 87:205-216.

Study Location: central Sierra Nevada, California
Habitat Description: PIPO, PILA, ABCO, PSME, CADE, QUKE
Summary: Foraging habitat preferences, niche relationships, patterns of relative abundance vs. niche breadth and differences between migrant and resident species were examined for 12 species of insect gleaning birds in the Sierras. Tree species, and to a lesser extent, tree height were used selectively by the guild. Incense-cedar was avoided by all species, while other tree species were preferred by individual or groups of gleaners. In differentiating between niche of each species, foraging site was the most important foraging characteristic, followed by tree species, foraging technique, and foraging height. No correlation was found between niche breadth and species abundance, though a positive correlation existed for all 5 resident species.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.

Study Location: throughout range
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Birds of North America species account for Nashville Warbler. Breeds in many areas including cut-over and second growth forest, open deciduous or mixed-species forest with high levels of light penetration and shrubby undergrowth. Never found in unbroken forest. Nests common in riparian habitat associated with PIPO and PSME forest.
