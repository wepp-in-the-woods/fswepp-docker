Response to Disturbance
favored 4-14 years post-fire as shrubs develop, aspen mature and most snags have fallen (Johnson and Wauer 1996); as time since wildfire increased from 8-15 years, a dense brush-field developed that encouraged abundance (Bock et al. 1978)

Study Location: California
Habitat Description: PIJE, ABCO, PIPO
Summary: Study compares work reported in Bock and Lynch 1970 on avian communities 8 years after wildfire to continuation data collected 15 years after the fire.  Bird diversity significantly dropped on burned plots compared to data collected 8 years after the fire. In general, using both data sets, there was a much greater change in species densities on burned plots than controls. Breeding bird populations of the burned and unburned forest were more similar 8 years after wildfire than 15 years after wildfire; the two communities lost rather than gained similarity over the seven year period. The authors attribute this pattern to the fact that forest structure 8 years after fire was more similar to unburned forest than the structure that existed 15 years after fire.

Study Location: southwest USA
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Review of the impacts of disturbance on songbirds in southwest PIPO forests. Includes how disturbances such as fire change forest vegetation and in turn how this change impacts difference life history traits of avian species. Many useful, explicitly referenced review tables including: Table 2. Response patterns of selected birds to fire in PIPO forest, Table 3. Abundance of bird species that occur in clearcut, partially cut, and uncut southwestern PIPO forest, Table 4. Effect of silvicultural treatment on avian abundance and diversity, Table 5.Bird species in ponderosa pine forests that nest primarily on the ground or in low shrubs, Table 6. Bird species that prefer open habitat or use meadows or clearings within the forest, Table 7. Bird species that use riparian zones adjacent to ponderosa pine for nesting and foraging.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Bandelier National Monument, NM
Habitat Description: PIPO, montane meadow, mixed conifer, pinyon-juniper
Summary: Breeding birds were surveyed before and for many years after a wildfire in Bandelier National Monument. Species diversity increased after the fire, but breeding populations in general declined for several years before increasing above prefire levels. This pattern was more pronounced on severely burned forest. In all but the severely burned forest, breeding bird diversity and populations were higher than prefire levels 14 years after the wildfire. Patterns are presented for different foraging and nesting guilds, as well as some individual species (including particular habitat changes that impacted bird species).

Study Location: Blue Mountains, OR
Habitat Description: ABGR
Summary: This case history (1) evaluates bird-habitat relationships in primarily grand fir forests. The goals of this study were to assess how forest stand structure influences habitat selection by birds, to investigate bird use of specific forest structural classes, and to relate bird habitat use to potential management options that consider breeding bird habitat.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.
