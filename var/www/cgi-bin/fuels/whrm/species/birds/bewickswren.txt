Distribution
year-round resident in Pacific coastal USA, as far north as southern British Columbia, east to Oklahoma and Texas, south into Mexico
General Habitat
dense, brushy habitats
Home or Activity Range
3-12 ac
Canopy Cover
No information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
prefers shrubby, dense thickets near open areas; responds positively to edge; prefers heterogeneous landscapes; needs cavities for nesting
Nestsite Characteristics
nests in any available cavity, including trees, man-made structures, logs, posts, baskets, rock crevices
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages on ground or shrubs and understory vegetation
Diet
mostly small insects and spiders such as beetles, leafhoppers, treehoppers, ants, wasps, caterpillars, moths, and grasshoppers; also seeds and some fruits 
Predators
snakes at nests; Accipiter hawks
Shelter Habitats
adults roost in depressions, cavities in trees, posts, vines, dense conifer foliage
Response to Disturbance
lower mean detection rate and % occurrence in clearcuts without snags (Marcot 1983); susceptible to nest parasitism by cowbirds, population decreases also attributed to increases in house wren populations (Kennedy and White 1997)
Sources of Information used in the Model
Marcot 1983, Kennedy and White 1997
General Sources of Background Information

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: throughout range
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Birds of North America species account for the Bewick's wren. Breeds in brushy areas, scrub and thickets in open country, open and riparian woodland, and chaparral. Breeding territories contain a mixture of thick scrubby vegetation and open woodland. In parts of western range, found in riparian areas with a dense understory. Forages for arthropods from weeds, brush and trees or base of shrubs. Nests in cavities in trees or rock crevices.

Study Location: northwestern California
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Bird abundance was compared in clearcut PSME forests where snags had been retained or removed. Nine species of primary and secondary cavity-nesting birds had a lower mean detection rate and percent occurrence in clearcuts where snags had been removed. One species, the chestnut-backed chickadee, increased in mean detection rate and percent occurrence in clearcuts without snags. The authors hypothesize that most cavity nesters shifted nesting to neighboring stands and used clearcut areas for foraging.
