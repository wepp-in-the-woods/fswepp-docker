Distribution
year-round resident west of the Rockies
General Habitat
locally common in chapparal, brushy ravines, mountain slopes
Home or Activity Range
5-650 ac
Canopy Cover
found in areas with 0-39% canopy closure (Verner 1980)
Specific Habitat Preferences
shrub-seedling-sapling stage, pole-medium sized trees, 0-39% canopy cover; prefers heterogeneous landscapes
Nestsite Characteristics
nests on ground sheltered by bushes, rocks, logs or grassy tussocks, often close to water; nest is lined with leaves, conifer needles and grass
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages on ground or shrubs and understory vegetation
Diet
Leaves, buds, acorns, flowers, fruits, and seeds of forbs, shrubs, and trees. Elderberry fruits in fall and fringecup and thistle seeds in summer were important Idaho foods. Frequently dig for bulbs of plants, such as fringecup. Other important species include smooth sumac, clover, common chickweed, vetch, poison oak seeds, hackberry, and snowberry. In western Oregon, exotic legumes are an important part of the diet. Seeds of Australian fireweed, bull thistle, tarweed, black raspberries, seed of poison oak
Predators
raptors and forest carnivores
Shelter Habitats
roosts on ground or low in shrubbery
Response to Disturbance
used logged areas during nesting season and summer, preferred cutover areas but also present on newly-logged areas (Hagar 1960)
Sources of Information used in the Model

General Sources of Background Information

Study Location: inner coast ranges of northwestern California
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Bird species were surveyed in cutover areas of PSME forest as well as virgin forest. Bird species are identified that prefer cutover forest, intact forest, or occur in both. Accounts of habitat preferences are given for several bird species, including detailed dietary information.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.
