Study Location: Alberta
Habitat Description:  not stated
Summary: Review of the literature pertaining to northern pygmy owls. Throughout its range, it appears that pygmy owls use a variety of forest types and may be considered a habitat generalist. They prefer areas of low to intermediate canopy closure and are most common near the edges of meadows, lakes and other clearings. They are rarely seen in dense forest, though dense forest may be used if it is interspersed with clearings as in Alberta. Records in the Alberta area suggest that a forest of mixed aspen and spruce represents suitable breeding habitat.

Summary:Resource partitioning at the macro- and microhabitat scale was studied for five abundant species of forest owls. Owls differed in habitat preferences as well as activity periods and food habits. Screech owls had the most restricted niche, while pygmy and great-horned owls were more generalist in habitat ust. Patterns of resource use was interpreted as resulting from environmental factors, morphological limitations, behavioral adaptations, and interspecific competition.

Study Location: west-central Montana
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: Examination of the diets of two sympatric, small owls. Pygmy-owls were found to have a significant avian component to their diets, while they also ate a large number of voles. Microtine voles were the most significant component of saw-whet owl diets.The authors could not conclude that diet is shaping the sympatric distribution of these two owls.

Study Location: Alberta
Habitat Description:  not stated: Alberta Foothills Natural Region
Summary: Authors investigated the distribution, abundance and habitat preferences for northern pygmy and barred owls along the edge of the Rocky Mountains southeast of Calgary. Spatial analysis showed that northern pygmy owls prefered older, structurally diverse mixedwood habitat, with line-of-sight enhanced by increased edge and terrain roughness.
