Response to Disturbance
attracted to areas clearcut 17 and 37 years previously (Austin and Perry 1979); more abundant in low shrub-, high shrub- and pole- stage clearcuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); nested almost exclusively in salvaged logged vs. unlogged forest 2-4 years after high-intensity wildfire (Saab and Dudley 1998); more common on harvest units (clearcut and shelterwood cut) than old growth or mature PSME (Moore 1992)

Study Location: Uinta Mountains, Utah
Habitat Description: PICO as main overstory tree; also includes PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Birds were censused in wet and dry meadows, mature and stagnated PICO stands, and regenerating PICO stands (17 and 37 years post-clearcut). The richest avifauna was found in the dry meadows. While a few birds were adversely affected by the clearcutting, many individual species were more numerous in the clearcuts, and the overall number of species was similar.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: Northwestern Montana
Habitat Description: LAOC, PSME
Summary: Characteristics of nest-hole trees are described. Nesters clearly preferred LAOC over PSME. PIPO was also preferred, though it was not abundant in the study area. Nearly as many live trees as dead snags were used. Average dbh of nest trees for a variety of species is listed. Some species, such as pileated woodpeckers and American kestrels, used only a small range of tree diameters, while others, like the yellow-bellied sapsucker and red-breasted nuthatch, were found in a variety of tree sizes.

Study Location: southwestern Montana
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Avian species composition and abundance were examined in old-growth, mature, and harvested PSME forest. The greatest total abundance was detected in the old-growth forest. In general, the old-growth contained the greatest number of species, though there was no detected difference in species richness between the stand types. Higher elevation old-growth stands contained a greater abundance of birds than the lower elevation old-growth stands. Trees with cavities were also examined in this study. The majority of cavity trees were old PSME with broken tops, and cavities tended to be located in the top one-third of the tree. Some primary and secondary cavity-nesting birds demonstrated dbh preferences for nest trees.

Study Location: Boise National Forest, southwestern Idaho
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME
Summary: The authors identified snag characteristics, including diameter and density, preferred by a number of cavity-nesting birds. Models of landscape-scale habitat preference were also presented for black-backed and Lewis's woodpeckers, and were consistent with findings at a smaller scale. As these two species represent opposite extremes of a continuum of habitat use amongst the birds studied, managing for these particular species will incorporate the needs of many other cavity-nesting birds.

Study Location: southwestern Idaho
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME
Summary: Cavity nesting birds were grouped as strong, weak or non-excavating species. Patterns of cavity occupancy were tied to various microhabitat features as well as temporal and spatial scales. Time since fire had the greatest influence on occupancy of nest cavities for all species; site characteristics were secondarily important. Prefered snag characteristics differed by type of excavator and changed over time. The majority of cavities (80%) were not reused. Both number of cavities and number of cavity-nesting birds increased with time since fire. The authors stress the ephemeral nature of fire-created habitat.

Study Location: Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: The requirements of cavity nesting birds were examined, with an emphasis on the impact of logging and snag removal on cavity nesting birds. For nest sites, birds usually selected PIPO snags >18" dbh that had been dead for at least six years and had >40% bark cover. A few species responded to logging and snag removal. The most heavily impacted birds were those that nested in PIPO. The density of cavity nesting birds decreased by 53% on those stands that had been treated. The authors recommend a snag density of 2.6 snags/acre, with snags >19" dbh.

Study Location: Olympic National Forest, northwest Washington
Habitat Description: THPL-PSME zone
Summary: Breeding populations of cavity-nesting birds were examined across four forest successional stages with varying snag densities. Species richness, diversity, and density increased with snag density. Nest site preferences for some species are given. Overall, larger taller snags with broken tops were preferred by cavity nesters. Management recommendations are made, including a minimum number of hard and soft snags per hectare, and size and species suggestions.
