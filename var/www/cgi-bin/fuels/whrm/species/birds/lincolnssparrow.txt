Response to Disturbance
more abundant in high shrub-stage clearcuts and equally abundant on low-shrub stage clearcuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); more abundant in old-growth PSME stands than mature PSME or harvest (clearcut or shelterwood cut) units (Moore 1992)

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: southwestern Montana
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Avian species composition and abundance were examined in old-growth, mature, and harvested PSME forest. The greatest total abundance was detected in the old-growth forest. In general, the old-growth contained the greatest number of species, though there was no detected difference in species richness between the stand types. Higher elevation old-growth stands contained a greater abundance of birds than the lower elevation old-growth stands. Trees with cavities were also examined in this study. The majority of cavity trees were old PSME with broken tops, and cavities tended to be located in the top one-third of the tree. Some primary and secondary cavity-nesting birds demonstrated dbh preferences for nest trees.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.
