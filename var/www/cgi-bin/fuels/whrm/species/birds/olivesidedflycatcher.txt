Distribution
breeds across most of Alaska and Canada and western USA, New England
General Habitat
shrub-forest ecotonal habitats; recently burned forest
Home or Activity Range
20-110 ac
Canopy Cover
preference for open canopy (Verner 1980 (0-39%), Beedy 1981)
Specific Habitat Preferences
large trees, open canopy cover; prefers high-contrast edges; strongly prefers heterogeneous landscapes
Nestsite Characteristics
nests in overstory, usually on horizontal branch of conifer; nest lined with lichen, grass, roots, twigs, weeds, and pine needles
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
needs exposed perches from which to hawk insects; often uses dead tree tops or snags; the presence of trees or snags significantly taller than surrounding canopy  appears to be a crucial feature
Diet
variety of flying insects, especially honey bees and flying ants
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
responded positively to single-tree selective logging (Medin and Booth 1989); responded positively to fire (Sallabanks et al. 2003), more abundant in early post-fire conditions (Hutto 1995), favored 2-4 years post-fire as snags fall, wood insects decline (Johnson and Wauer 1996); more abundant in low shrub- and high shrub-stage clearcuts and partial cuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); found in stands as mature "yellow" PIPO densities increased to 8 trees/acre (Keller 1992); when observed, recorded in thinned and burned PIPO sites but not controls (Woolf 2003)

Study Location: central Sierra Nevada
Habitat Description: mixed conifer (PIJE, PICO, ABCO, CADE) and ABMA stands
Summary: Bird communities in open- and closed-canopy stands in two forest types were compared. Closed-canopy forest had lower bird densities, diversities, species richness, and consuming biomasses than open-canopy forests in both vegetative zones. With the exception of hummingbirds, all feeding guilds were present on each transect, though the reduction in understory vegetation and forest clearings in closed-canopy forest caused pronounced decreases in three understory guilds as well as in the flycatchers.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: western Montana and northern Wyoming
Habitat Description: range of habitat types: includes PIPO, PSME, LAOC, PICO, PIAL, PIFL, Picea sp,, ABLA, ABGR, THPL, aspen, cottonwood
Summary: Fifteen bird species are generally more abundant in early post-fire communities than in any other cover type in the northern Rockies (includes olive-sided flycatcher, three-toed woodpecker, black-backed woodpecker, Clark's nutcracker, mountain bluebird, red crossbill, Cassin's finch, pine siskin, American robin, dark-eyed junco, yellow-rumped warbler). Six species (common nighthawk, calliope hummingbird, northern flicker, Stellar's jay, orange-crowned warbler, chipping sparrow) were most abundant in stands 10-40 years post-fire. Three species (American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, dark-eyed junco) were detected in early an mid-successional burned forest 100% of the time. One species, the black-backed woodpecker, was restricted to standing dead forest created by stand-replacing fires. Bird communities are different in recently burned forest, primarily because members of three feeding guilds (woodpeckers, flycatchers, and seedeaters) are especially abundant. Larger-diameter (>10 cm dbh) PP, DF, and LAOC were most often used for feeding by woodpeckers. Standing, fire-killed trees were used by the majority of birds nesting in recently burned forest. Many of the structures used in nesting (broken-topped snags) were present before the fire. Large-scale, stand-replacing fire may be necessary for long-term maintenance of many bird populations. Commentary is offered on the need to alter present fire and post-fire forest management.

Study Location: Bandelier National Monument, NM
Habitat Description: PIPO, montane meadow, mixed conifer, pinyon-juniper
Summary: Breeding birds were surveyed before and for many years after a wildfire in Bandelier National Monument. Species diversity increased after the fire, but breeding populations in general declined for several years before increasing above prefire levels. This pattern was more pronounced on severely burned forest. In all but the severely burned forest, breeding bird diversity and populations were higher than prefire levels 14 years after the wildfire. Patterns are presented for different foraging and nesting guilds, as well as some individual species (including particular habitat changes that impacted bird species).

Study Location: Coconino and Kaibab National Forest, northern Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: The overstory of mature PIPO forest and the presence of snags influenced bird communities in pole-sized PIPO stands in northern Arizona. Study areas containing pure pole-sized trees and no snags had the lowest numbers of insectivorous birds; study areas with the most insectivorous bird diversity contained at least 14 mature PIPO trees/acre and at least 2 snags/acre. The greatest number of birds were detected in stands containing 8-10 mature PIPO trees/acre and no snags. PIPO overstory also influenced both coniferous forest-nesting birds and primary cavity-nesting birds. The presence of snags influenced secondary cavity-nesters. Overall, this study suggests that a homogenous forest of young PIPO stands lacking in snags is not desirable for maintaining healthy bird species diversity.

Study Location: Idaho
Habitat Description: PSME, PIPO
Summary: Populations of birds and small mammals were monitored in conjunction with a single-tree selection logging operation. Total numbers of breeding birds remained relatively stable, but some individual species responded either positively or negatively to the treatment. Timber gleaners were the only feeding guild adversely affected by the logging treatment. Secondary cavity nesters were the only nesting guild adversely affected by the logging treatment. The most notable small mammal response was the positive response of yellow-pine chipmunks to the treatment. Fewer deer mice were found in the treatment area.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.

Woolf, Jennifer. 2003. The effects of thinning and prescribed fire on birds, small mammals, and avian species composition. Missoula, MT: University of Montana. 93 p. M.S. Thesis.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Stands in western Montana underwent PIPO restoration treatments that included selective tree removal followed by a prescribed burn. Bird and small mammal populations were monitored on these and control sites. While some bird species showed a preference for treated vs. untreated stands, the treatment did not have major effects on avian species composition. The foraging behavior of bark-gleaning birds was also examined on treated vs. untreated sites. Birds selectively foraged on larger trees, with PIPO preferred to PSME in this study area. Thinning and burning is compatible with providing forage substrates for the species in this area, as the encounter rate for bark-gleaners was higher in the treated sites. Small mammal communities changed in both abundance and composition as a result of treatment, with deer mice exhibiting the most positive response to treatment.
