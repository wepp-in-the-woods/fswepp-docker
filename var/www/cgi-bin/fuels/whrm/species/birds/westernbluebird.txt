Response to Disturbance
sensitive to snag removal (Balda 1975), increased steadily post-fire  (Johnson and Wauer 1996); population lowest 2 years post-fire (Johnson and Wauer 1996) ; will switch nesting habitat to live trees post-snag removal; lower mean detection rate and % occurrence in clearcuts without snags (Marcot 1983); more abundant on logged plots  (Szaro and Balda 1986); more abundant in early post-fire conditions (Hutto 1995), favored 1-2 years post-fire due to an open understory (Johnson and Wauer 1996); more abundant in partial cuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); in stands undergoing PIPO restoration techniques, the number of fledglings per nest, the probability of a nest surviving to fledge at least one young, and parasite loading was greater than in untreated forest (Germaine and Germaine 2002)

Balda, Russell P. 1975. The relationship of secondary cavity nesters to snag densities in western coniferous forests. Wildlife Habitat Bulletin No. 1. Albuquerque, NM: USDA Forest Service, Southwestern Region. 37 p.

Study Location: Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: The habitat needs and roles of secondary cavity nesters are examined in PIPO forests by compiling information from a variety of studies in Arizona. The density of secondary cavity nesters was determined and their importance in local ecology is addressed. Food guilds are outlined. Territory size and snag foraging behavior are outlined for a few species. The impact of snag removal is also discussed; snag removal resulted in a significant loss of breeding bird diversity as well as a decrease in the in the density of secondary cavity nesters. Species are ranked by their sensitivity to snag removal. Finally, the author outlines minimum snag densities that are appropriate for supporting secondary cavity nesters. The author concludes that 268 snags should be maintained for every 100 acres of forest.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Snags used by secondary cavity nesters (SCN) in PP forests were evaluated for their characteristics. The majority of used snags were > 60cm dbh, >20 m tall, were mostly covered in bark, had bark near the cavity entrance, and had broken tops. The largest and tallest snags available were chosen. SCNs preferred snags that were dead 5- 20 years ago, with the exception of the pygmy nuthatch that preferred older snags. Snag density accounted for more than half the variability in density of SCNs. Removal of snags in coniferous forests would have a serious negative effect on the density of SCNs.

Habitat Description: PIPO, QUGA, RONE (New Mexico locust)
Summary: The impact of forest restoration treatments on the nesting success of Western bluebirds was studied in northwestern Arizona. There was no effect on clutch size and little effect on number of nestlings per nest. However, in treated forest stands, the number of fledglings per nest was 1.6 time greater and the probability of a nest surviving to fledge at least one young was up to 4.2 times greater than in untreated forest. The authors attribute this pattern to greater predation rates in untreated forest. The authors speculate that treatment techniques such as prescribed burning may have caused high mortality of predator species, including snakes. The average number of nests infested with a blowfly parasite, as well as the number of parasites per fledgling, was much higher in treated forest. In general, it appears that forest restoration treatments lead to a higher success of fledging young, but also increase the risk of parasitic infection. The implications of this pattern on post-fledgling survival are unknown.

Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Habitat Description: range of habitat types: includes PIPO, PSME, LAOC, PICO, PIAL, PIFL, Picea sp,, ABLA, ABGR, THPL, aspen, cottonwood
Summary: Fifteen bird species are generally more abundant in early post-fire communities than in any other cover type in the northern Rockies (includes olive-sided flycatcher, three-toed woodpecker, black-backed woodpecker, Clark's nutcracker, mountain bluebird, red crossbill, Cassin's finch, pine siskin, American robin, dark-eyed junco, yellow-rumped warbler). Six species (common nighthawk, calliope hummingbird, northern flicker, Stellar's jay, orange-crowned warbler, chipping sparrow) were most abundant in stands 10-40 years post-fire. Three species (American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, dark-eyed junco) were detected in early an mid-successional burned forest 100% of the time. One species, the black-backed woodpecker, was restricted to standing dead forest created by stand-replacing fires. Bird communities are different in recently burned forest, primarily because members of three feeding guilds (woodpeckers, flycatchers, and seedeaters) are especially abundant. Larger-diameter (>10 cm dbh) PP, DF, and LAOC were most often used for feeding by woodpeckers. Standing, fire-killed trees were used by the majority of birds nesting in recently burned forest. Many of the structures used in nesting (broken-topped snags) were present before the fire. Large-scale, stand-replacing fire may be necessary for long-term maintenance of many bird populations. Commentary is offered on the need to alter present fire and post-fire forest management.

Study Location: central Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO, ABCO, PSME, PIST, aspen, Gambel oak
Summary: Habitat features for successful and unsuccessful nest sites, nest sites vs. random sites, and differences among coexisting species of cavity nesting birds were identified. Species-specific characteristics are presented both for nest site and nest tree; birds differed in some of their habitat preferences. Aspen (mostly dead) were a preferred nesting species and were common in foraging patches, despite their low density in the study area. High density of aspen provides both more nesting sites and protects nests from predation, as predators have to search more sites to find nests. Foraging areas also had more conifers and fewer deciduous trees (other than aspen) than random areas. Preference for conifers is attributed to increased foraging opportunities.Failed nests were surrounded by denser foliage and were closer to conifers. Reduced nest success was also linked to lower nest height. Nonexcavating species had lower nesting success than excavator species.

Study Location: northwestern California
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Bird abundance was compared in clearcut PSME forests where snags had been retained or removed. Nine species of primary and secondary cavity-nesting birds had a lower mean detection rate and percent occurrence in clearcuts where snags had been removed. One species, the chestnut-backed chickadee, increased in mean detection rate and percent occurrence in clearcuts without snags. The authors hypothesize that most cavity nesters shifted nesting to neighboring stands and used clearcut areas for foraging.

Study Location: southwestern Idaho
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME
Summary: Cavity nesting birds were grouped as strong, weak or non-excavating species. Patterns of cavity occupancy were tied to various microhabitat features as well as temporal and spatial scales. Time since fire had the greatest influence on occupancy of nest cavities for all species; site characteristics were secondarily important. Prefered snag characteristics differed by type of excavator and changed over time. The majority of cavities (80%) were not reused. Both number of cavities and number of cavity-nesting birds increased with time since fire. The authors stress the ephemeral nature of fire-created habitat.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Seasonal avian communities were examined for their response to weather condition and treatment (logging) effects. While birds responded to climate, most notably precipitation, treatment effects appeared to be more influential. Species preferring open habitat (rock wren, American robin, western wood pe-wee and western bluebird) were highest on medium and heavy cut stands. Treated stands also had the highest abundance of chipping sparrows, broad-tailed hummingbirds, Grace's warbler, and dark-eyed juncos. Species preferring dense foliage (western flycatcher, pygmy nuthatch, red-faced warbler, hermit thrush, black-headed grosbeak) were less abundant in modified habitats.

Study Location: Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks, Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO, ABLA/PIEN
Summary: Bird density, composition, and diversity were monitored across a series of fire severities in burned PICO or spruce-fir forest in Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks. Highest populations and greatest biomass occurred from 5-29 years post-fire. Density, composition, and diversity on moderately burned spruce-fir-PICO were more like those on unburned spruce-fir than other seral stages. Changes in bird communities by feeding category were also examined. Overall, canopy closure was a habitat variable that appeared to affect avifauna more than the presence of fire.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.

Study Location: Olympic National Forest, northwest Washington
Habitat Description: THPL-PSME zone
Summary: Breeding populations of cavity-nesting birds were examined across four forest successional stages with varying snag densities. Species richness, diversity, and density increased with snag density. Nest site preferences for some species are given. Overall, larger taller snags with broken tops were preferred by cavity nesters. Management recommendations are made, including a minimum number of hard and soft snags per hectare, and size and species suggestions.
