Response to Disturbance
favored 2-4 years post-fire as snags fall, wood insects decline (Johnson and Wauer 1996); disfavored 4-14 years post-fire due to an increase in shrubs, mature aspen, most snags fallen (Johnson and Wauer 1996); responded positively 1-3 years post-fire; increased one year post-prescribed burn (Bock and Bock 1983); attracted to areas clearcut 17 and 37 years previously (Austin and Perry 1979); more abundant in low shrub-, high shrub-, and pole-stage clearcuts and partial cuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995);  as time since wildfire increased from 8-15 years, a dense brush-field developed that inhibited ground-foraging (Bock et al. 1978)

Study Location: Uinta Mountains, Utah
Habitat Description: PICO as main overstory tree; also includes PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Birds were censused in wet and dry meadows, mature and stagnated PICO stands, and regenerating PICO stands (17 and 37 years post-clearcut). The richest avifauna was found in the dry meadows. While a few birds were adversely affected by the clearcutting, many individual species were more numerous in the clearcuts, and the overall number of species was similar.

Study Location: California
Habitat Description: PIJE, ABCO, PIPO
Summary: Study compares work reported in Bock and Lynch 1970 on avian communities 8 years after wildfire to continuation data collected 15 years after the fire.  Bird diversity significantly dropped on burned plots compared to data collected 8 years after the fire. In general, using both data sets, there was a much greater change in species densities on burned plots than controls. Breeding bird populations of the burned and unburned forest were more similar 8 years after wildfire than 15 years after wildfire; the two communities lost rather than gained similarity over the seven year period. The authors attribute this pattern to the fact that forest structure 8 years after fire was more similar to unburned forest than the structure that existed 15 years after fire.

Study Location: Black Hills, South Dakota
Habitat Description: PIPO, pine-grassland savannah
Summary: Bird and deer mouse abundance was examined 1 and 2 years post-prescribed fire. Bird species composition was similar between burned and control plots. However, 7 bird species (American robin, Mountain bluebird, Solitary vireo, Yellow-rumped warbler, Western tanager, Dark-eyed junco, Chipping sparrow) were more abundant on burned plots the first year post-fire. In the second year post-fire, only one species was more abundant on the burns (Vesper sparrow), while 2 were more common on the controls (American robin, red-breasted nuthatch). Deer mice were similarly more abundant on burned plots the first year post-fire, but were not so the second year. The major difference in vegetation post-fire was the reduction of litter and small pines in the burned areas. The authors attribute the observed patterns of wildlife abundance to a temporary increase in the quantity or quality of local food supply as opposed to the documented changes in vegetative structure.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: Bandelier National Monument, NM
Habitat Description: PIPO, montane meadow, mixed conifer, pinyon-juniper
Summary: Breeding birds were surveyed before and for many years after a wildfire in Bandelier National Monument. Species diversity increased after the fire, but breeding populations in general declined for several years before increasing above prefire levels. This pattern was more pronounced on severely burned forest. In all but the severely burned forest, breeding bird diversity and populations were higher than prefire levels 14 years after the wildfire. Patterns are presented for different foraging and nesting guilds, as well as some individual species (including particular habitat changes that impacted bird species).

Study Location: southwestern Idaho
Habitat Description: PIPO/PSME
Summary: The responses of nine cavity-nesting bird species to high-intensity wildfire with three post-fire treatments were studied in southwestern Idaho. In general, nesting continues increased up to four years after wildfire. Among treatments, overall densities were similar though species composition varied. All bird species selected nest sites with higher tree densities than that measured at random sites, and cavity-nesters as a group selected clumps of snags rather than snags that were retained in uniform, evenly-spaced distributions. Larger-diameter, more heavily decayed snags were chosen by cavity-nesters. Most used trees also had broken tops that pre-dated the wildfire. Also includes a table predicting the response of 11 bird species to high-intensity fire, prescribed fire with stand management, and fire suppression.

Study Location: southwestern Idaho
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME
Summary: Cavity nesting birds were grouped as strong, weak or non-excavating species. Patterns of cavity occupancy were tied to various microhabitat features as well as temporal and spatial scales. Time since fire had the greatest influence on occupancy of nest cavities for all species; site characteristics were secondarily important. Prefered snag characteristics differed by type of excavator and changed over time. The majority of cavities (80%) were not reused. Both number of cavities and number of cavity-nesting birds increased with time since fire. The authors stress the ephemeral nature of fire-created habitat.

Study Location: Blue Mountains, OR
Habitat Description: ABGR
Summary: This case history (1) evaluates bird-habitat relationships in primarily grand fir forests. The goals of this study were to assess how forest stand structure influences habitat selection by birds, to investigate bird use of specific forest structural classes, and to relate bird habitat use to potential management options that consider breeding bird habitat.
