Response to Disturbance
population peak 4 years post-fire  (Johnson and Wauer 1996); less abundant in low shrub-stage clearcuts and more abundant in high shrub-stage clearcuts and partial cuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995)more abundant in old-growth and mature PSME stand than harvest (clearcut or shelterwood cut) units (Moore 1992)

Study Location: central Sierra Nevada, California
Habitat Description: PIPO, PILA, ABCO, PSME, CADE, QUKE
Summary: Foraging habitat preferences, niche relationships, patterns of relative abundance vs. niche breadth and differences between migrant and resident species were examined for 12 species of insect gleaning birds in the Sierras. Tree species, and to a lesser extent, tree height were used selectively by the guild. Incense-cedar was avoided by all species, while other tree species were preferred by individual or groups of gleaners. In differentiating between niche of each species, foraging site was the most important foraging characteristic, followed by tree species, foraging technique, and foraging height. No correlation was found between niche breadth and species abundance, though a positive correlation existed for all 5 resident species.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: Bandelier National Monument, NM
Habitat Description: PIPO, montane meadow, mixed conifer, pinyon-juniper
Summary: Breeding birds were surveyed before and for many years after a wildfire in Bandelier National Monument. Species diversity increased after the fire, but breeding populations in general declined for several years before increasing above prefire levels. This pattern was more pronounced on severely burned forest. In all but the severely burned forest, breeding bird diversity and populations were higher than prefire levels 14 years after the wildfire. Patterns are presented for different foraging and nesting guilds, as well as some individual species (including particular habitat changes that impacted bird species).

Study Location: Lolo National Forest, western Montana
Habitat Description: mix from PIPO-PIEN-ABLA
Summary: This one-year study examined the habitat requirements of seven open nesting birds typically found in mature forest. Habitat preferences for each species are noted. In general, structural complexity was of high importance; canopy cover, shrub cover and number of large-diameter stems were often included in predictive models. Management recommendations are made for individual species as well as for the general avian community studied.

Study Location: southwestern Montana
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Avian species composition and abundance were examined in old-growth, mature, and harvested PSME forest. The greatest total abundance was detected in the old-growth forest. In general, the old-growth contained the greatest number of species, though there was no detected difference in species richness between the stand types. Higher elevation old-growth stands contained a greater abundance of birds than the lower elevation old-growth stands. Trees with cavities were also examined in this study. The majority of cavity trees were old PSME with broken tops, and cavities tended to be located in the top one-third of the tree. Some primary and secondary cavity-nesting birds demonstrated dbh preferences for nest trees.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: riparian woodland: black cottonwood, PIPO, aspen
Summary: The habitats and spatial relationships of warbling and red-eyed vireos was studied. Intraspecific territorial overlap was virtually non-existent. Red-eyed vireos preferred habitat with denser cover than warbling vireos. Red-eyed vireos foraged in the middle of trees, and used aspen more than warbling vireos. Both species sang primarily from the top of trees.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.

Study Location: range of Mexican spotted owl; case studies in northern Arizona and New Mexico
Habitat Description: not stated; PIPO
Summary: Literature review and synthesis of data from past studies concerning the ecology of prey of the Mexican Spotted Owl, including information on owl diet, identification of prey that might influence owl fitness, and quantification of habitat correlates of prey species. The authors found variation in diet regionally. Reproductive success of spotted owls was not linked to any single prey species, rather to many species in combination, or total prey biomass. However, certain species may be more important in specific regions. Overall, food resources were quite variable among vegetation communities and through time. Owl food is most abundant during the summer when young are being raised. Prey biomass decreases in late fall and early winter. Habitat correlates are presented from one study in northern Arizona (deer mouse, brush mouse, Mexican woodrat) and one in New Mexico.
