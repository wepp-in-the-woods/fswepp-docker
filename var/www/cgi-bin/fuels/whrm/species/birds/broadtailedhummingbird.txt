Distribution
breeds along Rocky Mountain chain south into Mexico; common in southern and central Rockies and Great Basin mountains
General Habitat
open pine and pine-oak woodlands and edges
Home or Activity Range
0.5-2 ha
Canopy Cover
preference for open canopy (Szaro and Balda 1986)
Specific Habitat Preferences
proximity to mountain streams; defends flower patches
Nestsite Characteristics
nests in horizontal tree branch or fork, usually near or over mountain streams
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages in foliage for nectar
Diet
plucks insects and spiders from webs, also eats nectar and sap
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
more abundant on logged plots  (Szaro and Balda 1986); favored 1-2 years post-fire due to abundant nutrients, vigorous herbaceous growth and seed production (Johnson and Wauer 1996); more abundant in low shrub- and high shrub-stage clearcuts and partial cuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); highest density on irregular strip shelterwood and severely thinned plots (Szaro and Balda 1979)

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Bird species diversity and species richness were not significantly affected by forest cutting and logging except in a clearcut treatment. Bird population densities significantly increased on silviculturally cut and irregular strip shelterwood plots and significantly decreased  on the severely thinned and clearcut plots. Impact on individual species is discussed.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Seasonal avian communities were examined for their response to weather condition and treatment (logging) effects. While birds responded to climate, most notably precipitation, treatment effects appeared to be more influential. Species preferring open habitat (rock wren, American robin, western wood pee-wee and western bluebird) were highest on medium and heavy cut stands. Treated stands also had the highest abundance of chipping sparrows, broad-tailed hummingbirds, Grace's warbler, and dark-eyed juncos. Species preferring dense foliage (western flycatcher, pygmy nuthatch, red-faced warbler, hermit thrush, black-headed grosbeak) were less abundant in modified habitats.
