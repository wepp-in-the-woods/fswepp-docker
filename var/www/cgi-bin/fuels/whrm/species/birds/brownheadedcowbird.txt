Distribution
widespread over most of N. America
General Habitat
common in woodlands, forest edge, agricultural areas, and around human habitation
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Canopy Cover
No information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
no information available
Nestsite Characteristics
parasitic nester
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forage on the ground, rarely in vegetation, and often in agricultural lands, near livestock, or in open country.
Diet
seeds, mostly grasses such as bristle grass, ragweed, cereal grains, knotweed, panicgrass, doveweed, and timothy; as well as insects and invertebrates such as beetles, caterpillars, spiders, and myriapods; and eggs from parasitized nests
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
increased post-fire (Johnson and Wauer 1996); less abundant in low shrub-stage clearcuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); more abundant in old-growth PSME stands than mature PSME or harvest (clearcut or shelterwood cut) units (Moore 1992)
Sources of Information used in the Model

General Sources of Background Information
Moore 1992, Hejl et al. 1995, Johnson and Wauer 1996, National Geographic Society 1996, Alsop 2001, reviewed in O'Neil et al. 2001, Fischer et al. 2002

Study Location: Colorado
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME
Summary: Nests of western tanagers were located in PIPO and PSME trees. Nests were placed near the midpoint of branches in areas of high canopy cover in the middle section of nest trees. Nesting success varied widely annually (11.3% vs. 75.3%). Predation was the primary cause of nest failure. Parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds occurred in 41% of the nests, dramatically reducing clutch size in the parasitized nests.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: Bandelier National Monument, NM
Habitat Description: PIPO, montane meadow, mixed conifer, pinyon-juniper
Summary: Breeding birds were surveyed before and for many years after a wildfire in Bandelier National Monument. Species diversity increased after the fire, but breeding populations in general declined for several years before increasing above prefire levels. This pattern was more pronounced on severely burned forest. In all but the severely burned forest, breeding bird diversity and populations were higher than prefire levels 14 years after the wildfire. Patterns are presented for different foraging and nesting guilds, as well as some individual species (including particular habitat changes that impacted bird species).
