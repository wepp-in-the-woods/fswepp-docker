Study Location: western slope of Sierra Nevada, California
Habitat Description: CALO, PSME, ABCO, PIPO, PILA, QUKE
Summary: Brown creepers and red-breasted nuthatches were studied for one year in the Sierra Nevada. Both species showed a preference for diverse structure typical of mature mixed-conifer forests. Stand use by both species was correlated to basal area of sugar pine. Creepers showed a preference for foraging on incense cedar, while nuthatches used a variety of tree species. Creepers varied the size of the tree they foraged on seasonally, while nuthatches did not. Creepers spent the majority of time foraging on tree trunks, while nuthatches were more variable in their use of substrates, including time foraging on small branches. These habitat associations and seasonal habitat variation are attributed to the presence of arthropod prey species.

Study Location: central Sierra Nevada, California
Habitat Description: PIPO, PILA, ABCO, PSME, CADE, QUKE
Summary: Foraging habitat preferences, niche relationships, patterns of relative abundance vs. niche breadth and differences between migrant and resident species were examined for 12 species of insect gleaning birds in the Sierras. Tree species, and to a lesser extent, tree height were used selectively by the guild. Incense-cedar was avoided by all species, while other tree species were preferred by individual or groups of gleaners. In differentiating between niche of each species, foraging site was the most important foraging characteristic, followed by tree species, foraging technique, and foraging height. No correlation was found between niche breadth and species abundance, though a positive correlation existed for all 5 resident species.

Study Location: Uinta Mountains, Utah
Habitat Description: PICO as main overstory tree; also includes PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Birds were censused in wet and dry meadows, mature and stagnated PICO stands, and regenerating PICO stands (17 and 37 years post-clearcut). The richest avifauna was found in the dry meadows. While a few birds were adversely affected by the clearcutting, many individual species were more numerous in the clearcuts, and the overall number of species was similar.

Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Bird species were surveyed in cutover areas of PSME forest as well as virgin forest. Bird species are identified that prefer cutover forest, intact forest, or occur in both. Accounts of habitat preferences are given for several bird species, including detailed dietary information.

Study Location: northeast Washington
Habitat Description: mixed conifer, includes: PSME, PIPO, ABLA, PIEN, LAOC, PICO
Summary: This study examined bird use of burned and unburned forest in the winter season. Species richness was similar, but composition was distinctly different. Composition and abundance also changed with time; some species disappeared from the area while others moved in. Trunk and branch foraging species were more abundant in burned forest, though their abundance significantly decreased from the first to the fourth winter post-fire. Foraging behavior was documented for four woodpecker species within the burned area. Foraging took place on snags > 23 cm dbh.

Study Location: Modoc and Lassen National forests, northern California
Habitat Description: PIPO, Jeffrey Pine
Summary: The snags containing nests of four specific cavity-nesting birds were examined for various features. Snags with nests tended to be larger and taller than random alternative snags. The author also examines historical cavity usage and suggests management implication of snag retention.

Study Location: central Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO, ABCO, PSME, PIST, aspen, Gambel oak
Summary: Habitat features for successful and unsuccessful nest sites, nest sites vs. random sites, and differences among coexisting species of cavity nesting birds were identified. Species-specific characteristics are presented both for nest site and nest tree; birds differed in some of their habitat preferences. Aspen (mostly dead) were a preferred nesting species and were common in foraging patches, despite their low density in the study area. High density of aspen provides both more nesting sites and protects nests from predation, as predators have to search more sites to find nests. Foraging areas also had more conifers and fewer deciduous trees (other than aspen) than random areas. Preference for conifers is attributed to increased foraging opportunities.Failed nests were surrounded by denser foliage and were closer to conifers. Reduced nest success was also linked to lower nest height. Nonexcavating species had lower nesting success than excavator species.

Study Location: northeastern Oregon
Habitat Description: ABGR zone, includes PIPO, PSME, LAOC, PICO, ABGR
Summary: Bird communities and vegetation differences were examined in managed and old-growth stands. Three variables, including large snags, large trees, and understory tree components, appeared to be responsible for the higher abundance of some species in old growth forest. Species more abundant in managed forest appeared to be attracted to the open structure of managed stands. Managed forest supported more breeding birds, due largely to the abundance of a few species.

Study Location: Northwestern Montana
Habitat Description: LAOC, PSME
Summary: Characteristics of nest-hole trees are described. Nesters clearly preferred LAOC over PSME. PIPO was also preferred, though it was not abundant in the study area. Nearly as many live trees as dead snags were used. Average dbh of nest trees for a variety of species is listed. Some species, such as pileated woodpeckers and American kestrels, used only a small range of tree diameters, while others, like the yellow-bellied sapsucker and red-breasted nuthatch, were found in a variety of tree sizes.

Study Location: Idaho
Habitat Description: PSME, PIPO
Summary: Populations of birds and small mammals were monitored in conjunction with a single-tree selection logging operation. Total numbers of breeding birds remained relatively stable, but some individual species responded either positively or negatively to the treatment. Timber gleaners were the only feeding guild adversely affected by the logging treatment. Secondary cavity nesters were the only nesting guild adversely affected by the logging treatment. The most notable small mammal response was the positive response of yellow-pine chipmunks to the treatment. Fewer deer mice were found in the treatment area.

Study Location: South Dakota
Habitat Description: PIPO, aspen/birch
Summary: Habitat relations of breeding songbirds were examined in PIPO and aspen/birch forests at three scales: in two vegetation types, structural stages within vegetation types, and vegetative structure. Species richness was greater in the aspen/birch forest type, which the authors attribute to greater invertebrate food resources. A number of species differed depending on overstory canopy closure. A few species were associated with snag presence.

Study Location: southwestern Montana
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Avian species composition and abundance were examined in old-growth, mature, and harvested PSME forest. The greatest total abundance was detected in the old-growth forest. In general, the old-growth contained the greatest number of species, though there was no detected difference in species richness between the stand types. Higher elevation old-growth stands contained a greater abundance of birds than the lower elevation old-growth stands. Trees with cavities were also examined in this study. The majority of cavity trees were old PSME with broken tops, and cavities tended to be located in the top one-third of the tree. Some primary and secondary cavity-nesting birds demonstrated dbh preferences for nest trees.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: PSME, LAOC, PICO, PIEN, PIPO, ABLA, ABGR, THPL, PIMO, aspen, birch
Summary: A comparison of bird communities was performed between control sites and those undergoing traditional overstory removal harvests and those harvested using "New Forestry" techniques. Only four species showed significant differences in abundance between treatments, though the author suspects that other trends in the data would be clearer with additional post-treatment data. In general, for species that did differ in abundance, numbers in New Forestry stands were intermediate between overstory removal and controls. Foliage foragers declined similarly in both harvest types, while ground foragers increased. Conifer nesters decreased similarly in both harvest types, while ground nesters increased. Important habitat variables for a number of species are given.

Study Location: Blue Mountains, OR
Habitat Description: ABGR
Summary: This case history (1) evaluates bird-habitat relationships in primarily grand fir forests. The goals of this study were to assess how forest stand structure influences habitat selection by birds, to investigate bird use of specific forest structural classes, and to relate bird habitat use to potential management options that consider breeding bird habitat.

Study Location: southeastern British Columbia
Habitat Description: mature second growth: PSME, PICO, LAOC; small numbers of THPL, TSHE, PIPO, aspen paper birch
Summary: Cavity nesting of red-breasted nuthatches was influenced by both forest structure and the disease agents that contribute to it. They nested at higher densities on cutbacks with more dead trees and higher levels of root disease (Armillaria). Relative to their availability, nuthatches preferred to nest in PSME, LAOC, and paper birch and avoided PICO. There was also a strong preference for dead trees. Nuthatches preferred to nest in snags with broken tops and with greater height and dbh. Trees with root disease and/or dwarf mistletoe infestation and slightly more sapwood decay than random trees were preferentially selected. Management techniques to retain snags and diseased trees as nuthatch habitat are presented.

Study Location: Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks, Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO, ABLA/PIEN
Summary: Bird density, composition, and diversity were monitored across a series of fire severities in burned PICO or spruce-fir forest in Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks. Highest populations and greatest biomass occurred from 5-29 years post-fire. Density, composition, and diversity on moderately burned spruce-fir-PICO were more like those on unburned spruce-fir than other seral stages. Changes in bird communities by feeding category were also examined. Overall, canopy closure was a habitat variable that appeared to affect avifauna more than the presence of fire.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Stands in western Montana underwent PIPO restoration treatments that included selective tree removal followed by a prescribed burn. Bird and small mammal populations were monitored on these and control sites. While some bird species showed a preference for treated vs. untreated stands, the treatment did not have major effects on avian species composition. The foraging behavior of bark-gleaning birds was also examined on treated vs. untreated sites. Birds selectively foraged on larger trees, with PIPO preferred to PSME in this study area. Thinning and burning is compatible with providing forage substrates for the species in this area, as the encounter rate for bark-gleaners was higher in the treated sites. Small mammal communities changed in both abundance and composition as a result of treatment, with deer mice exhibiting the most positive response to treatment.
