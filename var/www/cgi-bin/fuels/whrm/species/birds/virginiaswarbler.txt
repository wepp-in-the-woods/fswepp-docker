Distribution
breeding range limited to southwest, including spotty range in southern California, southern Wyoming, western Texas 
General Habitat
PIPO/aspen stands; brushlands and pinyon-juniper woodlands
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Canopy Cover
No information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
herbaceous cover, shrubs, non-aspen deciduous trees
Nestsite Characteristics
nests on ground, near grassy tussock or base of tree, or hidden in a pile of leaves
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
gleans prey from branches and foliage, sometime hover-gleans or catches insects in flight; "other trees" used in model refer to non-aspen deciduous trees (Griffis-Kyle and Beier 2003)
Diet
insects and caterpillars
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
disfavored 1-2 years post-fire due to an open understory (Johnson and Wauer 1996); favored 2-4 years post-fire as shrubs develop (Johnson and Wauer 1996)
Sources of Information used in the Model
Griffis-Kyle and Beier 2003
General Sources of Background Information
Johnson and Wauer 1996, National Geographic Society 1996, reviewed in Finch et al. 1997, Alsop 2001, Griffis-Kyle and Beier 2003

Study Location: southwest USA
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Review of the impacts of disturbance on songbirds in southwest PIPO forests. Includes how disturbances such as fire change forest vegetation and in turn how this change impacts difference life history traits of avian species. Many useful, explicitly referenced review tables including: Table 2. Response patterns of selected birds to fire in PIPO forest, Table 3. Abundance of bird species that occur in clearcut, partially cut, and uncut southwestern PIPO forest, Table 4. Effect of silvicultural treatment on avian abundance and diversity, Table 5.Bird species in ponderosa pine forests that nest primarily on the ground or in low shrubs, Table 6. Bird species that prefer open habitat or use meadows or clearings within the forest, Table 7. Bird species that use riparian zones adjacent to ponderosa pine for nesting and foraging.

Study Location: Bandelier National Monument, NM
Habitat Description: PIPO, montane meadow, mixed conifer, pinyon-juniper
Summary: Breeding birds were surveyed before and for many years after a wildfire in Bandelier National Monument. Species diversity increased after the fire, but breeding populations in general declined for several years before increasing above prefire levels. This pattern was more pronounced on severely burned forest. In all but the severely burned forest, breeding bird diversity and populations were higher than prefire levels 14 years after the wildfire. Patterns are presented for different foraging and nesting guilds, as well as some individual species (including particular habitat changes that impacted bird species).

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: Aspen in a PIPO matrix
Summary: This study examined the role that aspen stands in a larger forest matrix play in supporting a variety of avian species. Relative bird abundance and species richness were higher in aspen plots than in paired ponderosa pine plots. However, aspen stands did not harbor unique avian communities, suggesting that they act as important landscape elements within the ponderosa pine forest matrix. Within-patch habitat factors explained 24-46% of the variation in species richness amongst aspen stands; the only habitat factor consistently associated with species richness was sapling density (neg.). Area and isolation of aspen stands had no influence on species diversity. Management activities such as overstory thinning, burning, and fencing against ungulates are suggested to create and conserve aspen stands.
