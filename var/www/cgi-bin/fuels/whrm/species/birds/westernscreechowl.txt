Distribution
western N. America
General Habitat
found in bunch grass, riparian, deciduous habitat types; common in open woodlands, streamside groves, deserts
Home or Activity Range
7-145 ac
Canopy Cover
No information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
wide tree spacing with grassy open spaces; riparian areas with abundant deciduous cover 4-8 m tall; sings in areas with high shrub cover
Nestsite Characteristics
natural cavities and flicker holes in a variety of tree types
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
swoops from a perch or from foliage to take prey on the ground; catches insects in the air; prefer wide tree spacing with grassy open spaces
Diet
mice and insects, small birds, shrews, rats, flying squirrels, chipmunks, bats, crawfish, spiders, scorpions, beetles, cutworms, grasshoppers, locusts, crickets, cicadas, caterpillars
Predators
larger owls, especially the great-horned and barred owls, cats, raccoons, snakes, crows, ravens
Shelter Habitats
roosts close to tree bole; area around roost has denser trees than adjacent forest; may roost in cavities, caves or crevices
Response to Disturbance
no information available

Study Location: throughout range
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Birds of North America species account for the western screech owl. Inhabits a variety of habitat types in the west, but is clearly prefers riparian/deciduous areas. Found in aspen stands with adjacent PIPO/PSME forest in British Columbia.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Frank Church Wilderness, central Idaho
Habitat Description: PSME, PICO, PIPO
Summary: Winter and spring roosts of boreal and saw-whet owls, and late winter, spring and summer roosts of screech owls were examined. All owls roosted in conifers or shrubs except for one individual boreal owl that roosted in a cavity. Only screech owls repeatedly used the same roost. Roost sites of all species were similar in that tree density immediately around roosts was greater than in adjacent forest. Roosts of the species differed in the amount of cover which the roost tree provided and the position of the perches on the branches.

Study Location: Frank Church Wilderness, central Idaho
Habitat Description: PSME, PICO, PIPO, ABLA habitat type series
Summary: Resource partitioning at the macro- and microhabitat scale was studied for five abundant species of forest owls. Owls differed in habitat preferences as well as activity periods and food habits. Screech owls had the most restricted niche, while pygmy and great-horned owls were more generalist in habitat ust. Patterns of resource use was interpreted as resulting from environmental factors, morphological limitations, behavioral adaptations, and interspecific competition.
