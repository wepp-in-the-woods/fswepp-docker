Response to Disturbance
disfavored 1-2 years post-fire due to forest and foliage loss (Johnson and Wauer 1996); higher densities in moderately vs. high severity burns (Taylor and Barmore 1980); negatively affected by fire; more numerous on unlogged sites (Franzreb 1978); increased one year post-prescribed fire (Horton and Mannan 1988); absent in logged stand where snags were removed (Balda 1975); most abundant in 27 year-old clearcut vs. mature forest, younger clearcut and meadow types (Austin and Perry 1979); less abundant in low shrub- and tall shrub-stage clearcuts and partially cut forest compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); more abundant in unfragmented stands (Keller and Anderson 1992); encountered more often on untreated vs. thinned and burned stands (Woolf 2003); found more in unburned controls compared to stands burned by stand-replacement wildfire (Kreisel and Stein 1999)more abundant in old-growth and mature PSME stand than harvest (clearcut or shelterwood cut) units (Moore 1992); not present on clearcut plots and reduced on severely thinned (Szaro and Balda 1979); forest management activities that decrease tree species diversity may have detrimental effects on chickadees and other insectivorous birds (Brennan et al. 2000)

Study Location: central Sierra Nevada, California
Habitat Description: PIPO, PILA, ABCO, PSME, CADE, QUKE
Summary: Foraging habitat preferences, niche relationships, patterns of relative abundance vs. niche breadth and differences between migrant and resident species were examined for 12 species of insect gleaning birds in the Sierras. Tree species, and to a lesser extent, tree height were used selectively by the guild. Incense-cedar was avoided by all species, while other tree species were preferred by individual or groups of gleaners. In differentiating between niche of each species, foraging site was the most important foraging characteristic, followed by tree species, foraging technique, and foraging height. No correlation was found between niche breadth and species abundance, though a positive correlation existed for all 5 resident species.

Study Location: Uinta Mountains, Utah
Habitat Description: PICO as main overstory tree; also includes PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Birds were censused in wet and dry meadows, mature and stagnated PICO stands, and regenerating PICO stands (17 and 37 years post-clearcut). The richest avifauna was found in the dry meadows. While a few birds were adversely affected by the clearcutting, many individual species were more numerous in the clearcuts, and the overall number of species was similar.

Study Location: Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: The habitat needs and roles of secondary cavity nesters are examined in PIPO forests by compiling information from a variety of studies in Arizona. The density of secondary cavity nesters was determined and their importance in local ecology is addressed. Food guilds are outlined. Territory size and snag foraging behavior are outlined for a few species. The impact of snag removal is also discussed; snag removal resulted in a significant loss of breeding bird diversity as well as a decrease in the in the density of secondary cavity nesters. Species are ranked by their sensitivity to snag removal. Finally, the author outlines minimum snag densities that are appropriate for supporting secondary cavity nesters. The author concludes that 268 snags should be maintained for every 100 acres of forest.

Study Location: western Sierra Nevada, California
Habitat Description: includes PIPO, PSME, ABCO, PILA, QUKE, CADE
Summary: Foraging patterns and habitat use was observed for mountain and chestnut-backed chickadees. The two sympatric species tended to forage on different species, and species preferences changed seasonally. Foraging behavior was also different between the two species. Both species chose live trees with no signs of decay or disease. Data indicate that all six of the dominant vegetation species provide foraging habitat and support food resources at some time during the year.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Snags used by secondary cavity nesters (SCN) in PP forests were evaluated for their characteristics. The majority of used snags were > 60cm dbh, >20 m tall, were mostly covered in bark, had bark near the cavity entrance, and had broken tops. The largest and tallest snags available were chosen. SCNs preferred snags that were dead 5- 20 years ago, with the exception of the pygmy nuthatch that preferred older snags. Snag density accounted for more than half the variability in density of SCNs. Removal of snags in coniferous forests would have a serious negative effect on the density of SCNs.

Study Location: Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO, PIST, PSME, aspen, ABCO, PIEN
Summary: Tree species preferences were analyzed for 5 species of birds on logged and unlogged forest. Niche widths and bird densities are given for the individual species. In unlogged forest, the entire avifauna indicated preferences for PSME, ABCO, and PIEN. PIPO, PIST, and snags were not used to the extent to which they were available. In the logged area, avian use of aspen, PIPO, and PIST was less than expected, while PSME and PIEN were preferred. Overall, the unaltered sites supported a considerably larger avian community. The mountain chickadee, ruby-crowned kinglet, and yellow-rumped warbler were more numerous on unlogged sites, while the yellow-bellied sapsucker and the gray-headed junco were more numerous on logged sites. The brown creeper was entirely missing from logged sites.

Study Location: Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PSME and PIPO dominated
Summary: Birds were significantly more abundant in unlogged plots than modified plots, while composition overlapped. Species richness was more influenced by year than treatment. Birds gleaning on foliage or timber were most adversely affected by logging. Ground or slash foragers were much more abundant in harvested plots. Aerial foragers and most flycatchers were more abundant on logged plots. Cup nesting species were more abundant on unlogged plots.

Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: Coronado National Forest, southeast Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO dominated, also PIST, PSME, QUHY, QUAR
Summary: This study compared the number and characteristics of snags used by cavity-nesting birds before and after broadcast understory fires in PP stands. Avian species were monitored to investigate their response to prescribed fire. Before the fire, many avian species used large snags (> 50 cm dbh) for cavity nesting, with smaller snags used primarily for foraging. Nearly half of all snags were burned or drastically changed by the prescribed fire. A snag's likelihood to be consumed depended on both dbh and decay class. Few large live trees were killed immediately, leading to a 45% net decrease in snags 1 year post-treatment. Small snags (< 15 cm dbh) increased 20-fold after the treatment. Logs decreased post-treatment. No avian species were lost post-treatment, though northern flickers and violet-green swallows decreased in experimental stands, while mountain chickadees increased. The authors attribute these patterns to changes in prey populations or shifts in areas used in foraging, and not to any limitation in nest sites.

Keller, Mary E.; Anderson, Stanley H. 1992. Avian use of habitat configurations created by forest cutting in southeastern Wyoming. Condor. 94:55-65.

Study Location: southeastern Wyoming
Habitat Description: PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Forest cutting has resulted in an increase in forest edges and reduction in forest continuity. Avian communities in uncut forests and those fragmented by small clearcuts were compared. Overall, stands interrupted by small clearcuts had a similar species composition to paired uncut stands. Brown creepers and hermit thrushes were most negatively impacted by fragmentation, while pine siskins were the most positively influenced by fragmentation. This study also examined how bird species were distributed in relation to forest interiors and edges. Distribution of birds among forest edges and interiors were not consistent with preferences for forest edges and interiors.

Study Location: northeast Washington
Habitat Description: mixed conifer, includes: PSME, PIPO, ABLA, PIEN, LAOC, PICO
Summary: This study examined bird use of burned and unburned forest in the winter season. Species richness was similar, but composition was distinctly different. Composition and abundance also changed with time; some species disappeared from the area while others moved in. Trunk and branch foraging species were more abundant in burned forest, though their abundance significantly decreased from the first to the fourth winter post-fire. Foraging behavior was documented for four woodpecker species within the burned area. Foraging took place on snags > 23 cm dbh.

Habitat Description: PIPO, Jeffrey Pine
Summary: The snags containing nests of four specific cavity-nesting birds were examined for various features. Snags with nests tended to be larger and taller than random alternative snags. The author also examines historical cavity usage and suggests management implication of snag retention.

Study Location: central Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO, ABCO, PSME, PIST, aspen, Gambel oak
Summary: Habitat features for successful and unsuccessful nest sites, nest sites vs. random sites, and differences among coexisting species of cavity nesting birds were identified. Species-specific characteristics are presented both for nest site and nest tree; birds differed in some of their habitat preferences. Aspen (mostly dead) were a preferred nesting species and were common in foraging patches, despite their low density in the study area. High density of aspen provides both more nesting sites and protects nests from predation, as predators have to search more sites to find nests. Foraging areas also had more conifers and fewer deciduous trees (other than aspen) than random areas. Preference for conifers is attributed to increased foraging opportunities.Failed nests were surrounded by denser foliage and were closer to conifers. Reduced nest success was also linked to lower nest height. Non-excavating species had lower nesting success than excavator species.

Study Location: southwestern Montana
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Avian species composition and abundance were examined in old-growth, mature, and harvested PSME forest. The greatest total abundance was detected in the old-growth forest. In general, the old-growth contained the greatest number of species, though there was no detected difference in species richness between the stand types. Higher elevation old-growth stands contained a greater abundance of birds than the lower elevation old-growth stands. Trees with cavities were also examined in this study. The majority of cavity trees were old PSME with broken tops, and cavities tended to be located in the top one-third of the tree. Some primary and secondary cavity-nesting birds demonstrated dbh preferences for nest trees.

Habitat Description: PSME, LAOC, PICO, PIEN, PIPO, ABLA, ABGR, THPL, PIMO, aspen, birch
Summary: A comparison of bird communities was performed between control sites and those undergoing traditional overstory removal harvests and those harvested using "New Forestry" techniques. Only four species showed significant differences in abundance between treatments, though the author suspects that other trends in the data would be clearer with additional post-treatment data. In general, for species that did differ in abundance, numbers in New Forestry stands were intermediate between overstory removal and controls. Foliage foragers declined similarly in both harvest types, while ground foragers increased. Conifer nesters decreased similarly in both harvest types, while ground nesters increased. Important habitat variables for a number of species are given.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Bird species diversity and species richness were not significantly affected by forest cutting and logging except in a clearcut treatment. Bird population densities significantly increased on silviculturally cut and irregular strip shelterwood plots and significantly decreased  on the severely thinned and clearcut plots. Impact on individual species is discussed.

Study Location: Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks, Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO, ABLA/PIEN
Summary: Bird density, composition, and diversity were monitored across a series of fire severities in burned PICO or spruce-fir forest in Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks. Highest populations and greatest biomass occurred from 5-29 years post-fire. Density, composition, and diversity on moderately burned spruce-fir-PICO were more like those on unburned spruce-fir than other seral stages. Changes in bird communities by feeding category were also examined. Overall, canopy closure was a habitat variable that appeared to affect avifauna more than the presence of fire.

Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.

Woolf, Jennifer. 2003. The effects of thinning and prescribed fire on birds, small mammals, and avian species composition. Missoula, MT: University of Montana. 93 p. M.S. Thesis.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Stands in western Montana underwent PIPO restoration treatments that included selective tree removal followed by a prescribed burn. Bird and small mammal populations were monitored on these and control sites. While some bird species showed a preference for treated vs. untreated stands, the treatment did not have major effects on avian species composition. The foraging behavior of bark-gleaning birds was also examined on treated vs. untreated sites. Birds selectively foraged on larger trees, with PIPO preferred to PSME in this study area. Thinning and burning is compatible with providing forage substrates for the species in this area, as the encounter rate for bark-gleaners was higher in the treated sites. Small mammal communities changed in both abundance and composition as a result of treatment, with deer mice exhibiting the most positive response to treatment.
