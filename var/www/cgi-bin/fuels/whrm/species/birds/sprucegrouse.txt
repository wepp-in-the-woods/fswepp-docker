Distribution
across Alaska, Canada and south into northern New England, northern Great Lake states, and parts of Washington, Idaho, and Montana
General Habitat
coniferous forest
Home or Activity Range
37-76 ac
Canopy Cover
canopy cover 50-90% at night roosting sites and 30-70% at daytime feeding/loafing sites (Paterni 1979); dense overhead cover at nest sites (Boag and Schroeder 1992)
Specific Habitat Preferences
dense small trees for roosting; dense large trees for feeding and loafing
Nestsite Characteristics
nests on ground under low branch of spruce or bushes
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
dense large trees for feeding and loafing
Diet
buds and needles of conifers, seeds of weeds and grasses, berries, mushrooms, fern fronds, some insects
Predators
raptors and forest carnivores; red squirrels, corvids, mustellids and canids eat eggs
Shelter Habitats
roost in trees, often in clumps of small trees
Response to Disturbance
no information available

Study Location: throughout range
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Birds of North America species account for the spruce grouse. Grouse appear to prefer relatively young successional stands, with dense tree cover and a well-developed middle-story. Nest-sites always have high overhead cover, usually at the base of coniferous growth.

Paterni, Michael J. 1979. Winter habitat selection by female spruce grouse (Canachites canadensis franklinii) in a mixed coniferous forest. Missoula, MT: University of Montana. 96 p. M.S. Thesis.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: PIEN, LAOC, PICO, PIPO, PSME
Summary: Spruce grouse movement, activity areas, social groupings, and food habits were assessed in winter. Grouse used different cover types in winter than other seasons. Most activity was concentrated on southern exposures. Roosting sites had a high density of small trees and high canopy cover, while basal area was high at both roosting and feeding/loafing sites. Winter diet consisted largely of conifer needles.
