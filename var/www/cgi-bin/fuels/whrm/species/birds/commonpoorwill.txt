Distribution
western USA into Mexico
General Habitat
common in sagebrush and coniferous woodlands and on coastal chapparal slopes
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Canopy Cover
No information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
grass-forb, shrub-seedling-sapling stages
Nestsite Characteristics
nests on bare soil, pebbles or atop a small pile of leaves, usually shaded by a bush or grasses
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
aerial foragers; sally after insects from a low perch or from the ground;  use vision, and are more active with increased moonlight
Diet
night - flying insects:  moths, beetles, and also occasionally flies, grasshoppers, and flying ants
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
day roosts on ground in shrubs and grasses; hibernates in rock crevices
Response to Disturbance
no information available

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.
