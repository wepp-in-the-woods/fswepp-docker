Study Location: Okanagan Valley, southern British Columbia
Habitat Description: PIPO-PSME, BEOC
Summary: The breeding biology of northern saw-whet owls was compared in deciduous riparian areas and PIPO-PSME forest. Nests occurred either in boxes or in northern flicker cavities in PIPO snags. Nesting phenology, diet, and home range are discussed.

Study Location: Frank Church Wilderness, central Idaho
Habitat Description: PSME, PICO, PIPO
Summary: Winter and spring roosts of boreal and saw-whet owls, and late winter, spring and summer roosts of screech owls were examined. All owls roosted in conifers or shrubs except for one individual boreal owl that roosted in a cavity. Only screech owls repeatedly used the same roost. Roost sites of all species were similar in that tree density immediately around roosts was greater than in adjacent forest. Roosts of the species differed in the amount of cover which the roost tree provided and the position of the perches on the branches.

Study Location: Frank Church Wilderness, central Idaho
Habitat Description: PSME, PICO, PIPO, ABLA habitat type series
Summary: Resource partitioning at the macro- and microhabitat scale was studied for five abundant species of forest owls. Owls differed in habitat preferences as well as activity periods and food habits. Screech owls had the most restricted niche, while pygmy and great-horned owls were more generalist in habitat ust. Patterns of resource use was interpreted as resulting from environmental factors, morphological limitations, behavioral adaptations, and interspecific competition.

Study Location: west-central Montana
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: Examination of the diets of two sympatric, small owls. Pygmy-owls were found to have a significant avian component to their diets, while they also ate a large number of voles. Microtine voles were the most significant component of saw-whet owl diets.The authors could not conclude that diet is shaping the sympatric distribution of these two owls.

Study Location: north-central Colorado
Habitat Description: mixed conifer, including: PIEN, PICO, PSME, PIPO, aspen, JUSC
Summary: This study examined habitat selection, movement patterns (including home range), diet, and breeding season singing activity of boreal and saw-whet owls. Chapters are divided into potential competitive interactions, movement and roost site selection by boreal owls, and annual and seasonal variation in singing activity for both species. Boreal owls selected high-elevation mature spruce-fir forests while saw-whet owls were found at lower elevation deciduous or mixed forests. Both species avoided large, unbroken stands of PICO. Otherwise, macrohabitat selection for both species did not differ from what was available. At the microhabitat level, saw-whet owl territories had more small trees and a higher deciduous element than boreal owl territories. Boreal owls roosted in dense tree stands on steep slopes. Conifer trees were preferred, and roosts were seldom used more than once.

Study Location: Blue Mountains, OR
Habitat Description: ABGR
Summary: This case history (1) evaluates bird-habitat relationships in primarily grand fir forests. The goals of this study were to assess how forest stand structure influences habitat selection by birds, to investigate bird use of specific forest structural classes, and to relate bird habitat use to potential management options that consider breeding bird habitat.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.

Study Location: range of Mexican spotted owl; case studies in northern Arizona and New Mexico
Habitat Description: not stated; PIPO
Summary: Literature review and synthesis of data from past studies concerning the ecology of prey of the Mexican Spotted Owl, including information on owl diet, identification of prey that might influence owl fitness, and quantification of habitat correlates of prey species. The authors found variation in diet regionally. Reproductive success of spotted owls was not linked to any single prey species, rather to many species in combination, or total prey biomass. However, certain species may be more important in specific regions. Overall, food resources were quite variable among vegetation communities and through time. Owl food is most abundant during the summer when young are being raised. Prey biomass decreases in late fall and early winter. Habitat correlates are presented from one study in northern Arizona (deer mouse, brush mouse, Mexican woodrat) and one in New Mexico.
