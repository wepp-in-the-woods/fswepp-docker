Distribution
Canada, Alaska, northern midwest states, local populations in parts of California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and Utah
General Habitat
mature conifer forest with an open understory and dense overstory
Home or Activity Range
900-77000 ac
Canopy Cover
canopy cover > 60% at nest sites (Bell and Henjum 1990); stands with 11-59% canopy cover for foraging and roosting (Bull and Henjum 1990); abundance linked to high canopy cover > 70% (Verner 1980)
Specific Habitat Preferences
large trees, >70% canopy cover, respond positively to edge
Nestsite Characteristics
stick platforms (often constructed by northern goshawks or red-tailed hawks), on top of large-diameter broken-off snags, natural platforms of dwarf mistletoe, artificial wooden platforms (preferred over stick platforms); mostly in mature, unlogged mixed conifer stands 
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
openings in mature forest, meadows, edges of clearcuts or partial cuts; perches needed
Diet
northern pocket gophers, mountain, longtail, and Richardson's voles, redback vole, deer mouse, heather vole, yellow pine chipmunk, red squirrel, northern flying squirrel, busytailed woodrat, Columbian ground squirrel, golden manteled ground squirrel, Pacific mole, robins
Predators
Great-horned owls, northern goshawks, red-tailed hawks, black bears (juveniles), great-horned owls, Canada lynx (adults in Manitoba), common raven (eggs and young), mosquitos and blackflies (young)
Shelter Habitats
11-59% canopy closure at roosting sites
Response to Disturbance
will forage on the edges of clearcuts given a suitable perch, partial cuts may also be suitable (Bull and Henjum 1990); forestry practices can influence the presence of potential nest sites; removal of diseased trees, removal of large trees, and forest stand alterations not compatible with the habitat requirements of nest-building species would inhibit nesting, while promoting the growth of large trees capable of supporting a platform or leaving snags and snag replacements to favor broken nest-top structures would encourage nesting (reviewed in Verner et al. 1994); clear-cutting and even selective-tree harvesting has reduced nesting habitat for great gray owls and all forest raptors (reviewed in Verner et al. 1994); openings can be created by logging that support populations of prey used by breeding owls, but these artificially created clearings are not long-lasting (reviewed in Verner 1994); diet was primarily pocket gophers near clearcuts, but was mostly voles near natural forest openings (Franklin 1988)

Bryan, Terry K.; Foresman, Eric D. 1987. Distribution, abundance, and habitat of great gray owls in south-central Oregon. Murrelet. 68:45-49.

Study Location: southcentral Oregon
Habitat Description: primarily PIPO and PICO; also aspen, ABGR, PSME and interspersed sagebrush
Summary: Locations of owls and nests were found in southcentral Oregon. The distribution of owls in the study area was non-uniform. The majority of locations occurred in PIPO/PICO forests with adjacent meadows. The forests were either old-growth or mature types with large overstory trees. Nest site characteristics varied; nests had been constructed by either goshawks or red-tailed hawks or were in cavities in dead tree tops. Stand structure, canopy closure, tree species composition and distance to the nearest meadow varied by nest.

Study Location: northeastern Oregon
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME, ABGR, LAOC, PICO
Summary: Outline of great grey owl ecology in northeastern Oregon, including information on breeding, nesting, foraging, and movement. Nesting usually occurred in mature forest in previously constructed stick nests in large-diameter trees or on the top of a large-diameter snag. Areas used for nesting were unlogged, mature conifer forests containing ABGR, PSME and LAOC with a fairly open understory but dense overstory. Foraging habitat was related to grass cover, presence of downed wood, and canopy cover between 11-59%. Several management practices are suggested. Because great grey owls tend to congregate locally, areas where they have been observed in the past should be retained and not disturbed. Nest platforms should be put up and/or large diameter (>50 cm) snags with broken tops and trees with raptor stick nests should be left standing.  Cover and perch sites for juveniles are also important. Partial cuts and the edges of clearcuts (given suitable perches) can make good foraging habitat. Downed wood should be retained for prey species.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests. 

Franklin, Alan B. 1988. Breeding biology of the great gray owl in southeastern Idaho and northwestern Wyoming. Condor. 90:689-696.

Study Location:  southeastern Idaho and northwestern Wyoming
Habitat Description:not stated
Summary: The author found 38 pairs of breeding great gray owls in Idaho and Wyoming. Nesting habits nesting chronology, reproductive output and movement of fledglings were recorded. Nests occurred either in stick nests or in the broken-off tops of snags. Nests in fir/spruce snags were more productive and stable than nests in lodgepole snags or stick nests. Diet was also described; diet consisted mostly of pocket gophers and voles, though owls nesting near clearcuts had a higher percentage of pocket gophers in their diet, while owls near natural meadows consumed more voles.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.

Study Location: throughout range of great gray owl
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Includes review of the systematics, distribution and abundance, movements, habitat use, food habits, influence of prey species biology on owl movements, breeding biology, demography, and community ecology of great gray owls. Occurrence by habitat type is given for a number of western National Forests (Table 2 pp. 156-157). Great gray owl populations are limited by two principal factors, the availability of pre-existing nest sites and prey abundance/availability, which in turn influence reproduction and survival. Prey availability is thought to be a primary factor influencing survival and limiting abundance. The dynamics of forest communities supporting great grey owls are outlined, including the Northern Rocky Mountains, Oregon Cascades, and Sierra Nevada Mountains. The current and projected conservation status varies across its geographic distribution; persistence seems likely if forests of all successional stages are maintained, including mature forest for nesting and clearings/natural openings for foraging. The broad home range of this species and its use of a variety of habitat types dictates that management be accomplished with a landscape and regional perspective.
