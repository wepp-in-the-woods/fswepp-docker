Distribution
widespread over much of USA, southern Canada, south into Mexico
General Habitat
varies geographically; includes semi-desert grasslands, short-grass prairies, riparian zones, and dense coniferous forest stands
Home or Activity Range
1400-22000 ac
Canopy Cover
extensive overstory canopy closure at locations (Smith 1984)
Specific Habitat Preferences
steep, rocky sites; dense cover; structural complexity
Nestsite Characteristics
den in small, cave-like holes, under large fallen trees, in the interstices of large boulders on talus slopes; prefer dense cover and steep, rocky undisturbed areas as den sites
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
use dense cover for hunting
Diet
hares, cottontails, jackrabbits, prairie dogs, small mammals
Predators
coyote; fox, owl species, adult male bobcats will take young
Shelter Habitats
dense cover for shelter
Response to Disturbance
past disturbance, such as mining or logging activity, did not appear to influence den site selection (Brainerd 1985)

Study Location: north-central Montana
Habitat Description: PSME, JUSC, PIPO, cottonwoods, Salix sp., grasses and greasewood, big sagebrush
Summary: Bobcat habitat selection and movement was studied in the C.M. Russel National Wildlife Refuge. The three bobcats with radiocollars selected habitat types with > 52% cover, as did potential lagomorph prey. The majority of relocations were made in Douglas-fir, juniper thicket, and river bottom cover types. Douglas-fir and juniper thickets were preferred in winter and spring while the riverbottom received its greatest use in summer and fall. Management recommendations are largely centered around halting illegal hunting.

Study Location: central Idaho
Habitat Description: PSME, ABLA, PIAL
Summary: Significant differences were found in use of elevation, forest types, terrain, overstory density, and exposure in the summer habitat used by mountain lions, bobcats and coyotes. Resource use overlapped in winter, which resulted in mountain lions killing both bobcat and coyote. Coyote used open stands and all forest types (except alpine) situated on south-southwest exposures in both seasons. Bobcats showed more seasonal differences; they used PSME-mountain mahogany forest types, open areas, and rocky terrain on south-southwest exposures more frequently during winter than summer. Mountain lions also showed seasonal differences. They used lower elevation, more xeric, open areas with rocky terrain and south-southwest exposures in winter.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: PICO, PSME, PIEN, ABLA, PIPO 
Summary: Eight bobcats were radio-collared and movement and habitat use was monitored in coniferous forests of western Montana. Preferred habitat included extensive coniferous overstory with a dense vegetative understory of either shrubs or a combination of grasses and forbs. The author speculates that this cover was useful for hunting success. Areas with extensive overstory canopy cover were consistently used. Steep, rocky habitats were most important in summer, as they provided secure denning sites. No interspecific competition was documented between bobcats and lynx, as these species appeared to separate based on habitat selection and a potential scent-oriented avoidance system.
