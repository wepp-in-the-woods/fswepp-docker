Distribution
range widespread through northern Canada and Alaska, south through British Columbia; patchy in Montana, Colorado, and central California
General Habitat
open forests at high elevations and in alpine areas; avoid lowland grass and shrub cover types as well as PIPO forests
Home or Activity Range
more than 24700 ac
Canopy Cover
No information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
prefer basins, southerly and easterly slopes, and edge and ecotonal areas; mature tree cover
Nestsite Characteristics
den in complex snow tunnels; alpine or subalpine habitats associated with tree roots, boulders, rock ledges; must have dependable deep snow; seldom den in low elevation, dense coniferous forest
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
summer: medium density/scattered mature forests at high elevation; winter: montane coniferous forest
Diet
No information available
Predators
wolves, black and grizzly bears, mountain lions, golden eagles
Shelter Habitats
No information available
Response to Disturbance
human disturbance at den sites resulted in den abandonment, but not kit abandonment (Magoun and Copeland 1998) ;increased human presence as a result of management activities may have adverse effects on rare forest carnivores (reviewed in Bull et al. 2001); wolverines were never relocated within clearcuts, though track surveys found animals crossing clearcut areas 15 times (Hornocker and Hash 1981)

Hahr, Meg. 2001. Winter distribution and habitat use of lynx, fisher, and wolverine in Glacier National Park, Montana. Missoula, MT: University of Montana. 97 p. M.S. Thesis.

Location of Study:  northwest Montana
Habitat Description: entire Glacier National Park; includes dry herbaceous, mesic herbaceous, deciduous trees and shrubs, dense mesic coniferous forest, open dry coniferous forest, barren rock, snow or ice
Summary: Lynx, fisher, and wolverine use of forest age classes and vegetative cover types was assessed in winter in Glacier National Park. Lynx use of deciduous and dry coniferous forest types was greater than expected while dry herb/shrub and mesic conifer cover types were used less than expected. Fisher used deciduous and dry coniferous forest types more than both shrub cover types. Wolverines used both conifer cover types less than expected while deciduous forest stands and dry herb/shrub were used significantly more than expected. Tracks of a variety of other carnivores, including marten, coyote, and mountain lion,  were also recorded.

Location of Study: Northwestern Montana
Habitat Description: ranges from low elevation PIPO to  areas dominated by PSME, ABLA, PIEN, ABGR, LAOC and PICO
Summary: Five-year study of wolverine ecology in Montana. Population estimates, home ranges, and cover-type preferences were noted. The authors estimated that 20 wolverines inhabited a 1300 km2 study area. Wolverines ranged from 1371 m in elevation in winter to 1920 m elevation in summer. Easterly and southerly areas received the majority of consistent use. 70% of all relocations occurred in large areas of mature or scattered timber. Areas of dense, young timber were used least. Abies seral types were most often used; LAOC and PICO sites were also frequently used. Wolverines were never relocated within clearcuts, though track surveys found animals crossing clearcut areas 15 times.

Location of Study:  northwestern AK and central ID
Habitat Description: AK: treeless tundra, alpine ridges; ID: various elevations of coniferous forest
Summary: Den sites of wolverines were described in Alaska and central Idaho. While most dens in Alaska were long, complex snow tunnels with no association to trees and boulders, dens in Idaho were always associated with fallen trees or boulders. All dens were covered in at least 1 m of snow. Wolverine dens described to date have all been located in alpine, subalpine, taiga, or tundra habitat. Dens in low elevation, densely forested habitat are rare. Den site selection may be influenced by thermoregulatory advantages, protection from predators, suitability of the site during the spring thaw, and location of rearing habitat.
