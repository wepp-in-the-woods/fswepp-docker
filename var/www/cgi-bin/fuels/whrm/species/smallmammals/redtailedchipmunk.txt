Study Location: review
Habitat Description: review
Summary: Habitat needs of a variety of northern goshawk prey are identified by a literature review. Management recommendations are made in regard to nesting, foraging, and other life history attributes.

Summary: The initial responses of small mammals to overstory removal and new forestry techniques were monitored in western Montana. Treatments affected large tree density but not vegetative cover or density of small trees. There was no significant treatment effect on any small mammal species, but trends in abundance were apparent; red-tailed chipmunks appeared to decline while yellow pine chipmunks and red-backed voles increased in response to harvest. Habitat associations were examined for some species pre- and post- harvest. The use of riparian buffers was also investigated, with use of buffers higher than expected in overstory removal grids and use of upland rows higher than expected in control grids.
