Study Location: west of Cascade crest in Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: not specified
Summary: Accounts of arboreal rodents are given, with information on identification, distribution, habitat preference, nesting, food items and predators. These species are most abundant and diverse in mixed-conifer old-growth forest that contains streams. All species appear to be sensitive to timber harvest due to loss of habitat and dispersal barriers.

Study Location: Coast Range, Oregon
Habitat Description: PSME dominated old growth and second growth
Summary: Northern flying squirrel dens were examined in coastal, DF-dominated forests. Types of dens (nests vs. cavities) varied regionally and depended on seral stage. In old growth, squirrels preferentially selected large conifers, alive and dead, for den sites. In second growth, squirrels preferentially selected large residual snags and mid-size DF for denning. Two-thirds of the den trees were live. Flying squirrels used multiple dens throughout all of the study areas, and group denning was nearly universal. Flying squirrel densities in thinned stands were lower than in unthinned stands; more nest dens were found in unthinned forest while more cavity dens were found in thinned forest. The authors suggest a management scheme of thinning combined with cavity tree management and long rotations (70-130 yrs) for second-growth forests. Managers can also leave large fallen trees and large dbh tall stumps, retain green trees at harvest to provide dens for the future, retain flying squirrel dens during thinning, and create cavities in live trees in poor habitat.

Gashweiler, Jay S. 1970. Plant and animal changes on a clearcut in west-central Oregon. Ecology. 51:1018-1026.

Study Location: west-central Oregon (west Cascades)
Habitat Description: PSME, TSHE, THPL
Summary: Study documents changes in plant and mammal communities for 11 years following a clearcut with a fall burn. Deer mice increased in the experimental area soon after the burn was completed. Other species that increased at various times after the burn include Townsend's chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and the Oregon vole. Red-back voles, northern flying squirrels, and Douglas' squirrels were not found in the clearcut/burn. California squirrels migrated into the clearcut/burn.

Study Location: British Columbia
Habitat Description: PSME, TSHE, THPL, ALRU, ACMA
Summary: This study examined the importance of aspect and height in nest site selection (using nest boxes) for tree and flying squirrels. Both species chose higher nest boxes but there was no apparent selection for north or south aspect. Multiple nests were located in some boxes containing flying squirrels.

Study Location: northern Rocky Mountains; western Montana, Idaho, northwestern Wyoming, northern Utah
Habitat Description: spruce-fir zone; including ABLA, PSME, aspen, PICO, also extended into PIPO zone
Summary: Four year study on the ecology of the boreal owl in the northern Rocky Mountains. All owls were detected above 1292 m elevation, and the majority of detections were in ABLA habitat types. PICO was the only dominant forest type that was avoided, despite being common in the study area. It was used when no other forest type was available, and was characterized as having large trees. Nest sites were restricted to mature/old stands with complex physical structure; many habitat types were used, including mixed conifer forest (PIPO and PSME) 39% of the time as well as aspen 21% of the time despite covering <1% of the available forest. PICO was avoided for nesting. Boreal owls were selective in summer roosts sites, choosing sites with greater canopy cover, higher tree density, and higher basal area. The best foraging habitat was associated with mature/old spruce-fir stands where prey was most abundant. Diet, population and breeding were also examined. Habitat associations by vegetation type are given for primary prey species. Management strategies that focus on snag retention and harvest practices that retain forest structure are recommended for maintaining quality habitat.

Study Location: Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: Northern flying squirrels using nest-boxes showed evidence of aggregation, sexual segregation, and a male bias towards nest-box use.

Study Location: Toiyabe National Forest, California
Habitat Description: ABMA, ABCO, PICO, PIMO
Summary: Northern flying squirrels selected habitats where truffles were abundant. Flying squirrels foraged in areas in close proximity to understory cover and trees and high canopy closure, while neither coarse woody debris density or abundance of potential nesting sites (snags) measurably influenced squirrel occurrence.

Study Location: south coast of British Columbia
Habitat Description: old- and second-growth stands of TSHE, THPL, PSME, ABAM
Summary: This study tested the hypothesis that old-growth forest stands were higher quality habitat than second-growth stands for two squirrel species. No major differences in movement, density, recruitment, mass of males, survival, percentage of the population breeding, and the duration of habitation of the study plots were found between the two stand types for flying squirrels. For Douglas squirrels, the only difference found was in recruitment, which was higher in the second growth stand. Therefore, old-growth habitat does not appear to be higher quality habitat for either species. When considering the contradictory results from other studies on northern flying squirrels, the authors noted that two overall patterns: abundance can be variable within a stand type and the relative difference between stand types varies from year to year. This pattern limits the inference from short-term studies.

In: Management of amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals in North America symposium: proceedings; Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-166. Fort Collins, CO: USDA, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station. 359-367.

Study Location: southern Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO (60%), PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Abundance of small mammals was associated with generalized habitat types within the supalpine zone. Moisture and stand maturity were two habitat features that separated patterns of abundance of various species. Specific habitat associations are given for 8 species of small mammals. The southern red-backed vole was confirmed as a suitable indicator of old-growth forest; the masked and dusky shrew may be as well.
