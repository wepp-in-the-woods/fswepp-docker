Study Location: southern Wyoming
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Study areas that varied widely in CWD amounts were sampled for terrestrial amphibians and small mammals. Regression models containing habitat variables were constructed for 5 species of amphibians and small mammals. As CWD volume was important to some organisms, the authors suggest a retention of CWD in the range of 100-300 m3/ha to provide habitat for most terrestrial salamanders.
