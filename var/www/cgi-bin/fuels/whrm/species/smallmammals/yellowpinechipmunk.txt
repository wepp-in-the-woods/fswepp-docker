Response to Disturbance
responded positively to single-tree selective logging (Medin and Booth 1989); became more abundant on thinned/burned sites two years after treatment (Woolf 2003); increased in abundance one year after overstory removal and new forestry harvest techniques (Shepherd 1994); more abundant in treated (clearcut and seed-tree) than old growth forest stands (Sullivan et al. 2000)

Study Location: Frank Church Wilderness, central Idaho
Habitat Description: PICO-dominated, also PIPO, PSME, ABLA, PIEN
Summary: Small mammal populations were sampled in a wilderness area in central Idaho. Spruce-fir forests had the highest abundance of small mammals, while PICO forest had the lowest. Species richness was low in all habitats, though it was highest in PICO forest. Habitat associations are given for some small mammals. The patchy distribution of small mammals in this study area mimics the patchy nature of forests in this region.

Study Location: northern Rocky Mountains; western Montana, Idaho, northwestern Wyoming, northern Utah
Habitat Description: spruce-fir zone; including ABLA, PSME, aspen, PICO, also extended into PIPO zone
Summary: Four year study on the ecology of the boreal owl in the northern Rocky Mountains. All owls were detected above 1292 m elevation, and the majority of detections were in ABLA habitat types. PICO was the only dominant forest type that was avoided, despite being common in the study area. It was used when no other forest type was available, and was characterized as having large trees. Nest sites were restricted to mature/old stands with complex physical structure; many habitat types were used, including mixed conifer forest (PIPO and PSME) 39% of the time as well as aspen 21% of the time despite covering <1% of the available forest. PICO was avoided for nesting. Boreal owls were selective in summer roosts sites, choosing sites with greater canopy cover, higher tree density, and higher basal area. The best foraging habitat was associated with mature/old spruce-fir stands where prey was most abundant. Diet, population and breeding were also examined. Habitat associations by vegetation type are given for primary prey species. Management strategies that focus on snag retention and harvest practices that retain forest structure are recommended for maintaining quality habitat.

Study Location: west-central Idaho
Habitat Description: dominated by PSME and PIPO; scattered stands of ABGR, PICO, PIEN
Summary: Small mammals were trapped from 1-3 years after diameter-cut logging. Deer mouse populations were not different between logged and unlogged plots. Yellow-pine chipmunks were higher on logged sites, while Gapper's red-backed voles disappeared from the small mammal community after logging. The major changes to to the vegetation included a reduction in large-diameter trees and a loss of shrub cover due the logging activities and slash burning. Herbaceous vegetation recovered more quickly.

Study Location: Idaho
Habitat Description: PSME, PIPO
Summary: Populations of birds and small mammals were monitored in conjunction with a single-tree selection logging operation. Total numbers of breeding birds remained relatively stable, but some individual species responded either positively or negatively to the treatment. Timber gleaners were the only feeding guild adversely affected by the logging treatment. Secondary cavity nesters were the only nesting guild adversely affected by the logging treatment. The most notable small mammal response was the positive response of yellow-pine chipmunks to the treatment. Fewer deer mice were found in the treatment area.

Study Location: northwest Montana
Habitat Description: PSME-dominated; also included PICO, ABLA, ABGR, PIEN, PIPO
Summary: The initial responses of small mammals to overstory removal and new forestry techniques were monitored in western Montana. Treatments affected large tree density but not vegetative cover or density of small trees. There was no significant treatment effect on any small mammal species, but trends in abundance were apparent; red-tailed chipmunks appeared to decline while yellow pine chipmunks and red-backed voles increased in response to harvest. Habitat associations were examined for some species pre- and post- harvest. The use of riparian buffers was also investigated, with use of buffers higher than expected in overstory removal grids and use of upland rows higher than expected in control grids.

Study Location:  south-central British Columbia
Habitat Description: PSME, PICO
Summary: This study tested the hypothesis that diversity of stand structure attributes and forest-floor small mammal communities increase from young pine to seed tree to old growth forest. Some vegetative attributes differed between forest type. Red-backed voles were most abundant in old growth forest, while northwestern chipmunks, heather voles, western jumping mice, montane shrews, and common shrews were more abundant in the treated stands. Meadow voles were more abundant in the seed tree stands. Deer mice, long-tailed voles, and short-tailed weasels were similarly abundant among all treatment types. Mean species richness and diversity was higher in the treated stands, suggesting that all stand types offer their own structural diversity to the forest landscape.

Woolf, Jennifer. 2003. The effects of thinning and prescribed fire on birds, small mammals, and avian species composition. Missoula, MT: University of Montana. 93 p. M.S. Thesis.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Stands in western Montana underwent PIPO restoration treatments that included selective tree removal followed by a prescribed burn. Bird and small mammal populations were monitored on these and control sites. While some bird species showed a preference for treated vs. untreated stands, the treatment did not have major effects on avian species composition. The foraging behavior of bark-gleaning birds was also examined on treated vs. untreated sites. Birds selectively foraged on larger trees, with PIPO preferred to PSME in this study area. Thinning and burning is compatible with providing forage substrates for the species in this area, as the encounter rate for bark-gleaners was higher in the treated sites. Small mammal communities changed in both abundance and composition as a result of treatment.
