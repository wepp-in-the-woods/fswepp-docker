# Literature
Distribution
southwestern range of PIPO (includes Abert's and Kaibab tassel-eared squirrels)

Home or Activity Range
No information available
Canopy Cover
foraging habitat are areas with > 60% canopy cover (Reynolds et al. 1992)
Specific Habitat Preferences
large, clumped PP
Nestsite Characteristics
PIPO trees; bolus nest constructed on a limb, against bole, or in porcupine crotch; flat nest on witches broom; Other Trees used are Gambel Oaks
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
PIPO trees
Diet
PIPO inner bark from twigs, pollen from staminate cones, buds, seeds from ovulate cones, hypogeous fungi from roots, eat acorns when available, carrion and bones, fir cones, pinyon pine nuts, bird eggs and young birds

Mexican spotted owl, hawks, owls
Shelter Habitats
may den in Gambel oak; uses dense underbrush for predator avoidance
Response to Disturbance
decreased in stands with timber harvest (Pederson et al. 1976)

Study Location:  north-central Arizona
Habitat Description:  PP forests
Summary:  Tassel squirrel recruitment was strongly and positively related to the number of interlocking canopy trees and fungal content of August fecal samples. Fungal content was related to basal area. Squirrel density was related to fungal diversity. Management techniques that include intensive widespread thinning may adversely impact tassel eared squirrels and the fungi they rely on. Managing for interlocking canopies could be beneficial to squirrel populations.

Hall, Joseph G. 1981. A field study of the Kaibab squirrel in the Grand Canyon National Park. Wildlife Monographs. 75: 5-54.

Study Location:  Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO, pinyon-juniper woodland, spruce-fir
Summary:  The natural history of the Kaibab squirrel on the Kaibab Plateau is outlined. Most life history traits are tied specifically to PIPO Quality of feeding habitat is reflected in the density of larger trees, trunk diameter, crown density and height, and foliage weight. Nests are constructed in large pines near one or more neighboring pines. Nests are made close to the trunk of large PIPO, and are often 10 m above the ground. Several nests are used yearly. The author also discusses home ranges, daily behavior, food availability, the impact the Kaibab squirrel has on PIPO and spatial and temporal population fluctuations.

Study Location:  Apache, Coconino, and Kaibab National Forests, Arizona
Habitat Description:  PIPO forest
Summary: Abert squirrel habitat was modeled in PIPO forests using tree size, density, and dispersion pattern as habitat characteristics. The author recommends managing for stands with trees >12" dbh, >120 trees/acre, and some clumpiness, as these areas provide good nesting habitat. Specific management techniques are suggested.

Study Location:  Kaibab plateau, Arizona
Habitat Description:  PIPO forest
Summary: Timber harvesting on the Kaibab plateau reduced habitat quality and consequently Kaibab squirrel density. Squirrel densities were smaller and home ranges larger on sites where timber harvest occurred. The impacts of timber harvests on squirrel densities were directly related to the amount of tree patchiness (+), the number and diameter of trees remaining for food and cover (+), and to the size of a cut area (-).

Study Location:  Abajo Mountains and Elk Ridge Plateau of San Juan County,  southeastern Utah
Habitat Description: PIPO forest
Summary:  The habitat requirements of the Navajo subspecies of the Abert squirrel are described. Diameter of PIPO trees (12-19" dbh) was the most significant variable in delineating Abert squirrel habitat. Other life history traits are examined, including distribution, use of nest and feed trees, movement and home range, and an evaluation of squirrel populations in a logged area. Logging resulted in a decrease in squirrel populations, as potential nest and feed trees were removed and conditions were created that enhanced habitat for competitors. Specific recommendations are made for logging within the range of the Abert squirrel.

Study Location:  Kaibab National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description:  PP forest
Summary: Kaibab squirrel numbers were most consistently correlated with the basal area of ponderosa pine, including all PIPO and those > 6" dbh. A conceptual model for assessing quality of Kaibab squirrel habitat was made by ranking basal area per acre of PIPO and number of squirrel nests per trapsite.

Habitat Description:  PIPO and other forest types
Summary:  Habitat needs of a variety of northern goshawk prey are identified by a literature review. Management recommendations are made in regard to nesting, foraging, and other life history attributes.

Study Location:  Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO forest
Summary: Foraging behavior of tassel-eared squirrels was examined. Food resources varied annually, and was reflected in the foraging behavior of the squirrels.
