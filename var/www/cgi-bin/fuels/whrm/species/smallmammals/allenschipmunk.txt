Study Location:  northwestern California
Habitat Description:  PSME
Summary:  This study describes the relative abundance of amphibians, reptiles and mammals in six seral stages of forest in NW California. Seral stages preferred by individual species are given (Table 2). Late brush/sapling and old growth seral stages provided the most productive wildlife habitat. Habitat components that correlated with the relative abundance of 9 species are also presented. Species that would increase or decrease in numbers after harvest of old-growth DF forest are predicted.
