# Literature
Distribution
ranges from Alaska to Novia Scotia, and across the northern continental USA, dipping into Georgia and South Carolina; disjunct populations in the southwest and Mexico
General Habitat
moist or dry grasslands and forested areas with a grassy component
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Canopy Cover
No information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
open canopy, presence of graminoid species; Shepherd (1994) found a negative association with forb cover
Nestsite Characteristics
nests constructed above ground in dense grass cover
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
no information available
Diet
herbaceous diet including over 70 plant species; grasses, seeds, roots, hypogeous fungi, insects
Predators
snakes, hawks, owls, weasels
Shelter Habitats
communally nests in winter
Response to Disturbance
showed no response to overstory removal or new forestry harvest techniques (Shepherd 1994); more abundant in seed-tree cut forest stands than clearcuts or old growth (Sullivan et al. 2000)
Sources of Information used in the Model

Study Location: northwest Montana
Habitat Description: PSME-dominated; also included PICO, ABLA, ABGR, PIEN, PIPO
Summary: The initial responses of small mammals to overstory removal and new forestry techniques were monitored in western Montana. Treatments affected large tree density but not vegetative cover or density of small trees. There was no significant treatment effect on any small mammal species, but trends in abundance were apparent; red-tailed chipmunks appeared to decline while yellow pine chipmunks and red-backed voles increased in response to harvest. Habitat associations were examined for some species pre- and post- harvest. The use of riparian buffers was also investigated, with use of buffers higher than expected in overstory removal grids and use of upland rows higher than expected in control grids.

Study Location:  south-central British Columbia
Habitat Description: PSME, PICO
Summary: This study tested the hypothesis that diversity of stand structure attributes and forest-floor small mammal communities increase from young pine to seed tree to old growth forest. Some vegetative attributes differed between forest type. Red-backed voles were most abundant in old growth forest, while northwestern chipmunks, heather voles, western jumping mice, montane shrews, and common shrews were more abundant in the treated stands. Meadow voles were more abundant in the seed tree stands. Deer mice, long-tailed voles, and short-tailed weasels were similarly abundant among all treatment types. Mean species richness and diversity was higher in the treated stands, suggesting that all stand types offer their own structural diversity to the forest landscape.
