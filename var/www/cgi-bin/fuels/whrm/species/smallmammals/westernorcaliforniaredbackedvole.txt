Distribution
Pacific northwest
General Habitat
mature mixed-conifer forest
Home or Activity Range
2-12 ac
Canopy Cover
abundance linked to high canopy cover (Doyle 1987)
Specific Habitat Preferences
large-diameter logs with overhangs; lichen cover, length of decayed logs, low canopy cover of deciduous trees, grass cover
Nestsite Characteristics
no information available
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
logs; forage mostly underground, where the temperatures are more stable
Diet
hypogeous fungi, mycorrhizal fungi, lichen; secondarily on seeds and forbs
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
large-diameter logs with overhangs
Response to Disturbance
absent from clearcuts (Corn et al. 1988); disappear from clearcuts surrounding forest remnants, less likely to be trapped near the edge than interior of remnant (Tallmon and Mills 1994)

In: Management of amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals in North America symposium: proceedings; Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-166. Fort Collins, CO: USDA, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station. 340-352.

Study Location: Oregon and Washington Cascade Mountains
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Abundance of small mammals was associated with seral stage and moisture of PSME forests. Habitat associations are given for a number of species. Comparisons between clearcut and young forests were made for a few species.

Study Location: western Cascade Range, Oregon
Habitat Description: primarily PSME; also TSHE, THPL, ABGR, TABR
Summary: Microhabitat separation and preferences were investigated for Clethrionomys californicus, Microtus oregoni and M. richardsoni. Specific habitat preferences are given for the three species. Microhabitat separation was a function of canopy cover of deciduous trees, percent cover of lichen, and distance from streamside

Study Location: west slope of Oregon Cascades
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: There was no significant difference in species richness among young, mature and old-growth PSME stands in the Oregon Cascade Range. Trowbridge's shrew was the most abundant small mammal captured. Trowbridge's shrew, the shrew-mole, the deer mouse, and the red tree vole all were associated with older stands. The coast mole was only found in mature and old growth stands in one year. Tree squirrel abundance was positively correlated with snags. Temporal and spatial differences in habitat use were indicated by associations with forest vegetational and physical characteristics. The authors state that young and mature stands in this study contained many characteristics of old growth stands as they were allowed to naturally regenerate. Therefore, caution should be exercised in extrapolating results, as these stands did not contain conditions representative of stands managed for timber production.

Study Location: southern Oregon Cascades
Habitat Description: PSME, THPL, ABCO, PIPO
Summary: Logs used as travel routes by western red-backed voles and deer mice were analyzed. Western red-backed voles used logs with larger diameters and mean overhang areas when traveling. Deer mouse use of logs was not correlated with any measured variable. Neither species responded to the decay status of the log.

McComb, William C.; McGarigal, Kevin, Anthony, Robert G. 1993. Small mammal and amphibian abundance in streamside and upslope habitats of mature Douglas-fir stands, western Oregon. Northwest Science. 67(1):7-15.

Study Location: Oregon Coast Range
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Small mammal and amphibian populations were sampled in streamside and upslope habitats in the Oregon Coast Range. Streamside habitats had shallower litter depth, greater high shrub cover (1.3-4m), greater midstory cover, less low shrub cover (<1.3m), less overstory cover, less basal area of snags and live conifers, and fewer stumps than upslope areas. These differences were largely due to different floristics. Small mammal species diversity was higher on streamside transects. Marsh shrews, Pacific jumping mice, long-tailed voles, and white-footed voles capture rates were higher streamside. Western red-backed voles, creeping voles, Trowbridge's shrews, and Townsend's chipmunks capture rates were higher on upslope transects. Amphibian species richness did not differ between stream and upslope transects. Dunn's salamanders were caught along streamside transects. More ensatinas were found on upslope transects. Specific habitat associations are given for three small mammal species: Pacific jumping mice, western red-backed voles, and marsh shrews.

Study Location: southern Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO (60%), PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Abundance of small mammals was associated with generalized habitat types within the supalpine zone. Moisture and stand maturity were two habitat features that separated patterns of abundance of various species. Specific habitat associations are given for 8 species of small mammals. The southern red-backed vole was confirmed as a suitable indicator of old-growth forest; the masked and dusky shrew may be as well.

Study Location: Klamath Mountains, OR
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Four California red-backed voles were radio-tracked on a remnant of forest surrounded by a forest that had been clearcut 4-27 years ago. Voles used logs more than expected by chance; 98% of observations coincided with logs even though they covered only 7% of the collective minimum-convex-polygon area. The majority of logs were in a late-stage decay class.
