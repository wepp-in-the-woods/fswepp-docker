Study Location: west slope of Oregon Cascades
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: There was no significant difference in species richness among young, mature and old-growth PSME stands in the Oregon Cascade Range. Trowbridge's shrew was the most abundant small mammal captured. Trowbridge's shrew, the shrew-mole, the deer mouse, and the red tree vole all were associated with older stands. The coast mole was only found in mature and old growth stands in one year. Tree squirrel abundance was positively correlated with snags. Temporal and spatial differences in habitat use were indicated by associations with forest vegetational and physical characteristics. The authors state that young and mature stands in this study contained many characteristics of old growth stands as they were allowed to naturally regenerate. Therefore, caution should be exercised in extrapolating results, as these stands did not contain conditions representative of stands managed for timber production.

Study Location: Umpqua National Forest, southwestern Oregon
Habitat Description: mature PSME, with past history of thinning or salvage logging
Summary: The association between small vertebrate richness and coarse woody debris volume was tested, with a positive correlation demonstrated across all taxa and also within the taxonomic groups of small mammals, insectivores, and amphibians. A number of individual species appear to be associated with coarse woody debris; the majority of these associations were positive. No evidence of an association between snag volume and small vertebrate richness was found. Because the coarse woody debris volumes in the study area were well above regional guidelines, the author predicts reduced small vertebrate richness in those areas where coarse woody debris guidelines are strictly followed.

Study Location: Oregon Coast Range
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Small mammal and amphibian populations were sampled in streamside and upslope habitats in the Oregon Coast Range. Streamside habitats had shallower litter depth, greater high shrub cover (1.3-4m), greater midstory cover, less low shrub cover (<1.3m), less overstory cover, less basal area of snags and live conifers, and fewer stumps than upslope areas. These differences were largely due to different floristics. Small mammal species diversity was higher on streamside transects. Marsh shrews, Pacific jumping mice, long-tailed voles, and white-footed voles capture rates were higher streamside. Western red-backed voles, creeping voles, Trowbridge's shrews, and Townsend's chipmunks capture rates were higher on upslope transects. Amphibian species richness did not differ between stream and upslope transects. Dunn's salamanders were caught along streamside transects. More ensatinas were found on upslope transects. Specific habitat associations are given for three small mammal species: Pacific jumping mice, western red-backed voles, and marsh shrews.
