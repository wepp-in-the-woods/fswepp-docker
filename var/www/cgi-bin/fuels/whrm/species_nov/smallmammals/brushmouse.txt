Distribution
southwestern USA into northern Mexico
General Habitat
pinyon-juniper, riparian, oak, pine-oak woodlands (rarely in pure pine stands)
Home or Activity Range
No information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
dense rock and shrub cover, windrowed slash; areas with greater shrub cover and log density, lower tree basal area; "other trees" in model are oaks
Nestsite Characteristics
under rocks, in crevices, under debris
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
may forage arboreally or in shrubs
Diet
pine nuts, acorns, seeds, berries
Predators
Mexican spotted owl; other raptors and forest carnivores
Shelter Habitats
dense rock and shrub cover, windrowed slash
Response to Disturbance
more abundant in burned areas (reviewed in Jennes 2000)
Sources of Information used in the Model
Holbrook 1978, Goodwin and Hungerford 1979, Ward and Block 1995
General Sources of Background Information
Holbrook 1978, Goodwin and Hungerford 1979, Burt 1980, reviewed in Ward and Block 1995, reviewed in Jennes 2000, Chambers 2002

Study Location:  Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description:  PIPO forest
Summary:  Small mammals were trapped in PIPO forest stands that had undergone a variety of treatments, including strip shelterwood cutting, clearcutting, severe thinning, and no treatment. Habitat relationships and diet composition are given for a variety of small mammals. The populations of some small mammals, particularly deer mice, were higher on treated plots than untreated plots; the presence of slash and other debris as well as the prevalence of food items (forbs and grasses) seems to be responsible for this pattern.

Holbrook, Sally J. Habitat relationships and coexistence of four sympatric species of Peromyscus in northwestern New Mexico. 1978. Journal of Mammalogy. 59(1): 18-26.

Study Location:  northwestern New Mexico
Habitat Description:  range from grass/sagebrush at low elevations to conifer forests containing PIPO, PSME, Picea sp., Abies sp., and aspen
Summary:  Habitat relationships of the sympatric deer, pinyon, brush and rock mouse were studied in northwest New Mexico. Subdivision of habitat by vegetational type is an important mechanism for coexistence in these species. Measures of the three-dimensional structure of habitat were correlated with the total number of species occuring in microsympatry. Mechanisms realted to foraging activities that would enhance the coexistence of these species are also discussed.

Ward Jr., James P.; Block, William M. 1995. Mexican spotted owl prey ecology. Chapter 5. In Recovery Plan for the Mexican Spotted Owl. Vol II. Albequerque, New Mexico: USDI Fish and Wildlife Service. pp 1-48.

Study Location:  range of Mexican spotted owl; case studies in northern Arizona and New Mexico
Habitat Description:  not stated, presumably mostly PIPO forest
Summary:  Literature review and synthesis of data from past studies concerning the ecology of prey of the Mexican Spotted Owl, including information on owl diet. Prey biomass decreases in late fall and early winter. Habitat correlates are presented from one study in northern Arizona (deer mouse, brush mouse, Mexican woodrat) and one in New Mexico. Impacts of fire, grazing, timber harvest, and fuel wood removal on prey species are reviewed.
