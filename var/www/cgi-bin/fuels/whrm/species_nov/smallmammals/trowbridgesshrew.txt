Response to Disturbance
most abundant in uncut plots, followed by unburned clearcut, least abundant in slash-burned clearcut (Hooven and Black 1976), more abundant in young stands than clearcuts (Corn et al. 1988); positively associated with older stands but not dependent on old-growth (Gilbert and Allwine 1991)
Sources of Information used in the Model

General Sources of Background Information

Study Location: western Oregon Cascades
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Study areas that varied widely in CWD amounts were sampled for terrestrial amphibians and small mammals. Regression models containing habitat variables were constructed for 5 species of amphibians and small mammals. As CWD volume was important to some organisms, the authors suggest a retention of CWD in the range of 100-300 m3/ha to provide habitat for most terrestrial salamanders.

Study Location: Oregon and Washington Cascade Mountains
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Abundance of small mammals was associated with seral stage and moisture of PSME forests. Habitat associations are given for a number of species. Comparisons between clearcut and young forests were made for a few species.

Study Location: west slope of Oregon Cascades
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: There was no significant difference in species richness among young, mature and old-growth PSME stands in the Oregon Cascade Range. Trowbridge's shrew was the most abundant small mammal captured. Trowbridge's shrew, the shrew-mole, the deer mouse, and the red tree vole all were associated with older stands. The coast mole was only found in mature and old growth stands in one year. Tree squirrel abundance was positively correlated with snags. Temporal and spatial differences in habitat use were indicated by associations with forest vegetational and physical characteristics. The authors state that young and mature stands in this study contained many characteristics of old growth stands as they were allowed to naturally regenerate. Therefore, caution should be exercised in extrapolating results, as these stands did not contain conditions representative of stands managed for timber production.

Study Location: western Oregon (Cascades)
Habitat Description: PSME; also TSHE, THPL, ABGR
Summary: Changes in small mammal populations were documented in two clearcut (one with slash burned) and one uncut PSME stand. Shrews and chipmunks were adversely impacted by logging, while deer mice and Oregon creeping voles were affected favorably by both logging and slash burnings
