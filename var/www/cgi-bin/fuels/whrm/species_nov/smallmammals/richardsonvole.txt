Doyle, A.T. 1987. Microhabitat separation among sympatric microtines, Clethrionomys californicus, Microtus oregoni and M. richardsoni. The American Midland Naturalist. 118: 258-265.

Study Location: western Cascade Range, Oregon
Habitat Description: primarily PSME; also TSHE, THPL, ABGR, TABR
Summary: Microhabitat separation and preferences were investigated for Clethrionomys californicus, Microtus oregoni and M. richardsoni. Specific habitat preferences are given for the three species. Microhabitat separation was a function of canopy cover of deciduous trees, percent cover of lichen, and distance from streamside
