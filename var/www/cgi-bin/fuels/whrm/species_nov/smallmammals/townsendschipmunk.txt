# Literature
Distribution
Pacific northwest, northeastern California
General Habitat
coniferous forest and adjacent chaparrel
Home or Activity Range
< 2.5 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
prefer timber and shrubby brush areas; avoid areas that are semi-bare
Nestsite Characteristics
nest primarily in burrows, also in trees, fallen trees, rock crevices
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages on ground, in shrubs and in trees; also caches food in trees and shrubs
Diet
seeds, nuts, fruits, fungi, insects
Predators
long-tailed weasel, mink, western spotted skunk, bobcat, great horned owl
Shelter Habitats
use burrows in winter
Response to Disturbance
increased 7 years after clearcut/burn (Gashwiler 1970); severely reduced or absent from PICO-ABLA forest one year after prescribed stand-replacing fire (Tiedemann and Woodard 2002)

Carey, Andrew B. 1991. The biology of arboreal rodents in Douglas-fir forests. Gen. Tech. Rep. PNW-GTR-276. Portland, OR: USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station. 46 p.

Study Location: west of Cascade crest in Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: not specified
Summary: Accounts of arboreal rodents are given, with information on identification, distribution, habitat preference, nesting, food items and predators. These species are most abundant and diverse in mixed-conifer old-growth forest that contains streams. All species appear to be sensitive to timber harvest due to loss of habitat and dispersal barriers.

Gashweiler, Jay S. 1970. Plant and animal changes on a clearcut in west-central Oregon. Ecology. 51:1018-1026.

Study Location: west-central Oregon (west Cascades)
Habitat Description: PSME, TSHE, THPL
Summary: Study documents changes in plant and mammal communities for 11 years following a clearcut with a fall burn. Deer mice increased in the experimental area soon after the burn was completed. Other species that increased at various times after the burn include Townsend's chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and the Oregon vole. Red-back voles, northern flying squirrels, and Douglas' squirrels were not found in the clearcut/burn. California squirrels migrated into the clearcut/burn.

Study Location: western Oregon (Cascades)
Habitat Description: PSME; also TSHE, THPL, ABGR
Summary: Changes in small mammal populations were documented in two clearcut (one with slash burned) and one uncut PSME stand. Shrews and chipmunks were adversely impacted by logging, while deer mice and Oregon creeping voles were affected favorably by both logging and slash burnings

Study Location: eastern Cascades, Washington
Habitat Description: overmature PICO-ABLA stand, mature PICO thicket
Summary: One year after a prescribed, stand-replacing fire, plant cover and diversity decreased, as did microbial respiriation. Nitrogen fixation and nitrification increased after burning. Overall bird diversity increased after the fire. Diversity of woodpeckers increased the year after burning, while needle-foraging species declined or were absent after fire. There was no definitive response of small mammals to burning, though the Townsend's chipmunk did markedly decline. Forage for elk in the burn was higher in crude protein, but low productivity and distance from water diminished the value of the burned area for elk.
