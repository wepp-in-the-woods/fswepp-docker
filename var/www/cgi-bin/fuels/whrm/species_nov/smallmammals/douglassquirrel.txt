# Literature
Distribution
western British Columbia, Washington and Oregon; northerwestern and central California
General Habitat
pole through old-growth conifer stands
Home or Activity Range
< 1.5 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
large trees that provide a consistent cone crop, downed wood, dislike hardwood understory ("other trees" in the model are tanoaks)
Nestsite Characteristics
cavity in tree or outside in branches
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
conifer trees; old growth and mature forest provide a more abundant, more consistent, less seasonal, and more diverse seed source
Diet
seeds, nuts, eggs, fungi, stores conifer cones and nuts in caches
Predators
northern goshawk, great horned owl, marten
Shelter Habitats
tree cavities, hollow trees, hollow logs, nests of grass, lichens, and sticks in trees, burrows in the ground; underground nest within midden
Response to Disturbance
not found in areas clearcut/burned (Gashwiler 1970)

Study Location: southern Washington Cascades
Habitat Description: PSME, THPL, TSHE
Summary: Douglas squirrel populations in winter were generally higher in old-growth forests, but varied dramatically from year to year in synchrony to the annual production of conifer cones. Older forests appeared to be better habitat, as they produced a greater and more reliable quantity of conifer seeds. Silvicultural strategies to increase levels of cone production would be an effective means of improving the habitat quality of young PSME forest for squirrels. Such strategies include retaining green trees to ensure local cone production, planting mixed species to provide alternate seed sources, and harvesting trees such that multilayered or irregular canopies are the result.

Study Location: west of Cascade crest in Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: not specified
Summary: Accounts of arboreal rodents are given, with information on identification, distribution, habitat preference, nesting, food items and predators. These species are most abundant and diverse in mixed-conifer old-growth forest that contains streams. All species appear to be sensitive to timber harvest due to loss of habitat and dispersal barriers.

Study Location: west-central Oregon (west Cascades)
Habitat Description: PSME, TSHE, THPL
Summary: Study documents changes in plant and mammal communities for 11 years following a clearcut with a fall burn. Deer mice increased in the experimental area soon after the burn was completed. Other species that increased at various times after the burn include Townsend's chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and the Oregon vole. Red-back voles, northern flying squirrels, and Douglas' squirrels were not found in the clearcut/burn. California squirrels migrated into the clearcut/burn.

Study Location: west slope of Oregon Cascades
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: There was no significant difference in species richness among young, mature and old-growth PSME stands in the Oregon Cascade Range. Trowbridge's shrew was the most abundant small mammal captured. Trowbridge's shrew, the shrew-mole, the deer mouse, and the red tree vole all were associated with older stands. The coast mole was only found in mature and old growth stands in one year. Tree squirrel abundance was positively correlated with snags. Temporal and spatial differences in habitat use were indicated by associations with forest vegetational and physical characteristics. The authors state that young and mature stands in this study contained many characteristics of old growth stands as they were allowed to naturally regenerate. Therefore, caution should be exercised in extrapolating results, as these stands did not contain conditions representative of stands managed for timber production.

Study Location: British Columbia
Habitat Description: PSME, TSHE, THPL, ALRU, ACMA
Summary: This study examined the importance of aspect and height in nest site selection (using nest boxes) for tree and flying squirrels. Both species chose higher nest boxes but there was no apparent selection for north or south aspect. Multiple nests were located in some boxes containing flying squirrels.

Study Location: south coast of British Columbia
Habitat Description: old- and second-growth stands of TSHE, THPL, PSME, ABAM
Summary: This study tested the hypothesis that old-growth forest stands were higher quality habitat than second-growth stands for two squirrel species. No major differences in movement, density, recruitment, mass of males, survival, percentage of the population breeding, and the duration of habitation of the study plots were found between the two stand types for flying squirrels. For Douglas squirrels, the only difference found was in recruitment, which was higher in the second growth stand. Therefore, old-growth habitat does not appear to be higher quality habitat for either species. When considering the contradictory results from other studies on northern flying squirrels, the authors noted that two overall patterns: abundance can be variable within a stand type and the relative difference between stand types varies from year to year. This pattern limits the inference from short-term studies.

In: Management of amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals in North America symposium: proceedings; Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-166. Fort Collins, CO: USDA, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station. 359-367.

Study Location: southern Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO (60%), PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Abundance of small mammals was associated with generalized habitat types within the supalpine zone. Moisture and stand maturity were two habitat features that separated patterns of abundance of various species. Specific habitat associations are given for 8 species of small mammals. The southern red-backed vole was confirmed as a suitable indicator of old-growth forest; the masked and dusky shrew may be as well.
