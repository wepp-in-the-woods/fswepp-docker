Distribution
non-coastal western USA
General Habitat
ponderosa pine forest type; grassy prairies, alpine meadows, brushy areas, open pine forests
Home or Activity Range
< 2.5 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
primarily ground-dwelling; seldom seen above ground; needs loose soil for burrowing; may prefer areas with low shrubs vs. high shrubs because the root systems of large shrub would prevent burrowing
Nestsite Characteristics
no information available
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
on ground or underground
Diet
feeds on above ground leaves and stems of plants, underground roots
Predators
boreal owl
Shelter Habitats
in burrows
Response to Disturbance
found more in early and late successional stages than mid-successional stages (Scrivner and Smith 1981)
Sources of Information used in the Model

Hayward, Gregory D., Hayward, Patricia H.; Garton, Edward O. 1993. Ecology of boreal owls in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. Wildlife Monographs. 124:159.

Study Location: northern Rocky Mountains; western Montana, Idaho, northwestern Wyoming, northern Utah
Habitat Description: spruce-fir zone; including ABLA, PSME, aspen, PICO, also extended into PIPO zone
Summary: Four year study on the ecology of the boreal owl in the northern Rocky Mountains. All owls were detected above 1292 m elevation, and the majority of detections were in ABLA habitat types. PICO was the only dominant forest type that was avoided, despite being common in the study area. It was used when no other forest type was available, and was characterized as having large trees. Nest sites were restricted to mature/old stands with complex physical structure; many habitat types were used, including mixed conifer forest (PIPO and PSME) 39% of the time as well as aspen 21% of the time despite covering <1% of the available forest. PICO was avoided for nesting. Boreal owls were selective in summer roosts sites, choosing sites with greater canopy cover, higher tree density, and higher basal area. The best foraging habitat was associated with mature/old spruce-fir stands where prey was most abundant. Diet, population and breeding were also examined. Habitat associations by vegetation type are given for primary prey species. Management strategies that focus on snag retention and harvest practices that retain forest structure are recommended for maintaining quality habitat.

Study Location: Payette National Forest, Idaho
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: Pocket gophers were live-trapped to assess habitat preferences. Variation in gopher density was best explained by forb cover (+), shrub cover (-), available tree basal area (-), and soil depth (+).  A feeding trial experiment was also conducted to determine dietary preferences. Forbs were prefered over grasses. The forbs selected tended to be those found in early and mid-seral stage forest.

Study Location: Clearwater National Forest Idaho
Habitat Description: spruce-fir associations, ABGR main tree
Summary: This study examined pocket gophers in stands different successional stages (0-80 years past disturbance). The youngest and oldest stands had the highest gopher abundance, with mid-successional stands having the lower abundance, which the authors attribute to differences in the understory. Those stands had a high density of low shrubs (< 114 cm), and forbs favorable for eating.
