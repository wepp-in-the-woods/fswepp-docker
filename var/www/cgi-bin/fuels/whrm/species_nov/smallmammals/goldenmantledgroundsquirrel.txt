Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Small mammals were trapped in PIPO forest stands that had undergone a variety of treatments, including strip shelterwood cutting, clearcutting, severe thinning, and no treatment. Habitat relationships and diet composition are given for a variety of small mammals. The populations of some small mammals, particularly deer mice, were higher on treated plots than untreated plots; the presence of slash and other debris as well as the prevalence of food items (forbs and grasses) seems to be responsible for this pattern.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, northern Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Relationships between small mammal species and wildfire severity categories were examined in northern Arizona. Average number of species was similar among high and moderate severity burn plots as well as controls, though species composition differed. Deer mice were more abundant on high-severity plots compared to moderate-severity plots. Patterns of habitat correlation for deer mice were not consistent across fire severities or spatial scales, suggesting that habitat use patterns differ between fire severities. The author suggests that deer mice are responded to habitat variables that are limiting in the specific severity type under consideration.

Study Location: review
Habitat Description: review
Summary: Habitat needs of a variety of northern goshawk prey are identified by a literature review. Management recommendations are made in regard to nesting, foraging, and other life history attributes.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Stands in western Montana underwent PIPO restoration treatments that included selective tree removal followed by a prescribed burn. Bird and small mammal populations were monitored on these and control sites. While some bird species showed a preference for treated vs. untreated stands, the treatment did not have major effects on avian species composition. The foraging behavior of bark-gleaning birds was also examined on treated vs. untreated sites. Birds selectively foraged on larger trees, with PIPO preferred to PSME in this study area. Thinning and burning is compatible with providing forage substrates for the species in this area, as the encounter rate for bark-gleaners was higher in the treated sites. Small mammal communities changed in both abundance and composition as a result of treatment.
