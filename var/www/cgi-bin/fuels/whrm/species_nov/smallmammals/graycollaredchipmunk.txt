Distribution
central Arizona and New Mexico
General Habitat
PIPO and spruce-fir forests
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
open sunny forests with an abundance of herbaceous and shrubby plants and many logs, snags, stumps, rocks and cliffs
Nestsite Characteristics
underground, in old logs, rocks, and cavities in snags; commonly uses woodpecker holes
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
logs, debris, snags, well developed shrubby and herbaceous layers, rocky habitats, areas with cone-producing trees
Diet
omnivores: seeds, nuts, fruits, bulbs, roots, herbage, insects, other animal matter
Predators
Northern goshawk
Shelter Habitats
snags, downed logs and woody debris for predator avoidance
Response to Disturbance
decreased as canopy was opened; not found on plots burned with high-severity wildlfire one year after fire, but were found on moderate-severity plots (Kyle 2000)

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Small mammals were trapped in PIPO forest stands that had undergone a variety of treatments, including strip shelterwood cutting, clearcutting, severe thinning, and no treatment. Habitat relationships and diet composition are given for a variety of small mammals. The populations of some small mammals, particularly deer mice, were higher on treated plots than untreated plots; the presence of slash and other debris as well as the prevalence of food items (forbs and grasses) seems to be responsible for this pattern.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, northern Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Relationships between small mammal species and wildfire severity categories were examined in northern Arizona. Average number of species was similar among high and moderate severity burn plots as well as controls, though species composition differed. Deer mice were more abundant on high-severity plots compared to moderate-severity plots. Patterns of habitat correlation for deer mice were not consistent across fire severities or spatial scales, suggesting that habitat use patterns differ between fire severities. The author suggests that deer mice are responded to habitat variables that are limiting in the specific severity type under consideration.

Study Location: review
Habitat Description: review
Summary: Habitat needs of a variety of northern goshawk prey are identified by a literature review. Management recommendations are made in regard to nesting, foraging, and other life history attributes.
