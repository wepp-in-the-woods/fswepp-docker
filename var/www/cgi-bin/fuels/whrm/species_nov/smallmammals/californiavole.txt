Response to Disturbance
removal of timber and reduction of vegetative cover in clearcuts reduced habitat suitability (Hooven and Black 1976)
Sources of Information used in the Model

Summaries of Specific Studies
Hooven, Edward F.; Black, Hugh C. 1976. Effects of some clearcutting practices on small-mammal populations in western Oregon. Northwest Science. 50(4):189-208.

Location of Study:  western Oregon (Cascades)
Habitat Description:  PSME; also TSHE, THPL, ABGR
Summary: Changes in small mammal populations were documented in two clearcut (one with slash burned) and one uncut PSME stand. Shrews and chipmunks were adversely impacted by logging, while deer mice and Oregon creeping voles were affected favorably by both logging and slash burnings.

In: Management of amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals in North America symposium: proceedings; Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-166. Fort Collins, CO: USDA, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station. 23-31.

Location of Study:  northwestern California
Habitat Description:  PSME
Summary:  This study describes the relative abundance of amphibians, reptiles and mammals in six seral stages of forest in NW California. Seral stages preferred by individual species are given (Table 2). Late brush/sapling and old growth seral stages provided the most productive wildlife habitat. Habitat components that correlated with the relative abundance of 9 species are also presented. Species that would increase or decrease in numbers after harvest of old-growth PSME forest are predicted.
