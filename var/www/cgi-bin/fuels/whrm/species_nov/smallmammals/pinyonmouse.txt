General Sources of Background Information

Chambers, Carol L.  2002.  Forest management and the dead wood resource in ponderosa pine forests: effects on small mammals.  USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. PSW-GTR-181: 679-693.

Study Location: northern Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary:Deer mice were less abundant in high density stands of ponderosa pine (live trees and small snags); more abundant in high forb cover and Gambel oak tree basal area.  Author predicts that deer mice will continue to increase in density in treated units for several years following treatment; then populations will stabilize.

Holbrook, Sally J. Habitat relationships and coexistence of four sympatric species of Peromyscus in northwestern New Mexico. 1978. Journal of Mammalogy. 59(1): 18-26.

Study Location:  northwestern New Mexico
Habitat Description:  range from grass/sagebrush at low elevations to conifer forests containing PIPO, PSME, Picea sp., Abies sp., and aspen
Summary:  Habitat relationships of the sympatric deer, pinyon, brush and rock mouse were studied in northwest New Mexico. Subdivision of habitat by vegetational type is an important mechanism for coexistence in these species. Measures of the three-dimensional structure of habitat were correlated with the total number of species occuring in microsympatry. Mechanisms realted to foraging activities that would enhance the coexistence of these species are also discussed.

Raphael, Martin G. 1988. Habitat associations of small mammals in a subalpine forest, southeastern Wyoming. In: Management of amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals in North America symposium: proceedings; Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-166. Fort Collins, CO: USDA, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station. 359-367.

Study Location: southern Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO (60%), PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Abundance of small mammals was associated with generalized habitat types within the supalpine zone. Moisture and stand maturity were two habitat features that separated patterns of abundance of various species. Specific habitat associations are given for 8 species of small mammals. The southern red-backed vole was confirmed as a suitable indicator of old-growth forest; the masked and dusky shrew may be as well.
