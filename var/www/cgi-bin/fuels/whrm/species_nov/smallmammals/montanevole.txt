Study Location: Utah Co., Utah
Habitat Description: PSME and aspen interspersed with herbaceous and shrub-dominated meadows
Summary: Habitat associations of four small mammal species (deer mouse, western jumping mouse, western redbacked vole, montane vole) were examined for montane sites in Utah. Species microhabitat preferences are given. Microhabitat preferences shifted from fallen logs and brush in early summer to areas of herbaceous growth in mid and late summer. Females occupied more structured microhabitat than males (higher levels of fallen trees, trees, and shrubs).
