Kyle, Sean C. 2000. Small mammal abundance and habitat correlates following varied-severity wildfire in ponderosa pine-bunchgrass forests. Flagstaff, AZ: Northern Arizona University. 125 p. M.S. Thesis.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, northern Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Relationships between small mammal species and wildfire severity categories were examined in northern Arizona. Average number of species was similar among high and moderate severity burn plots as well as controls, though species composition differed. Deer mice were more abundant on high-severity plots compared to moderate-severity plots. Patterns of habitat correlation for deer mice were not consistent across fire severities or spatial scales, suggesting that habitat use patterns differ between fire severities. The author suggests that deer mice are responded to habitat variables that are limiting in the specific severity type under consideration.
