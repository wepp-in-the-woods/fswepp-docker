Study Location: Utah Co., Utah
Habitat Description: aspen and PSME interspersed with herbaceous meadows and shrub-dominated ridges
Summary: Montane shrews showed temporal variation in habitat association in the summer months. Habitat use in July was characterized by areas with higher densities of fallen logs, greater number of woody species, and larger size of understory trees, which was characteristic of shrubby areas in early successional stages. In August, no obvious associations were present. In September, shrews used habitat with a lower density of fallen logs, few numbers of woody species, and smaller understory trees, which represented areas dominated by climax aspen stands. The authors attribute these patterns to the development and persistence of herbaceous ground cover in the summer months.

Study Location: Utah Co., Utah
Habitat Description: PSME and aspen interspersed with herbaceous and shrub-dominated meadows
Summary: Habitat associations of four small mammal species (deer mouse, western jumping mouse, western redbacked vole, montane vole) were examined for montane sites in Utah. Species microhabitat preferences are given. Microhabitat preferences shifted from fallen logs and brush in early summer to areas of herbaceous growth in mid and late summer. Females occupied more structured microhabitat than males (higher levels of fallen trees, trees, and shrubs).

Study Location: Oregon and Washington Cascade Mountains
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Abundance of small mammals was associated with seral stage and moisture of PSME forests. Habitat associations are given for a number of species. Comparisons between clearcut and young forests were made for a few species.

Study Location: Frank Church Wilderness, central Idaho
Habitat Description: PICO-dominated, also PIPO, PSME, ABLA, PIEN
Summary: Small mammal populations were sampled in a wilderness area in netral Idaho. Spruce-fir forests had the highest abundance of small mammals, while PICO forest had the lowest. Species richness was low in all habitats, though it was highest in PICO forest. Habitat associations are given for some small mammals. The patchy distribution of small mammals in this study area mimics the patchy nature of forests in this region.

Study Location: northwest Montana
Habitat Description: ABGR, LAOC, PIPO, BEPA, PSME, PIEN, ACGL
Summary: The habitat use patterns and food habitats of montane, vagrant, and masked shrews were studied. The vagrant shrew was most commonly captured on mesic sites, while the masked shrew was found more often on xeric sites. Montane shrews were infrequently captured. Marked masked and vagrant shrews did not differ in movement patterns, while both commonly used fallen trees as runways and as cover. Microhabitat use differed significantly between species. Differences suggest that the vagrant and masked shrews partition space within the habitat at both large and small scales. No significant difference in prey items was found between species.

Study Location: southern Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO (60%), PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Abundance of small mammals was associated with generalized habitat types within the supalpine zone. Moisture and stand maturity were two habitat features that separated patterns of abundance of various species. Specific habitat associations are given for 8 species of small mammals. The southern red-backed vole was confirmed as a suitable indicator of old-growth forest; the masked and dusky shrew may be as well.

Study Location:  south-central British Columbia
Habitat Description: PSME, PICO
Summary: This study tested the hypothesis that diversity of stand structure attributes and forest-floor small mammal communities increase from young pine to seed tree to old growth forest. Some vegetative attributes differed between forest type. Red-backed voles were most abundant in old growth forest, while northwestern chipmunks, heather voles, western jumping mice, montane shrews, and common shrews were more abundant in the treated stands. Meadow voles were more abundant in the seed tree stands. Deer mice, long-tailed voles, and short-tailed weasels were similarly abundant among all treatment types. Mean species richness and diversity was higher in the treated stands, suggesting that all stand types offer their own structural diversity to the forest landscape.
