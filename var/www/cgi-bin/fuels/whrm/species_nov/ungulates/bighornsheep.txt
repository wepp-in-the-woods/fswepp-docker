Distribution
southern British Columbia and Alberta through the mountainous regions of the western United States and northern Mexico
General Habitat
diverse range of habitats; must include rocky terrain with step cliffs in association with meadows or grassland
Home or Activity Range
150-500 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
rocky terrain associated with meadows or grassland; areas with shrubs for food and cover, forbs and grasses
Nestsite Characteristics
usually give birth on steep rocky terrains; cliffs adjacent to timbered areas for cover and grasslands for feeding; areas with dense low shrubs and seedlings, forb/herbaceous cover
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
meadows and grassland; areas with palatable shrubs, grasses, and forbs
Diet
grasses, shrubs
Predators
coyote, mountain lion, black bear, bobcat, bald eagle
Shelter Habitats
small patches of conifers and deep ravines as shelter from wind and snow
Response to Disturbance
in areas treated for habitat improvement that resulted in an increase in palatable shrubs, grass, and forb cover, responded positively in movement patterns but not in population dynamics (Stansberry 1996)

Semmens, William J. 1996. Seasonal movements and habitat use of the Highlands/Pioneer Mountains bighorn sheep herd of soutwest Montana. Bozeman, MT: Montana State University. 103 p. M.S. Thesis.

Location of Study:  southwest Montana
Habitat Description:  PSME at high-elevation timbered areas; mountain mahogany and sagebrush grasslands
Summary: Home range, sex and age composition, population estimation, site preference, food habits, vegetational cover of feeding sites versus food habits, mineral use, and possible competition with mule deer and cattle were investigated for a population of Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep. Seasonal site preferences were noted in relation to escape cover, slope, aspect, and ground cover.

Location of Study:  northwest Montana
Habitat Description:  PIPO, PSME, LAOC, PICO, ABLA, PIEN
Summary: This study evaluates the success of habitat enhancement projects for mule deer and bighorn sheep. Shrub manipulations resulted in a general decrease in shrubs, except for palatable species, which increased. Herbage production and understory cover composition increased initially but returned to pre-treatment levels within 2 years. Bighorn sheep responded by increasing use of treated areas, while a change in mule deer habitat use was less apparent. Treatments did not appear to impact home range for either species. Overall, results of monitoring suggest that their was a positive behavioral response to habitat manipulation, but a long-term improvement in population dynamics was not evident.

Location of Study:  northwest Montana
Habitat Description:  THPL, ABGR, TSHE, PSME, PIPO
Summary: Group size, herd sex and age characteristics, movements, home range, and habitat selection were studied for wintering bighorn sheep. Wintering sheep selected against elevations > 4800 ft, drainage bottoms, upper slopes, areas with aspects, areas >0.2 miles from steep terrain, closed forests, and one PSME habitat type. Preferences were shown for cliffs, areas with steepness > 80%, areas within 0.2 miles of steep terrain, shrubland-grasslands and open forests, and the rockland-scree habitat-type category.
