Response to Disturbance
in winter heavily used burned areas (Keay 1977, Keay and Peek 1980); in areas treated for habitat improvement that resulted in an increase in palatable shrubs, grass, and forb cover, responded positively in movement patterns but not in population dynamics (Stansberry 1996); habitat use was higher in conventionally thinned stands followed by chemically thinned stands over unthinned (Sullivan et al. 2002)

Location of Study:  elk and mule deer range
Habitat Description:  elk and mule deer range
Summary: The consequences of timber management decisions on potential mule deer and elk habitat use are developed, using a model that integrates a ratio of cover and forage areas. Optimum habitat is described as a ratio of 40% cover and 60% forage. Particular requirements for birthing, hiding, and thermal cover are given. Habitat for mule deer and elk can be enhanced by considering travel lanes, road construction, shaded or other fuel breaks, and timber management operations.

Location of Study:  Oregon
Habitat Description:  variety
Summary:  Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Location of Study:  Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area, east-central Idaho
Habitat Description:  variety: bluebunch wheatgrass/poa, PIPO/bluebunch wheatgrass, PSME/ninebark, grand fir/clintonia, THPL, PIEN, ABLA, PICO, PIAL
Summary:    This study assessed the impact of fires on white-tailed deer and mule deer populations. Preference for specific habitat types varied monthly. White-tailed deer exhibited a significant preference for unburned sites, which had greater cover, and were seen mostly at low elevations (<1220 m). Mule deer preferred burned PSME/ninebark and PIPO/bluebunch wheatgrass habitat in winter, and were often seen at higher elevations (>1070 m). Seasonal food preferences are given for white-tailed and mule deer. Many of these forage species have been demonstrated to be enhanced by fires. One species, ninebark, was eaten on burned sites but not on unburned. The author suggests that fires can enhance the palatability and availabity of some forage species. Burning of PSME/ninebark and PIPO/bluebunch wheatgrass may enhance their value as mule deer winter range. This action may preclude the immediate use of these habitat types by white-tailed deer, but light burns may improve the forage value of winter range without removing important shrub cover if stems are left standing.

Location of Study:  Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area, east-central Idaho
Habitat Description:  bluebunch wheatgrass/Sandberg bluegrass, PIPO/bluebunch wheatgrass, PSME/ninebark, ABGR/clintonia, THPL
Summary:  Habitat preferences for mule and white-tailed deer were examined in areas with recent wildfire. White-tailed deer preferred unburned PSME in January, March and April; unburned bluebunch wheatgrass was preferred in February. The majority of sightings were at low elevations. Mule deer preferred burned PSME and PIPO during the winter months; this pattern continued into April and May. Both species used closed-canopy habitats at some point in the winter that offered thermal protection and forage ability due to a lower snowpack. Seasonal food preferences are given. The author suggests that fires can enhance the palatability and availability of some forage species (i.e. ninebark). Burning of this forest type will enhance use by mule deer in winter, though it may reduce use by white-tailed deer until sufficient shrub cover develops (3-4 years post-fire).

Lyon, L. Jack; Jenson, Chester E. 1980. Management implications of elk and deer use of clear-cuts in Montana. Journal of Wildlife Management. 44:353-362.

Location of Study:  eastern and western Montana
Habitat Description:  not stated
Summary: Pellets of elk and combined mule and white-tailed deer were examined in and adjacent to clearcuts. Pellet distributions suggest that animals enter clear-cut openings in search of high quality and quantity forage, though require security in the form of cover in these areas. Elk and deer both preferred openings with cover except where such cover inhibiting forage growth. Both preferred openings where logging slash was not a barrier to movement. Predictive models for elk in use of clearcuts in western Montana included vegetation height within the opening (+, largely shrubs), depth of dead and down timber in adjacent forest, slash depth within opening, and area of the opening. Models for elk in eastern Montana included elevation of opening, cover quality of the uncut adjacent forest, vegetation height inside the opening (-, largely PICO seedlings), and vehicle access. Elk preferred smaller openings than deer, but were more tolerant of large openings. Open roads and inadequate cover severely depressed elk use of clearcuts.

Location of Study:  Southern Montana
Habitat Description:  PSME, ABLA
Summary: Forest vegetation includes core habitat for mule deer production in the Bridger Mts. High summer deer densities appear to be associated with multi-aged stands of PSME and/or subalpine fir on moist north and east aspects at elevations of 2,150-2,400 m. Moderate densities appear to be associated with open, 100-200 year old PSME stands on drier south and west aspects between 2,150-2,400 m. Low densities were typical of extensive, even-aged (60-100 year old) stands of PICO at intermediate elevations, or 100-150 year old whitebark pine at higher elevations. The authors assert that there is no evidence that logging practicies, often said to increase deer foraging opportunities, actually increase or decrease deer populations in the long term. Also, the authors hypothesize that clearcutting would be detrimental to deer populations, as deer in the Bridger Mts. appear to maintain high summer densities by exploiting the diverse patterns offered by existing late mature and old-growth forest habitats.

Location of Study:  Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado
Habitat Description:  Aspen, PICO, ABLA, PIEN
Summary: Review of the interactions between wildlife and aspen in Rocky Mountain National Park. Focuses on wildlife that impact aspen stands in such a way that promotes fungal infection (such as elk and sapsuckers) or alter aspen structurally and prevent reproductive growth (mule deer). Wildlife is treated as a threat to the viability of aspen stands in the region. Largely anecdotal.

Location of Study:  northwest Montana
Habitat Description:  PIPO, PSME, LAOC, PICO, ABLA, PIEN
Summary: This study evaluates the success of habitat enhancement projects for mule deer and bighorn sheep. Shrub manipulations resulted in a general decrease in shrubs, except for palatable species, which increased. Herbage production and understory cover composition increased initially but returned to pre-treatment levels within 2 years. Bighorn sheep responded by increasing use of treated areas, while a change in mule deer habitat use was less apparent. Treatments did not appear to impact home range for either species. Overall, results of monitoring suggest that their was a positive behavioral response to habitat manipulation, but a long-term improvement in population dynamics was not evident.

Study Location:  south-central British Columbia
Habitat Description: PICO, in a ABLA/PIGL climax zone
Summary: This study tested the hypotheses that the abundance and diversity of stand structural attributes, forest floor mammal communities, and relative habitat use of large herbivores will all increase from unthinned to conventionally thinned to chemically thinned stands of young PICO forest. Abundance and diversity of understory vegetation and small mammal communities were generally unaffected by stand thinning. Deer mice were most abundant in the chemically thinned stands, followed by unthinned and conventionally thinned stands. Heather voles were most abundant in the conventionally thinned stands. Other small mammals were similar between treatments. Mule deer habitat use was higher in conventionally thinned stands followed by chemically thinned stands over unthinned. Snowshoe hare pellets were highest in the unthinned stands, but also higher in the chemically thinned stands vs. the conventially thinned stands. The patterns observed are attributed to the differences in stands structure that resulted from the treatment types.
