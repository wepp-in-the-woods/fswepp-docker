Summaries of Specific Studies
Cunningham, Stan C.; Babb, Randall D.; Jones, Thomas R.; Taubert, Bruce D.; Vega, Raul. 2002. Reaction of lizard populations to a catastrophic wildfire in a central Arizona mountain range. Biological Conservation. 107(2002): 193-201.

Study Location: central Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO and mixed conifer at high elevations, interior chaparral and Sonoran desert scrub at lower elevations
Summary: Reptile species were trapped in burned and unburned chaparral and forest plots for 3 years after a wildfire. This study found that the majority of founders were fire-survivors. Relative abundance of animals was 10 times greater in burned areas; species richness and diversity were also higher. In the forested areas, reptile abundance was 4-9 times greater in burned than unburned forest. The relative abundance of individual species in burned and unburned forest is presented. The overall preference for burned areas could be attributed to a variety of factors, including an increase in food resources. The results of this study are short-term in nature; inference is limited and additional work should be done to further examine the patterns found.
