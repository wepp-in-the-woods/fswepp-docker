Distribution
four-corners area of Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico
General Habitat
found mainly in the mountains in pinyon-juniper grassland, open chaparral, oak woodland, and lower edges of PIPO and fir forests; at lower elevations can be found in broadleaf woodlands along streams
Home or Activity Range
< 2.5 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
prefers open woodland with grassy understory; juniper woodlands with scant ground vegetation and gravelly soil
Nestsite Characteristics
all individuals are female (parthenogenetic); eggs hatch without male fertilization
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
no information available
Diet
insects: grasshoppers, crickets, leafhoppers, caterpillars, ants; spiders
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
abundant in both forest burned by stand-replacing wildfire and unburned forest (Cunningham et al. 2002)
Sources of Information used in the Model
no information available
General Sources of Background Information

Study Location: central Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO and mixed conifer at high elevations, interior chaparral and Sonoran desert scrub at lower elevations
Summary: Reptile species were trapped in burned and unburned chaparral and forest plots for 3 years after a wildfire. This study found that the majority of founders were fire-survivors. Relative abundance of animals was 10 times greater in burned areas; species richness and diversity were also higher. In the forested areas, reptile abundance was 4-9 times greater in burned than unburned forest. The relative abundance of individual species in burned and unburned forest is presented. The overall preference for burned areas could be attributed to a variety of factors, including an increase in food resources. The results of this study are short-term in nature; inference is limited and additional work should be done to further examine the patterns found.
