Distribution
many subspecies; western USA as far north as Oregon and Idaho; south into Mexico
General Habitat
deserts and semiarid habitats, including deserts, montane pine forests, woodland and streamside growth
Home or Activity Range
< 1 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
sparse plants, open areas for running; avoids dense grasslands and thick shrub growth
Nestsite Characteristics
eggs are laid underground
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
ground-forager
Diet
grasshoppers, Lepidoptera (adults and larvae), beetles, spiders, Homoptera, bugs, termites, scorpions, lizards
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
run to a shrub and move under its shelter to sneak away from the other side; also retreat to burrows
Response to Disturbance
captured in forest burned by stand-replacing wildfire- not in unburned forest (Cunningham et al. 2002)
Sources of Information used in the Model
no information available
General Sources of Background Information

Study Location: central Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO and mixed conifer at high elevations, interior chaparral and Sonoran desert scrub at lower elevations
Summary: Reptile species were trapped in burned and unburned chaparral and forest plots for 3 years after a wildfire. This study found that the majority of founders were fire-survivors. Relative abundance of animals was 10 times greater in burned areas; species richness and diversity were also higher. In the forested areas, reptile abundance was 4-9 times greater in burned than unburned forest. The relative abundance of individual species in burned and unburned forest is presented. The overall preference for burned areas could be attributed to a variety of factors, including an increase in food resources. The results of this study are short-term in nature; inference is limited and additional work should be done to further examine the patterns found.
