Distribution
forested coastal interior mountains of the Northwest
General Habitat
mature-old growth forests; cold-fast-moving permanent streams
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
closed-canopy conditions, cool flowing streams
Nestsite Characteristics
breed in cool flowing streams; prefer closed-canopy conditions; eggs are laid in strings under large rocks
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
no information available
Diet
adults insectivorous; larva feed on algae and diatoms
Predators
garter snake, Pacific giant salamander, Rana sp., western toad, trout, char, salmon, dipper, weasels, shrews
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
a loss of canopy cover from forest insects, tree disease, or fire would likely have a detrimental effect as stream temperatures would rise and sedimentation would increase (reviewed in Bull and Wales 2001); some evidence that tailed frogs disappear from logged stands in Washington and Oregon (reviewed in Bull and Wales 2001)

Study Location: eastern Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: primarily PIPO
Summary: The authors review the habitat needs of amphibian species of concern in eastern Oregon and Washington, focusing on how disturbances (natural and anthropogenic) would alter habitat for these species. Species of concern include the Oregon spotted frog, Columbia spotted frog, northern leopard frog, Cascades frog, Tailed frog, Larch Mountain salamander, and Cope's giant salamander.

Study Location: Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Evidence from this study suggests that rich, abundant populations of herpetofauna occur in naturally regenerating stands in Oregon and Washington. Few differences were found in amphibians between wet, moderate, and dry old-growth sites and between young, mature, and old-growth stands. Three salamanders in Oregon were found associated with downed logs or bark on the ground or on logs. These salamanders differed in their preference for age/class of downed logs.

Gomez, D.M.; Anthony, R.G. 1996. Amphibian and reptile abundance in riparian and upslope areas of five forest types in western Oregon. Northwest Science. 70:109-119.

Study Location: central Coast Ranges, Oregon
Habitat Description: 5 forest types, from young to old PSME (includes TSHE), as well as one deciduous forest type
Summary: Amphibian and reptile populations were studied in five forest types. Amphibian species richness was the highest in pole stands, followed by old growth. Abundance was highest in the deciduous forest type. Reptile species richness and abundance was highest in the shrub forest type. Stream and upslope habitats were similar in species richness, while more amphibians were caught in stream habitats and more reptiles were caught in upslope habitats. Capture rates for different species are given by forest type.

Study Location: northwestern California, southwestern Oregon
Habitat Description: PSME- low to mid elevations
Summary: Abundances and community composition of reptiles and amphibians were compared across forest types of coastal and inland DF forests. Habitat associations of 10 common species are given. Salamanders comprise the majority of the herpetofauna of this area. Species diversity was greater in older forest age classes with mesic conditions. A comparison of sampling methods is also presented.
