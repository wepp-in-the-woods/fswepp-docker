Distribution
northwestern USA north into western Canada and southern Alaska
General Habitat
frequents a variety of habitats, including semiarid sagebrush, cheatgrass plains, alpine meadows, barren rocky shores of high mountain lakes
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
found in piles of rotten wood, under bark, rotting logs, rocks, and other objects near quiet water of ponds, lakes, or streams; larvae reside in shallow, often ephemeral ponds
Nestsite Characteristics
breeds in ponds, some not completely free of ice; eggs are attached to vegetation, sticks or rocks, predominantly in temporary pools
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
no information available
Diet
larvae eat small invertebrates (copepods and fairy shrimp), also young Pacific Treefrog tadpoles and smaller long-toed salamander larvae
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
found in piles of rotten wood, under bark, rotting logs, rocks, and other objects near quiet water of ponds, lakes, or streams; shrubs, forbs and small trees provide cover that reduces dessication
Response to Disturbance
overstory removal and new forestry harvest treatments reduced the abundance of adult salamanders to 25% of the intact stands, and adults were larger on treated stands (McGraw 1995)
Sources of Information used in the Model
McGraw 1995
General Sources of Background Information

Study Location: northwestern Montana
Habitat Description: PSME-dominated
Summary: The relative abundance of metamorphosed and larval long-toed salamanders was examined in both intact sites and sites that had been harvested with new forestry or overstory removal harvest techniques. Both harvest treatments reduced the abundance of salamanders to 25% of the intact stands. Salamanders that survived the treatments were larger than those found on intact sites. The author attributes this pattern to the ability of larger salamanders to withstand dessication, the risk of which is higher in treated areas. Larval salamanders did not exhibit a clear pattern of response to harvest, but were more abundant in smaller ponds where diversity of invertebrate predators and competitors was the lowest.
