Study Location: southeastern Idaho
Habitat Description: conifer forests: Pinus, Picea, Abies
Summary: Western toad habitat selection and movement were esamined, with an emphasis on testing for a biophysical basis o habitat selection. Toads that used primarily terrestrial habitats used rodent burrows and other microsites sheltered by shrubs and coarse woddy debris. Selected macrohabitat patches had high shrub cover. Clearcuts were selected against. Sites with low contrast along edges were selected for, while sites with high contrast along edges were selected against. The hypothesis that habitat selection has a biophysical basis was supported.
