Distribution
endemic to Pacific northwest
General Habitat
highly aquatic; associated with ponds, marshes, and slow-flowing streams
Home or Activity Range
< 1 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
aquatic sites must contain a shallow emergent wetland component
Nestsite Characteristics
no information available
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
no information available
Diet
insects: ants, beetles, mosquito larvae, grasshoppers; spiders, mollusks, tadpoles, crayfish, slugs
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
road building has eliminated breeding sites (reviewed in Bull and Wales 2001); high- and low-water events, ice events, beaver activity, livestock grazing, and introduction of exotic predators could influence populations (reviewed in Bull and Wales 2001)
Sources of Information used in the Model
no information available
General Sources of Background Information
reviewed in Bull and Wales 2001, reviewed in O'Neil et al. 2001, Stebbins 2003
Summaries of Specific Studies
Bull, Evelyn; Wales, Barbara C. 2001. Effects of disturbance on amphibians of conservation concern in eastern Oregon and Washington. Northwest Science. 75:174-179.

Study Location: eastern Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: primarily PIPO
Summary: The authors review the habitat needs of amphibian species of concern in eastern Oregon and Washington, focusing on how disturbances (natural and anthropogenic) would alter habitat for these species. Species of concern include the Oregon spotted frog, Columbia spotted frog, northern leopard frog, Cascades frog, Tailed frog, Larch Mountain salamander, and Cope's giant salamander.
