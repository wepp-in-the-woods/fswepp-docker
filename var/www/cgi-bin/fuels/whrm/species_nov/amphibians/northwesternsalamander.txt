Study Location: Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Evidence from this study suggests that rich, abundant populations of herpetofauna occur in naturally regenerating stands in Oregon and Washington. Few differences were found in amphibians between wet, moderate, and dry old-growth sites and between young, mature, and old-growth stands. Three salamanders in Oregon were found associated with downed logs or bark on the ground or on logs. These salamanders differed in their preference for age/class of downed logs.
