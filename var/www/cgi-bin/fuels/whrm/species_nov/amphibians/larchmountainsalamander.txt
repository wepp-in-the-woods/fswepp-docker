steep talus slopes of the Columbia River Gorge
General Habitat
mixed PSME and hardwood forest, but also in open non-forested areas 
Home or Activity Range

Specific Habitat Preferences
moist, shady talus with cool temperatures and high humidity; found in bark piles at the base of snags, downed wood, moist talus; dense canopy cover but low ground cover
Nestsite Characteristics
lay eggs in moist habitats, probably well below the surface of talus

no information available
Shelter Habitats
bark piles at the base of snags, downed wood, moist talus
Response to Disturbance
any activity removing the shade-providing overstory from occupied sites could affect this salamander (reviewed in Bull and Wales 2001)
Sources of Information used in the Model
no information available
General Sources of Background Information
Leonard et al. 1993, reviewed in Bull and Wales 2001, reviewed in Sallabanks et al. 2003, Stebbins 2003
Summaries of Specific Studies
Bull, Evelyn; Wales, Barbara C. 2001. Effects of disturbance on amphibians of conservation concern in eastern Oregon and Washington. Northwest Science. 75:174-179.

Study Location: eastern Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: primarily PIPO
Summary: The authors review the habitat needs of amphibian species of concern in eastern Oregon and Washington, focusing on how disturbances (natural and anthropogenic) would alter habitat for these species. Species of concern include the Oregon spotted frog, Columbia spotted frog, northern leopard frog, Cascades frog, Tailed frog, Larch Mountain salamander, and Cope's giant salamander.
