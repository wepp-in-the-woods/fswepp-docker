Summaries of Specific Studies
Storz, Jay F. 1995. Local distribution and foraging behavior of the spotted bat (Euderma maculatum) in northwestern Colorado and adjacent Utah. Great Basin Naturalist. 55: 78-83.

Study Location: Dinosaur National Monument, Utah
Habitat Description: canyonbottom vegetation: cottonwoods, various shrubs
Summary: Local distribution and foraging behavior were noted for the spotted bat. The spotted bat occurred in a variety of habitat types including canyon bottoms and other low elevation sites. Foraging bats concentrated their activity in the open-air space above meadows and occassionally exploited near-canopy habitat. Exclusive foraging areas were maintained and distinct vocalizations indicated agnositic behavior at territory boundaries.
