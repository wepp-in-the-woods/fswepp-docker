Distribution
southwestern British Columbia through western USA into central Mexico
General Habitat
always found near open water, found in a variety of habitat types, including both wooded and treeless areas
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
areas with structures for nesting, roosting, and hibernating: buildings, bridges, caves, mines. Roosts almost always near water for foraging
Nestsite Characteristics
maternity colonies almost exclusively in man-made structures
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages in open areas; almost always near open water
Diet
opportunistic on aquatic insects; beetles and soft-bodied insects such as flies, termites, moths, mayflies
Predators
Mexican spotted owl
Shelter Habitats
roosts in buildings, bridges, caves, mines; hibernate in cool structures like caves and mines

Study Location: southern Washington Cascades, Oregon Coast Range
Habitat Description: PSME-TSHE sere
Summary: Bats were examined in different-aged PSME stands. Bats were grouped by nesting strategy and by echolocation signal. Bat activity was higher in old-growth sites than in mature or young sites; these results suggest that bats are 3-10 times more abundant in the old-growth sites. The author attributes this pattern to roosting habitat, due to the availability of large-diameter snags in older forest. Foraging opportunities did not contribute to the observed pattern of bat abundance. Differences in sex-ratio, reproductive activity and age distribution were seen between the two regions. Reduction in old-growth forest would negatively impact bat populations, though the degree of impact may vary regionally.
