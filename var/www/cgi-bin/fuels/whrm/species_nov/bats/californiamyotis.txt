Study Location: southern British Columbia
Habitat Description: PSME, ABGR, PICO, PIPO, PIMO, TSHE, THPL, aspen
Summary: Female California bats were radiotagged and roost site preferences were documented. Bats used multiple roosts within the sampling period. Roost were under loose bark or in holes or cracks in the tree. Roost trees had significantly larger diameters and were futher away from trees of the same or greater height. Roost trees were also in areas with lower canopy closure. Bats chose PIPO more than expected, and PSME less than expected based on availability. Trees were most often of advanced decay classes. Substantial numbers of large snags, particularly PIPO, should be retained to support such bat populations.

Study Location: southwestern California
Habitat Description: variety, includes desert areas as well as deciduous and coniferous forest
Summary: General natural history of the California myotis in a variety of habitat types in southwestern California. This myotis appears is primarily a crevice-dweller and roosts in any crevice available after evening foraging. Anecdotal descriptions of roosting, reproduction.

Study Location: southern Washington Cascades, Oregon Coast Range
Habitat Description: PSME-TSHE sere
Summary: Bats were examined in different-aged PSME stands. Bats were grouped by nesting strategy and by echolocation signal. Bat activity was higher in old-growth sites than in mature or young sites; these results suggest that bats are 3-10 times more abundant in the old-growth sites. The author attributes this pattern to roosting habitat, due to the availability of large-diameter snags in older forest. Foraging opportunities did not contribute to the observed pattern of bat abundance. Differences in sex-ratio, reproductive activity and age distribution were seen between the two regions. Reduction in old-growth forest would negatively impact bat populations, though the degree of impact may vary regionally.
