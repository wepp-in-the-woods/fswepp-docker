Study Location: Washington and Oregon
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Review of the basic biology of bats inhabitating PSME forests of the Pacific Northwest, including a discussion of natural history, habitat requirements, and their ecological relations with old-growth forests.

Study Location: Cibola National Forest, New Mexico
Habitat Description: pinyon-juniper habitat, with interspersed PIPO
Summary: Bat species composition and structures used for maternity colonies were investigated in a primarily pinyon-juniper woodland. Over 11 species were detected. Roost sites for three species (long-eared, long-legged and fringed myotis) were found. Long-legged and fringed myotis used PIPO snags and live trees with vertical cracks for maternity roost sites. Long-eared myotis used live and dead junipers exclusively for solitary and colony roost sites.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: primarily PIPO; also PSME, aspen, PIFL, ABCO
Summary: Eight species of bats roosted primarily in large-diameter PIPO snags with exfoliating bark. Forest surrounding roosts had higher tree densities, greater tree species diversity, and trees with larger basal area than random snag areas. Almost hlaf of the bats used more than one roost site. Snags in one study area were more likely to be located near water; snags in the other study area were less likely to be located within a harvested area. Snag retention and creation is especially important for bat species because of the short time period during which snags actually have exfoliating bark for bats to roost under.

Study Location: southern Washington Cascades, Oregon Coast Range
Habitat Description: PSME-TSHE sere
Summary: Bats were examined in different-aged PSME stands. Bats were grouped by nesting strategy and by echolocation signal. Bat activity was higher in old-growth sites than in mature or young sites; these results suggest that bats are 3-10 times more abundant in the old-growth sites. The author attributes this pattern to roosting habitat, due to the availability of large-diameter snags in older forest. Foraging opportunities did not contribute to the observed pattern of bat abundance. Differences in sex-ratio, reproductive activity and age distribution were seen between the two regions. Reduction in old-growth forest would negatively impact bat populations, though the degree of impact may vary regionally.
