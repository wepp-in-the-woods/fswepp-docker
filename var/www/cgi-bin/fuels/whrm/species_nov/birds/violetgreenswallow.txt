Response to Disturbance
sensitive to snag removal (Balda 1975); decreased post-snag removal (Scott 1979); lower mean detection rate and % occurrence in clearcuts without snags (Marcot 1983); decreased one year post-prescribed fire (Horton and Mannan 1988); more abundant on sites with overstory removal (Franzreb and Omhart 1978); absent in logged stand where snags were removed (Balda 1975); favored 2-4 years post-fire as snags fall, wood insects decline (Johnson and Wauer 1996); less abundant in partially cut forest compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); highest density in control and silviculturally cut plots, minimally present on irregular strip plots and absent from severely thinned and clearcut plots (Szaro and Balda 1979)

Study Location: Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: The habitat needs and roles of secondary cavity nesters are examined in PIPO forests by compiling information from a variety of studies in Arizona. The density of secondary cavity nesters was determined and their importance in local ecology is addressed. Food guilds are outlined. Territory size and snag foraging behavior are outlined for a few species. The impact of snag removal is also discussed; snag removal resulted in a significant loss of breeding bird diversity as well as a decrease in the in the density of secondary cavity nesters. Species are ranked by their sensitivity to snag removal. Finally, the author outlines minimum snag densities that are appropriate for supporting secondary cavity nesters. The author concludes that 268 snags should be maintained for every 100 acres of forest.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Snags used by secondary cavity nesters (SCN) in PP forests were evaluated for their characteristics. The majority of used snags were > 60cm dbh, >20 m tall, were mostly covered in bark, had bark near the cavity entrance, and had broken tops. The largest and tallest snags available were chosen. SCNs preferred snags that were dead 5- 20 years ago, with the exception of the pygmy nuthatch that preferred older snags. Snag density accounted for more than half the variability in density of SCNs. Removal of snags in coniferous forests would have a serious negative effect on the density of SCNs.

Study Location: Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PSME and PIPO dominated
Summary: Birds were significantly more abundant in unlogged plots than modified plots, while composition overlapped. Species richness was more influenced by year than treatment. Birds gleaning on foliage or timber were most adversely affected by logging. Ground or slash foragers were much more abundant in harvested plots. Aerial foragers and most flycatchers were more abundant on logged plots. Cup nesting species were more abundant on unlogged plots.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: Coronado National Forest, southeast Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO dominated, also PIST, PSME, QUHY, QUAR
Summary: This study compared the number and characteristics of snags used by cavity-nesting birds before and after broadcast understory fires in PP stands. Avian species were monitored to investigate their response to prescribed fire. Before the fire, many avian species used large snags (> 50 cm dbh) for cavity nesting, with smaller snags used primarily for foraging. Nearly half of all snags were burned or drastically changed by the prescribed fire. A snag's likelihood to be consumed depended on both dbh and decay class. Few large live trees were killed immediately, leading to a 45% net decrease in snags 1 year post-treatment. Small snags (< 15 cm dbh) increased 20-fold after the treatment. Logs decreased post-treatment. No avian species were lost post-treatment, though northern flickers and violet-green swallows decreased in experimental stands, while mountain chickadees increased. The authors attribute these patterns to changes in prey populations or shifts in areas used in foraging, and not to any limitation in nest sites.

Study Location: Bandelier National Monument, NM
Habitat Description: PIPO, montane meadow, mixed conifer, pinyon-juniper
Summary: Breeding birds were surveyed before and for many years after a wildlfire in Bandelier National Monument. Species diversity increased after the fire, but breeding populations in general declined for several years before increasing above prefire levels. This pattern was more pronounced on severely burned forest. In all but the severely burned forest, breeding bird diversity and populations were higher than prefire levels 14 years after the wildfire. Patterns are presented for different foraging and nesting guilds, as well as some individual species (including particular habitat changes that impacted bird species).

Study Location: northwestern California
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Bird abundance was compared in clearcut PSME forests where snags had been retained or removed. Nine species of primary and secondary cavity-nesting birds had a lower mean detection rate and percent occurrence in clearcuts where snags had been removed. One species, the chesnut-backed chickadee, increased in mean detection rate and percent occurrence in clearcuts without snags. The authors hypothesize that most cavity nesters shifted nesting to neighboring stands and used clearcut areas for foraging.

Study Location: Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: PIPO snags were removed from one stand during a timber harvest. Populations of violet-green swallows and pygmy nuthatches decreased on the plot with snags removed, and either increased or remained stable on control plots or plots where timber was harvested but snags were not removed. Several other bird species showed population changes or shifts, though the patterns were either not significant or were uninterpretable.

Study Location: Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: The requirements of cavity nesting birds were examined, with an emphasis on the impact of logging and snag removal on cavity nesting birds. For nest sites, birds usually selected PIPO snags >18" dbh that had been dead for at least six years and had >40% bark cover. A few species responded to logging and snag removal. The most heavily impacted birds were those that nested in PIPO. The density of cavity nesting birds decreased by 53% on those stands that had been treated. The authors recommend a snag density of 2.6 snags/acre, with snags >19" dbh.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Bird species diversity and species richness were not significantly affected by forest cutting and logging except in a clearcut treatment. Bird population densitities significantly increased on silvilculturally cut and irregular strip shelterwood plots and significantly decreased  on the severely thinned and clearcut plots. Impact on individual species is discussed.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.
