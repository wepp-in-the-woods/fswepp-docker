Distribution
breeds in Pacific coastal states north into Canada and west into northern Idaho and northwestern Montana
General Habitat
open coniferous, coniferous-deciduous, pine-oak or oak woodlands
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
no information available
Nestsite Characteristics
nests in fork of twig of tree or bush or set in the middle of a conifer
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages slowly and deliberately staying fairly high in shrubs and trees; sometime hovers to pick food off vegetation or catch insects in flight
Diet
insects, larvae, and various fruits
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
less abundant in low shrub-stage clearcuts and more abundant on high shrub-stage clearcuts and partially cut forest compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995)
Sources of Information used in the Model
Verner 1980 (listed as solitary vireo)
General Sources of Background Information
Verner 1980, Hejl et al. 1995, Alsop 2001, reviewed in O'Neil et al. 2001

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Listed as solitary vireo in paper; paper covers range of both Cassin's and plumbeous vireos. Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Listed as solitary vireo in paper; paper covers range of only Cassin's vireo. Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.
