Distribution
from British Columbia south through western USA to Guatemala; common but secretive
General Habitat
old growth PIPO/PSME; open or broken conifer woodlands, containing mixes of true firs, pines, PSME, oak
Home or Activity Range
9-60 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
developed understory, multiple canopy layers; within a territory, locally dense clump of mature trees near a break in canopy closure and vegetation type; respond positively to edge
Nestsite Characteristics
flicker and other woodpecker holes, natural cavities; dead pine, ash, oak, and aspen trees; open, mature vegetation (stands with trees > 50 cm dbh) around nest with low shrub density at cavity entrance
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
edges and broken woodlands; brush cover; mature forest with high density of insect species, dense vegetation; rests between foraging bouts on dominant conifers with large, dense crowns; glean insects from conifer crowns, hawks insects between crowns, ground-captures
Diet
largely insectivorous: beetles, moths, caterpillars, crickets, ants, spiders, scorpions
Predators
Mexican spotted owl, great-horned owl, Cooper's hawk and other accipiters, nest predation by northern flying squirrel
Shelter Habitats
dense clumps of mature trees or doghair stands of PIPO seedlings; perch at base of horizontal limb near trunk; males day-roost in dominant or sub-dominant PSME or PIPO with a horizontal or sprawling growth form 
Response to Disturbance
absent from logged plots (Franzreb and Omhart 1978); no owls found in clearcuts or stands < 80 years old (Howie and Ritcey 1987); found in mature stands that had undergone selective logging (Howie and Ritcey 1987); selective logging may create open stands that are used (reviewed in McCallum 1994); doghair stands resulting from fire suppression may provide suitable roosting habitat, but probably seriously reduce foraging potential (reviewed in McCallum 1994)

Study Location: northeastern Oregon
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME, ABGR, LAOC
Summary: Nest sites of flammulated owls were located in northeastern Oregon. Nest trees averaged 72 cm dbh and cavity height averaged 12 m and 91% were dead trees. The majority were PP. Important nest habitat characteristics included large-diameter snags, location on ridges and upper slopes with east or south aspects, or location in stands of large (>50 cm dbh) PP and DF. Most nesting cavities had been made by pileated woodpecker (67% of nests) or northern flickers (27%). Management for flammulated owl nesting sites could therefore be accomplished by managing for pileated woodpeckers or northern flickers.

Study Location: Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PSME and PIPO dominated
Summary: Birds were significantly more abundant in unlogged plots than modified plots, while composition overlapped. Species richness was more influenced by year than treatment. Birds gleaning on foliage or timber were most adversely affected by logging. Ground or slash foragers were much more abundant in harvested plots. Aerial foragers and most flycatchers were more abundant on logged plots. Cup nesting species were more abundant on unlogged plots.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: southern British Columbia
Habitat Description: PIPO, PIPO/PSME, PICO,  aspen
Summary: In southern British Columbia, flammulated owls were found within the interior Douglas-fir biogeoclimatic zone, often in a drier subzone. Owls were not found in the PIPO belt. Most sitings occurred in old-growth PSME that had been selectively cut 20-30 years previously. Stands were open with 35-65% canopy closure. Owls were found in areas with at least two canopy layers. Shrub layers were poorly developed, while herbs and grasses were well-developed. Regenerating thickets were used for roosting. No owls were found in clearcut areas or where the forest age was < 80 years old. The highest density of owls was found in stands 140-200+ years old. Though flammulated owls used a forest type different from that in most other studies (primarily PIPO), the authors believe that the vegetative structure of PSME forests in their study area mimics that of preferred habitat in other parts of the owl's range.

Study Location: central Colorado
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME
Summary: Thesis describing the home range, foraging activity, roosting behavior and reproduction of flammulated owls in a PIPO forest. Foraging areas, day roosts, and territorial song posts of males were mostly associated with mature, open stands of PIPO mixed with PSME. The majority of foraging took place within an intensive foraging area within an male owl's home range. Home ranges appeared to be bounded by the presence of appropriate mature, open forest.

Study Location: northwestern California
Habitat Description: mixed conifer- not stated
Summary: Flammulated owl distribution is outlined for two counties in northwestern California. Some broad characteristics of territories are given. The following management recommendations are given: identify and preserve locally dense stands of mature trees that form the core of each territory, maintain brush adjacent to core stand (for cover and feeding), leave undisturbed any tree with natural or woodpecker-made cavities, allow for snag recruitment.

Study Location: western New Mexico
Habitat Description: PIED, junipers, oaks, PIPO
Summary: Nest site characteristics are described for flammulated owls in western New Mexico. Vegetation preferences surrounding the nest site included low shrub density, high canopy height, and a high importance of PIED. Preferred vegetation characteristcs were more limited than preferred cavity/nest-tree characteristics.

Study Location: central Colorado
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME, PIPU, PIFL, aspen
Summary: Flammulated owl nesting biology was studied in central Colorado. Breeding, nesting, home range size, foraging locations and diet were observed. Nesting occurred in a variety of forest types. Characteristics of specific trees used for cavity-nesting are not discussed, other than the use of aspen. Foraging areas were usually old-growth PIPO and PSME stands. The use of mature/old-growth forest is attributed to the abundance of snags and large trees with suitable cavities and the presence of a well-developed shrub and grass understory to provide prey. Also, at least three foraging tactics (hawk-gleaning, hover-gleaning, and hawking) require large, open crowns and space between crowns.

Study Location: Blue Mountains, OR
Habitat Description: ABGR
Summary: This case history (1) evaluates bird-habitat relationships in primarily grand fir forests. The goals of this study were to assess how forest stand structure influences habitat selection by birds, to investigate bird use of specific forest structural classes, and to relate bird habitat use to potential management options that consider breeding bird habitat.

Study Location: throughout range of flammulated owl
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Includes review of the systematics, distribution and abundance, movements, habitat occupancy, food habits, breeding biology, demography, community ecology and response to forest change of flammulated owls. Synthesis from a variety of studies suggests that forest structure may be more important than floristics; preferred structure appears to be mature to old forest with an open, multi-layered canopy and clumps of thickets. Occurrence by habitat type is given for a number of western National Forests (Table 2 pp. 12-13). Minimal habitat requirements are summarized as the following: (1) cool to moderate air temperatures, with the effects of higher temperature ameliorable where humidity is low; (2) dense foliage or mistletoes for roosting; (3) open space between trees to promote abundance of phytophagous insects and facilitate aerial maneuvering by the owl while capturing insects; (4) cavities large and deep enough to allow nesting; and (5) perhaps other unspecified characteristics of old mid-elevation forst of yellow pine, Douglas fir, and aspen, such as specific prey taxa. Based on these minimal habitat requirements, the flammulated owl may be sensitive to habitat change and may therefore be in peril in the future given current land management practices.

Study Location: range of Mexican spotted owl; case studies in northern Arizona and New Mexico
Habitat Description: not stated; PIPO
Summary: Literature review and synthesis of data from past studies concerning the ecology of prey of the Mexican Spotted Owl, including information on owl diet, identification of prey that might influence owl fitness, and quanitification of habitat correlates of prey species. The authors found variation in diet regionally. Reproductive success of spotted owls was not linked to any single prey species, rather to many species in combination, or total prey biomass. However, certain species may be more important in specific regions. Overall, food resources were quite variable among vegetation communities and through time. Owl food is most abundant during the summer when young are being raised. Prey biomass decreases in late fall and early winter. Habitat correlates are presented from one study in northern Arizona (deer mouse, brush mouse, Mexican woodrat) and one in New Mexico.

Study Location: Colorado
Habitat Description: PIPO- aspen
Summary: Information on survey results for flammulated owls. Includes nesting behavior in live and dead aspen in holes excavated by northern flickers. The author attributes their presence in aspen stands to food abundance and the higher density of cavity-excavating woodpeckers in these stands compared to surrounding coniferous forests.
