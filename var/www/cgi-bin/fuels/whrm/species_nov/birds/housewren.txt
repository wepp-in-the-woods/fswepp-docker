sensitive to snag removal (Balda 1975), increased in stands with timber harvest (decrease in basal area); lower mean detection rate and % occurrence in clearcuts without snags (Marcot 1983); more abundant on sites with overstory removal (Franzreb and Omhart 1978); favored 1-2 years post-fire due to increasing ground debris (Johnson and Wauer 1996); less abundant in low shrub-stage clearcuts, more abundant in high shrub-stage clearcuts and partially cut forest compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); found in stands as mature "yellow" PIPO densities increased to 8 trees/acre (Keller 1992); more abundant in old-growth PSME stands than mature PSME or harvest (clearcut or shelterwood cut) units (Moore 1992)

Study Location: Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: The habitat needs and roles of secondary cavity nesters are examined in PIPO forests by compiling information from a variety of studies in Arizona. The density of secondary cavity nesters was determined and their importance in local ecology is addressed. Food guilds are outlined. Territory size and snag foraging behavior are outlined for a few species. The impact of snag removal is also discussed; snag removal resulted in a significant loss of breeding bird diversity as well as a decrease in the in the density of secondary cavity nesters. Species are ranked by their sensitivity to snag removal. Finally, the author outlines minimum snag densities that are appropriate for supporting secondary cavity nesters. The author concludes that 268 snags should be maintained for every 100 acres of forest.

Study Location: Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PSME and PIPO dominated
Summary: Birds were significantly more abundant in unlogged plots than modified plots, while composition overlapped. Species richness was more influenced by year than treatment. Birds gleaning on foliage or timber were most adversely affected by logging. Ground or slash foragers were much more abundant in harvested plots. Aerial foragers and most flycatchers were more abundant on logged plots. Cup nesting species were more abundant on unlogged plots.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: Bandelier National Monument, NM
Habitat Description: PIPO, montane meadow, mixed conifer, pinyon-juniper
Summary: Breeding birds were surveyed before and for many years after a wildlfire in Bandelier National Monument. Species diversity increased after the fire, but breeding populations in general declined for several years before increasing above prefire levels. This pattern was more pronounced on severely burned forest. In all but the severely burned forest, breeding bird diversity and populations were higher than prefire levels 14 years after the wildfire. Patterns are presented for different foraging and nesting guilds, as well as some individual species (including particular habitat changes that impacted bird species).

Study Location: Coconino and Kaibab National Forest, northern Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: The overstory of mature PIPO forest and the presence of snags influenced bird communities in pole-sized PIPO stands in northern Arizona. Study areas containing pure pole-sized trees and no snags had the lowest numbers of insectivorous birds; study areas with the most insectivorous bird diversity contained at least 14 mature PIPO trees/acre and at least 2 snags/acre. The greatest number of birds were detected in stands containing 8-10 mature PIPO trees/acre and no snags. PIPO overstory also influenced both coniferous forest-nesting birds and primary cavity-nesting birds. The presence of snags influenced secondary cavity-nesters. Overall, this study suggests that a homogenous forest of young PIPO stands lacking in snags is not desirable for maintaining healthy bird species diversity.

Study Location: central Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO, ABCO, PSME, PIST, aspen, Gambel oak
Summary: Habitat features for successful and unsuccessful nest sites, nest sites vs. random sites, and differences among coexisting species of cavity nesting birds were identified. Species-specific characteristics are presented both for nest site and nest tree; birds differed in some of their habitat preferences. Aspen (mostly dead) were a preferred nesting species and were common in foraging patches, despite their low density in the study area. High density of aspen provides both more nesting sites and protects nests from predation, as predators have to search more sites to find nests. Foraging areas also had more conifers and fewer deciduous trees (other than aspen) than random areas. Preference for conifers is attributed to increased foraging opportunities.Failed nests were surrounded by denser foliage and were closer to conifers. Reduced nest success was also linked to lower nest height. Nonexcavating species had lower nesting success than excavator species.

Study Location: northwestern California
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Bird abundance was compared in clearcut PSME forests where snags had been retained or removed. Nine species of primary and secondary cavity-nesting birds had a lower mean detection rate and percent occurrence in clearcuts where snags had been removed. One species, the chesnut-backed chickadee, increased in mean detection rate and percent occurrence in clearcuts without snags. The authors hypothesize that most cavity nesters shifted nesting to neighboring stands and used clearcut areas for foraging.

Study Location: southwestern Montana
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Avian species composition and abundance were examined in old-growth, mature, and harvested PSME forest. The greatest total abundance was detected in the old-growth forest. In general, the old-growth contained the greatest number of species, though there was no detected difference in species richness between the stand types. Higher elevation old-growth stands contained a greater abundance of birds than the lower eleveation old-growth stands. Trees with cavities were also examined in this study. The majority of cavity trees were old PSME with broken tops, and cavities tended to be located in the top one-third of the tree. Some primary and secondary cavity-nesting birds demonstrated dbh preferences for nest trees.

Habitat Description: ABGR
Summary: This case history (1) evaluates bird-habitat relationships in primarily grand fir forests. The goals of this study were to assess how forest stand structure influences habitat selection by birds, to investigate bird use of specific forest structural classes, and to relate bird habitat use to potential management options that consider breeding bird habitat.
