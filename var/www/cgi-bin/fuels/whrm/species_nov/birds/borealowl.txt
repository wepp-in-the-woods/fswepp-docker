# Literature
Distribution
throughout holarctic and boreal climatic zones
General Habitat
high elevation mature spruce-fir forest types; lodgepole pine forest type
Home or Activity Range
2500-250000 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
complex physical structure; well-developed low and high canopy but lacking mid canopy layer; few tall shrubs; near forest opening and water
Nestsite Characteristics
mature forest stands with complex physical structure, open understory, large trees; use large-diameter cavities in snags or live trees- species PIPO, aspen, PSME; use high cavities with little obstruction around cavity entrance and open forest surrounding nest tree
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
older spruce-fir stands with abundant prey base; may use natural or man-made created openings for hunting in edge habitat; as roost sites represent the end of a foraging bout, characteristics of roost site location may be representative of foraging habitat
Diet
"sit-and-wait predators," small mammals 80% of diet; eat southern redbacked vole most common, northern flying squirrels (caught by females in winter), northern pocket gophers, yellow-pine chipmunks, western jumping mice, microtine voles, busy-tailed woodrat, pika, heather vole, deer mouse, northern bog lemming, woodland jumping mouse, shrews, birds, insects
Predators
American marten (at nests), Cooper's hawk, northern goshawk, great-horned owl, squirrels (eat eggs and young), ectoparasites (on young in nest)
Shelter Habitats
summer roosts: closed canopy forest with high tree density and basal area, need cool microsites in summer to avoid heat stress; winter and summer roosts differ in microhabitat characteristics; roost in dominant tree species in stand; use multiple roosts; roost far from mate and nest; roost close to tree bole; roosts have more cover above than below
Response to Disturbance
as boreal owls inhabit a narrow life zone with breeding populations isolated in patches of high elevation forest, forest fragmentation and removal of mature forest habitats on a regional scale may harm populations (Hayward et al. 1993), indirectly impacted by disturbances that negatively affect prey species and primary cavity-nesters (reviewed in Verner et al. 1994)

Study Location: Frank Church Wilderness, central Idaho
Habitat Description: PSME, PICO, PIPO
Summary: Winter and spring roosts of boreal and saw-whet owls, and late winter, spring and summer roosts of screech owls were examined. All owls roosted in conifers or shrubs except for one individual boreal owl that roosted in a cavity. Only screech owls repeatedly used the same roost. Roost sites of all species were similar in that tree density immediately around roosts was greater than in adjacent forest. Roosts of the species differed in the amount of cover which the roost tree provided and the position of the perches on the branches.

Study Location: Frank Church Wilderness, central Idaho
Habitat Description:  PSME, PICO, PIPO, ABLA habitat type series
Summary:Resource partitioning at the macro- and microhabitat scale was studied for five abundant species of forest owls. Owls differed in habitat preferences as well as activity periods and food habits. Screech owls had the most restricted niche, while pygmy and great-horned owls were more generalist in habitat ust. Patterns of resource use was interpreted as resulting from environmental factors, morphological limitations, behavioral adaptations, and interspecific competition.

Study Location: northern Rocky Mountains; western Montana, Idaho, northwestern Wyoming, northern Utah
Habitat Description: spruce-fir zone; including ABLA, PSME, aspen, PICO, also extended into PIPO zone
Summary: Four year study on the ecology of the boreal owl in the northern Rocky Mountains. All owls were detected above 1292 m elevation, and the majority of detections were in ABLA habitat types. PICO was the only dominant forest type that was avoided, despite being common in the study area. It was used when no other forest type was available, and was characterized as having large trees. Nest sites were restricted to mature/old stands with complex physical structure; many habitat types were used, including mixed conifer forest (PIPO and PSME) 39% of the time as well as aspen 21% of the time despite covering <1% of the available forest. PICO was avoided for nesting. Boreal owls were selective in summer roosts sites, choosing sites with greater canopy cover, higher tree density, and higher basal area. The best foraging habitat was associated with mature/old spruce-fir stands where prey was most abundant. Diet, population and breeding were also examined. Habitat associations by vegetation type are given for primary prey species. Management strategies that focus on snag retention and harvest practices that retain forest structure are recommended for maintaining quality habitat.

Study Location: southwestern Montana
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME, ABLA, PICO, aspen
Summary: Winter song-playback surveys were conducted in forested habitats. 8 different owls were detected in PIEN, ABLA, PSME, or PICO forest types between 6,000-7,800 ft. Owl calling sites were between 12-120 ft from forest openings and within 300 ft of water. Stand structure at primarily calling sites included canopy closure estimates between 40-80%, 2-10 snags/acre, tree age of 80-200 years, and dbh values between 11-24 inches.

Study Location: north-central Colorado
Habitat Description: mixed conifer, including: PIEN, PICO, PSME, PIPO, aspen, JUSC
Summary: This study examined habitat selection, movement patterns (including home range), diet, and breeding season singing activity of boreal and saw-whet owls. Chapters are divided into potential competitive interactions, movement and roost site selection by boreal owls, and annual and seasonal variation in singing activity for both species. Boreal owls selected high-elevation mature spruce-fir forests while saw-whet owls were found at lower elevation deciduous or mixed forests. Both species avoided large, unbroken stands of PICO. Otherwise, macrohabitat selection for both species did not differ from what was available. At the microhabitat level, saw-whet owl territories had more small trees and a higher deciduous element than boreal owl territories. Boreal owls roosted in dense tree stands on steep slopes. Conifer trees were preferred, and roosts were seldom used more than once.

Study location: Blue Mountains, OR
Habitat Description: ABGR
Summary: This case history (1) evaluates bird-habitat relationships in primarily grand fir forests. The goals of this study were to assess how forest stand structure influences habitat selection by birds, to investigate bird use of specific forest structural classes, and to relate bird habitat use to potential management options that consider breeding bird habitat.

Study location: throughout range of flammulated owl
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Includes review of the systematics, distribution and abundance, movements, habitat occupancy, food habits, breeding biology, demography, community ecology and response to forest change of flammulated owls. Synthesis from a variety of studies suggests that forest structure may be more important than floristics; preferred structure appears to be mature to old forest with an open, multi-layered canopy and clumps of thickets. Occurrence by habitat type is given for a number of western National Forests (Table 2 pp. 12-13). Minimal habitat requirements are summarized as the following: (1) cool to moderate air temperatures, with the effects of higher temperature ameliorable where humidity is low; (2) dense foliage or mistletoes for roosting; (3) open space between trees to promote abundance of phytophagous insects and facilitate aerial maneuvering by the owl while capturing insects; (4) cavities large and deep enough to allow nesting; and (5) perhaps other unspecified characteristics of old mid-elevation forst of yellow pine, Douglas fir, and aspen, such as specific prey taxa. Based on these minimal habitat requirements, the flammulated owl may be sensitive to habitat change and may therefore be in peril in the future given current land management practices.
