Summaries of Specific Studies
Griffis-Kyle, Kerry L.; Beier, Paul. 2003. Small isolated aspen stands enrich bird communities in southwestern ponderosa pine forests. Biological Conservation. 110(2003): 375-385.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: Aspen in a PIPO matrix
Summary: This study examined the role that aspen stands in a larger forest matrix play in supporting a variety of avian species. Relative bird abundance and species richness were higher in aspen plots than in paired ponderosa pine plots. However, aspen stands did not harbor unique avian communities, suggesting that they act as important landscape elements within the ponderosa pine forest matrix. Within-patch habitat factors explained 24-46% of the variation in species richness amongst aspen stands; the only habitat factor consistently associated with species richness was sapling density (neg.). Area and isolation of aspen stands had no influence on species diversity. Management activites such as overstory thinning, burning, and fencing against unlulates are suggested to create and conserve aspen stands.
