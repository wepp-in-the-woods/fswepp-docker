Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Blue Mountains, OR
Habitat Description: ABGR
Summary: This case history (1) evaluates bird-habitat relationships in primarily grand fir forests. The goals of this study were to assess how forest stand structure influences habitat selection by birds, to investigate bird use of specific forest structural classes, and to relate bird habitat use to potential management options that consider breeding bird habitat.
