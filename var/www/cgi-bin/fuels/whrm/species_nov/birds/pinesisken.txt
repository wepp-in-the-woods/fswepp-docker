Response to Disturbance
appeared by the hundreds immediately post-fire to eat fire-released seeds (Taylor and Barmore 1980); more abundant in early post-fire conditions (more abundant first year than second year post-fire) (Hutto 1995); greater abundance in cut-over forest when food is available: thistles, fireweed (Hagar 1960), disfavored 1-2 years post-fire due to forest and foliage loss (Johnson and Wauer 1996); more common in clearcut and partially cut stands than unlogged stands (Tobalske et al. 1991); most common in dry meadow with PICO overstory as compared to mature and stagnating PICO forest, clearcuts, or wet meadows (Austin and Perry 1979); attracted to areas clearcut 17 and 37 years previously (Austin and Perry 1979); less abundant in low shrub-stage clearcuts and partially cuts forest, equally common in high shrub- and pole-stage clearcuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); more abundant in fragmented stands (Keller and Anderson 1992); most abundant in strip-cut configurations compared to spot-cuts, meadow edges, mid-forest or forest interior configurations (Keller and Anderson 1992); not found in stands lacking mature "yellow" PIPO and snags

Study Location: Uinta Mountains, Utah
Habitat Description: PICO as main overstory tree; also includes PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Birds were censused in wet and dry meadows, mature and stagnated PICO stands, and regenerating PICO stands (17 and 37 years post-clearcut). The richest avifauna was found in the dry meadows. While a few birds were adversly affected by the clearcutting, many individual species were more numerous in the clearcuts, and the overall number of species was similar.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: Aspen in a PIPO matrix
Summary: This study examined the role that aspen stands in a larger forest matrix play in supporting a variety of avian species. Relative bird abundance and species richness were higher in aspen plots than in paired ponderosa pine plots. However, aspen stands did not harbor unique avian communities, suggesting that they act as important landscape elements within the ponderosa pine forest matrix. Within-patch habitat factors explained 24-46% of the variation in species richness amongst aspen stands; the only habitat factor consistently associated with species richness was sapling density (neg.). Area and isolation of aspen stands had no influence on species diversity. Management activites such as overstory thinning, burning, and fencing against unlulates are suggested to create and conserve aspen stands.

Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: western Montana and northern Wyoming
Habitat Description: range of habitat types: includes PIPO, PSME, LAOC, PICO, PIAL, PIFL, Picea sp,, ABLA, ABGR, THPL, aspen, cottonwood
Summary: Fifteen bird species are generally more abundant in early post-fire communities than in any other cover type in the northern Rockies (includes olive-sided flycatcher, three-toed woodpecker, black-backed woodpecker, Clark's nutcracker, mountain bluebird, red crossbill, Cassin's finch, pine siskin, American robin, dark-eyed junco, yellow-rumped warbler). Six species (common nighthawk, calliope hummingbird, northern flicker, Stellar's jay, orange-crowned warbler, chipping sparrow) were most abundant in stands 10-40 years post-fire. Three species (American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, dark-eyed junco) were detected in early an mid-successional burned forest 100% of the time. One species, the black-backed woodpecker, was restricted to standing dead forest created by stand-replacing fires. Bird communities are different in recently burned forest, primarily because members of three feeding guilds (woodpeckers, flycatchers, and seedeaters) are especially abundant. Larger-diameter (>10 cm dbh) PP, DF, and LAOC were most often used for feeding by woodpeckers. Standing, fire-killed trees were used by the majority of birds nesting in recently burned forest. Many of the structures used in nesting (broken-topped snags) were present before the fire. Large-scale, stand-replacing fire may be necessary for long-term maintenance of many bird populations. Commentary is offered on the need to alter present fire and post-fire forest management.

Study Location: Coconino and Kaibab National Forest, northern Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: The overstory of mature PIPO forest and the presence of snags influenced bird communities in pole-sized PIPO stands in northern Arizona. Study areas containing pure pole-sized trees and no snags had the lowest numbers of insectivorous birds; study areas with the most insectivorous bird diversity contained at least 14 mature PIPO trees/acre and at least 2 snags/acre. The greatest number of birds were detected in stands containing 8-10 mature PIPO trees/acre and no snags. PIPO overstory also influenced both coniferous forest-nesting birds and primary cavity-nesting birds. The presence of snags influenced secondary cavity-nesters. Overall, this study suggests that a homogenous forest of young PIPO stands lacking in snags is not desirable for maintaining healthy bird species diversity.

Study Location: southeastern Wyoming
Habitat Description: PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Forest cutting has resulted in an increase in forest edges and reduction in forest continuity. Avian communities in uncut forests and those fragmented by small clearcuts were compared. Overall, stands interrupted by small clearcuts had a similar species composition to paired uncut stands. Brown creepers and hermit thrushes were most negatively impacted by fragmentation, while pine siskins were the most positively influenced by fragmentation. This study also examined how bird species were distributed in relation to forest interiors and edges. Distribution of birds among forest edges and interiors were not consistent with preferences for forest edges and interiors.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: PSME, LAOC, PICO, PIEN, PIPO, ABLA, ABGR, THPL, PIMO, aspen, birch
Summary: A comparison of bird communities was performed between control sites and those undergoing traditional overstory removal harvests and those harvested using "New Forestry" techniques. Only four species showed significant differences in abundance between treatments, though the author suspects that other trends in the data would be clearer with additional post-treatment data. In general, for species that did differ in abundance, numbers in New Forestry stands were intermediate between overstory removal and controls. Foliage foragers declined similarly in both harvest types, while ground foragers increased. Conifer nesters decreased similarly in both harvest types, while ground nesters increased. Important habitat variables for a number of species are given.

Habitat Description: ABGR
Summary: This case history (1) evaluates bird-habitat relationships in primarily grand fir forests. The goals of this study were to assess how forest stand structure influences habitat selection by birds, to investigate bird use of specific forest structural classes, and to relate bird habitat use to potential management options that consider breeding bird habitat.

Study Location: Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks, Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO, ABLA/PIEN
Summary: Bird density, composition, and diversity were monitored across a series of fire severities in burned PICO or spruce-fir forest in Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks. Highest populations and greatest biomass occurred from 5-29 years post-fire. Density, composition, and diversity on moderately burned spruce-fir-PICO were more like those on unburned spruce-fir than other seral stages. Changes in bird communities by feeding category were also examined. Overall, canopy closure was a habitat variable that appeared to affect avifauna more than the presence of fire.

Study Location: northwestern Montana
Habitat Description: LAOC cover type; includes ABLA, LAOC, PSME, PIEN, PICO, BEPA, aspen, cottonwood
Summary: Populations of 10 breeding bird species were monitored in harvested and immediately adjacent uncut areas. A number of species were more abundant in harvested areas. Responses by feeding and nesting guilds are also included. Foliage-foraging species and tree gleaners wre less abundant in harvested areas, while flycatching and ground foragers were more common there. Conifer tree-nesting species were least abundant in clearcuts, while ground nesters were more common within the cutover habitats.Management recommendations are made, including the retention of broadleaf trees within cutting units and investigating the importance of slash piles in logged habitat. Slash piles were used by winter wrens, Townsend's solitaires, and dark-eyed juncos as perches, food sources, or nest sites.

Study Location: range of Mexican spotted owl; case studies in northern Arizona and New Mexico
Habitat Description: not stated; PIPO
Summary: Literature review and synthesis of data from past studies concerning the ecology of prey of the Mexican Spotted Owl, including information on owl diet, identification of prey that might influence owl fitness, and quanitification of habitat correlates of prey species. The authors found variation in diet regionally. Reproductive success of spotted owls was not linked to any single prey species, rather to many species in combination, or total prey biomass. However, certain species may be more important in specific regions. Overall, food resources were quite variable among vegetation communities and through time. Owl food is most abundant during the summer when young are being raised. Prey biomass decreases in late fall and early winter. Habitat correlates are presented from one study in northern Arizona (deer mouse, brush mouse, Mexican woodrat) and one in New Mexico.
