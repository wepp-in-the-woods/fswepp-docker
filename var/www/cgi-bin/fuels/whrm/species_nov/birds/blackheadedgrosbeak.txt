Mexican spotted owl
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
increased 2-4 years post-fire then declined (Johnson and Wauer 1996); less abundant on treated (logged) plots (Szaro and Balda 1986); less abundant in low shrub-stage clearcuts and more abundant in high shrub-stage clearcuts and partially cut forest compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); found in stands as mature "yellow" PIPO densities increased to 8 trees/acre (Keller 1992); highest density in control and silviculturally cut plots, minimally present on irregular strip plots and absent from severely thinned and clearcut plots (Szaro and Balda 1979)

Study Location: central Sierra Nevada, California
Habitat Description: PIPO, PILA, ABCO, PSME, CADE, QUKE
Summary: Foraging habitat preferences, niche relationships, patterns of relative abundance vs. niche breadth and differences between migrant and resident species were examined for 12 species of insect gleaning birds in the Sierras. Tree species, and to a lesser extent, tree height were used selectively by the guild. Incense-cedar was avoided by all species, while other tree species were preferred by individual or groups of gleaners. In differentiating between niche of each species, foraging site was the most important foraging characteristic, followed by tree species, foraging technique, and foraging height. No correlation was found between niche breadth and species abundance, though a positive correlation existed for all 5 resident species.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: Bandelier National Monument, NM
Habitat Description: PIPO, montane meadow, mixed conifer, pinyon-juniper
Summary: Breeding birds were surveyed before and for many years after a wildlfire in Bandelier National Monument. Species diversity increased after the fire, but breeding populations in general declined for several years before increasing above prefire levels. This pattern was more pronounced on severely burned forest. In all but the severely burned forest, breeding bird diversity and populations were higher than prefire levels 14 years after the wildfire. Patterns are presented for different foraging and nesting guilds, as well as some individual species (including particular habitat changes that impacted bird species).

Study Location: Coconino and Kaibab National Forest, northern Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: The overstory of mature PIPO forest and the presence of snags influenced bird communities in pole-sized PIPO stands in northern Arizona. Study areas containing pure pole-sized trees and no snags had the lowest numbers of insectivorous birds; study areas with the most insectivorous bird diversity contained at least 14 mature PIPO trees/acre and at least 2 snags/acre. The greatest number of birds were detected in stands containing 8-10 mature PIPO trees/acre and no snags. PIPO overstory also influenced both coniferous forest-nesting birds and primary cavity-nesting birds. The presence of snags influenced secondary cavity-nesters. Overall, this study suggests that a homogenous forest of young PIPO stands lacking in snags is not desirable for maintaining healthy bird species diversity.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Bird species diversity and species richness were not significantly affected by forest cutting and logging except in a clearcut treatment. Bird population densitities significantly increased on silvilculturally cut and irregular strip shelterwood plots and significantly decreased  on the severely thinned and clearcut plots. Impact on individual species is discussed.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Seasonal avian communities were examined for their response to weather condition and treatment (logging) effects. While birds responded to climate, most notably precipitation, treatment effects appeared to be more influential. Species preferring open habitat (rock wren, American robin, western wood pe-wee and western bluebird) were highest on medium and heavy cut stands. Treated stands also had the highest abundance of chipping sparrows, broad-tailed hummingbirds, Grace's warbler, and dark-eyed juncos. Species preferring dense foliage (western flycatcher, pygmy nuthatch, red-faced warbler, hermit thrush, black-headed grosbeak) were less abundant in modified habitats.
