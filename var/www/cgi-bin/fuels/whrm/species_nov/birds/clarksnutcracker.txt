Distribution
year-round resident in western USA, north into British Columbia and Alberta
General Habitat
locally common in high coniferous forests at timberline
Home or Activity Range
2.5-500 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
conifer trees
Nestsite Characteristics
nests on far end of horizontal branch of conifer; nest consists of platform made of small sticks and pieces of bark
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages on ground and in tree canopy; stores conifer seeds for use in winter and spring; storage places include ground, rocks, tree bark, or in logs and stumps; use recently burned forest

conifer seeds from pinyon pine, white bark pine, ponderosa pine, and Douglas-fir; variety of insects, small mammals, birds, and carrion opportunistically; young are fed seeds from stored caches
Predators

Shelter Habitats

Response to Disturbance
abundant immediately post-fire (Taylor and Barmore 1980); more abundant in early post-fire conditions (more abundant first year than second year post-fire) (Hutto 1995);  less abundant in low shrub-stage clearcuts and more abundant on partial cuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); found only in stands burned by stand-replacement wildfire, not in unburned controls 1 and 2 winters after fire (Kreisel and Stein 1999); more abundant in old-growth PSME stands than mature PSME or harvest (clearcut or shelterwood cut) units (Moore 1992)

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: western Montana and northern Wyoming
Habitat Description: range of habitat types: includes PIPO, PSME, LAOC, PICO, PIAL, PIFL, Picea sp,, ABLA, ABGR, THPL, aspen, cottonwood
Summary: Fifteen bird species are generally more abundant in early post-fire communities than in any other cover type in the northern Rockies (includes olive-sided flycatcher, three-toed woodpecker, black-backed woodpecker, Clark's nutcracker, mountain bluebird, red crossbill, Cassin's finch, pine siskin, American robin, dark-eyed junco, yellow-rumped warbler). Six species (common nighthawk, calliope hummingbird, northern flicker, Stellar's jay, orange-crowned warbler, chipping sparrow) were most abundant in stands 10-40 years post-fire. Three species (American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, dark-eyed junco) were detected in early an mid-successional burned forest 100% of the time. One species, the black-backed woodpecker, was restricted to standing dead forest created by stand-replacing fires. Bird communities are different in recently burned forest, primarily because members of three feeding guilds (woodpeckers, flycatchers, and seedeaters) are especially abundant. Larger-diameter (>10 cm dbh) PP, DF, and LAOC were most often used for feeding by woodpeckers. Standing, fire-killed trees were used by the majority of birds nesting in recently burned forest. Many of the structures used in nesting (broken-topped snags) were present before the fire. Large-scale, stand-replacing fire may be necessary for long-term maintenance of many bird populations. Commentary is offered on the need to alter present fire and post-fire forest management.

Study Location: southwestern Montana
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Avian species composition and abundance were examined in old-growth, mature, and harvested PSME forest. The greatest total abundance was detected in the old-growth forest. In general, the old-growth contained the greatest number of species, though there was no detected difference in species richness between the stand types. Higher elevation old-growth stands contained a greater abundance of birds than the lower eleveation old-growth stands. Trees with cavities were also examined in this study. The majority of cavity trees were old PSME with broken tops, and cavities tended to be located in the top one-third of the tree. Some primary and secondary cavity-nesting birds demonstrated dbh preferences for nest trees.

Study Location: northeast Washington
Habitat Description: mixed conifer, includes: PSME, PIPO, ABLA, PIEN, LAOC, PICO
Summary: This study examined bird use of burned and unburned forest in the winter season. Species richness was similar, but composition was distinctly different. Composition and abundance also changed with time; some species disappeared from the area while others moved in. Trunk and branch foraging species were more abundant in burned forest, though their abundance significantly decreased from the first to the fourth winter post-fire. Foraging behavior was documented for four woodpecker species within the burned area. Foraging took place on snags > 23 cm dbh.

Study Location: Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks, Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO, ABLA/PIEN
Summary: Bird density, composition, and diversity were monitored across a series of fire severities in burned PICO or spruce-fir forest in Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks. Highest populations and greatest biomass occurred from 5-29 years post-fire. Density, composition, and diversity on moderately burned spruce-fir-PICO were more like those on unburned spruce-fir than other seral stages. Changes in bird communities by feeding category were also examined. Overall, canopy closure was a habitat variable that appeared to affect avifauna more than the presence of fire.
