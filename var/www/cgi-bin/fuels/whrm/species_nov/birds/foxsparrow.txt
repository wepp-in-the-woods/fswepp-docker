Response to Disturbance
greater abundance in cut-over forest (Hagar 1960); less abundant in clearcut and contiguous old growth forest than partial cut forest (Tobalske et al. 1991); less abundant in low shrub-stage clearcuts and more abundant in high shrub-stage clearcuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); as time since wildfire increased from 8-15 years, a dense brush-field developed that encouraged abundance (Bock et al. 1978)

Study Location: central Sierra Nevada
Habitat Description: mixed conifer (PIJE, PICO, ABCO, CADE) and ABMA stands
Summary: Bird communities in open- and closed-canopy stands in two forest types were compared. Closed-canopy forest had lower bird densities, diversities, species richness, and consuming biomasses than open-canopy forests in both vegetative zones. With the exception of hummingbirds, all feeding guilds were present on each transect, though the reduction in understory vegetation and forest clearings in closed-canopy forest caused pronounced decreases in three understory guilds as well as in the flycatchers.

Study Location: California
Habitat Description: PIJE, ABCO, PIPO
Summary: Study compares work reported in Bock and Lynch 1970 on avian communities 8 years after wildfire to continuation data collected 15 years after the fire.  Bird diversity significantly dropped on burned plots compared to data collected 8 years after the fire. In general, using both data sets, there was a much greater change in species densities on burned plots than controls. Breeding bird populations of the burned and unburned forest were more similar 8 years after wildfire than 15 years after wildfire; the two communities lost rathern than gained similarity over the seven year period. The authors attribute this pattern to the fact that forest structure 8 years after fire was more similar to unburned forest than the structure that existed 15 years after fire.

Study Location: inner coast ranges of northwestern California
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Bird species were surveyed in cutover areas of DF forest as well as virgin forest. Bird species are identified that prefer cutover forest, intact forest, or occur in both. Accounts of habitat preferences are given for several bird species, including detailed dietary information.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: Lolo National Forest, western Montana
Habitat Description: mix from PIPO-PIEN-ABLA
Summary: This one-year study examined the habitat requirements of seven open nesting birds typically found in mature forest. Habitat preferences for each species are noted. In general, structural complexity was of high importance; canopy cover, shrub cover and number of large-diameter stems were often included in predictive models. Management recommendations are made for indiividual species as well as for the general avian community studied.

Habitat Description: ABGR
Summary: This case history (1) evaluates bird-habitat relationships in primarily grand fir forests. The goals of this study were to assess how forest stand structure influences habitat selection by birds, to investigate bird use of specific forest structural classes, and to relate bird habitat use to potential management options that consider breeding bird habitat.

Study Location: northwestern Montana
Habitat Description: LAOC cover type; includes ABLA, LAOC, PSME, PIEN, PICO, BEPA, aspen, cottonwood
Summary: Populations of 10 breeding bird species were monitored in harvested and immediately adjacent uncut areas. A number of species were more abundant in harvested areas. Responses by feeding and nesting guilds are also included. Foliage-foraging species and tree gleaners wre less abundant in harvested areas, while flycatching and ground foragers were more common there. Conifer tree-nesting species were least abundant in clearcuts, while ground nesters were more common within the cutover habitats.Management recommendations are made, including the retention of broadleaf trees within cutting units and investigating the importance of slash piles in logged habitat. Slash piles were used by winter wrens, Townsend's solitaires, and dark-eyed juncos as perches, food sources, or nest sites.
