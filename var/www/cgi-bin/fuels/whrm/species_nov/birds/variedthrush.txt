Distribution
breeds from Alaska south through British Columbia and northwestern USA; winters in northwestern USA and California
General Habitat
dense, moist woodlands, especially coniferous forests
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
edges and brush thickets of cutover areas; stands of tan oak; responds negatively to edge (reviewed in Hagar et al. 1995)
Nestsite Characteristics
nests in branch or fork of tree; nest made of dried leaves, inner bark strips and soft moss reinforced with twigs and lined with grass and rootlets
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages mostly on the ground; feeds on berries in trees and shrubs
Diet
insects (especially in the summer): beetles, ants, caterpillars, and crickets; also many millipedes, sowbugs, snails, earthworms, spiders, and other invertebrates; berries and wild fruits comprise the majority of winter diet: madrone, manzanita, blackberry, snowberry, poison oak, honeysuckle, and orchard fruits; also seeds (PSME) and acorns
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
greater abundance in cut-over forest (Hagar 1960); less common in cut areas than unlogged forest (Tobalske et al. 1991);  less abundant in low shrub- and high shrub- stage clearcuts and partially cut forest compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); not found in stands burned by stand-replacement wildfire, found in unburned controls (Kreisel and Stein 1999)

Study Location: inner coast ranges of northwestern California
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Bird species were surveyed in cutover areas of PSME forest as well as virgin forest. Bird species are identified that prefer cutover forest, intact forest, or occur in both. Accounts of habitat preferences are given for several bird species, including detailed dietary information.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: northeast Washington
Habitat Description: mixed conifer, includes: PSME, PIPO, ABLA, PIEN, LAOC, PICO
Summary: This study examined bird use of burned and unburned forest in the winter season. Species richness was similar, but composition was distinctly different. Composition and abundance also changed with time; some species disappeared from the area while others moved in. Trunk and branch foraging species were more abundant in burned forest, though their abundance significantly decreased from the first to the fourth winter post-fire. Foraging behavior was documented for four woodpecker species within the burned area. Foraging took place on snags > 23 cm dbh.

Study Location: northwestern Montana
Habitat Description: LAOC cover type; includes ABLA, LAOC, PSME, PIEN, PICO, BEPA, aspen, cottonwood
Summary: Populations of 10 breeding bird species were monitored in harvested and immediately adjacent uncut areas. A number of species were more abundant in harvested areas. Responses by feeding and nesting guilds are also included. Foliage-foraging species and tree gleaners wre less abundant in harvested areas, while flycatching and ground foragers were more common there. Conifer tree-nesting species were least abundant in clearcuts, while ground nesters were more common within the cutover habitats.Management recommendations are made, including the retention of broadleaf trees within cutting units and investigating the importance of slash piles in logged habitat. Slash piles were used by winter wrens, Townsend's solitaires, and dark-eyed juncos as perches, food sources, or nest sites.
