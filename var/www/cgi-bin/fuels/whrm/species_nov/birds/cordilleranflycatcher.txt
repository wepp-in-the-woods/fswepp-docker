Study Location: Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: The habitat needs and roles of secondary cavity nesters are examined in PIPO forests by compiling information from a variety of studies in Arizona. The density of secondary cavity nesters was determined and their importance in local ecology is addressed. Food guilds are outlined. Territory size and snag foraging behavior are outlined for a few species. The impact of snag removal is also discussed; snag removal resulted in a significant loss of breeding bird diversity as well as a decrease in the in the density of secondary cavity nesters. Species are ranked by their sensitivity to snag removal. Finally, the author outlines minimum snag densities that are appropriate for supporting secondary cavity nesters. The author concludes that 268 snags should be maintained for every 100 acres of forest. Note: western flycatchers named in this paper are assumed to be Cordilleran.

Study Location: central Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO, ABCO, PSME, PIST, aspen, Gambel oak
Summary: Habitat features for successful and unsuccessful nest sites, nest sites vs. random sites, and differences among coexisting species of cavity nesting birds were identified. Species-specific characteristics are presented both for nest site and nest tree; birds differed in some of their habitat preferences. Aspen (mostly dead) were a preferred nesting species and were common in foraging patches, despite their low density in the study area. High density of aspen provides both more nesting sites and protects nests from predation, as predators have to search more sites to find nests. Foraging areas also had more conifers and fewer deciduous trees (other than aspen) than random areas. Preference for conifers is attributed to increased foraging opportunities.Failed nests were surrounded by denser foliage and were closer to conifers. Reduced nest success was also linked to lower nest height. Nonexcavating species had lower nesting success than excavator species.

Habitat Description: ABGR
Summary: This case history (1) evaluates bird-habitat relationships in primarily grand fir forests. The goals of this study were to assess how forest stand structure influences habitat selection by birds, to investigate bird use of specific forest structural classes, and to relate bird habitat use to potential management options that consider breeding bird habitat.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Seasonal avian communities were examined for their response to weather condition and treatment (logging) effects. While birds responded to climate, most notably precipitation, treatment effects appeared to be more influential. Species preferring open habitat (rock wren, American robin, western wood pe-wee and western bluebird) were highest on medium and heavy cut stands. Treated stands also had the highest abundance of chipping sparrows, broad-tailed hummingbirds, Grace's warbler, and dark-eyed juncos. Species preferring dense foliage (western flycatcher, pygmy nuthatch, red-faced warbler, hermit thrush, black-headed grosbeak) were less abundant in modified habitats. Note: western flycatchers named in this study are assumed to be Cordilleran.
