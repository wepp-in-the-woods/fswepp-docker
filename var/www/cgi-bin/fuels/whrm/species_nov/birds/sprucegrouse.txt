Study Location: western Montana

Summary: Spruce grouse movement, activity areas, social groupings, and food habits were assessed in winter. Grouse used different cover types in winter than other seasons. Most activity was concentrated on southern exposures. Roosting sites had a high density of small trees and high canopy cover, while basal area was high at both roosting and feeding/loafing sites. Winter diet consisted largely of conifer needles.
