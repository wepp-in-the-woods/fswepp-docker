Distribution
widely distributed in coniferous forests in the mountain regions of the Interior West
General Habitat
coniferous and aspen forest edges, forest openings, meadows
Home or Activity Range
1.25-5 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
structural diversity; interspersion of open areas and closed, mature forest; respond positively to edge; dense thickets of small trees
Nestsite Characteristics
along forested edges of meadows and openings
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
conifer trees, along forest floor, along ridgetops, in openings; large trees limiting in winter; broods forage in interspersed grassy and herbaceous vegetation
Diet
needles, buds, and new cones of conifers, fruits and seeds, green leaves, insects, deciduous buds and seeds
Predators
forest carnivores and raptors
Shelter Habitats
mature, closed canopy forest for winter shelter; stumps and logs for resting and hiding, medium-diameter conifers for spring roosting; male territories include dense, small-diameter conifer thickets for resting and escape coverbroods seek cover in interspersed grassy and herbaceous vegetation
Response to Disturbance
found only in stands burned by stand-replacement wildfire, not in unburned controls 2 winters after fire (Kreisel and Stein 1999); selective logging should be used in areas with fire suppression to create uneven-aged stands of timber in which conifer thickets 20-60 years of age are numerous (Martinka 1972);cattle grazing significantly reduced the amount of potential brood cover in an area (Mussehl 1963)

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests. 

Kreisel, Karen J.; Stein, Steven J. 1999. Bird use of burned and unburned forests during winter. Wilson Bulletin. 111(2): 243-250.

Study Location: northeast Washington
Habitat Description: mixed conifer, includes: PSME, PIPO, ABLA, PIEN, LAOC, PICO
Summary: This study examined bird use of burned and unburned forest in the winter season. Species richness was similar, but composition was distinctly different. Composition and abundance also changed with time; some species disappeared from the area while others moved in. Trunk and branch foraging species were more abundant in burned forest, though their abundance significantly decreased from the first to the fourth winter post-fire. Foraging behavior was documented for four woodpecker species within the burned area. Foraging took place on snags > 23 cm dbh.

Study Location: southwestern Montana
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME
Summary: Structural characteristics of male blue grouse territories were examined. The major component of territories were thickets of coniferous trees, with an average density of 1,200 tree per acre and average dbh of 4.9 " for trees in the thicket. An important component of thickets used for resting and as escape cover was the presence of edge habitat.

Study Location: review
Habitat Description: review
Summary: Habitat needs of a variety of northern goshawk prey are identified by a literature review. Management recommendations are made in regard to nesting, foraging, and other life history attributes.

Stauffer, Dean F.; Peterson, Steven R. 1985. Ruffed and blue grouse habitat use in southeastern Idaho. Journal of Wildlife Management. 49:459-466.

Study Location: Wasatch Mountains of southeastern Idaho
Habitat Description: 8 types: sagebrush, mixed shrub, mountain mahogany, maple, aspen, aspen-conifer (ABLA, PSME, PICO), dense conifer (ABLA, PIEN, PICO), open conifer (PSME, ABLA, PIFL)
Summary: Seasonal habitat selection is presented for blue and ruffed grouse. Ruffed grouse preferred stands dominated by quaking aspen or aspen-conifer mixes in winter, and otherwise preferred stand characteristics typical of early successional stages. Blue grouse preferred higher elevation, open conifer stands in winter. In spring, lower elevation mixed shrub stands with and open understory and overstory were selected for breeding and brood rearing. Little habitat overlap was noted between the two species, with blue grouse consisitently choosing more open habitat than ruffed grouse.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.
