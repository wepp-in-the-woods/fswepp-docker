Response to Disturbance
more numerous in overstory removal sites (Franzreb 1978); most abundant in 27 year-old clearcut vs. mature forest, younger clearcut and meadow types (Austin and Perry 1979); attracted to areas clearcut 17 and 37 years previously (Austin and Perry 1979)

Austin, Dennis D.; Perry, Michael L. 1979. Birds in six communities within a lodgepole pine forest. Journal of Forestry. 77:584-586.

Study Location: Uinta Mountains, Utah
Habitat Description: PICO as main overstory tree; also includes PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Birds were censused in wet and dry meadows, mature and stagnated PICO stands, and regenerating PICO stands (17 and 37 years post-clearcut). The richest avifauna was found in the dry meadows. While a few birds were adversly affected by the clearcutting, many individual species were more numerous in the clearcuts, and the overall number of species was similar.

Study Location: Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO, PIST, PSME, aspen, ABCO, PIEN
Summary: Tree species preferences were analyzed for 5 species of birds on logged and unlogged forest. Niche widths and bird densities are given for the individual species. In unlogged forest, the entire avifauna indicated preferences for PSME, ABCO, and PIEN. PIPO, PIST, and snags were not used to the extent to which they were available. In the logged area, avian use of aspen, PIPO, and PIST was less than expected, while PSME and PIEN were preferred. Overall, the unaltered sites supported a considerably larger avian community. The mountain chickadee, ruby-crowned kinglet, and yellow-rumped warbler were more numerous on unlogged sites, while the yellow-bellied sapsucker and the gray-headed junco were more numerous on logged sites. The brown creeper was entirely missing from logged sites.

Study Location: Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PSME and PIPO dominated
Summary: Birds were significantly more abundant in unlogged plots than modified plots, while composition overlapped. Species richness was more influenced by year than treatment. Birds gleaning on foliage or timber were most adversely affected by logging. Ground or slash foragers were much more abundant in harvested plots. Aerial foragers and most flycatchers were more abundant on logged plots. Cup nesting species were more abundant on unlogged plots.
