Hayward, Gregory D.; Garton, Edward O. 1988. Resource partitioning among forest owls in the River of No Return Wilderness. Oecologia (Berlin). 75:253-265.

Study Location: Frank Church Wilderness, central Idaho
Habitat Description:  PSME, PICO, PIPO, ABLA habitat type series
Summary:Resource partitioning at the macro- and microhabitat scale was studied for five abundant species of forest owls. Owls differed in habitat preferences as well as activity periods and food habits. Screech owls had the most restricted niche, while pygmy and great-horned owls were more generalist in habitat ust. Patterns of resource use was interpreted as resulting from environmental factors, morphological limitations, behavioral adaptations, and interspecific competition.
