Distribution
closely mimics PIPO distribution in western USA
General Habitat
open woodlands, especially burnt pine forests, cottonwood riparian areas; uses both old and new burns
Home or Activity Range
2.5-15 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
need snags, low canopy cover areas with shrub development that supports prey; respond positively to edge
Nestsite Characteristics
selects areas of moderate snag density, snags of relatively large diameters, riparian cottonwood areas; weak excavator; will enlarge holes of other species or usurp nests; requires large snags in an advanced decay state; may re-use nest for several years.
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
perches in open areas where it can view and maneuver for prey; presence of understory shrubs
Diet
aerial insectivore: arthropods, crickets, beetles, flies, larvae, fruit, pine seeds, acorns
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
favored 4-14 years post-fire as acorns are produced (Johnson and Wauer 1996); highest nesting densities ever recorded in salvage-logged forest 2-4 years after high-intensity wildfire (Saab and Dudley 1998)

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Bandelier National Monument, NM
Habitat Description: PIPO, montane meadow, mixed conifer, pinyon-juniper
Summary: Breeding birds were surveyed before and for many years after a wildlfire in Bandelier National Monument. Species diversity increased after the fire, but breeding populations in general declined for several years before increasing above prefire levels. This pattern was more pronounced on severely burned forest. In all but the severely burned forest, breeding bird diversity and populations were higher than prefire levels 14 years after the wildfire. Patterns are presented for different foraging and nesting guilds, as well as some individual species (including particular habitat changes that impacted bird species).

Study Location: review of western Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: intensively managed and unmanaged PSME
Summary: A comprehensive review of the importance of snags as wildlife trees in managed and unmanaged PSME forests. Includes information on the ecological role of snags and cavity users, wildlife snag requirements, snag management, and guidelines for selecting wildlife trees to meet logging safety requirements. Much detail is presented on calculated the number of snags needed to maintain specfic densities of cavity-users. Forestry practices that impact snag production and retention are also outlined. The economic role of snags and cavity-using wildlife is addressed.

Study Location: Boise National Forest, southwestern Idaho
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME
Summary: The authors identified snag characteristics, including diameter and density, preferred by a number of cavity-nesting birds. Models of landscape-scale habitat preference were also presented for black-backed and Lewis's woodpeckers, and were consistent with findings at a smaller scale. As these two species represent opposite extremes of a continuum of habitat use amongst the birds studied, managing for these particular species will incorporate the needs of many other cavity-nesting birds.

Study Location: southwestern Idaho
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME
Summary: Cavity nesting birds were grouped as strong, weak or non-excavating species. Patterns of cavity occupancy were tied to various microhabitat features as well as temporal and spatial scales. Time since fire had the greatest influence on occupancy of nest cavities for all species; site characteristics were secondarily important. Preffered snag characteristics differed by type of excavator and changed over time. The majority of cavities (80%) were not reused. Both number of cavities and number of cavity-nesting birds increased with time since fire. The authors stress the ephemeral nature of fire-created habitat.

Study Location: PIPO: southwestern Idaho, cottonwood: central Colorado
Habitat Description: burned PIPO,  unburned riparian cottonwood
Summary: Burnt PIPO forest and riparian cottonwood areas have been identified as primary nesting areas for Lewis's woodpeckers. Significant differences in nesting success were found between these two habitat types. Nesting density and success were higher in burnt PIPO forests, while predation on nests was lower. As nest failure was most commonly the result of predation, the authors suggest the time lag in re-colonization of burnt areas by potential predators as one mechanism for the observed pattern of higher nest success in burnt PIPO forests. The authors also link higher shrub cover in PIPO forests to successful foraging. Burnt PIPO forest appears to be a "source" habitat; riparian cottonwood forest appears to be a "sink" habitat. Both low-intensity fire and stand-replacing crown fires are suggested to restore PIPO stands and provide suitable habitat for the Lewis's woodpecker. The authors also note that they performed a comprehensive (6000 ha) search for nesting Lewis's woodpeckers in unburnt PIPO forests and found only one nest in two years. This result highlights the importance of fire as a defining habitat character in PIPO forests.
