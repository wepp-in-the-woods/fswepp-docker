Summary: Literature review of the use of snags for nesting osprey, bald eagles, and Mississippi kites. Osprey nests were typically near water and were in coniferous snags. Comparative size, abundance, and location of trees were more important for bald eagle nesting than absolute tree size or species. Bald eagles were typically found near water and use trees with sturdy branches for nesting, but also with characteristics that facilitate visibility and accessibility. Snags were frequently used for perching, especially in the eagle's nesting or wintering range. Management techniques that conserve snags or reserve live trees as future snags are presented.

Habitat Description: intensively managed and unmanaged PSME
Summary: A comprehensive review of the importance of snags as wildlife trees in managed and unmanaged PSME forests. Includes information on the ecological role of snags and cavity users, wildlife snag requirements, snag management, and guidelines for selecting wildlife trees to meet logging safety requirements. Much detail is presented on calculating the number of snags needed to maintain specfic densities of cavity-users. Forestry practices that impact snag production and retention are also outlined. The economic role of snags and cavity-using wildlife is addressed.
