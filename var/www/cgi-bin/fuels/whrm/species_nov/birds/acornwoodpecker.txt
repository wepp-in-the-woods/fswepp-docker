Home or Activity Range
15 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
large snags, PIPO and oak
Nestsite Characteristics
excavates holes and nests communally in large dead PIPO, occassionally in live or dead oak
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
snags as feeding substrate; mature oaks
Diet
acorns, almonds, walnuts, pecans, grasshoppers, ants, beetles, flies, oak sap

No information available
Shelter Habitats
cavities in dead trees provide  thermally regulated habitat for communal roosting and overwintering
Response to Disturbance
appeared 6 years post-fire and then increased markedly (Johnson and Wauer 1996); favored 4-14 years post-fire as acorns are produced (Johnson and Wauer 1996); lower mean detection rate and % occurrence in clearcuts without snags (Marcot 1983)

Summaries of Specific Studies
Gutierrez, R. J.; Koenig, Walter .D. 1978. Characteristics of storage trees used by acorn woodpeckers in two California woodlands. Journal of Forestry. 76:162-164.

Study Location: Monterey County, California
Habitat Description: PIPO, QUWI, QUCH, PILA
Summary: The authors examined granary trees used by acorn woodpeckers for acorn storage. Primary storage trees were significantly larger than the largest non-storage trees in the area; the authors suggest that woodpeckers select for the largest live or dead PIPO available in a given area. Secondary storage trees are often located near the primary storage tree and tend to be smaller. Management recommendations include retaining large PIPO to act as potential storage trees and only removing secondary storage trees if some removal is neccessary.

Study Location: Coronado National Forest, southeast Arizon
Habitat Description: PIPO dominated, also PIST, PSME, QUHY, QUAR
Summary: This study compared the number and characteristics of snags used by cavity-nesting birds before and after broadcast understory fires in PP stands. Avian species were monitored to investigate their response to prescribed fire. Before the fire, many avian species used large snags (> 50 cm dbh) for cavity nesting, with smaller snags used primarily for foraging. Nearly half of all snags were burned or drastically changed by the prescribed fire. A snag's likelihood to be consumed depended on both dbh and decay class. Few large live trees were killed immediately, leading to a 45% net decrease in snags 1 year post-treatment. Small snags (< 15 cm dbh) increased 20-fold after the treatment. Logs decreased post-treatment. No avian species were lost post-treatment, though northern flickers and violet-green swallows decreased in experimental stands, while mountain chickadees increased. The authors attribute these patterns to changes in prey populations or shifts in areas used in foraging, and not to any limitation in nest sites.

Study Location: Bandelier National Monument, NM
Habitat Description: PIPO, montane meadow, mixed conifer, pinyon-juniper
Summary: Breeding birds were surveyed before and for many years after a wildlfire in Bandelier National Monument. Species diversity increased after the fire, but breeding populations in general declined for several years before increasing above prefire levels. This pattern was more pronounced on severely burned forest. In all but the severely burned forest, breeding bird diversity and populations were higher than prefire levels 14 years after the wildfire. Patterns are presented for different foraging and nesting guilds, as well as some individual species (including particular habitat changes that impacted bird species).

Study Location: central Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO, ABCO, PSME, PIST, aspen, Gambel oak
Summary: Habitat features for successful and unsuccessful nest sites, nest sites vs. random sites, and differences among coexisting species of cavity nesting birds were identified. Species-specific characteristics are presented both for nest site and nest tree; birds differed in some of their habitat preferences. Aspen (mostly dead) were a preferred nesting species and were common in foraging patches, despite their low density in the study area. High density of aspen provides both more nesting sites and protects nests from predation, as predators have to search more sites to find nests. Foraging areas also had more conifers and fewer deciduous trees (other than aspen) than random areas. Preference for conifers is attributed to increased foraging opportunities.Failed nests were surrounded by denser foliage and were closer to conifers. Reduced nest success was also linked to lower nest height. Nonexcavating species had lower nesting success than excavator species.

Study Location: northwestern California
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Bird abundance was compared in clearcut PSME forests where snags had been retained or removed. Nine species of primary and secondary cavity-nesting birds had a lower mean detection rate and percent occurrence in clearcuts where snags had been removed. One species, the chesnut-backed chickadee, increased in mean detection rate and percent occurrence in clearcuts without snags. The authors hypothesize that most cavity nesters shifted nesting to neighboring stands and used clearcut areas for foraging.

Study Location: review of western Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: intensively managed and unmanaged PSME
Summary: A comprehensive review of the importance of snags as wildlife trees in managed and unmanaged PSME forests. Includes information on the ecological role of snags and cavity users, wildlife snag requirements, snag management, and guidelines for selecting wildlife trees to meet logging safety requirements. Much detail is presented on calculated the number of snags needed to maintain specfic densities of cavity-users. Forestry practices that impact snag production and retention are also outlined. The economic role of snags and cavity-using wildlife is addressed.
