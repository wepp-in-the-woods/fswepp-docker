Distribution
historically from British Columbia throughout continental USA to Chile and Argentina; presently most USA populations are in the west
General Habitat
variety of habitat types, usually along water courses
Home or Activity Range
8000-72000 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
vegetative cover for concealment, proximity to water courses, closed conifer types used for travelling, also travel along drainages and ridges
Nestsite Characteristics
maternal den sites are often in dense, brushy areas, particularly under large deadfall
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
kill sites associated with closed conifer, open conifer and aspen-conifer forest types; need vegetative cover to stalk and attack prey and for security during feeding periods; use "edge" complexes while on hunting forays; many kill sites in drainage bottoms
Diet
ungulates: mule deer, white-tailed deer, bighorn sheep, elk; porcupine, raccoon, snowshoe hare, marmots, ground squirrel, pocket gopher, vole, coyote, bobcat, other mountain lions
Predators
other mountain lions, wolves, humans
Shelter Habitats
rest under rock ledges or piled deadfall
Response to Disturbance
some individuals made extensive use of burned areas, sometimes associated with rock-cliff components (Williams 1992)

Hahr, Meg. 2001. Winter distribution and habitat use of lynx, fisher, and wolverine in Glacier National Park, Montana. Missoula, MT: University of Montana. 97 p. M.S. Thesis.

Location of Study: northwest Montana
Habitat Description: entire Glacier National Park; includes dry herbaceous, mesic herbaceous, deciduous trees and shrubs, dense mesic coniferous forest, open dry coniferous forest, barren rock, snow or ice
Summary: Lynx, fisher, and wolverine use of forest age classes and vegetative cover types was assessed in winter in Glacier National Park. Lynx use of deciduous and dry coniferous forest types was greater than expected while dry herb/shrub and mesic conifer cover types were used less than expected. Fisher used deciduous and dry coniferous forest types more than both shrub cover types. Wolverines used both conifer cover types less than expected while deciduous forest stands and dry herb/shrub were used significantly more than expected. Tracks of a variety of other carnivores, including marten, coyote, and mountain lion,  were also recorded.

Report to: The American Museum of Natural History, The Boone and Crockett Club, The New York Zoological Society, The Board of Regents University of Idaho, The Idaho Fish and Game Commission.  

Location of Study: central Idaho
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: Update on a project aimed to gather data on the dynamics of a lion population and to evaluate the role of the lion as a predator and its effect on populations of big-game species. Contains data on home range, prey items, and prey health

Location of Study: Arizona
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: A mountain lion population on the North Kaibab plateau experienced a decline attributed to hunting and nutritional stress. At most, lions removed 15-20% of the peak deer population in the area.

Williams, James S. 1992. Ecology of mountain lions in the Sun River area of northern Montana. Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks. Project # W-100-R-4,5. 109 p.

Location of Study: north-central Montana
Habitat Description: variety, includes: PIFL savannah/grassland, aspen, cottonwood, PSME, PICO, PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Mountain lion habitat use, foraging habits, and homea era characteristics were investigated. Closed-conifer, open-conifer, aspen-conifer, deciduous tree and shrubland cover types were selected for. Grasslands and vegetated rock cover were avoided. Areas near a stream course were preferred, and roads and USFS recreational trails were not avoided. Eastern aspects, elevations between 1200-1850 m, a range of slopes, and both broken and unbroken topography were preferred. Home ranges varied by sex and habitat.
