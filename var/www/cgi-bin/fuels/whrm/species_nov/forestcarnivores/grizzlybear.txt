Distribution
in N. America, ranges from Alaska across the Yukon and Northwest Territory, through British Columbia and Alberta. Disjunct populations Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming.
General Habitat
variety of habitat types, often in wilderness areas are well-removed from human disturbance
Home or Activity Range
24000-500000 ac
Specific Habitat Preferences
habitats with high abundance of food sources, including grasses, forbs, and berry-producing shrubs
Nestsite Characteristics
give birth in winter dens; winter den sites in densely forested areas on well-drained ground, may be straight into hillsides
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
habitats with high abundance grasses, forbs, and berry-producing shrubs
Diet
grass, sedges, forbs, shrubs, berries, tubers, insects (ants, grubs,ladybird beetles, army cutworm moths), mammals (deer, elk squirrels, voles, ground squirrels, mice, marmots), carrion
Predators
humans
Shelter Habitats
winter den sites in densely forested areas on well-drained ground, may be straight into hillsides
Response to Disturbance
used burned-huckleberry habitat more than expected based on availability in the fall (Kasworm and Manley 1988); bears used habitat < 500 m of open roads less than expected (Kasworm and Manley 1988)

Location of Study:  northwest Montana
Habitat Description:  mixed conifer
Summary: A grizzly bear habitat use model is presented based on community type distribution, food habits, and food availability. Seasonal variation in habitat foraging quality may be explained by food availability and nutrient content of food items.

Summary: Grizzly and black bears were radio-collared and monitored in the Cabinet Mountains of northwestern Montana. Home range size, population density, food habits and spring and fall habitat use were examined. Both bear species avoided habitat close to open roads, though grizzlies were more sensitive. Habitat selection in relation to topography, vegetation types, human activities, and land use were discussed. Grizzly bears used timbered habitats less than expected both spring and fall, and timbered shrub habitats were used less than expected in spring only. Snowchute shrub/alder habitat was used more than expected in both seasons. Burned/huckleberry habitat was used more than expected in the fall. Habitats high in grasses and forbs were used in the spring. Black bears used timbered habitat less than expected, but timbered-shrub, snowchute shrub-alder, burn-huckleberry, and riparian-forb habitat more than expected in both seasons. The impact of human harvest on black bear sex and age structure was also examined. The low number of grizzly captures and sightings, as well as the high mortality of captured grizzlies leads to serious questions of the species' ability to persist in the Cabinet mountains.

Servheen, Christopher. 1981. Grizzly bear ecology and management in the Mission Mountains, Montana. Missoula, MT: University of Montana. 138 p. M.S. Thesis.

Location of Study:  northwest Montana
Habitat Description:  not stated
Summary: Grizzly bear movements, habitat selection, food habits, and denning activities were studies in the Mission Mountains. Low elevation wet sites were used more than expected in spring. Seep areas and alpine slab-rock were used more than expected in summer. Wet meadows, riparian areas, and alpine slab-rock were used more than expected in autumn. Food habits varied seasonally; specific dietary preferences are given. The majority of den sites were located in open, side-hill park habitat between 2050 and 2500 m in elevation. All were excavated and the majority were lined with beargrass. Thesis includes a management plan that outlines impacts of human activities and suggests actions for mitigating human disturbance.
