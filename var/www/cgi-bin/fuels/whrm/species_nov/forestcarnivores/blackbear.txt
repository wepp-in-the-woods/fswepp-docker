Specific Habitat Preferences
forest generalists, prefer edge habitats and are frequently found near riparian areas, use large diameter trees and logs and rock crevices for denning; logs and fruiting shrubs for foraging; closed canopy, high cover conditions for bedding
Nestsite Characteristics
dens beneath down trees, hollow logs or trees, beneath roots, in rock crevices, use ground excavations
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
large-diameter logs; fruiting shrubs (especially hawthorne in OR)
Diet
acorns, berries, nuts, tubers, insects and their larvae, small mammals, eggs, honey, carrion, garbage
Predators
wolves, mountain lions, humans
Shelter Habitats
snags for overwintering, dwelling or denning; dens beneath down trees, hollow logs or trees, beneath roots,rock crevices, ground excavations; bed in closed canopy, dense stands, including pole stands; daybeds may be in timbered areas with sparse understory
Response to Disturbance
selected areas clearcut 5-15 years in the past for berry producing shrubs and cover, avoided clearcuts over 30 years old (Lindsey and Meslow 1977); selected against areas burned by wildfire within the past 0-2 years and areas harvested and burned within the past 1-10 years (Gold 1997); bears selected for selection cuts (20-40 years old) in all seasons, and against clearcuts (<20 years old) in all seasons (Young 1984); used burned-huckleberry habitat more than expected based on availability in the spring and fall (Kasworm and Manley 1988); bears used habitat < 100 m of open roads less than expected (Kasworm and Manley 1988); selection cuts provided a large variety of bear food and were used for feeding (Unsworth et al. 1989); very few bear locations were within clearcuts (Unsworth et al. 1989)

Location of Study: Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME, ABGR, PICO, ABLA
Summary: Black bears used hollow logs and trees, ground excavations, and cave or rock structures for denning in northeastern Oregon. Hollow trees used for denning were typically large-diameter and showed signs of either heartwood or basal decay. Age classes of bears showed different patterns of den site selection. Areas where hollow logs were used had been harvested, resulting in earlier structural stages lacking large-diameter trees. The majority of denning sites occured in moist, late-seral stands of ABGR. Retention of large-diameter ABGR and LAOC with evidence of decay will increase the availability of den sites to black bears in the region.

Location of Study: northeastern Oregon
Habitat Description: ABGR, PSME, PICO, ABLA, PIPO at all structural stages
Summary: Black bear habitat use was examined by sex and age outside of the denning season. Old and young multistory stands were used more, and all other structural stages used less, than expected based on availability. Adult males used the most diversified habitat, while adult females were restricted to mature, multistory, unlogged ABGR stands. Sites used for bedding and moving had a high degree of security in the form of high stem density and dense canopy closure. Most log-foraging took place in logged stands and were higher in slope than stands used for other activities. Fruit-foraging took place in open stands that were lower in slope, closer to roads, and lower in log density than stands used for other purposes. Bears selected large-diameter logs (> 38 cm diameter) with partial or advanced decay for foraging.

Location of Study:  northeast Cascades, Washington
Habitat Description:  PIPO, PSME, TSHE, PICO, ABLA
Summary: Black bears selected for PSME, riparian forests, and ecideuous forests, and selected against hemlock, other conifers, fire, and bare ground (mostly roads) in the study area. Riparian and mesic sites, mosiacs of open and forested areas, and areas with high diversity of bear plant food also represent important habitat to bears in the northeast Cascades.

Location of Study:  northwest Montana, northern Idaho
Habitat Description:  PIPO, PSME, ABGR, THPL, TSHE, ABLA, PIEN, TSME, PICO, LAOC, aspen
Summary: Grizzly and black bears were radio-collared and monitored in the Cabinet Mountains of northwestern Montana. Home range size, population density, food habits and spring and fall habitat use were examined. Both bear species avoided habitat close to open roads, though grizzlies were more sensitive. Habitat selection in relation to topography, vegetation types, human activities, and land use were discussed. Grizzly bears used timbered habitats less than expected both spring and fall, and timbered shrub habitats were used less than expected in spring only. Snowchute shrub/alder habitat was used more than expected in both seasons. Burned/huckleberry habitat was used more than expected in the fall. Habitats high in grasses and forbs were used in the spring. Black bears used timbered habitat less than expected, but timbered-shrub, snowchute shrub-alder, burn-huckleberry, and riparian-forb habitat more than expected in both seasons. The impact of human harvest on black bear sex and age structure was also examined. The low number of grizzly captures and sightings, as well as the high mortality of captured grizzlies leads to serious questions of the species' ability to persist in the Cabinet mountains.

Location of Study:  island in southwestern Washington
Habitat Description:  TSHE, PSME, PISI, THPL
Summary:  Black bear movement and activity were monitored on a small island in southwestern Washington. Home range on the island was smaller than that reported in other areas, which the authors attribute to the richness of local habitat. Bears selected for areas logged within 5-10 years of the study, and avoided those areas logged more than 30 years previously. The authors attribute the attraction to recently logged areas by the presence of berry-producing shrubs in these areas. Areas logged 8-15 years previously provided both food and cover and were used more than expected based on availability.

Location of Study:  Apache-Sitgreaves and Coconino National Forests, Arizona
Habitat Description:  PIPO, PSME, ABCO, PIFL, ACGR, QUGA, aspen
Summary:  Feeding and bedding sites were examined for female black bears. All radio-collared bears selected for mixed-conifer forest and against PIPO. Mixed conifer areas had higher overstory and horizontal cover, as well as a higher density of mature trees and shrubs. The author believes that bears selected for areas with the most security in the form of cover, both vegetative and topographical, rather than areas containing specific species. Secondary habitat selection was food-based. Gambel oak acorns were a main food source.

Location of Study:  review of western Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description:  intensively managed and unmanaged PSME
Summary:  A comprehensive review of the importance of snags as wildlife trees in managed and unmanaged PSME forests. Includes information on the ecological role of snags and cavity users, wildlife snag requirements, snag management, and guidelines for selecting wildlife trees to meet logging safety requirements. Details on calculating the number of snags needed to maintain specfic densities of cavity-users is presented. Forestry practices that impact snag production and retention are also outlined. The economic role of snags and cavity-using wildlife is addressed.

Location of Study:  west-central Idaho
Habitat Description:  forest types of PIPO, PSME, ABGR also containing PICO, ABLA, PIEN, LAOC, aspen; also sagebrush, grasses and forbs at lower elevations
Summary: Female black-bear habitat use was studied. Habitat use varied seasonally and by activity. Female bears tended to feed in areas where topographic features enhanced the growth of mesic vegetation. Selection-cut shrubfields and shrubfield habitats were used for feeding. Uncut timbered sites were important bedding locations. Open timber and meadow areas high in grasses and forbs were used in spring for foraging. Riparian and aspen habitats high in berry-producing shrubs were used for both feeding and bedding in the summer and fall. Rock-talus and sagebrush habitats were avoided.

Location of Study:  northern Idaho
Habitat Description:  TSHE, PSME, THPL, ABLA, PIAL
Summary: This study aimed to quantify seasonal habitat use by black bears, determine if habitat use patterns differed by sex,  identify relationships between habitat use and activities on disturbed and undisturbed sites, identify relationships between habitat use and characteristics of food species, and determine whether physical and environmental factors affect habitat use patterns. Black bears selected for selection cuts during spring, summer, and fall. Clearcuts were selected against in all seasons. Females used the timbered habitat component more than males. Selection cuts and riparian zones were used for feeding, while timber and selection cuts were used for bedding. Bear locations were tied to the phenological development of food plants.
