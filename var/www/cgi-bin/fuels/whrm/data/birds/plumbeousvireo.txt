Distribution
Rocky Mountains south into Mexico 
General Habitat
pine and pine-oak forests
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Canopy Cover
to forage and nest in mature, open-canopied forest (Curson and Goguen 1998)
Specific Habitat Preferences
coniferous woodlands (PIPO) of open structure with some deciduous understory
Nestsite Characteristics
nest suspended between fork near tip of branch in tree or bush; breeds at almost 10,000 ft
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages and perches in mid- to high levels in trees; gleans insects from foliage or bark surfaces; PIPO a prefered species to forage on
Diet
insects, fruits and berries
Predators
jays, Accipiter hawks, northern pygmy-owl
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
slow decline post-fire (Johnson and Wauer 1996); increased one year post-prescribed burn (Bock and Bock 1983); less abundant in low shrub-stage clearcuts and more abundant on high shrub-stage clearcuts and partially cut forest compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995)

Bock, Carl E.; Bock, Jane H. 1983. Responses of birds and deer mice to prescribed burning in ponderosa pine. Journal of Wildlife Management. 47(3): 836-840.

Study Location: Black Hills, South Dakota
Habitat Description: PIPO, pine-grassland savannah
Summary: Listed as solitary vireo in paper; appears to be in the range of the plumbeous vireo. Bird and deer mouse abundance was examined 1 and 2 years post-prescribed fire. Bird species composition was similar between burned and control plots. However, 7 bird species (American robin, Mountain bluebird, Solitary vireo, Yellow-rumped warbler, Western tanager, Dark-eyed junco, Chipping sparrow) were more abundant on burned plots the first year post-fire. In the second year post-fire, only one species was more abundant on the burns (Vesper sparrow), while 2 were more common on the controls (American robin, red-breasted nuthatch). Deer mice were similarly more abundant on burned plots the first year post-fire, but were not so the second year. The major difference in vegetation post-fire was the reduction of litter and small pines in the burned areas. The authors attribute the observed patterns of wildlife abundance to a temporary increase in the quantity or quality of local food supply as opposed to the documented changes in vegetative structure.

Study Location: throughout range
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Birds of North America species account for the plumbeous vireo. Typically breeds in warm, dry, often montane forests of pine, particularly PIPO, also oak and juniper. Generally favors coniferous woodlands of open structure with some deciduous understory, and in steep terrains favors canyon bottoms. Generalist forager; forages on PIPO trees as well as shrubs. Nests low within understory vegetation or on low branch of large or sapling-sized tree.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Listed as solitary vireo in paper; paper covers range of both Cassin's and plumbeous vireos. Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: Bandelier National Monument, NM
Habitat Description: PIPO, montane meadow, mixed conifer, pinyon-juniper
Summary: Listed as solitary vireo in paper; appears to be in the range of the plumbeous vireo. Breeding birds were surveyed before and for many years after a wildlfire in Bandelier National Monument. Species diversity increased after the fire, but breeding populations in general declined for several years before increasing above prefire levels. This pattern was more pronounced on severely burned forest. In all but the severely burned forest, breeding bird diversity and populations were higher than prefire levels 14 years after the wildfire. Patterns are presented for different foraging and nesting guilds, as well as some individual species (including particular habitat changes that impacted bird species).
