Summary: Birds of North America species account for the least flycatcher. Inhabits semi-open, second-growth, and mature deciduous and mixed woods.; occasionally conifer groves, swamps and bog edges, orchards, and shrubby fields. Hawks or gleans insects from foliage of trees and shrubs; may eat fruits and seeds. Nest sites vary with location; species vary but include deciduous (aspen and riparian trees) and coniferous trees, and tend to be small trees or saplings rather than mature trees.
