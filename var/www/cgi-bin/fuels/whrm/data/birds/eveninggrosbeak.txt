Distribution
much of USA and Canada, extends into parts of Mexico
General Habitat
breeds in mixed woods; in the west, mainly in mountains
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Canopy Cover
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
large trees, 40-69% canopy cover
Nestsite Characteristics
nests built on horizontal branch of tree far from the trunk; nest is a frail structure of twigs, grass, moss, roots and pine needles
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages in trees, shrubs, and sometimes on the ground
Diet
conifer seeds: fir, pine, spruce, and western red cedar; broad-leafed trees: vine maple, bigleaf maple, dogwood, willow, and oak; insects: (during breeding season) caterpillars, ants, bees, wasps, and true bugs (up to 20% of summer diet); some fruit: mountain ash, chokecherries, juniper berries, and pinion nuts; often consume dirt and gravel for minerals and salts
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
less abundant in low shrub-stage clearcuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995)
Sources of Information used in the Model

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.
