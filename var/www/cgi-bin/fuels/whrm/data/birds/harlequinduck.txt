Distribution
northeastern Canada and from Alaska south to Wyoming for breeding, rocky Atlantic and Pacific coasts in winter
General Habitat
winter in coastal areas, migrate inland to nest along swiftly flowing mountain streams
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Canopy Cover
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
streams in mature to old-growth forest or areas with shrubby riparian vegetation and young PSME overstory
Nestsite Characteristics
on the edge of swift-flowing mountain streams; could be impacted if logging removes habitat or alters stream flow/siltation; use areas with dense understory vegetation including shrubs, forbs, seedlings and saplings; may nest in woody debris or snags
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forage while walking on the bottom of swift streams; search among rocks for food, and dive (3 - 5 ft deep) for food as well
Diet
crustaceans, mollusks (chitons, chink shells, perwinkles, top shells, limpets, and blue mussels), aquatic insects (stone flies, etc.),  echinoderms, and fish
Predators
bald eagle, seals, river otters, mustelids, hawks, owls, common raven, red squirrel
Shelter Habitats
use dense understory vegetation and woody debris on streambanks; roosts in groups on rocks, gravel bars, or on logs
Response to Disturbance
Harlequin ducks are sensitive to human disturbance along stream edges, and their habitat may be degraded or modified when streambanks or channel characteristics are modified. They are especially sensitive to increased sedimentation, which impacts their macroinvertebrate diet (MacCallum 2001).

Study Location: eastern Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: primarily PIPO
Summary: The authors review the habitat needs of bird species of concern in eastern Oregon and Washington, focusing on how disturbances (natural and anthropogenic) would alter habitat for these species.

Study Location: Alberta
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Harlequin ducks breed in swift flowing, clear mountain streams. Nests are placed on streambanks in areas of dense understory vegetation. Nests may be placed amidst woody debris or snags in close proximity to streams. Harlequin ducks are sensitive to human disturbance along stream edges, and their habitat may be degraded or modified when streambanks or channel characteristics are modified. They are especially sensitive to increased sedimentation, which impacts their macroinvertebrate diet.

Study Location: throughout range
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Birds of North America species account for the harlequin duck. A sea duck that uses clear, fast-flowing rivers and streams for breeding. Chooses streams with high levels of vegetative cover along bank. Feeds within stream. Will roost in groups on rocks, gravel bars, or on logs. Nests on the ground, on small cliff ledges, in tree cavities, or on stumps. Usually will nest in areas with good cover, near base of shrub, log, or tree.
