Distribution
forested regions of North America
General Habitat
mature (>150 years old) forest types with high levels of canopy cover (>40%)
Home or Activity Range
1400- 21000 ac (O'Neil et al. 2001)
Canopy Cover
high canopy cover at nest sites (Moore and Henny 1983, Reynolds 1983, (>50%) Reynolds et al. 1992,  (66%) Siders and Kennedy 1996, Squires and Ruggiero 1996, Clough 2000); breeding males preferred high canopy cover; occurrence linked to tree canopy cover > 48% (Beier and Drennan 1997)
Specific Habitat Preferences
mature forest, high canopy cover, steep slopes, snags, coarse woody debris, proximity to quiet, ephemeral streams or ponds
Nestsite Characteristics
nest site a factor of both forest structure and territoriality; nest in large trees and areas with a high density of large trees, high tree canopy cover and basal area. Nest areas are usually cool, shady slopes or canyon sides and are often near streams. Clough 2000 found high shrub density in nest stands, while Crocker-Bedford (1990) and Finn et al. (2002) found low density of shrubs
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forage below the forest canopy; forest structure more important than prey abundance- use areas of high canopy closure, high total tree density, and high large tree density; patches of dense, large (>18" dbh) trees and snags >18" dbh; high canopy cover >70%; forest openings (<2 acre); large downed logs (>12"); open understory (low shrub cover); food availability enhanced by mature trees, downed wood, snags, and small forest openings.  Some prey species prefer high herbaceous and shrub cover, whereas others do not.
Diet
forest birds and mammals; includes: snowshoe hare, red squirrel, Columbian ground squirrel, golden-mantled ground squirrel, northern flying squirrel, northern pocket gopher, mountain cottontail, voles, blue grouse, ruffed grouse, gray jays, northern flicker, common raven, Clark's nutcracker, Townsend's solitaire, dark-eyed junco, American robin
Predators
great-horned owls prey on young, larger hawks
Shelter Habitats
dense trees, high canopy closure; dense, large trees (>18" dbh) and trees 1-4.9" dbh provide hiding cover for fledglings
Response to Disturbance
Even with nest buffers, nest occupancy dropped by 80% and nestling production by 94% within 10 years of logging (Crocker-Bedford 1990),  other raptors replaced goshawks in most logged territories, but not in unlogged controls (Crocker-Bedford 1990); it is suggested that logging degrades foraging habitat by decrease canopy of large trees and promoting development of dense brush, sapling and pole understory. Therefore, thinning from below may improve goshawk habitat by improving prey densities and foraging habitat (Crocker-Bedford 1990); disturbance or management strategies that result in the death or removal of nesting trees or a reduction in stand density and canopy closure would be detrimental (reviewed in Bull and Wales 2001); more abundant in low shrub-stage clearcuts, less abundant in high shrub-stage clearcuts and equally common in pole-stage clearcuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995)

Study Location: Coconino and Kaibab National Forests, northern Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO overstory
Summary: Within an established home range, northern goshawks apparently do not select summer foraging sites based on prey abundance; they appear to select foraging sites based on forest structure. They selected sites with higher canopy closure, greater tree density, and greater large tree density than contrast plots. Specific recommendations are made for managing PP forests to provide both foraging habitat for northern goshawks and habitat that promotes prey abundance.

Habitat Description: chose areas where goshawks nested in PIPO
Summary: Habitat preferences and home range information was gathered for male goshawks in the breeding season. Some birds used closed canopy forests and woodland > 200m from an edge more than expected, and open canopy forest and areas with a high diversity of categories more than expected.

Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME, PICO, ABLA, PIEN, PIAL
Summary: Nesting habitat selection and productivity for northern goshawks was assessed at five different scales: landscape, post-fledgling family area, nest stand, nest-tree area, and nest tree proper. Goshawks selected for a core area of mature forest that was surrounded by denser, smaller-sized trees. PSME and PICO covertypes were selected for. At post-fledgling areas, preferred characters included a northerly aspect, high canopy closure, and fewer clearcut harvest areas. At the nest-stand scale, preferred characters included greater canopy closure, greater shrub cover, less wood litter, and greater density of large-sized trees. At the nest-tree area, preferred characters included greater total plant cover, greater canopy closure, large tree density, and less sapling density. Nest-trees had larger diameters and greater height to the lowest limb than random trees. At the landscape scale, nests were closer to forest openings and edges and at lower elevations than available habitat. Number of young fledged was negatively correlated with the size of the non-forested opening near the nest and sapling densities in nest stands, and was positively correlated with the density of large-sized trees in nest-tree areas.

Habitat Description:  PIPO, white fir, sub-alpine fir, PSME, Engelmann spruce, blue spruce, and quaking aspen. 
Summary: Goshawk nesting density appeared to be closely associated with dense overstories and open understories.  Authors suggest that thinning shrubs, saplings and small poles, while maintaining or enhancing the canopy of large trees may improve habitat.  Buffers around nests in harvested PP forests were ineffective as nests were abandoned. The authors suggest protecting more than just nest trees, particularly post-fledging habitat and home range stands.

Study Location: Olympic Peninsula, WA
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: Paper quantifies habitat structure, composition, and configuration at three spatial scales corresponding to nest area, post-fledging area, and home range of goshawks.  Occupancy was associated with high proportion of late-seral forest with at least some trees > 53 cm dbh and > 70% canopy closure. Large tree canopies and low shrub cover were good predictors of stand level occupancy.

Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: northeastern Oregon
Habitat Description: PIPO, PICO, ABGR, ABLA, LAOC
Summary: Habitat data were collected around northern goshawk, sharp-shinned hawk and Cooper's hawk nest sites. Cooper's and sharp-shinned hawks commonly nested in younger successional stages than the goshawk, preferring high density of foliage in layers from 3-15 m. Cooper's hawks preferred northern aspects and often used mistletoe growth as a nest platform, which may explain their preference for PSME. Goshawks preferred nesting in PSME and LAOC and sometimes used snags. All species avoided PICO. All three species had high canopy coverage over nest sites (88.1-97.9%).

Study Location: Kaibab National Forest, northern Arizona
Habitat Description: pinyon-juniper woodlands/PIPO, PIPO, mixed conifer, spruce, deciduous, open areas
Summary: Models were created to predict the location of northern goshawk nests. Forest predictors of nest locations included canopy closure, basal area, proportion of basal area in a variety of tree species, maximum height of understory vegetation, and the presence/absence of seedlings and saplings. As potential nesting spaces were abundant and not filled, the authors suggest that territoriality also plays a role in nest location (average minimum distance between active nests=1.6 km). Territorial density may be a factor of prey abundance, quality, and accessibility. Ultimate choice of nest location was probably constrained by the availability of high potential locations within spaces defined by neighboring territories. The modeling technique could be applied to other study areas where vertebrate densities and the spatial resolution of habitat data may differ from this study, provided that new point process and pairwise potential models are developed for each area.

Study Location: western and eastern Oregon
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: Nest sites of the three accipiter species had similar physiographic but dissimilar vegetative structures. Most nests were on moderate slopes with northerly exposures and were near quiet ephemeral streams or ponds, with nest trees located on the lower portions of the slope near the water. Most nest sites had high canopy closure and tree density. The major difference between accipiter species was related to stand age, with the sharp-shinned hawks preferring 25-50 year old stands, Cooper's hawks preferring 30-70 year old stands, and goshawks preferring >150 year old stands for nesting. Goshawks demonstrated much higher and longer nest fidelity than the other two species. Home ranges for the three species were also documented. The author states that management for these three accipiter species needs to include not only potential nest sites but the stands surrounding them, including upslope habitat and riparian areas if they are present. Sites should not be isolated by silvicultural treatments. Nesting habitat for the two smaller accipiters is temporally unstable, as these species use younger stands that change quickly through time. Therefore, the suitability of some areas as accipiter habitat may not be long-term, or may progress from the preferred habitat of one species to that of another. The author outlines specific densities of nesting sites.

Summary: Distribution of nests and nesting success was determined for three accipiter species. Accipiter hawks nested in eastern, western, and southwestern Oregon. Two areas were intensely studies for nest site characteristics. An analysis of hatching success, fledgling success, and number of nests that were successful showed that Sharp-shinned hawks suffered the greatest losses during the incubation period, and Cooper's Hawks and Goshawks during the nestling period.

Summary: Nesting habitat for goshawks is described at three spatial scales: nest tree, nest tree area, and nest stand. Goshawks selected larger trees at both the nest tree and nest stand level. Nest trees were taller and had a greater dbh than trees in random stands. Tree density was lower in nest stands than random stands, though large tree density was higher. Nest stands were in even-aged, single-storied mature forest with high canopy closure and clear forest floors. Because this forest type is not typical of the multi-storied forest type usually designated as suitable goshawk habitat, special considerations should be made to include this forest in goshawk management. Techniques for creating or enhancing goshawk habitat in this region are outlined.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.
