Distribution
Rocky Mountain chain south into Mexico; common in southern and central Rockies and Great Basin mountains
General Habitat
open pine and pine-oak woodlands and edges; higher elevation subalpine meadows and shrubby areas with nearby forest
Home or Activity Range
0.5-2 ac (O'Neil et al. 2001)
Canopy Cover
open canopy (Szaro and Balda 1986)
Specific Habitat Preferences
proximity to mountain streams and flower patches
Nestsite Characteristics
nests in horizontal tree branch or fork, usually near or over mountain streams
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages in foliage for nectar
Diet
plucks insects and spiders from webs, also eats nectar and sap
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
more abundant on logged plots  (Szaro and Balda 1986); favored 1-2 years post-fire due to abundant nutrients, vigorous herbaceous growth and seed production (Johnson and Wauer 1996); more abundant in low shrub- and high shrub-stage clearcuts and partial cuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); highest density on irregular strip shelterwood and severely thinned plots (Szaro and Balda 1979)

Study Location: throughout range
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Birds of North America species account for the broad-tailed hummingbird. Most abundant in open subalpine meadows and shrubby habitats with nearby forests. Depends on nectar obtained from forbs and insects. Nests on low conifer branches or at or near the canopy of aspens. May also nest in willows, alders, cottonwoods or scrub oaks.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Bird species diversity and species richness were not significantly affected by forest cutting and logging except in a clearcut treatment. Bird population densities significantly increased on silviculturally cut and irregular strip shelterwood plots and significantly decreased  on the severely thinned and clearcut plots. Impact on individual species is discussed.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Seasonal avian communities were examined for their response to weather condition and treatment (logging) effects. While birds responded to climate, most notably precipitation, treatment effects appeared to be more influential. Species preferring open habitat (rock wren, American robin, western wood pee-wee and western bluebird) were highest on medium and heavy cut stands. Treated stands also had the highest abundance of chipping sparrows, broad-tailed hummingbirds, Grace's warbler, and dark-eyed juncos. Species preferring dense foliage (western flycatcher, pygmy nuthatch, red-faced warbler, hermit thrush, black-headed grosbeak) were less abundant in modified habitats.

Study Location: Colorado
Habitat Description: aspen and conifer forest
Summary: The author investigated the relationship between flowering of key nectar plants and hummingbird reproduction in Colorado. Nests were commonly built on the outskirts of aspen forests, or else in conifers close to streams. Nests were built and placed to take advantage of flowering in forb species.
