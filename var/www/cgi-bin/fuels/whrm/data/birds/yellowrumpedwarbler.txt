Airola, Daniel A.; Barrett, Reginald H. 1985. Foraging and habitat relationships of insect-gleaning birds in a Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forest. Condor. 87:205-216.

Study Location: central Sierra Nevada, California
Habitat Description: PIPO, PILA, ABCO, PSME, CADE, QUKE
Summary: Foraging habitat preferences, niche relationships, patterns of relative abundance vs. niche breadth and differences between migrant and resident species were examined for 12 species of insect gleaning birds in the Sierras. Tree species, and to a lesser extent, tree height were used selectively by the guild. Incense-cedar was avoided by all species, while other tree species were preferred by individual or groups of gleaners. In differentiating between niche of each species, foraging site was the most important foraging characteristic, followed by tree species, foraging technique, and foraging height. No correlation was found between niche breadth and species abundance, though a positive correlation existed for all 5 resident species.

Study Location: Uinta Mountains, Utah
Habitat Description: PICO as main overstory tree; also includes PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Birds were censused in wet and dry meadows, mature and stagnated PICO stands, and regenerating PICO stands (17 and 37 years post-clearcut). The richest avifauna was found in the dry meadows. While a few birds were adversely affected by the clearcutting, many individual species were more numerous in the clearcuts, and the overall number of species was similar.

Study Location: Black Hills, South Dakota
Habitat Description: PIPO, pine-grassland savannah
Summary: Bird and deer mouse abundance was examined 1 and 2 years post-prescribed fire. Bird species composition was similar between burned and control plots. However, 7 bird species (American robin, Mountain bluebird, Solitary vireo, Yellow-rumped warbler, Western tanager, Dark-eyed junco, Chipping sparrow) were more abundant on burned plots the first year post-fire. In the second year post-fire, only one species was more abundant on the burns (Vesper sparrow), while 2 were more common on the controls (American robin, red-breasted nuthatch). Deer mice were similarly more abundant on burned plots the first year post-fire, but were not so the second year. The major difference in vegetation post-fire was the reduction of litter and small pines in the burned areas. The authors attribute the observed patterns of wildlife abundance to a temporary increase in the quantity or quality of local food supply as opposed to the documented changes in vegetative structure.

Bosma, Andrew. 1993. Foraging site selection by insectivorous forest birds in western Montana. Missoula, MT: University of Montana. 76 p. M.A.Thesis.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME
Summary: Foraging habitat was described for four species of insectivorous birds (gray jay, western tanager, yellow-rumped warbler, chipping sparrow), including foraging tree species, dbh, and estimated insect frass. The influence of potential competitors was also examined. Foraging site selection for all birds but the gray jay was most influenced by tree species (PIPO selected), which the author attributes to a greater abundance of food. Competitor presence did not clearly influence selection. Birds also selected large trees. Annual variation existed in foraging habitat patterns.

Study Location: Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO, PIST, PSME, aspen, ABCO, PIEN
Summary: Tree species preferences were analyzed for 5 species of birds on logged and unlogged forest. Niche widths and bird densities are given for the individual species. In unlogged forest, the entire avifauna indicated preferences for PSME, ABCO, and PIEN. PIPO, PIST, and snags were not used to the extent to which they were available. In the logged area, avian use of aspen, PIPO, and PIST was less than expected, while PSME and PIEN were preferred. Overall, the unaltered sites supported a considerably larger avian community. The mountain chickadee, ruby-crowned kinglet, and yellow-rumped warbler were more numerous on unlogged sites, while the yellow-bellied sapsucker and the gray-headed junco were more numerous on logged sites. The brown creeper was entirely missing from logged sites.

Study Location: Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PSME and PIPO dominated
Summary: Birds were significantly more abundant in unlogged plots than modified plots, while composition overlapped. Species richness was more influenced by year than treatment. Birds gleaning on foliage or timber were most adversely affected by logging. Ground or slash foragers were much more abundant in harvested plots. Aerial foragers and most flycatchers were more abundant on logged plots. Cup nesting species were more abundant on unlogged plots.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: western Montana and northern Wyoming
Habitat Description: range of habitat types: includes PIPO, PSME, LAOC, PICO, PIAL, PIFL, Picea sp,, ABLA, ABGR, THPL, aspen, cottonwood
Summary: Fifteen bird species are generally more abundant in early post-fire communities than in any other cover type in the northern Rockies (includes olive-sided flycatcher, three-toed woodpecker, black-backed woodpecker, Clark's nutcracker, mountain bluebird, red crossbill, Cassin's finch, pine siskin, American robin, dark-eyed junco, yellow-rumped warbler). Six species (common nighthawk, calliope hummingbird, northern flicker, Stellar's jay, orange-crowned warbler, chipping sparrow) were most abundant in stands 10-40 years post-fire. Three species (American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, dark-eyed junco) were detected in early an mid-successional burned forest 100% of the time. One species, the black-backed woodpecker, was restricted to standing dead forest created by stand-replacing fires. Bird communities are different in recently burned forest, primarily because members of three feeding guilds (woodpeckers, flycatchers, and seedeaters) are especially abundant. Larger-diameter (>10 cm dbh) PP, DF, and LAOC were most often used for feeding by woodpeckers. Standing, fire-killed trees were used by the majority of birds nesting in recently burned forest. Many of the structures used in nesting (broken-topped snags) were present before the fire. Large-scale, stand-replacing fire may be necessary for long-term maintenance of many bird populations. Commentary is offered on the need to alter present fire and post-fire forest management.

Study Location: Bandelier National Monument, NM
Habitat Description: PIPO, montane meadow, mixed conifer, pinyon-juniper
Summary: Breeding birds were surveyed before and for many years after a wildfire in Bandelier National Monument. Species diversity increased after the fire, but breeding populations in general declined for several years before increasing above prefire levels. This pattern was more pronounced on severely burned forest. In all but the severely burned forest, breeding bird diversity and populations were higher than prefire levels 14 years after the wildfire. Patterns are presented for different foraging and nesting guilds, as well as some individual species (including particular habitat changes that impacted bird species).

Study Location: southeastern Wyoming
Habitat Description: PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Forest cutting has resulted in an increase in forest edges and reduction in forest continuity. Avian communities in uncut forests and those fragmented by small clearcuts were compared. Overall, stands interrupted by small clearcuts had a similar species composition to paired uncut stands. Brown creepers and hermit thrushes were most negatively impacted by fragmentation, while pine siskins were the most positively influenced by fragmentation. This study also examined how bird species were distributed in relation to forest interiors and edges. Distribution of birds among forest edges and interiors were not consistent with preferences for forest edges and interiors.

Study Location: Idaho
Habitat Description: PSME, PIPO
Summary: Populations of birds and small mammals were monitored in conjunction with a single-tree selection logging operation. Total numbers of breeding birds remained relatively stable, but some individual species responded either positively or negatively to the treatment. Timber gleaners were the only feeding guild adversely affected by the logging treatment. Secondary cavity nesters were the only nesting guild adversely affected by the logging treatment. The most notable small mammal response was the positive response of yellow-pine chipmunks to the treatment. Fewer deer mice were found in the treatment area.

Study Location: southwestern Montana
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Avian species composition and abundance were examined in old-growth, mature, and harvested PSME forest. The greatest total abundance was detected in the old-growth forest. In general, the old-growth contained the greatest number of species, though there was no detected difference in species richness between the stand types. Higher elevation old-growth stands contained a greater abundance of birds than the lower elevation old-growth stands. Trees with cavities were also examined in this study. The majority of cavity trees were old PSME with broken tops, and cavities tended to be located in the top one-third of the tree. Some primary and secondary cavity-nesting birds demonstrated dbh preferences for nest trees.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: PSME, LAOC, PICO, PIEN, PIPO, ABLA, ABGR, THPL, PIMO, aspen, birch
Summary: A comparison of bird communities was performed between control sites and those undergoing traditional overstory removal harvests and those harvested using "New Forestry" techniques. Only four species showed significant differences in abundance between treatments, though the author suspects that other trends in the data would be clearer with additional post-treatment data. In general, for species that did differ in abundance, numbers in New Forestry stands were intermediate between overstory removal and controls. Foliage foragers declined similarly in both harvest types, while ground foragers increased. Conifer nesters decreased similarly in both harvest types, while ground nesters increased. Important habitat variables for a number of species are given.

Study Location: Blue Mountains, OR
Habitat Description: ABGR
Summary: This case history (1) evaluates bird-habitat relationships in primarily grand fir forests. The goals of this study were to assess how forest stand structure influences habitat selection by birds, to investigate bird use of specific forest structural classes, and to relate bird habitat use to potential management options that consider breeding bird habitat.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Bird species diversity and species richness were not significantly affected by forest cutting and logging except in a clearcut treatment. Bird population densities significantly increased on silviculturally cut and irregular strip shelterwood plots and significantly decreased  on the severely thinned and clearcut plots. Impact on individual species is discussed.

Study Location: Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks, Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO, ABLA/PIEN
Summary: Bird density, composition, and diversity were monitored across a series of fire severities in burned PICO or spruce-fir forest in Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks. Highest populations and greatest biomass occurred from 5-29 years post-fire. Density, composition, and diversity on moderately burned spruce-fir-PICO were more like those on unburned spruce-fir than other seral stages. Changes in bird communities by feeding category were also examined. Overall, canopy closure was a habitat variable that appeared to affect avifauna more than the presence of fire.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.
