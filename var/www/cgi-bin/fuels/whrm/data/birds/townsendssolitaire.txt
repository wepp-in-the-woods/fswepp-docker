Distribution
western N. America
General Habitat
fairly common in open coniferous forests on high mountain slopes; in winter, also in wooded valleys, canyons, wherever juniper berries are available
Home or Activity Range
6-50 ac (O'Neil et al. 2001)
Canopy Cover
stands with 0-39% canopy closure (Verner 1980)
Specific Habitat Preferences
pole-large trees, 0-39% canopy cover, edge habitat, heterogeneous landscapes
Nestsite Characteristics
nests on ground, usually protected by some sort of overhang; commonly uses cutbanks of roads
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
perch from which to swoop down on insects near ground; feed by flycatching, tree trunk feeding, ground predation
Diet
insects, juniper berries in winter, other fruits and fleshy seeds
Predators
common raven (on nestlings)
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
more abundant in low shrub- and high-shrub stage clearcuts and less abundant in partial cuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); found in stands as mature "yellow" PIPO densities increased to 8 trees/acre (Keller 1992)

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: Bandelier National Monument, NM
Habitat Description: PIPO, montane meadow, mixed conifer, pinyon-juniper
Summary: Breeding birds were surveyed before and for many years after a wildfire in Bandelier National Monument. Species diversity increased after the fire, but breeding populations in general declined for several years before increasing above prefire levels. This pattern was more pronounced on severely burned forest. In all but the severely burned forest, breeding bird diversity and populations were higher than prefire levels 14 years after the wildfire. Patterns are presented for different foraging and nesting guilds, as well as some individual species (including particular habitat changes that impacted bird species).

Study Location: Coconino and Kaibab National Forest, northern Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: The overstory of mature PIPO forest and the presence of snags influenced bird communities in pole-sized PIPO stands in northern Arizona. Study areas containing pure pole-sized trees and no snags had the lowest numbers of insectivorous birds; study areas with the most insectivorous bird diversity contained at least 14 mature PIPO trees/acre and at least 2 snags/acre. The greatest number of birds were detected in stands containing 8-10 mature PIPO trees/acre and no snags. PIPO overstory also influenced both coniferous forest-nesting birds and primary cavity-nesting birds. The presence of snags influenced secondary cavity-nesters. Overall, this study suggests that a homogenous forest of young PIPO stands lacking in snags is not desirable for maintaining healthy bird species diversity.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: pinyon-juniper-PIPO ecotone
Summary: Aspects of winter territories of Townsend's soliataires were investigated. Each territory contained at least one tall PIPO, where solitaires spent about 43% of their time perched. Territories were maintained in primary foraging habitat, which contained JUMO trees with plentiful berries.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: mixed conifer; includes: PSME, PIPO, PICO, LAOC, ABLA, PIEN, aspen, cottonwood
Summary: Natural history of the Townsend's solitaire in western Montana. Includes information on habitat, feeding behavior, territoriality, and nesting. Solitaires occupied open coniferous forests with low to moderate ground cover. Nests were most often found on road cutbanks.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.
