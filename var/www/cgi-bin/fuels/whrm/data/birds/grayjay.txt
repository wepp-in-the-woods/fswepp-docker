Distribution
Canada and Alaska, northern Great Lakes states and New England, along Rocky Mountain chain and parts of Washington, Oregon, and northern California
General Habitat
conifer and mixed-conifer forests
Home or Activity Range
160-360 ac (O'Neil et al. 2001)
Specific Habitat Preferences
homogenous landscapes, trees for nesting, roosting, and caching food
Nestsite Characteristics
nests on horizontal limb near trunk or in crotch of conifer; nest lined with moss, grass, sticks, bark, feathers, and fur
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages on ground, on shrubs and understory vegetation, on tree boles/bark, within canopy, and form the air; stores food in forks of tree branches, behind lichens, or bark, or in coniferous foliage (food stores are used in winter and to feed nestlings)
Diet
feeds on a wide variety of carrion, bird eggs and nestlings, berries, insects, centipedes, spiders, fungi. 
Predators
Mexican spotted owl, falcons and short-winged hawks, owls; nestlings eaten by squirrels, martens, porcupines, raccoons, ravens, crows, other jays
Shelter Habitats
roosts close to trunk of densely foliated trees
Response to Disturbance
less abundant in low shrub- and high shrub-stage clearcuts and partially cut forest and equally common in pole-stage clearcuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); found more in unburned controls compared to stands burned by stand-replacement wildfire (Kreisel and Stein 1999)

Bosma, Andrew. 1993. Foraging site selection by insectivorous forest birds in western Montana. Missoula, MT: University of Montana. 76 p. M.A.Thesis.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME
Summary: Foraging habitat was described for four species of insectivorous birds (gray jay, western tanager, yellow-rumped warbler, chipping sparrow), including foraging tree species, dbh, and estimated insect frass. The influence of potential competitors was also examined. Foraging site selection for all birds but the gray jay was most influenced by tree species (PIPO selected), which the author attributes to a greater abundance of food. Competitor presence did not clearly influence selection. Birds also selected large trees. Annual variation existed in foraging habitat patterns.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: northeast Washington
Habitat Description: mixed conifer, includes: PSME, PIPO, ABLA, PIEN, LAOC, PICO
Summary: This study examined bird use of burned and unburned forest in the winter season. Species richness was similar, but composition was distinctly different. Composition and abundance also changed with time; some species disappeared from the area while others moved in. Trunk and branch foraging species were more abundant in burned forest, though their abundance significantly decreased from the first to the fourth winter post-fire. Foraging behavior was documented for four woodpecker species within the burned area. Foraging took place on snags > 23 cm dbh.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: PSME, LAOC, PICO, PIEN, PIPO, ABLA, ABGR, THPL, PIMO, aspen, birch
Summary: A comparison of bird communities was performed between control sites and those undergoing traditional overstory removal harvests and those harvested using "New Forestry" techniques. Only four species showed significant differences in abundance between treatments, though the author suspects that other trends in the data would be clearer with additional post-treatment data. In general, for species that did differ in abundance, numbers in New Forestry stands were intermediate between overstory removal and controls. Foliage foragers declined similarly in both harvest types, while ground foragers increased. Conifer nesters decreased similarly in both harvest types, while ground nesters increased. Important habitat variables for a number of species are given.

Study Location: throughout range
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Birds of North America species account for the gray jay. Common in boreal and sup-alpine coniferous forests; spruce species often present. Stores food items on trees by attaching them with saliva. Roost close to trunk of tree with dense foliage. Nests in areas close to an opening, using a variety of tree species.

Ward Jr., James P.; Block, William M. 1995. Mexican spotted owl prey ecology. Chapter 5. In Recovery Plan for the Mexican Spotted Owl. Vol II. Albuquerque, New Mexico: USDI Fish and Wildlife Service. pp 1-48.

Study Location: range of Mexican spotted owl; case studies in northern Arizona and New Mexico
Habitat Description: not stated; PIPO
Summary: Literature review and synthesis of data from past studies concerning the ecology of prey of the Mexican Spotted Owl, including information on owl diet, identification of prey that might influence owl fitness, and quantification of habitat correlates of prey species. The authors found variation in diet regionally. Reproductive success of spotted owls was not linked to any single prey species, rather to many species in combination, or total prey biomass. However, certain species may be more important in specific regions. Overall, food resources were quite variable among vegetation communities and through time. Owl food is most abundant during the summer when young are being raised. Prey biomass decreases in late fall and early winter. Habitat correlates are presented from one study in northern Arizona (deer mouse, brush mouse, Mexican woodrat) and one in New Mexico.
