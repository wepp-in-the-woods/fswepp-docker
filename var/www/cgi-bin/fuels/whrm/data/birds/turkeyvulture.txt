Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Birds of North America species account for the turkey vulture. Prefers farmland with pasture and abundant carrion close to undisturbed forested areas for perching, roosting, and nesting. Will nest in dark recesses beneath boulders, on cliff ledges, in hollow trees, logs, and stumps, and in abandoned buildings. 91% of western nests were found on rocky cliffs or slopes. In the west, typically roosts in large trees like cottonwood, or on rock outcrops. Roost trees are usually mature, and occur in semi-open forest.

Study Location: review of western Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: intensively managed and unmanaged PSME
Summary: A comprehensive review of the importance of snags as wildlife trees in managed and unmanaged PSME forests. Includes information on the ecological role of snags and cavity users, wildlife snag requirements, snag management, and guidelines for selecting wildlife trees to meet logging safety requirements. Much detail is presented on calculated the number of snags needed to maintain specific densities of cavity-users. Forestry practices that impact snag production and retention are also outlined. The economic role of snags and cavity-using wildlife is addressed.
