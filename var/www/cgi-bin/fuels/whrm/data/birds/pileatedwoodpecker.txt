# Literature
Distribution
much of Canada, northern and eastern USA and along north-central Pacific coast
General Habitat
Older coniferous stands; have been documented feeding and nesting in clearcuts in Alberta
Home or Activity Range
250-2500 ac (O'Neil et al. 2001)
Canopy Cover
&gt 60% canopy closure in forest surrounding roost trees (Bull et al. 1992); prefers high canopy closure (Higgelke and MacLeod 2000)
Specific Habitat Preferences
large-diameter snags and logs, large trees, >40% canopy cover
Nestsite Characteristics
large diameter snags, live trees with intermediate heart-rot; snags with little bark, few limbs, and broken tops
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
large diameter snags and logs; living trees with partial heartwood decay
Diet
Ants (up to 75% of diet), fruits, nuts, sap
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
roost in internal hollow chambers of dead or live trees- reduces risk of predation by raptors and thermal exposure; need tree trunks available to flitter around when flushed by potential predator; high canopy closure helps avoid avian predators
Response to Disturbance
lower % occurrence in clearcuts without snags (Marcot 1983); decreased in abundance in cutover forest; occurred infrequently in managed vs. old growth forest (Mannan and Meslow 1984); less abundant in low shrub- and high shrub- stage clearcuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); not found in stands burned by stand-replacement wildfire, found in unburned controls (Kreisel and Stein 1999)

Study Location:  northeastern Oregon
Habitat Description:  PP, PP/DF, DF/PP/ABGR, DF/LAOC/ABGR
Summary:  Pileated woodpecker habitat should include mature, mixed conifer forest with > 2 canopy layers, large live trees, large dead trees, and downed woody material. Size of nest and roost trees appears to be the one of the most important considerations. Ponderosa pine and western larch snags were preferred species for nesting in this study area. Because pileated excavate a new nest cavity every year and use multiple roosts, the retention of many snags in an area is important.

Study Location:  northeastern Oregon
Habitat Description: mixed-conifer: PP, DF, ABGR, LAOC, LP
Summary:  Characteristics of roost trees were examined for the pileated woodpecker. Roosts occurred in both large live and dead trees. Live trees often had evidence of fungal infection or were wounded. Roost trees were found in mature or old growth forest that had not been logged. Multiple roosts were used by individuals. The authors point out that different trees are used for roosting as compared to nesting; nest trees were larger, were dead trees, and had fewer entrances than roost trees. Therefore, managers need to consider a variety of trees to encompass those used by woodpeckers for various functions. A formula is presented to calculate the number of trees to leave as roosts within a pileated woodpecker management area.

Study Location:  California
Habitat Description:  variety- coniferous and deciduous
Summary: Decay and mortality characteristics were described for pileated woodpecker nest trees. All cavities in Pinaceae and hardwood trees were associated with early stages of decay. 100% of nesting cavities in PP (n=9) and DF (n=4) were found in snags with broken tops. Nest cavity sites were selected based on the structural quality of the wood and not simply because the tree was dead. The author suggests the retention of "hard" snags and does not recommend creation of snags by artificial means because such methods may not achieve the requisite decay conditions for pileated woodpecker nest trees.

Summary: A habitat suitability model is constructed for Pileated woodpeckers, assigning values for foraging, cover and nesting habitat to each 25 m pixel of forested habitat. A 2000 ha home range is used.

Study Location:  northwestern California	
Habitat Description: DF forest
Summary:  Bird abundance was compared in clearcut DF forests where snags had been retained or removed. Nine species of primary and secondary cavity-nesting birds had a lower mean detection rate and percent occurrence in clearcuts where snags had been removed. One species, the chestnut-backed chickadee, increased in mean detection rate and percent occurrence in clearcuts without snags. The authors hypothesize that most cavity nesters shifted nesting to neighboring stands and used clearcut areas for foraging.

Study Location:  northwestern Montana
Habitat Description:  LAOC, DF
Summary: Characteristics of nest-hole trees are described. Nesters clearly preferred LAOC over DF. PP was also preferred, though it was not abundant in the study area. Nearly as many live trees as dead snags were used. Average dbh of nest trees for a variety of species is listed. Some species, such as pileated woodpeckers and American kestrels, used only a small range of tree diameters, while others, like the yellow-bellied sapsucker and red-breasted nuthatch, were found in a variety of tree sizes.

Study Location:  western Oregon
Habitat Description: DF forest 
Summary:  Home range and habitat use were examined for the pileated woodpecker in western Oregon. Nests and roosts were located in large trees only in forests > 70 years of age. The authors suggest that the pileated woodpecker is not a good indicator of mature/old-growth forest in western Oregon because it often uses immature stands.

Study Location:  review of western Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: intensively managed and unmanaged DF
Summary: A comprehensive review of the importance of snags as wildlife trees in managed and unmanaged DF forests. Includes information on the ecological role of snags and cavity users, wildlife snag requirements, snag management, and guidelines for selecting wildlife trees to meet logging safety requirements. Much detail is presented on calculated the number of snags needed to maintain specific densities of cavity-users. Forestry practices that impact snag production and retention are also outlined. The economic role of snags and cavity-using wildlife is addressed.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PP/DF
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.
