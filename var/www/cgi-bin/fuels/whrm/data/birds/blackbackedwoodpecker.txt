Study Location: Deschutes National Forest, Oregon
Habitat Description: Primarily PICO
Summary: Three-toed and black-backed woodpeckers were studied in areas infested by epidemic levels of mountain pine beetle. Habitat preferences in regard to home range, nesting, roosting, and foraging were examined for LP-dominated forests. As these woodpecker species use trees with heartrot for nests, diseased trees or decaying snags for roosts, and decaying substrate for foraging, the management of these species is tied to the maintenance of disease and decay. Areas of LP forest should remain exempt from commercial and salvage timber management to retain a mature or overmature habitat as long as possible. Inference for this study is limited, as local conditions were extreme and few animals were radio-tagged.

Study Location: western Montana and northern Wyoming
Habitat Description: range of habitat types: includes PIPO, PSME, LAOC, PICO, PIAL, PIFL, Picea sp,, ABLA, ABGR, THPL, aspen, cottonwood
Summary: Fifteen bird species are generally more abundant in early post-fire communities than in any other cover type in the northern Rockies (includes olive-sided flycatcher, three-toed woodpecker, black-backed woodpecker, Clark's nutcracker, mountain bluebird, red crossbill, Cassin's finch, pine siskin, American robin, dark-eyed junco, yellow-rumped warbler). Six species (common nighthawk, calliope hummingbird, northern flicker, Stellar's jay, orange-crowned warbler, chipping sparrow) were most abundant in stands 10-40 years post-fire. Three species (American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, dark-eyed junco) were detected in early an mid-successional burned forest 100% of the time. One species, the black-backed woodpecker, was restricted to standing dead forest created by stand-replacing fires. Bird communities are different in recently burned forest, primarily because members of three feeding guilds (woodpeckers, flycatchers, and seedeaters) are especially abundant. Larger-diameter (>10 cm dbh) PP, DF, and LAOC were most often used for feeding by woodpeckers. Standing, fire-killed trees were used by the majority of birds nesting in recently burned forest. Many of the structures used in nesting (broken-topped snags) were present before the fire. Large-scale, stand-replacing fire may be necessary for long-term maintenance of many bird populations. Commentary is offered on the need to alter present fire and post-fire forest management.

Study Location: northeast Washington
Habitat Description: mixed conifer, includes: PSME, PIPO, ABLA, PIEN, LAOC, PICO
Summary: This study examined bird use of burned and unburned forest in the winter season. Species richness was similar, but composition was distinctly different. Composition and abundance also changed with time; some species disappeared from the area while others moved in. Trunk and branch foraging species were more abundant in burned forest, though their abundance significantly decreased from the first to the fourth winter post-fire. Foraging behavior was documented for four woodpecker species within the burned area. Foraging took place on snags > 23 cm dbh.

Study Location: review of western Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: intensively managed and unmanaged PSME
Summary: A comprehensive review of the importance of snags as wildlife trees in managed and unmanaged PSME forests. Includes information on the ecological role of snags and cavity users, wildlife snag requirements, snag management, and guidelines for selecting wildlife trees to meet logging safety requirements. Much detail is presented on calculating the number of snags needed to maintain specific densities of cavity-users. Forestry practices that impact snag production and retention are also outlined. The economic role of snags and cavity-using wildlife is addressed.

Habitat Description: PSME, PIPO, PICO, ABLA, PIEN, ABGR, LAOC, THPL (present before burn; virtually all dead at time of sampling)
Summary: Black-back woodpecker habitat use of two post-fire forests was examined in relation to prey density. A bark-sampling method of sampling insect abundance was developed. Black-backed woodpeckers selected for large and extra-large insects in foraging. Tree species preferred for foraging were not consistent between sites. Foraging trees were larger than surrounding trees, and contained more prey than randomly selected trees. However, prey densities in separate patches of a burn did not appear to determine where they foraged or nested. Prey density appears to be an important variable in habitat selection, but it is not the only factor affecting tree use by black-backed woodpeckers. Results from this study are compared with data from other studies to produce two hypotheses regarding habitat selection.

Study Location: Boise National Forest, southwestern Idaho
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME
Summary: The authors identified snag characteristics, including diameter and density, preferred by a number of cavity-nesting birds. Models of landscape-scale habitat preference were also presented for black-backed and Lewis's woodpeckers, and were consistent with findings at a smaller scale. As these two species represent opposite extremes of a continuum of habitat use amongst the birds studied, managing for these particular species will incorporate the needs of many other cavity-nesting birds.

Study Location: southwestern Idaho
Habitat Description: PIPO/PSME
Summary: The responses of nine cavity-nesting bird species to high-intensity wildfire with three post-fire treatments were studied in southwestern Idaho. In general, nesting continues increased up to four years after wildfire. Among treatments, overall densities were similar though species composition varied. All bird species selected nest sites with higher tree densities than that measured at random sites, and cavity-nesters as a group selected clumps of snags rather than snags that were retained in uniform, evenly-spaced distributions. Larger-diameter, more heavily decayed snags were chosen by cavity-nesters. Most used trees also had broken tops that pre-dated the wildfire. Also includes a table predicting the response of 11 bird species to high-intensity fire, prescribed fire with stand management, and fire suppression.

Study Location: southwestern Idaho
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME
Summary: Cavity nesting birds were grouped as strong, weak or non-excavating species. Patterns of cavity occupancy were tied to various microhabitat features as well as temporal and spatial scales. Time since fire had the greatest influence on occupancy of nest cavities for all species; site characteristics were secondarily important. Prefered snag characteristics differed by type of excavator and changed over time. The majority of cavities (80%) were not reused. Both number of cavities and number of cavity-nesting birds increased with time since fire. The authors stress the ephemeral nature of fire-created habitat.

Study Location: Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks, Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO, ABLA/PIEN
Summary: Bird density, composition, and diversity were monitored across a series of fire severities in burned PICO or spruce-fir forest in Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks. Highest populations and greatest biomass occurred from 5-29 years post-fire. Density, composition, and diversity on moderately burned spruce-fir-PICO were more like those on unburned spruce-fir than other seral stages. Changes in bird communities by feeding category were also examined. Overall, canopy closure was a habitat variable that appeared to affect avifauna more than the presence of fire.

Study Location: eastern Cascades, Washington
Habitat Description: overmature PICO-ABLA stand, mature PICO thicket
Summary: One year after a prescribed, stand-replacing fire, plant cover and diversity decreased, as did microbial respiration. Nitrogen fixation and nitrification increased after burning. Overall bird diversity increased after the fire. Diversity of woodpeckers increased the year after burning, while needle-foraging species declined or were absent after fire. There was no definitive response of small mammals to burning, though the Townsend's chipmunk did markedly decline. Forage for elk in the burn was higher in crude protein, but low productivity and distance from water diminished the value of the burned area for elk.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Stands in western Montana underwent PIPO restoration treatments that included selective tree removal followed by a prescribed burn. Bird and small mammal populations were monitored on these and control sites. While some bird species showed a preference for treated vs. untreated stands, the treatment did not have major effects on avian species composition. The foraging behavior of bark-gleaning birds was also examined on treated vs. untreated sites. Birds selectively foraged on larger trees, with PIPO preferred to PSME in this study area. Thinning and burning is compatible with providing forage substrates for the species in this area, as the encounter rate for bark-gleaners was higher in the treated sites. Small mammal communities changed in both abundance and composition as a result of treatment.
