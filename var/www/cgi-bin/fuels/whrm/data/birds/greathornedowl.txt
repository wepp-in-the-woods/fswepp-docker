Distribution
most of N. America
General Habitat
found in deciduous bottom, bunch grass, and riparian habitat types
Home or Activity Range
170-2200 ac (O'Neil et al. 2001)
Canopy Cover
to hunt and roost in areas with < 40% canopy cover (Ganey et al. 1997)
Specific Habitat Preferences
edge habitat, open areas, perch sites
Nestsite Characteristics
nests in tree cavities, snags, abandoned nests of other birds, ledges, caves, or on ground
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
hunts from perch, while walking, from the air, and over open water for waterfowl; may hawk in forest canopy for crow nestlings, but mostly forage in open habitats 
Diet
generalist: mammals 90%, birds 10%; miscellaneous amphibians, reptiles, invertebrates, insects, and worms. Mammals include voles, deer mice, bushytailed woodrats, mountain cottontails, pocket gophers, rats, rabbits, kangaroo rats, squirrels, snowshoe hares, pocket mice, weasels, jackrabbits, marmots, skunks, house cats, and opossums. Birds include coots, pheasants, gray partridges, pigeons, chickens, starlings, grouse, ducks, owls, magpie, quails, nestling hawks, crows, and rhinoceros auklets. Also feed on snakes, carps, crayfish, beetles, and Jerusalem crickets
Predators
red-tailed hawk, crows, jays, other great-horned owls
Shelter Habitats
roosts in trees, snags, thick brush, cavities, ledges and human structures; roosts in conifers throughout year
Response to Disturbance

Summaries of Specific Studies
Ganey, Joseph L.; Block, William M.; Jenness, Jeffrey S.; Wilson, Randolph A. 1997. Comparative habitat use of sympatric Mexican spotted and great horned owls. Journal of Wildlife Research. 2(2): 115-123. 

Study Location: northern Arizona
Habitat Description: primarily PIPO; also QUGA, JUDE, aspen, POAN
Summary: Mexican spotted and great horned owls overlapped considerably in home ranges, but overlap in use of individual stands was limited. In general, great horned owls used meadows and open stands (canopy cover < 40%) more than spotted owls, who roosted and foraged in stands primarily with > 40% canopy cover. Stands used by great horned owls had lower log volume, less shrub cover and canopy cover, and greater herbaceous cover than stands used by spotted owls. Opening forest stands through management would therefore likely favor great horned owls, while it would not favor spotted owls.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Frank Church Wilderness, central Idaho
Habitat Description:  PSME, PICO, PIPO, ABLA habitat type series
Summary:Resource partitioning at the macro- and microhabitat scale was studied for five abundant species of forest owls. Owls differed in habitat preferences as well as activity periods and food habits. Screech owls had the most restricted niche, while pygmy and great-horned owls were more generalist in habitat ust. Patterns of resource use was interpreted as resulting from environmental factors, morphological limitations, behavioral adaptations, and interspecific competition.

Study Location: throughout range
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Birds of North America species account for the great horned owl. Inhabits all ranges of habitat, preferring open and secondary-growth temperate woodlands, swamps, orchards, and agricultural areas. Appears to prefer more open habitat in the coniferous forests of the west. Uses open microhabitat for foraging. Roosts in trees, snags, thick brush, cavities, ledges and human structures. Roosts in conifers throughout year. Will use nests of other species, most commonly red-tailed hawks. Nests are found in cavities of trees or snags, cliffs, deserted buildings, artificial platforms.
