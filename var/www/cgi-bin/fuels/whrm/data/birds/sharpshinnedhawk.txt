Distribution
most of N. America
General Habitat
25-50 year old dense coniferous stands
Home or Activity Range
900-2000 ac (O'Neil et al. 2001)
Canopy Cover
high canopy cover over nest site (Reynolds 1983, (79%) Siders and Kennedy 1996)
Specific Habitat Preferences
dense trees, high canopy closure, proximity to quiet, ephemeral streams or ponds
Nestsite Characteristics
nests usually placed against the trunk of conifers; made of sticks and twigs and lined with strips of bark, grass, and coniferous needles; nest site characters include dense trees, high canopy closure, proximity to quiet, ephemeral streams or ponds
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
still hunts from perches, bursts through woodland to flush small birds and overtake them in flight; hunts in mature aspen, conifer and mixed forests
Diet
mostly birds (90%); occasionally small mammals, lizards, frogs, and insects. Birds: juncos, house and song sparrows, warblers, bobwhite, spotted sandpipers, morning doves, flickers, downy woodpeckers, starlings, pine siskins, house finches, fly catchers, western wood pewee, swallows, chickadees, wrens, kinglets, thrushes, vireos, nuthatches, and brown creepers. Mammals: deer mice, voles, and chipmunks. Lizards, snakes, grasshoppers, beetles, and butterflies
Predators
Great-horned owl, northern goshawk
Shelter Habitats
dense trees, high canopy closure for predator avoidance
Response to Disturbance
no information available

Study Location: throughout range
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Birds of North America species account for the sharp-shinned hawk. Breeding habitat includes dense stands with well-developed canopy in Colorado, including aspen and conifer forests.

Study Location: northeastern Oregon
Habitat Description: PIPO, PICO, ABGR, ABLA, LAOC
Summary: Habitat data were collected around northern goshawk, sharp-shinned hawk and Cooper's hawk nest sites. Cooper's and sharp-shinned hawks commonly nested in younger successional stages than the goshawk, preferring high density of foliage in layers from 3-15 m. Cooper's hawks preferred northern aspects and often used mistletoe growth as a nest platform, which may explain their preference for PSME. Goshawks preferred nesting in PSME and LAOC and sometimes used snags. All species avoided PICO. All three species had high canopy coverage over nest sites (88.1-97.9%).

Study Location: western and eastern Oregon
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: Nest sites of the three accipiter species had similar physiographic but dissimilar vegetative structures. Most nests were on moderate slopes with northerly exposures and were near quiet ephemeral streams or ponds, with nest trees located on the lower portions of the slope near the water. Most nest sites had high canopy closure and tree density. The major difference between accipiter species was related to stand age, with the sharp-shinned hawks preferring 25-50 year old stands, Cooper's hawks preferring 30-70 year old stands, and goshawks preferring >150 year old stands for nesting. Goshawks demonstrated much higher and longer nest fidelity than the other two species. Home ranges for the three species were also documented. The author states that management for these three accipiter species needs to include not only potential nest sites but the stands surrounding them, including upslope habitat and riparian areas if they are present. Sites should not be isolated by silvicultural treatments. Nesting habitat for the two smaller accipiters is temporally unstable, as these species use younger stands that change quickly through time. Therefore, the suitability of some areas as accipiter habitat may not be long-term, or may progress from the preferred habitat of one species to that of another. The author outlines specific densities of nesting sites. 

Siders, Melissa S.; Kennedy, Patricia L. 1996. Forest structural characteristics of Accipiter nesting habitat: is there an allometric relationship? The Condor. 98: 123-132.

Study Location: north-central New Mexico
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME, ABCO
Summary: The authors investigated a general correlation of accipiter body size and scaling of the vegetation components of nest sites. Nest tree height and diameter supported body size predictions about nesting habitat, while other nest-site parameters did not. Means for nest tree dbh and canopy closure at nests are given.
