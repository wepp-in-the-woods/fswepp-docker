western USA
General Habitat
considered a habitat generalist; occurs in a variety of vegetation types and readily adapts to human environments
Home or Activity Range
0-2.5 ac (O'Neil et al. 2001)
Canopy Cover
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
shrubs and non-aspen deciduous trees
Nestsite Characteristics
nest set in fork of small branch; made of plant down and spider's silk, decorated outside with small leaves and flowers; "other trees" in model include a variety of riparian deciduous trees and shrubs

feeds on nectar and insects in shrubs or understory vegetation by hovering, gleaning, and hawking; "other trees" used in model are non-aspen deciduous trees (mostly gambel oak) from Griffis-Kyle and Beier 2003
Diet
nectar from variety of plants, also insects and spiders
Predators
Bullock's and hooded orioles, gopher snake, roadrunner, Mexican jay, summer tanager, Clark's spiny lizard, brown-crested flycatcher, pygmy-owl

Study Location: throughout range
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Birds of North America species account for the black-chinned hummingbird. Inhabits a variety of habitats; considered a generalist. Often nest in mesic areas, such as stream bottoms or riparian areas; males stay in nearby xeric habitats. A variety of deciduous species are used for nesting. Needs nectar-producing flowers for feeding.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: Aspen in a PIPO matrix
Summary: This study examined the role that aspen stands in a larger forest matrix play in supporting a variety of avian species. Relative bird abundance and species richness were higher in aspen plots than in paired ponderosa pine plots. However, aspen stands did not harbor unique avian communities, suggesting that they act as important landscape elements within the ponderosa pine forest matrix. Within-patch habitat factors explained 24-46% of the variation in species richness amongst aspen stands; the only habitat factor consistently associated with species richness was sapling density (neg.). Area and isolation of aspen stands had no influence on species diversity. Management activities such as overstory thinning, burning, and fencing against ungulates are suggested to create and conserve aspen stands.
