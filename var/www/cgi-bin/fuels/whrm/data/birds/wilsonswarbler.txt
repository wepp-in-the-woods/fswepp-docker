Distribution
parts of Alaska and Canada, northern New England, western USA and along Rocky Mountain chain
General Habitat
nests in dense, moist woodlands, bogs, willow thickets, streamside tangles
Home or Activity Range
0.4-3 ac (O'Neil et al. 2001)
Canopy Cover
stands with 0- 39% canopy cover (Verner 1980)
Specific Habitat Preferences
high shrub cover, high density of large snags, shrub-seedling-sapling stage, pole-medium sized trees, 0-39% canopy cover, edge habitat, heterogeneous landscapes, deciduous understory elements
Nestsite Characteristics
nests in dense, moist woodlands, bogs, willow thickets, streamside tangles
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
mostly feeds by gleaning from foliage and twigs, less commonly feeds by hawking for insects, and rarely feeds on ground; "other trees" in foraging habitat in model are red alder (Morrison 1981)
Diet
Insects: beetles, mayflies, stoneflies, Diptera, Hymenoptera, true bugs, Trichoptera, Lepidoptera, insect larvae, Homoptera, and spiders. Occasionally eats berries.
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
less abundant in low shrub-stage clearcuts and more abundant in high shrub-stage clearcuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995)showed a limited ability to compensate for habitat alterations, and were subsequently lower in density on sites where the deciduous component was removed (Morrison 1981)

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: Lolo National Forest, western Montana
Habitat Description: mix from PIPO-PIEN-ABLA
Summary: This one-year study examined the habitat requirements of seven open nesting birds typically found in mature forest. Habitat preferences for each species are noted. In general, structural complexity was of high importance; canopy cover, shrub cover and number of large-diameter stems were often included in predictive models. Management recommendations are made for individual species as well as for the general avian community studied.

Study Location: western Oregon
Habitat Description: young PSME, with red alder as major deciduous element
Summary: The foraging behavior and habitat selection of MacGillivray's, Wilson's, and orange-crowned warblers were investigated in early-growth clearcuts with and without deciduous tree cover (red alder). Population densities were similar between site types, except Wilson's warblers were less abundant on sites without deciduous tree cover. Deciduous tree cover was the primary variable that differentiated amongst the three warblers. When this cover was experimentally reduced, foraging behavior changed and indices of foraging overlap revealed a general pattern of decreased habitat segregation. Orange-crowned warblers concentrated foraging behavior on shrubs in areas with the deciduous component was removed, and maintained densities similar to undisturbed areas. Wilson's warblers showed a limited ability to compensate for habitat alterations, and were lower in density on sites where the deciduous component was removed.

Study Location: Sierra Nevada of California
Habitat Description: ABCO/LIDE/PILA/PIPO/PSME
Summary: Breeding bird species are predicted for the various habitat stages of mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. Habitat is broken into groups based on tree size (exact diameters not given) and canopy closure. Relative suitability of habitats is listed; optimal habitat only was entered in this database. This species-habitat matrix was made from data from various studies in the region. Predictions were more accurate for later seral stages than early. Forest management in regards to bird communities is discussed, emphasizing the importance of late seral stages for breeding birds in the study region.
