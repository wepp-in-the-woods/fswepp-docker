no information available
Canopy Cover
low canopy cover at foraging locations (Szaro and Balda 1986, Lowther et al. 2000)
Specific Habitat Preferences
rocky, dry areas within a matrix of grassland or PIPO/PSME forest, bare ground in open areas for foraging
Nestsite Characteristics
rock-sheltered nest
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages on the ground and among rocks and crevices
Diet
insects and their larvae including beetles and grasshoppers, spiders, and earthworms
Predators
striped racer and other snakes, woodrat, antelope ground squirrel, American kestrel
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
most abundant on medium/heavy cut sites  (Szaro and Balda 1986); more abundant in partial cuts than uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); present on clearcut, severely thinned, and irregular strip plots and absent on control and silviculturally cut plots (Szaro and Balda 1979)
Sources of Information used in the Model

General Sources of Background Information

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: throughout range
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Birds of North America species account for the rock wren. Common in rocky areas, but will inhabit non-rocky habitats as long as crevices are present. Inhabits dry, rocky areas with little to no vegetation within PIPO, grassland or PSME forest matrix. Forages on bare soil in open canopy situations

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Bird species diversity and species richness were not significantly affected by forest cutting and logging except in a clearcut treatment. Bird population densities significantly increased on silviculturally cut and irregular strip shelterwood plots and significantly decreased  on the severely thinned and clearcut plots. Impact on individual species is discussed.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Seasonal avian communities were examined for their response to weather condition and treatment (logging) effects. While birds responded to climate, most notably precipitation, treatment effects appeared to be more influential. Species preferring open habitat (rock wren, American robin, western wood pe-wee and western bluebird) were highest on medium and heavy cut stands. Treated stands also had the highest abundance of chipping sparrows, broad-tailed hummingbirds, Grace's warbler, and dark-eyed juncos. Species preferring dense foliage (western flycatcher, pygmy nuthatch, red-faced warbler, hermit thrush, black-headed grosbeak) were less abundant in modified habitats.
