Diet
insects and spiders; mostly lepidopteran larvae
Predators
Accipiter hawks on adults; red squirrels, gray-necked chipmunks, ravens prey on nests and nestlings

Study Location: southwest USA
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Review of the impacts of disturbance on songbirds in southwest PIPO forests. Includes how disturbances such as fire change forest vegetation and in turn how this change impacts difference life history traits of avian species. Many useful, explicitly referenced review tables including: Table 2. Response patterns of selected birds to fire in PIPO forest, Table 3. Abundance of bird species that occur in clearcut, partially cut, and uncut southwestern PIPO forest, Table 4. Effect of silvicultural treatment on avian abundance and diversity, Table 5.Bird species in ponderosa pine forests that nest primarily on the ground or in low shrubs, Table 6. Bird species that prefer open habitat or use meadows or clearings within the forest, Table 7. Bird species that use riparian zones adjacent to ponderosa pine for nesting and foraging.

Study Location: throughout range
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Birds of North America species account for the red-faced warbler. Breeds in the highlands of Arizona, New Mexico, and Mexico and is common in high-elevation mixed deciduous-coniferous forests in this range. Forages mostly on coniferous trees. Nests placed in hollow on ground are often sheltered with forbs, rocks, logs or grass.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Seasonal avian communities were examined for their response to weather condition and treatment (logging) effects. While birds responded to climate, most notably precipitation, treatment effects appeared to be more influential. Species preferring open habitat (rock wren, American robin, western wood pe-wee and western bluebird) were highest on medium and heavy cut stands. Treated stands also had the highest abundance of chipping sparrows, broad-tailed hummingbirds, Grace's warbler, and dark-eyed juncos. Species preferring dense foliage (western flycatcher, pygmy nuthatch, red-faced warbler, hermit thrush, black-headed grosbeak) were less abundant in modified habitats.
