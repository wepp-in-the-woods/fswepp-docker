Distribution
much of Alaska, northern Canada and along northern Rocky Mountain chain for breeding, year-round in north-west USA; winters in southern USA south into Mexico
General Habitat
common in open woodlands, brushy grasslands, roadsides, parks
Home or Activity Range
0-2.5 ac (O'Neil et al. 2001)
Canopy Cover
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
brushy cutover areas, heterogeneous landscapes, patchy arrangements of bare ground, grass and shrub cover
Nestsite Characteristics
nests on clump of grass or moss, sheltered by bush, or in small tree or shrub; nest made of grass, sticks, rootlets and forbs
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages on ground, in shrubs and understory vegetation
Diet
PSME seed, Amaranthus seeds, grass, huckleberry, buds, some insects 
Predators
nests: snakes, ground squirrels, barn owl, accipiter hawks, crow, scrub jay, American kestrel
Shelter Habitats
shelters nest with shrubs and small trees
Response to Disturbance
present in 25 year post-fire stands until shrub cover was lost  (Taylor and Barmore 1980); more abundant in low shrub-stage clearcuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995)

Study Location: throughout range
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Birds of North America species account for the white-crowned sparrow. Populations breed in a variety of habitats across its range. Necessary habitat features for breeding include grass, bare ground for foraging, dense shrubs or small conifers for roosting and nest concealment, standing or running water, and tall coniferous trees.

Study Location: inner coast ranges of northwestern California
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Bird species were surveyed in cutover areas of PSME forest as well as virgin forest. Bird species are identified that prefer cutover forest, intact forest, or occur in both. Accounts of habitat preferences are given for several bird species, including detailed dietary information.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks, Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO, ABLA/PIEN
Summary: Bird density, composition, and diversity were monitored across a series of fire severities in burned PICO or spruce-fir forest in Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks. Highest populations and greatest biomass occurred from 5-29 years post-fire. Density, composition, and diversity on moderately burned spruce-fir-PICO were more like those on unburned spruce-fir than other seral stages. Changes in bird communities by feeding category were also examined. Overall, canopy closure was a habitat variable that appeared to affect avifauna more than the presence of fire.
