# Literature
Distribution
much of Alaska, Canada, and northern USA, extending south along Rocky and Appalachian mountain chains
General Habitat
young, multi-story mixed coniferous forest; deciduous and mixed woodlands
Home or Activity Range
12-40 ac (O'Neil et al. 2001)
Canopy Cover
high canopy cover (86%) at drumming sites (Buhler and Anderson 2001)
Specific Habitat Preferences
shrubby areas, aspen, edge habitats, large logs for drumming
Nestsite Characteristics
nests in areas with high cover; nests near tree trunk or sheltered by shrub, log, boulder, or tree stump
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages on ground; will move up into shrubs and trees to feed on buds, catkins, and twigs in snowy conditions
Diet
favors buds and catkins of aspen, alder, willow, and  black cottonwood; also leaves, buds, flowers, twigs, and fruit of a variety of forbs, shrubs, and deciduous trees; shrub species include chokecherries and serviceberries; chicks require insects for the first few weeks of life, including ants, flies, beetles, grasshoppers, and caterpillars
Predators
forest carnivores and raptors; great horned owl, goshawk, lynx
Shelter Habitats
use dense shrub cover for thermal and predator protection; in winter, will roost under snow layer
Response to Disturbance
no information available

Study Location: northwestern Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO/PIEN forest; also includes open sagebrush areas
Summary: Drumming logs used by breeding ruffed grouse had fewer limbs, little bark, and were in advanced stages of decay. Drumming logs were located in habitat types that had the highest total and conifer canopy cover, average canopy height, and total number of PIEN and PICO. Preferred stands also had larger diameter logs and more vertical foliage (seedlings and shrubs) 0.3-3.0 m in height. Aspen of all sizes was prevalent in the understory.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Alberta
Habitat Description: aspen woods, spruce woods, burn, open bog
Summary: Aspen woods were used almost exclusively by grouse in all seasons. Grouse activities tied to vegetation include drumming sites, sites from which grouse were flushed in spring, roost sites, brood sites, and kill sites. The majority of drumming males in the study area occupied logs in aspen woods. Vegetation at these logs included sparse canopy of low shrubs, low density of saplings, and greater density of trees. Kill sites in the aspen woods had lower shrub height and density than elsewhere.

Study Location: Blue Mountains, OR
Habitat Description: PICO
Summary: This case history (1) evaluates bird-habitat relationships in primarily grand fir forests. The goals of this study were to assess how forest stand structure influences habitat selection by birds, to investigate bird use of specific forest structural classes, and to relate bird habitat use to potential management options that consider breeding bird habitat.

Stauffer, Dean F.; Peterson, Steven R. 1985. Ruffed and blue grouse habitat use in southeastern Idaho. Journal of Wildlife Management. 49:459-466.

Study Location: Wasatch Mountains of southeastern Idaho
Habitat Description: 8 types: sagebrush, mixed shrub, mountain mahogany, maple, aspen, aspen-conifer (ABLA, PSME, PICO), dense conifer (ABLA, PIEN, PICO), open conifer (PSME, ABLA, PIFL)
Summary: Seasonal habitat selection is presented for blue and ruffed grouse. Ruffed grouse preferred stands dominated by quaking aspen or aspen-conifer mixes in winter, and otherwise preferred stand characteristics typical of early successional stages. Blue grouse preferred higher elevation, open conifer stands in winter. In spring, lower elevation mixed shrub stands with and open understory and overstory were selected for breeding and brood rearing. Little habitat overlap was noted between the two species, with blue grouse consistently choosing more open habitat than ruffed grouse.
