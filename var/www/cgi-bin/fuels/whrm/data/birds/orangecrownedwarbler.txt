no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
well-developed understories (>1236 shrubs, seedlings and saplings/acre), substantial groundcover, stand- initiation phase mixed conifer stands, edge habitat, heterogeneous landscapes
Nestsite Characteristics
nests on ground, usually sheltered by shrubs or grasses; nest made of bark pieces, grass, leaves, plant fibers and lined with hair, feathers and grass
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
feeds in low branches, on ground, on shrubs or understory vegetation; "other trees" in foraging habitat in model are red alder (Morrison 1981)
Diet
insects (caterpillars, beetles, wasps, ants, flies, true bugs, plant lice, bees, leafhoppers, scale insects, and aphids), spiders, and also small amounts of seeds, leaf galls, and fruit
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
uses grass and shrubs to shelter nest
Response to Disturbance
prescribed burning or grazing by large ungulates may reduce understory and ground cover and adversely affect warbler populations (reviewed in Sallabanks et al. 2003); more abundant in forests 10-40 years post-burn (Hutto 1995), disfavored 1-2 years post-fire due to forest and foliage loss (Johnson and Wauer 1996); less abundant in low shrub-stage clearcuts and partially cut forest compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995)

Summary: Review of the impacts of disturbance on songbirds in southwest PIPO forests. Includes how disturbances such as fire change forest vegetation and in turn how this change impacts difference life history traits of avian species. Many useful, explicitly referenced review tables including: Table 2. Response patterns of selected birds to fire in PIPO forest, Table 3. Abundance of bird species that occur in clearcut, partially cut, and uncut southwestern PIPO forest, Table 4. Effect of silvicultural treatment on avian abundance and diversity, Table 5.Bird species in ponderosa pine forests that nest primarily on the ground or in low shrubs, Table 6. Bird species that prefer open habitat or use meadows or clearings within the forest, Table 7. Bird species that use riparian zones adjacent to ponderosa pine for nesting and foraging.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: western Montana and northern Wyoming
Habitat Description: range of habitat types: includes PIPO, PSME, LAOC, PICO, PIAL, PIFL, Picea sp,, ABLA, ABGR, THPL, aspen, cottonwood
Summary: Fifteen bird species are generally more abundant in early post-fire communities than in any other cover type in the northern Rockies (includes olive-sided flycatcher, three-toed woodpecker, black-backed woodpecker, Clark's nutcracker, mountain bluebird, red crossbill, Cassin's finch, pine siskin, American robin, dark-eyed junco, yellow-rumped warbler). Six species (common nighthawk, calliope hummingbird, northern flicker, Stellar's jay, orange-crowned warbler, chipping sparrow) were most abundant in stands 10-40 years post-fire. Three species (American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, dark-eyed junco) were detected in early an mid-successional burned forest 100% of the time. One species, the black-backed woodpecker, was restricted to standing dead forest created by stand-replacing fires. Bird communities are different in recently burned forest, primarily because members of three feeding guilds (woodpeckers, flycatchers, and seedeaters) are especially abundant. Larger-diameter (>10 cm dbh) PP, DF, and LAOC were most often used for feeding by woodpeckers. Standing, fire-killed trees were used by the majority of birds nesting in recently burned forest. Many of the structures used in nesting (broken-topped snags) were present before the fire. Large-scale, stand-replacing fire may be necessary for long-term maintenance of many bird populations. Commentary is offered on the need to alter present fire and post-fire forest management.

Study Location: Bandelier National Monument, NM
Habitat Description: PIPO, montane meadow, mixed conifer, pinyon-juniper
Summary: Breeding birds were surveyed before and for many years after a wildfire in Bandelier National Monument. Species diversity increased after the fire, but breeding populations in general declined for several years before increasing above prefire levels. This pattern was more pronounced on severely burned forest. In all but the severely burned forest, breeding bird diversity and populations were higher than prefire levels 14 years after the wildfire. Patterns are presented for different foraging and nesting guilds, as well as some individual species (including particular habitat changes that impacted bird species).

Study Location: western Oregon
Habitat Description: young PSME, with red alder as major deciduous element
Summary: The foraging behavior and habitat selection of MacGillivray's, Wilson's, and orange-crowned warblers were investigated in early-growth clearcuts with and without deciduous tree cover (red alder). Population densities were similar between site types, except Wilson's warblers were less abundant on sites without deciduous tree cover. Deciduous tree cover was the primary variable that differentiated amongst the three warblers. When this cover was experimentally reduced, foraging behavior changed and indices of foraging overlap revealed a general pattern of decreased habitat segregation. Orange-crowned warblers concentrated foraging behavior on shrubs in areas with the deciduous component was removed, and maintained densities similar to undisturbed areas. Wilson's warblers showed a limited ability to compensate for habitat alterations, and were lower in density on sites where the deciduous component was removed.

Study Location: Blue Mountains, OR
Habitat Description: ABGR
Summary: This case history (1) evaluates bird-habitat relationships in primarily grand fir forests. The goals of this study were to assess how forest stand structure influences habitat selection by birds, to investigate bird use of specific forest structural classes, and to relate bird habitat use to potential management options that consider breeding bird habitat.
