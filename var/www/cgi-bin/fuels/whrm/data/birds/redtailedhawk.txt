Distribution
much of N. America
General Habitat
variety of habitats from woods with nearby open land; also plains, prairie groves, deserts
Home or Activity Range
200-1000 ac (O'Neil et al. 2001)
Canopy Cover
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
edge habitat, heterogeneous landscapes, elevated perches
Nestsite Characteristics
nests in crotch of large tree, on cliff ledge, or on artificial structure; nest made of stick and twigs
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
most hunt from a perch, diving and pouncing when prey is spotted
Diet
mammals: ground squirrels, rabbits, pocket gophers, voles, deer mice, and jack rabbits; birds: meadowlarks, magpies, bluebirds, chukars, horned larks, and ducks; snakes: gopher snakes, racers, garter snakes, and rattlesnakes;  also amphibians, insects (beetles), and carrion; known to eat salmon carcasses during stressful conditions
Predators
great-horned owls, corvids on eggs
Shelter Habitats
commonly roost in trees with dense foliage, with groups of trees used more often than single trees
Response to Disturbance
attracted to areas clearcut 17 and 37 years previously (Austin and Perry 1979); more abundant in low shrub- and high shrub-stage clearcuts and partial cuts compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); found in stands as mature "yellow" PIPO densities increased to 8 trees/acre (Keller 1992)

Study Location: Uinta Mountains, Utah
Habitat Description: PICO as main overstory tree; also includes PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Birds were censused in wet and dry meadows, mature and stagnated PICO stands, and regenerating PICO stands (17 and 37 years post-clearcut). The richest avifauna was found in the dry meadows. While a few birds were adversely affected by the clearcutting, many individual species were more numerous in the clearcuts, and the overall number of species was similar.

Study Location: inner coast ranges of northwestern California
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Bird species were surveyed in cutover areas of PSME forest as well as virgin forest. Bird species are identified that prefer cutover forest, intact forest, or occur in both. Accounts of habitat preferences are given for several bird species, including detailed dietary information.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Keller, Richard. 1992. Affect of ponderosa pine overstory and snags on the songbird community, northern Arizona. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION- THESIS?

Study Location: Coconino and Kaibab National Forest, northern Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: The overstory of mature PIPO forest and the presence of snags influenced bird communities in pole-sized PIPO stands in northern Arizona. Study areas containing pure pole-sized trees and no snags had the lowest numbers of insectivorous birds; study areas with the most insectivorous bird diversity contained at least 14 mature PIPO trees/acre and at least 2 snags/acre. The greatest number of birds were detected in stands containing 8-10 mature PIPO trees/acre and no snags. PIPO overstory also influenced both coniferous forest-nesting birds and primary cavity-nesting birds. The presence of snags influenced secondary cavity-nesters. Overall, this study suggests that a homogenous forest of young PIPO stands lacking in snags is not desirable for maintaining healthy bird species diversity.

Study Location: central Alberta
Habitat Description: mixed farmlands and deciduous and coniferous woodlands; not in dry coniferous forest type
Summary: Breeding red-tailed hawks occupied both forested and non-forested habitat, taking prey from all cover types associated with nesting sites. Specific prey items are outlined, with the role of cyclic prey densities examined. . Major prey species included Richardson's ground squirrel, snowshoe hare, meadow vole, and ruffed grouse.

Study Location: southeastern Washington
Habitat Description: shrubsteppe; some scattered trees in riparian areas
Summary: Nest sites and habitat selection were investigated at a macro- and microhabitat scale for ferruginous, Swainson's and red-tailed hawks. Ferruginous hawks constructed the largest nests on sturdy structures including rock outcrops, transmission towers, and trees. Ferruginous hawks were highly sensitive, nesting an average 1.8 km from human disturbance and 1.7 km from other ferruginous hawks. Swainson's hawks nested most frequently in small trees in areas with scattered elevated structures, low topographic relief, and close water. Red-tailed hawks selected the tallest substrates and nested higher than the other two Buteo species. Most nests were found on transmission towers, trees, and cliffs at heights greater than 10 m. Red-tailed hawks selected areas with more elevated structure and high topographic relief. Nearest neighbors to both Swainson's and red-tailed hawks were conspecifics.

Study Location: throughout range
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Birds of North America species account for the red-tailed hawk. Widespread hawk occupying a variety of habitat types, usually favoring open areas interspersed with patches of trees or similar structural features. Requires elevated perch sites. Will commonly roost in trees with dense foliage, with groups of trees used more often than single trees. In forested areas, nests are located within the crowns of tall trees, often the tallest tree available. Cliff ledges and artificial structures may be used. All nest sites have in common unobstructed access to nest from above and a commanding view of the adjacent environment.
