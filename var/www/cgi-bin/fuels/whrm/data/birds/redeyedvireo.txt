Distribution
much of Canada, northwest, central and eastern USA
General Habitat
common in deciduous forests, dense bottomlands
Home or Activity Range
1.7-7.5 ac (O'Neil et al. 2001)
Canopy Cover
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
deciduous forest elements, including small trees and shrubs
Nestsite Characteristics
nest hangs in fork of tree branch or shrub
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
picks food off of leaves, and twigs; hovers to snatch food off foliage, bark, or branches; forages in areas with dense understory cover from 0-20 m
Diet
mostly insects, particularly caterpillars; also fruits and berries in fall
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
populations reported to be tolerant of small canopy openings created by activities such as small group-selection cuts, small or narrow clearcuts, thinning, or single-tree selection in Appalachian hardwoods (Crawford et al. 1981, reviewed in Cimprich et al. 2000)

Study Location: throughout range
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Birds of North America species account for the red-eyed vireo. Far-ranging species. Overall appears to prefer deciduous over coniferous forest. Is absent from sites where understory shrubs are sparse or lacking. May be found near small openings in forest canopy. Breeds in alder and aspen thickets in northern parts of its range.


Pletschet, Sandra M. 1987. Habitat preferences and interspecific competition: red-eyed and warbling vireos. Missoula, MT: University of Montana. 61 p. M.A. Thesis.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: riparian woodland: black cottonwood, PIPO, aspen
Summary: The habitats and spatial relationships of warbling and red-eyed vireos was studied. Intraspecific territorial overlap was virtually non-existent. Red-eyed vireos preferred habitat with denser cover than warbling vireos. Red-eyed vireos foraged in the middle of trees, and used aspen more than warbling vireos. Both species sang primarily from the top of trees.
