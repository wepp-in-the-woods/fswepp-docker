Distribution
Canada and northern half of USA
General Habitat
common in open woodlands, clearings
Home or Activity Range
15-95 ac (O'Neil et al. 2001)
Canopy Cover
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
edge habitat, thickets, snags
Nestsite Characteristics
nests in deciduous or coniferous trees or snags; nest lined with vegetation, moss, feathers, hair and insect cocoons
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
forages in thickets and low branches of trees; gleans from tree bark and from trunk to thinnest twigs
Diet
winter diet consists of 50% insects and spiders, and 50% seeds and berries; diet during the breeding season consists of 80 - 90% animal (largely consisting of caterpillars) matter; insects include Lepidoptera larvae, eggs, and pupae; berries include blackberry, huckleberry, honeysuckle, wild cherry, poison ivy, bayberry; seeds include goldenrod, ragweed, and hemlocks. Also take snails, slugs, centipedes, and fat from carrion
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
no information available
Response to Disturbance
less abundant in low shrub- and high shrub- stage clearcuts and partially cut forest compared to uncut forest (Hejl et al. 1995); found more in unburned controls compared to stands burned by stand-replacement wildfire (Kreisel and Stein 1999)

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Rocky Mountains
Habitat Description: forest types across the Rocky mountains
Summary: Synthesis of the effects of different silvicultural treatments on neotropical migrants in forests of the Rocky Mountains. Outlines current forest structure, natural disturbance, logging history, and current silvicultural recommendations. General bird-habitat relationships in natural forest, including stands of different ages, are contrasted with stands that are silviculturally manipulated. Contains detailed species lists for rare to abundant bird species that are found in 8 forest types commonly found in the Rockies (Table 8-2). Also lists species by their likelihood to be more or less abundant in managed stands (classified as one of three types of clearcuts or partial cuts) compared to uncut forest. (Table 8-3)

Study Location: northeast Washington
Habitat Description: mixed conifer, includes: PSME, PIPO, ABLA, PIEN, LAOC, PICO
Summary: This study examined bird use of burned and unburned forest in the winter season. Species richness was similar, but composition was distinctly different. Composition and abundance also changed with time; some species disappeared from the area while others moved in. Trunk and branch foraging species were more abundant in burned forest, though their abundance significantly decreased from the first to the fourth winter post-fire. Foraging behavior was documented for four woodpecker species within the burned area. Foraging took place on snags > 23 cm dbh.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: PSME, LAOC, PICO, PIEN, PIPO, ABLA, ABGR, THPL, PIMO, aspen, birch
Summary: A comparison of bird communities was performed between control sites and those undergoing traditional overstory removal harvests and those harvested using "New Forestry" techniques. Only four species showed significant differences in abundance between treatments, though the author suspects that other trends in the data would be clearer with additional post-treatment data. In general, for species that did differ in abundance, numbers in New Forestry stands were intermediate between overstory removal and controls. Foliage foragers declined similarly in both harvest types, while ground foragers increased. Conifer nesters decreased similarly in both harvest types, while ground nesters increased. Important habitat variables for a number of species are given.
