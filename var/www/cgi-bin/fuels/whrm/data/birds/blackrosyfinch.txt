Study Location: eastern Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: primarily PIPO
Summary: The authors review the habitat needs of bird species of concern in eastern Oregon and Washington, focusing on how disturbances (natural and anthropogenic) would alter habitat for these species.

Study Location: throughout range
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Birds of North America species account for the black rosy finch. An alpine bird, breeding above treeline in cracks and holes in cliffs and foraging on the wet margins of snowbanks for seeds and insects. Breeding range is optimized wherever proper cliffs and rock shelter provide nest sites with protection from falling rock and hail and where there are adequate feeding grounds on tundra, fellfields, rockslides, snow fields and glaciers.
