Summary: Literature review of habitat use, diet and roost selection of the big brown bat. Important areas of conservation and research are highlighted, including the effects of roost disturbance, control of economically important insects pests, exposure to pesticides, long-term monitoring of populations, and the potential consequences of expanding populations.

Habitat Description: mosaic of pine and fir forests of various ages and species composition
Summary: Maternity roost sites were located for silver-haired and big brown bats in northeastern Oregon. Both species used large live and dead trees, though the big brown bat used larger trees than the silver-haired bat. Roost sites tended to be high, uncluttered, in no particular direction. Big brown bats tended to roost in more open sites, have larger maternity colonies, and move farther between roosts than the silver-haired bat. Silver-hair bats tended to stay within the same drainage. Both species used multiple roost sites, and multiple individuals were found at roost locations.

Study Location: south-central British Columbia
Habitat Description: not stated (includes PIPO)
Summary: The foraging and roosting behavior of big brown bats was studied in south-central British Columbia. Maternity colonies were found exclusively in PIPO snags (mean dbh 31 cm). Rock crevices were sometimes used as day roosts. Bats changed roosts fairly often and the number of bats in any given roost fluctuated. Bats flew to a nearby river area to forage. A comparison between this study area and an area in Ontario shows some differences in roosting behavior, which the author attributes to climatic differences.

Study Location: Saskatchewan
Habitat Description: PICO, PIGL interspersed with aspen
Summary: Big brown bats were secondary cavity nesters in mature aspens, despite the presence of available cavities in nearby conifer trees. The authors attribute this pattern to a cooler microclimate within aspen stands compared to mixed conifer forest. The authors promote the retention of large stands of mature aspen for the use of primary cavity nesters, particularly the yellow-bellied sapsucker, and consequently for big brown bats as natural roosting sites, especially in areas where human-made structures are not available for roosting.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: primarily PIPO; also PSME, aspen, PIFL, ABCO
Summary: Eight species of bats roosted primarily in large-diameter PIPO snags with exfoliating bark. Forest surrounding roosts had higher tree densities, greater tree species diversity, and trees with larger basal area than random snag areas. Almost half of the bats used more than one roost site. Snags in one study area were more likely to be located near water; snags in the other study area were less likely to be located within a harvested area. Snag retention and creation is especially important for bat species because of the short time period during which snags actually have exfoliating bark for bats to roost under.

Study Location: British Columbia
Habitat Description: not stated: includes THPL and TSHE
Summary: The diversity, relative abundance, and roosting ecology of bats were studied in the Mica Wildlife Compensation Area. The little brown bat was the most abundant bat species. Roosts were located in rocky outcrops and in trees. Bats moved roosts often, but remained faithful to a particular roosting area. Therefore, management for these bats should occur on a stand or landscape level, preserving areas where multiple roosting areas are present.

Study Location: southern Washington Cascades, Oregon Coast Range
Habitat Description: PSME-TSHE sere
Summary: Bats were examined in different-aged PSME stands. Bats were grouped by nesting strategy and by echolocation signal. Bat activity was higher in old-growth sites than in mature or young sites; these results suggest that bats are 3-10 times more abundant in the old-growth sites. The author attributes this pattern to roosting habitat, due to the availability of large-diameter snags in older forest. Foraging opportunities did not contribute to the observed pattern of bat abundance. Differences in sex-ratio, reproductive activity and age distribution were seen between the two regions. Reduction in old-growth forest would negatively impact bat populations, though the degree of impact may vary regionally.

Habitat Description: not stated; includes aspen, PIPO, PSME, PICO, LAOC, ABGR, PIST, THPL
Summary: Summer roost-site selection was determined for silver-haired and big brown bats by radio-tracking reproductive females. Roost-sites for both species included natural hollows and cavities made by primary excavators. Both species used large trees that were uncluttered by surrounding trees relative to available trees in the immediate area of the roost, and in other areas of the same stand. Both species preferred aspen; big brown bats had a specific decay-stage preference but silver-haired bats had none. The only distinguishing feature of roost trees used by the different species was a preference of big brown bats for trees higher relative to the canopy than silver-haired bats. Management recommendations are given.

Study Location: southern British Columbia
Habitat Description: variety: THPL, TSHE, PIEN, ABLA, PSME, PIPO, LAOC, aspen
Summary: Roost-site preferences were examined for four species of tree-roosting bats. Most roost sites were under tree bark, but woodpecker-made and natural cavities were also used. Roost entrances tended to be located beneath the canopy. Bats preferred tall trees associated with low percent canopy closure and a short distance to the nearest available tree. Roosts were switched frequently, with a low distance between roost sites. In this area, bats preferred to roost in western white pine, and to a lesser extent western larch and ponderosa pine.
