Summary: This study examined the habitat association of hoary and silver-haired bats in relation to tree size and structure of conifers in Oregon. Both species were found in the older forest (> 101 years old), which the authors attribute to the ability of older forests to offer more shelter for roosting, open space to gain flight while leaving the roost, and immediate accessibility to the roost site upon return. Older stands also offered more snags as roosting spaces. In general, the Douglas-fir dominated sites were used more than the PIPO/true fir forest.

Study Location: southern Washington Cascades, Oregon Coast Range
Habitat Description: PSME-TSHE sere
Summary: Bats were examined in different-aged PSME stands. Bats were grouped by nesting strategy and by echolocation signal. Bat activity was higher in old-growth sites than in mature or young sites; these results suggest that bats are 3-10 times more abundant in the old-growth sites. The author attributes this pattern to roosting habitat, due to the availability of large-diameter snags in older forest. Foraging opportunities did not contribute to the observed pattern of bat abundance. Differences in sex-ratio, reproductive activity and age distribution were seen between the two regions. Reduction in old-growth forest would negatively impact bat populations, though the degree of impact may vary regionally.
