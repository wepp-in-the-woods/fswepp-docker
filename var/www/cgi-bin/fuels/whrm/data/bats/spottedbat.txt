Study Location: southern British Columbia
Habitat Description: field, PIPO-PSME forest, burned PIPO forest
Summary: Spotted bats concentrated foraging activities in open areas adjacent to PIPO forest. A field site was preferred to PIPO-PSME forest and burned PIPO forest. Spotted bats roosted alone in steep cliff faces.

Study Location: Dinosaur National Monument, Utah
Habitat Description: canyon bottom vegetation: cottonwoods, various shrubs
Summary: Local distribution and foraging behavior were noted for the spotted bat. The spotted bat occurred in a variety of habitat types including canyon bottoms and other low elevation sites. Foraging bats concentrated their activity in the open-air space above meadows and occasionally exploited near-canopy habitat. Exclusive foraging areas were maintained and distinct vocalizations indicated agnostic behavior at territory boundaries.

Study Location: southern British Columbia
Habitat Description: PIPO, marsh
Summary: Spotted bats roosted in cliff faces and concentrated foraging activities over marshes and in open PIPO woodland.
