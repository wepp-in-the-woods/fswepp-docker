Location of Study:  central Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming
Habitat Description:  PIPO forests
Summary:  Habitat selection by white-tailed deer varied by sex and season in PIPO forests. Habitat selection for both sexes was linked primarily to measures of canopy closure and tree diameter, though the authors suggest that these variables influence shrub cover, which is a variable more directly linked to the habitat needs of white-tailed deer. The authors also found positive habitat selection for one category of burnt pine forest in winter range, and one category of aspen forest in summer range. The availability of foraging habitat and shelter habitat (for avoiding climatic stress) is hypothesized to be the limiting factor on white-tailed deer populations in the central Black Hills.

Location of Study:  Oregon
Habitat Description:  variety
Summary:  Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Location of Study:  Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area, east-central Idaho
Habitat Description:  variety: bluebunch wheatgrass/poa, PIPO/bluebunch wheatgrass, PSME/ninebark, grand fir/clintonia, THPL, PIEN, ABLA, PICO, PIAL
Summary:    This study assessed the impact of fires on white-tailed deer and mule deer populations. Preference for specific habitat types varied monthly. White-tailed deer exhibited a significant preference for unburned sites, which had greater cover, and were seen mostly at low elevations (<1220 m). Mule deer preferred burned PSME/ninebark and PIPO/bluebunch wheatgrass habitat in winter, and were often seen at higher elevations (>1070 m). Seasonal food preferences are given for white-tailed and mule deer. Many of these forage species have been demonstrated to be enhanced by fires. One species, ninebark, was eaten on burned sites but not on unburned. The author suggests that fires can enhance the palatability and availability of some forage species. Burning of PSME/ninebark and PIPO/bluebunch wheatgrass may enhance their value as mule deer winter range. This action may preclude the immediate use of these habitat types by white-tailed deer, but light burns may improve the forage value of winter range without removing important shrub cover if stems are left standing.

Location of Study:  Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area, east-central Idaho
Habitat Description:  bluebunch wheatgrass/Sandberg bluegrass, PIPO/bluebunch wheatgrass, PSME/ninebark, ABGR/clintonia, THPL
Summary:  Habitat preferences for mule and white-tailed deer were examined in areas with recent wildfire. White-tailed deer preferred unburned PSME in January, March and April; unburned bluebunch wheatgrass was preferred in February. The majority of sightings were at low elevations. Mule deer preferred burned PSME and PIPO during the winter months; this pattern continued into April and May. Both species used closed-canopy habitats at some point in the winter that offered thermal protection and forage ability due to a lower snowpack. Seasonal food preferences are given. The author suggests that fires can enhance the palatability and availability of some forage species (i.e. ninebark). Burning of this forest type will enhance use by mule deer in winter, though it may reduce use by white-tailed deer until sufficient shrub cover develops (3-4 years post-fire).

Location of Study:  eastern and western Montana
Habitat Description:  not stated
Summary: Pellets of elk and combined mule and white-tailed deer were examined in and adjacent to clearcuts. Pellet distributions suggest that animals enter clear-cut openings in search of high quality and quantity forage, though require security in the form of cover in these areas. Elk and deer both preferred openings with cover except where such cover inhibiting forage growth. Both preferred openings where logging slash was not a barrier to movement. Predictive models for elk in use of clearcuts in western Montana included vegetation height within the opening (+, largely shrubs), depth of dead and down timber in adjacent forest, slash depth within opening, and area of the opening. Models for elk in eastern Montana included elevation of opening, cover quality of the uncut adjacent forest, vegetation height inside the opening (-, largely PICO seedlings), and vehicle access. Elk preferred smaller openings than deer, but were more tolerant of large openings. Open roads and inadequate cover severely depressed elk use of clearcuts.

Location of Study:  northwest Montana
Habitat Description:  ABLA habitat-types; also includes PICO, PSME, LAOC
Summary: Summer habitat selection by deer was studied in northwest Montana. At a macrohabitat scale, deer habitat selection was influenced by the presence of second and third order streams and associated riparian meadow complexes. Deer selected for areas with naturally occurring grass/forb or shrub/hardwood vegetation. Later in the season, deer shifted to higher elevation sites containing open and closed pole/immature sawtimber. In general, early seral and mature vegetation were avoided. Sites within 100 m of a road were avoided. Microhabitat selection was less specific.

Singer, Francis J. 1979. Habitat partitioning and wildfire relationships of cervids in Glacier National Park, Montana. Journal of Wildlife Management. 43:437-444.

Location of Study:  Glacier National Park, Montana
Habitat Description:  Eight veg. types:grasslands, spruce forests, wash/cottonwood, PICO savanna, PSME, PICO/ABLA, willow/sedge, aspen 
Summary:  The seasonal habitat preferences of moose, elk, and white-tailed deer were examined in Glacier National Park. Each species showed significant preferences that shifted through the season. In the winter, elk preferred PICO savanna and spruce forest, mule deer preferred DF and spruce forest, and moose preferred aspen, willow/sedge, and spruce forest. In spring and fall, elk and deer preferred the grassland complex. The reliance of all species on spruce forest in winter was related to the ability of spruce to intercept snow and to provide better cover. Snow depth was the key factor determining habitat partitioning in the winter. Whereas all species preferred spruce stands, they were rarely found together in them. Wildfire was judged to be largely responsible for some of the preferred habitat types, including the open lodgepole savanna and aspen stands. The absence of fire in the system has been mediated by other habitat-altering disturbance, namely the flooding of the North Fork River. Food habits are given for the three cervids. Dietary overlap occurred between elk and the other two species. Spring feed was primarily grasses for elk, forbs for white-tailed deer, and browse for moose.
