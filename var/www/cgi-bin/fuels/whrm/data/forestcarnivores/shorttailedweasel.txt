Distribution
holarctic regions; in North America, from Alaska to Nova Scotia with two southward extensions: western third of the USA to New Mexico, northeastern USA from central Dakotas to Iowa, and northern Illinois across to northeastern Kentucky and the east coast
General Habitat
diverse habitats; most common in montane coniferous forests, particularly along edges and forests in early to mid-successional stages of development; common in riparian areas and meadow marshes
Home or Activity Range
25- 100 ac (Foresman 2001)
Canopy Cover
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
hollow trees or rock outcrops for denning, areas where vole density is high
Nestsite Characteristics
dens in hollow trees or rock outcrops, nest or borrow systems of voles
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
runs through rock crevices and along vole runways in search of prey; subnivean foraging occurs in winter; will cache food for later use if prey is abundant
Diet
primarily small mammals: mostly voles (meadow voles), also chipmunks, pika, rabbits; also birds, amphibians, reptiles, insects
Predators
hawks, owls, house cats, other carnivorous mammals, snakes
Shelter Habitats
dens in hollow trees or rock outcrops, nest or borrow systems of voles
Response to Disturbance

Sullivan, Thomas P.; Druscilla, S.; Lindgren, Pontus M.F. 2000. Small mammals and stand structure in young pine, seed-tree, and old-growth forest, southwest Canada. Ecological Applications. 10(5): 1367-1383.

Location of Study: south-central British Columbia
Habitat Description: PSME, PICO
Summary: This study tested the hypothesis that diversity of stand structure attributes and forest-floor small mammal communities increase from young pine to seed tree to old growth forest. Some vegetative attributes differed between forest type. Red-backed voles were most abundant in old growth forest, while northwestern chipmunks, heather voles, western jumping mice, montane shrews, and common shrews were more abundant in the treated stands. Meadow voles were more abundant in the seed tree stands. Deer mice, long-tailed voles, and short-tailed weasels were similarly abundant among all treatment types. Mean species richness and diversity was higher in the treated stands, suggesting that all stand types offer their own structural diversity to the forest landscape.
