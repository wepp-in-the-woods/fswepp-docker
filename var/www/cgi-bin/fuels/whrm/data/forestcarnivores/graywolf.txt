Distribution
Alaska across the Northwest Territories and the western rim of Greenland, throughout the Canadian provinces, with extensions into Montana, Idaho, and the Great Lakes region, and remote parts of the southwest and Mexico
General Habitat
areas with adequate prey and little human interference; vegetative characteristics do not appear to dictate habitat use
Home or Activity Range
18000-325000 ac (Singleton 1995, Arjo and Pletscher 2004)
Canopy Cover
dense cover at actual den site (Matteson 1992)
Specific Habitat Preferences
low road density, areas where prey congregate (valley bottoms)
Nestsite Characteristics
majority of dens excavated in soil, may also be in hollow logs or rock caves; den more often in valley bottoms and lower slopes, flat to moderate slopes, south and east aspects, depositional landforms, and sites close to trails, far from human habitation and activity, and close to meadows and other openings; soil texture, canopy cover, and hiding cover probably play a role in den site selection at small scales
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
No information available
Diet
large mammals such as deer, elk, moose, caribou, mountain sheep, mountain goats, bison
Predators
No information available
Shelter Habitats
No information available
Response to Disturbance
burned areas can make up significant portions of wolf home ranges (Singleton 1995); distance to nearest road not a significant factor in den site selection in Montana and British Columbia (Matteson 1992); wolves denned farther from human habitations and activity centers than expected (Matteson 1992); one wolf pack used burned areas more than expected in summer (Arjo and Pletscher 2004)

Arjo, Wendy M.; Pletscher, Daniel H. 2004. Coyote and wolf habitat use in northwestern Montana. Northwest Science. 78(1): 24-32. 

Location of Study: northwest Montana
Habitat Description: dominated by PICO; also LAOC, ABLA, PSME, PIPO
Summary: Habitat use by coyotes and wolves was studied in Glacier NP after a successful wolf recolonization. Wolves used more mesic forests and less mixed conifer forests and lowland conifer forests than expected. Wolves used habitat types within their home ranges in proportion to availability in the winter, but not in the summer when more open areas and burned areas were used. Coyotes used open areas, burned areas, and lowland conifer forests more than expected, and mixed conifer and upland forest less than expected. Wolves avoided roads more than coyotes, and tended to be found on SE-SW and SW-NW aspects, while coyotes were found on NE-NW aspects.

Location of Study: northwest Montana and British Columbia
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME, PICO, Picea sp.; LAOC, THPL, TSHE, ABLA, PIFL, aspen, cottonwood
Summary: Characteristics of wolf den sites and denning areas were examined, including position, cover, and other habitat characteristics. The majority of dens were excavated. Compared to available habitat, wolves tended to den more often in valley bottoms and lower slopes, flat to moderate slopes, south and east aspects, depositional landforms, and sites close to trails, far from human habitation and activity, and close to meadows and other openings. Soil texture, canopy cover, and hiding cover probably play a role in den site selection at scales less than 0.03 square kilometers. Distance to nearest road was not identified as a factor important to den site selection.

Location of Study: northwest Montana and British Columbia
Habitat Description: PIPO, PIEN, PIGL, PSME, ABLA, PICO, aspen, cottonwood
Summary: Habitat characteristics for grey wolves were examined along travel routes and within home ranges. Within the home range, west, southwest, and flat aspects were preferred, while eastern, northern, and northeastern exposures were avoided. Main valley bottoms and main valley lower slopes were used more than expected, while side valley habitats and upper ridges were used less than expected. Flat areas or slight slopes were most common. Deciduous forest classes, followed by PICO, were the most preferred vegetation classes. In areas burned by fire, burnt areas and those with PSME/LAOC received the highest use rankings. Wolf home ranges tended to be in areas with lower road density. Travel routes showed similar habitat patterns with the exception of no response to vegetation or burned area. Travel routes occurred in areas where snow deposition was mitigated by the forest canopy.

United States Department of Agriculture,  Forest Service. 1978. Gray wolf essential habitat: northern Region

Location of Study: USFS Northern Region: MT, ID
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: Essential habitat is identified for wolves in nine National Forests in the Northern Region. Habitat is best defined in terms of areas that support moderate to high ungulate populations and areas with little human habitation or activity.
