Distribution
North America west of Rocky Mountain chain
General Habitat
variety of habitat types, including grassland, chaparral, woodland, forest, desert oases, and farmland
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Canopy Cover
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
low plant growth near water, large downed woody debris
Nestsite Characteristics
breeds in ponded wetlands,  marshes, lakes, ponds, roadside ditches, reservoirs and slow streams
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
climb in shrubs near water margin to feed on insects, feed on floating algal masses
Diet
beetles, midges, flies, hemipterans, hymenoptera
Predators
fish and other amphibians, garter snakes, egrets, herons, raccoons, skunks, opossums
Shelter Habitats
will seek refuge in piles of debris, small mammal burrows, crevices of boulders
Response to Disturbance
abundant in clear-cut stands (Bury and Corn 1988); egg and larvae abundance negatively influenced by introduced trout presence (Bull and Marx 2002)
Sources of Information used in the Model

Brattstrom, Bayard H.; Warren, James W. 1955. Observations on the ecology and behavior of the Pacific treefrog, Hyla regilla. Copeia. 3: 181-191.

Study Location: California
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: The authors documented seasonal habitat use and ecology of the Pacific treefrog. Temperature played a key role in habits and behavior. Notes on feeding, shelter, and coloration are also presented. Most feeding took place above the water's surface, either in shrubs along the water margin or on algal mats. A variety of structures, including debris and animal burrows, were used as shelter.

Study Location: northeastern Oregon
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: High elevation lakes in Oregon were surveyed to determine if amphibian abundances were related to introduced fish species, habitat characteristics, or both. Long-toed salamander and Pacific treefrog abundances were negatively affected by introduced trout, while habitat characteristics, including CWD, exerted more influence on the abundance of eggs and larvae of western toads and Columbia spotted frogs.

Study Location: Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Evidence from this study suggests that rich, abundant populations of herpetofauna occur in naturally regenerating stands in Oregon and Washington. Few differences were found in amphibians between wet, moderate, and dry old-growth sites and between young, mature, and old-growth stands. Three salamanders in Oregon were found associated with downed logs or bark on the ground or on logs. These salamanders differed in their preference for age/class of downed logs.

Study Location: Umpqua National Forest, southwestern Oregon
Habitat Description: mature PSME, with past history of thinning or salvage logging
Summary: The association between small vertebrate richness and coarse woody debris volume was tested, with a positive correlation demonstrated across all taxa and also within the taxonomic groups of small mammals, insectivores, and amphibians. A number of individual species appear to be associated with coarse woody debris; the majority of these associations were positive. No evidence of an association between snag volume and small vertebrate richness was found. Because the coarse woody debris volumes in the study area were well above regional guidelines, the author predicts reduced small vertebrate richness in those areas where coarse woody debris guidelines are strictly followed.

Study Location: northwestern California, southwestern Oregon
Habitat Description: PSME- low to mid elevations
Summary: Abundances and community composition of reptiles and amphibians were compared across forest types of coastal and inland DF forests. Habitat associations of 10 common species are given. Salamanders comprise the majority of the herpetofauna of this area. Species diversity was greater in older forest age classes with mesic conditions. A comparison of sampling methods is also presented.
