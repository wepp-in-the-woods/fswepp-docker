Distribution
along Pacific coast from southern British Columbia to northern Mexico
General Habitat
broad ecological tolerance; occurs from dry woodland habitats to moister, high-elevation forests; most abundant in pole through old growth stages
Home or Activity Range
0.002 ac (Lowe 2003)
Canopy Cover
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
large volumes of CWD of late decay stage, bark, rocks, Butts and McComb (2000) found a negative association with herb and grass cover
Nestsite Characteristics
nests usually in or under logs of conifers, majority may be underground in rodent burrows
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
no information available
Diet
arthropods
Predators
snakes
Shelter Habitats
found under rotting logs, bark, rocks; in cold or dry weather, will retreat to the interior of rotten logs and wood rat nests, or enter rooted-out root channels and the burrows of gophers and meadow mice
Response to Disturbance
more abundant on forested vs. clearcut plots as well as thinned plots (Grialou et al. 2000)

Study Location: Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Evidence from this study suggests that rich, abundant populations of herpetofauna occur in naturally regenerating stands in Oregon and Washington. Few differences were found in amphibians between wet, moderate, and dry old-growth sites and between young, mature, and old-growth stands. Three salamanders in Oregon were found associated with downed logs or bark on the ground or on logs. These salamanders differed in their preference for age/class of downed logs.

Study Location: western Oregon Cascades
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Study areas that varied widely in CWD amounts were sampled for terrestrial amphibians and small mammals. Regression models containing habitat variables were constructed for 5 species of amphibians and small mammals. As CWD volume was important to some organisms, the authors suggest a retention of CWD in the range of 100-300 m3/ha to provide habitat for most terrestrial salamanders.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: PSME, THPL, ACMA
Summary: Ensatina were found primarily under litter, moss, and dead wood. Body measurements, sex-ratios, diet, and movement were also examined.

Habitat Description: PSME, TSHE, THPL, PISI
Summary: Short-term effects of clearcut logging and thinning were studied for western, northwestern, Columbia torrent, Pacific giant and Dunn's salamanders, as well as ensatinas and rough-skinned newts. All species but Columbia torrent and Pacific giant salamanders were found on both forested and clearcut sites; these two species were only found in the forested areas. Thinning had no impacts on species' presence. Both ensatina and western redbacked salamanders were less abundant in clearcut stands and capture rates were lower after thinning.

Study Location: northwestern California
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: Habitat and movement data are presented for a sympatric population of ensatina and Del Norte salamanders. Ensatinas were most abundant in areas with deep duff and little rock cover, while Del Norte salamanders were most abundant in areas with high amounts of pebble-sized rock. Juveniles of both species were associated with down woody debris.

Study Location: northwestern California
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: This study describes the relative abundance of amphibians, reptiles and mammals in six seral stages of forest in NW California. Seral stages preferred by individual species are given (Table 2). Late brush/sapling and old growth seral stages provided the most productive wildlife habitat. Habitat components that correlated with the relative abundance of 9 species are also presented. Species that would increase or decrease in numbers after harvest of old-growth PSME forest are predicted.

Study Location: northwestern California, southwestern Oregon
Habitat Description: PSME- low to mid elevations
Summary: Abundances and community composition of reptiles and amphibians were compared across forest types of coastal and inland DF forests. Habitat associations of 10 common species are given. Salamanders comprise the majority of the herpetofauna of this area. Species diversity was greater in older forest age classes with mesic conditions. A comparison of sampling methods is also presented.
