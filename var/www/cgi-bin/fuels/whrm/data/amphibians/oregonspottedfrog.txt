Distribution
Pacific northwest
General Habitat
highly aquatic; associated with ponds, marshes, and slow-flowing streams
Home or Activity Range
&lt 1 ac (O'Neil et al. 2001)
Canopy Cover
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
aquatic sites with a shallow emergent wetland component
Nestsite Characteristics
no information available
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
no information available
Diet
insects: ants, beetles, mosquito larvae, grasshoppers; spiders, mollusks, tadpoles, crayfish, slugs
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
burrow at base of dense vegetation beneath ice; use emergent vegetation for cover and resting locations, also provides shaded conditions
Response to Disturbance
road building has eliminated breeding sites (reviewed in Bull and Wales 2001); high- and low-water events, ice events, beaver activity, livestock grazing, and introduction of exotic predators could influence populations (reviewed in Bull and Wales 2001)
Sources of Information used in the Model
no information available
General Sources of Background Information
reviewed in Bull and Wales 2001, reviewed in O'Neil et al. 2001, Stebbins 2003, Watson et al. 2003

Study Location: eastern Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: primarily PIPO
Summary: The authors review the habitat needs of amphibian species of concern in eastern Oregon and Washington, focusing on how disturbances (natural and anthropogenic) would alter habitat for these species. Species of concern include the Oregon spotted frog, Columbia spotted frog, northern leopard frog, Cascades frog, Tailed frog, Larch Mountain salamander, and Cope's giant salamander.

Study Location: Washington
Habitat Description: wetlands/pasture
Summary: Oregon spotted frogs occupied a range that included a mosaic of wetlands and a pasture. Mean home range size was 2.2 ha. Habitat use was related to season and changing surface water conditions. Wet areas were used year round. In extremely cold weather, frogs burrowed at the base of dense vegetation beneath ice. Aquatic requirements needed to complete the life cycle of this frog include 1) stable, shallow water areas for egg and tadpole survival in the breeding season, 2) deep, moderately vegetated pools for adult and juvenile survival in the dry season, and 3) shallow water levels over emergent vegetation for protecting all age classes during cold weather in the wet season.
