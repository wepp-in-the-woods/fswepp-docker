# Literature
Distribution
southwestern Oregon and northwestern California
General Habitat
most abundant in  mature/old-growth, mesic forest; low-elevation mixed conifer-hardwood forests
Home or Activity Range
0.001 ac (Lowe 2003)
Canopy Cover
closed canopy conditions (Welsh and Lind 1995)
Specific Habitat Preferences
hardwood understory, closed canopy, large trees, rocky substrates such as talus found in rock outcrops, road fills, and rubble of old riverbeds, bark, logs, and other objects on the forest floor in rocky areas, Welsh and Lind (1995) found a negative correlation with herb cover
Nestsite Characteristics
eggs hidden in cavities
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
litter from hardwood understory (other trees in model = tanoaks) may support terrestrial insect populations
Diet
small terrestrial insects
Predators
No information available
Shelter Habitats
closed canopy and hardwood understory provide cool and stable microclimate; found under rocks, bark, logs and other objects on forest floor
Response to Disturbance
No information available
Sources of Information used in the Model

General Sources of Background Information

Study Location: northwestern California
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: Habitat and movement data are presented for a sympatric population of ensatina and Del Norte salamanders. Ensatinas were most abundant in areas with deep duff and little rock cover, while Del Norte salamanders were most abundant in areas with high amounts of pebble-sized rock. Juveniles of both species were associated with down woody debris.

Study Location: northwestern California
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: This study describes the relative abundance of amphibians, reptiles and mammals in six seral stages of forest in NW California. Seral stages preferred by individual species are given (Table 2). Late brush/sapling and old growth seral stages provided the most productive wildlife habitat. Habitat components that correlated with the relative abundance of 9 species are also presented. Species that would increase or decrease in numbers after harvest of old-growth PSME forest are predicted.

Study Location: northwestern California, southwestern Oregon
Habitat Description: PSME- low to mid elevations
Summary: Abundances and community composition of reptiles and amphibians were compared across forest types of coastal and inland DF forests. Habitat associations of 10 common species are given. Salamanders comprise the majority of the herpetofauna of this area. Species diversity was greater in older forest age classes with mesic conditions. A comparison of sampling methods is also presented.

Study Location: northwestern California
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: Populations of Del Norte salamanders were sampled across a successional continuum to determine habitat associations at a variety of scales. Greater slope was the only landscape variable associated with salamander abundance. At the macrohabitat scale, salamanders were associated with areas with older trees and more small hardwoods, including hardwoods in the understory and shrubs. Fern and moss density was higher and herb and medium-sized rock density was lower on sites with salamanders. The amount of closed canopy, relative humidity and cobble presence were also included in one modeling scheme. This study verifies the association of Del Norte salamanders with late seral stage forest.
