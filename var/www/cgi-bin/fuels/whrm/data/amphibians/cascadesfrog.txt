Distribution
the inner coastal ranges of Washington, Oregon and into northern California
General Habitat
closely associated with water, most common in small pools adjacent to streams flowing through subalpine meadows
Home or Activity Range
&lt 2.5 ac (O'Neil et al. 2001)
Canopy Cover
open areas (Fellers and Drost 1993)
Specific Habitat Preferences
water, grass, ferns, and other low herbaceous growth, and open areas
Nestsite Characteristics
egg mass is unattached to vegetation and lies partially submerged in shallow water
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
no information available
Diet
invertebrates
Predators
non-native fish
Shelter Habitats
escape predators by swimming; conceal themselves under woody debris, in mud, or in dense emergent vegetation
Response to Disturbance
negatively impacted by exotic fish species introduction and grazing (reviewed in Sallabanks et al. 2003); high- and low-water events, ice events, beaver activity, livestock grazing, and introduction of exotic predators could influence populations (reviewed in Bull and Wales 2001)
Sources of Information used in the Model
no information available
General Sources of Background Information
Leonard et al. 1993, reviewed in Bull and Wales 2001, reviewed in Sallabanks et al. 2003, Stebbins 2003
Summaries of Specific Studies
Bull, Evelyn; Wales, Barbara C. 2001. Effects of disturbance on amphibians of conservation concern in eastern Oregon and Washington. Northwest Science. 75:174-179.

Study Location: eastern Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: primarily PIPO
Summary: The authors review the habitat needs of amphibian species of concern in eastern Oregon and Washington, focusing on how disturbances (natural and anthropogenic) would alter habitat for these species. Species of concern include the Oregon spotted frog, Columbia spotted frog, northern leopard frog, Cascades frog, Tailed frog, Larch Mountain salamander, and Cope's giant salamander.

Fellers, Gary M.; Drost, Charles A. 1993. Disappearance of the Cascades frog Rana cascadae at the southern end of its range, California, USA. Biological Conservation. 65: 177-181.

Study Location: northern California
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: The authors documented a major decline in Cascades frog populations, which they attribute to predation by exotic fish, reduction of breeding habitat due to drought, and loss of open meadows and associated aquatic habitats.
