Study Location: southeastern Idaho
Habitat Description: conifer forests: Pinus, Picea, Abies
Summary: Western toad habitat selection and movement were examined, with an emphasis on testing for a biophysical basis o habitat selection. Toads that used primarily terrestrial habitats used rodent burrows and other microsites sheltered by shrubs and coarse woody debris. Selected macrohabitat patches had high shrub cover. Clearcuts were selected against. Sites with low contrast along edges were selected for, while sites with high contrast along edges were selected against. The hypothesis that habitat selection has a biophysical basis was supported.

Study Location: northeastern Oregon
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: High elevation lakes in Oregon were surveyed to determine if amphibian abundances were related to introduced fish species, habitat characteristics, or both. Long-toed salamander and Pacific treefrog abundances were negatively affected by introduced trout, while habitat characteristics, including CWD, exerted more influence on the abundance of eggs and larvae of western toads and Columbia spotted frogs.

Study Location: British Columbia
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Western toads are found in a variety of habitat types, including forests, wetlands, clearcuts, and meadows/grasslands. Breeding takes place in a variety of natural and artificial aquatic habitats, with or without tree or shrub canopy cover, coarse woody debris, or emergent vegetation. Summer ranges include a combination of upland and wetlands areas. Areas with dense shrub cover offer protection from desiccation and predation. Open areas (clearcuts) may be used for basking locations. Hibernation takes place under debris or in animal burrows.
