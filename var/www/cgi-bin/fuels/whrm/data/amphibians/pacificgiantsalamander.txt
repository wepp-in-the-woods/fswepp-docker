coastal northern California north into coastal Oregon and Washington, as well as inner coastal Washington
General Habitat
mature/old growth moist forests in the vicinity of cold, clear streams and mountain lakes
Home or Activity Range

Canopy Cover
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
permanent and semipermanent streams in forested areas, also rivers, mountain lakes, and ponds; terrestrially logs, bark and rocks in moist coniferous forests

insects, slugs, snails, worms, other amphibians, snakes and small mammals such as shrews and mice
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
under logs, bark and rocks
Response to Disturbance
found in forested but not clearcut areas (Grialou et al. 2000); no difference in larval abundance was found based on stand age (Steele and MacCracken 2002)
Sources of Information used in the Model

Gomez, D.M.; Anthony, R.G. 1996. Amphibian and reptile abundance in riparian and upslope areas of five forest types in western Oregon. Northwest Science. 70:109-119.

Study Location: central Coast Ranges, Oregon
Habitat Description: 5 forest types, from young to old PSME (includes TSHE), as well as one deciduous forest type
Summary: Amphibian and reptile populations were studied in five forest types. Amphibian species richness was the highest in pole stands, followed by old growth. Abundance was highest in the deciduous forest type. Reptile species richness and abundance was highest in the shrub forest type. Stream and upslope habitats were similar in species richness, while more amphibians were caught in stream habitats and more reptiles were caught in upslope habitats. Capture rates for different species are given by forest type.

Study Location: southwestern Washington
Habitat Description: PSME, TSHE, THPL, PISI
Summary: Short-term effects of clearcut logging and thinning were studied for western, northwestern, Columbia torrent, Pacific giant and Dunn's salamanders, as well as ensatinas and rough-skinned newts. All species but Columbia torrent and Pacific giant salamanders were found on both forested and clearcut sites; these two species were only found in the forested areas. Thinning had no impacts on species' presence. Both ensatina and western redbacked salamanders were less abundant in clearcut stands and capture rates were lower after thinning.

Study Location: southern Washington
Habitat Description: regenerating second-growth PSME
Summary: This study was unable to detect differences in Copes and Pacific giant salamander larval abundance based on forest age or any other habitat variable.

Study Location: northwestern California, southwestern Oregon
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Spatial, structural, compositional, and climatic attributes of the forest and stream environment were measured to determine key habitat relationships for amphibians. The highest abundance of tailed frogs were found in late seral forests, which also had the highest amphibian diversity. Tailed frogs were associated with a high herb component in the understory, but exhibited a negative associated with overhanging bank cover. Overall, the authors found stream temperature to be more important that forest structure. Tailed frogs were patchily distributed, while Pacific Giant salamanders were more generally distributed. Only in-stream conditions were good predictors of giant salamander density, though they avoided grassy areas and hardwood understory at the macrohabitat level.

Study Location: southwestern Washington
Habitat Description: PSME-TSHE
Summary: Habitat characteristics were related to the occurrence and abundance of Cope's and Pacific giant salamanders, tailed frogs, Columbia torrent salamanders, western red-backed salamanders, Dunn's salamanders, and Van Dyke's salamanders. Giant salamanders increased in abundance in streams with increasing pool frequency and with large woody debris accumulation in adjacent riparian areas, and decreased with large woody debris in channels. Torrent salamanders responded to increased channel gradient and decreased basin area. Overall, habitat quality for many of these species was tied to landform characteristics, including basin lithology.
