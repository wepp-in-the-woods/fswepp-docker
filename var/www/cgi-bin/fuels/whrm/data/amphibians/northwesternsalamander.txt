Study Location: Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Evidence from this study suggests that rich, abundant populations of herpetofauna occur in naturally regenerating stands in Oregon and Washington. Few differences were found in amphibians between wet, moderate, and dry old-growth sites and between young, mature, and old-growth stands. Three salamanders in Oregon were found associated with downed logs or bark on the ground or on logs. These salamanders differed in their preference for age/class of downed logs.

Study Location: southwestern Washington
Habitat Description: PSME, TSHE. THPL. PISI
Summary: Short-term effects of clearcut logging and thinning were studied for western, northwestern, Columbia torrent, Pacific giant and Dunn's salamanders, as well as ensatinas and rough-skinned newts. All species but Columbia torrent and Pacific giant salamanders were found on both forested and clearcut sites; these two species were only found in the forested areas. Thinning had no impacts on species' presence. Both ensatina and western redbacked salamanders were less abundant in clearcut stands and capture rates were lower after thinning.
