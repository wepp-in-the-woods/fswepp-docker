Distribution
coastal Washington, south into northwestern Oregon
General Habitat
larvae and neotone inhabit small, cold, rocky streams and seeps; adults found in surface debris on the margins of water
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Canopy Cover
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
cold rocky streams, seepages, mountain lakes and ponds, usually in moist coniferous forest
Nestsite Characteristics
lays eggs in underwater chambers formed between large rocks or under large, woody debris
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
no information available
Diet
insects, fish, eggs, and larvae of their own and tailed frogs
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
concealed during the day beneath rocks or other hidden cavities in the stream
Response to Disturbance
a loss of canopy cover from forest insects, tree disease, or fire would likely have a detrimental effect as stream temperatures would rise and sedimentation would increase (reviewed in Bull and Wales 2001); no difference in larval abundance was found based on stand age (Steele and MacCracken 2002)
Sources of Information used in the Model

General Sources of Background Information
Leonard et al. 1993, Wilkins and Peterson 2000, reviewed in O'Neill et al. 2001, Steele and MacCracken 2002, Stebbins 2003

Study Location: eastern Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: primarily PIPO
Summary: The authors review the habitat needs of amphibian species of concern in eastern Oregon and Washington, focusing on how disturbances (natural and anthropogenic) would alter habitat for these species. Species of concern include the Oregon spotted frog, Columbia spotted frog, northern leopard frog, Cascades frog, Tailed frog, Larch Mountain salamander, and Cope's giant salamander.

Study Location: southern Washington
Habitat Description: regenerating second-growth PSME
Summary: This study was unable to detect differences in Copes and Pacific giant salamander larval abundance based on forest age or any other habitat variable.

Study Location: southwestern Washington
Habitat Description: PSME-TSHE
Summary: Habitat characteristics were related to the occurrence and abundance of Cope's and Pacific giant salamanders, tailed frogs, Columbia torrent salamanders, western red-backed salamanders, Dunn's salamanders, and Van Dyke's salamanders. Giant salamanders increased in abundance in streams with increasing pool frequency and with large woody debris accumulation in adjacent riparian areas, and decreased with large woody debris in channels. Torrent salamanders responded to increased channel gradient and decreased basin area. Overall, habitat quality for many of these species was tied to landform characteristics, including basin lithology.
