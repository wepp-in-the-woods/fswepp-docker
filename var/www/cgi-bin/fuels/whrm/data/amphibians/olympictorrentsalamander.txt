Study Location: southwestern Washington
Habitat Description: PSME, TSHE. THPL. PISI
Summary: Short-term effects of clearcut logging and thinning were studied for western, northwestern, Columbia torrent, Pacific giant and Dunn's salamanders, as well as ensatinas and rough-skinned newts. All species but Columbia torrent and Pacific giant salamanders were found on both forested and clearcut sites; these two species were only found in the forested areas. Thinning had no impacts on species' presence. Both ensatina and western redbacked salamanders were less abundant in clearcut stands and capture rates were lower after thinning.

Study Location: northwestern California, southwestern Oregon
Habitat Description: PSME- low to mid elevations
Summary: Abundances and community composition of reptiles and amphibians were compared across forest types of coastal and inland DF forests. Habitat associations of 10 common species are given. Salamanders comprise the majority of the herpetofauna of this area. Species diversity was greater in older forest age classes with mesic conditions. A comparison of sampling methods is also presented.
