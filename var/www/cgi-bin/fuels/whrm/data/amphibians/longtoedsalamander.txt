Distribution
northwestern USA north into western Canada and southern Alaska
General Habitat
frequents a variety of habitats, including semiarid sagebrush, cheatgrass plains, alpine meadows, barren rocky shores of high mountain lakes
Home or Activity Range
0.3-0.7 ac  (Sheppard 1977)
Canopy Cover
closed canopy conditions; there was a 70% reduction in salamander numbers in stands that had the canopy opened by logging (Naughton et al. 2000)
Specific Habitat Preferences
piles of rotten wood, rotting logs, rocks, and other objects near quiet water of shallow ponds, lakes, or streams
Nestsite Characteristics
breeds in ponds, some not completely free of ice; eggs are attached to vegetation, sticks or rocks, predominantly in temporary pools
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
no information available
Diet
larvae eat small invertebrates (copepods and fairy shrimp), also young Pacific Tree frog tadpoles and smaller long-toed salamander larvae
Predators
introduced fish
Shelter Habitats
found in piles of rotten wood, under bark, rotting logs, rocks, and other objects near quiet water of ponds, lakes, or streams; shrubs, forbs and small trees provide cover that reduces dessication
Response to Disturbance
overstory removal and new forestry harvest treatments reduced the abundance of adult salamanders to 25% of the intact stands, and adults were larger on treated stands (McGraw 1995); salamander populations were 70% lower in new forestry and overstory removal stands compared to intact stands (Naughton et al. 2000); egg and larvae abundance negatively influenced by introduced trout presence (Bull and Marx 2002)

Study Location: northeastern Oregon
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: High elevation lakes in Oregon were surveyed to determine if amphibian abundances were related to introduced fish species, habitat characteristics, or both. Long-toed salamander and Pacific treefrog abundances were negatively affected by introduced trout, while habitat characteristics, including CWD, exerted more influence on the abundance of eggs and larvae of western toads and Columbia spotted frogs.

Study Location: Alberta
Habitat Description: variety reviewed
Summary: Long-toed salamanders are clumped in distribution in Alberta, and are usually associated with low mountain passes or rivers. In the Montane Ecoregion, they are associated with closed canopy PICO/PSME forest. Preferred terrestrial habitat includes well-drained areas with a thick litter layer and close proximity to water. The main limiting factors to salamander populations appear to be the presence of predatory fish in breeding ponds, human disturbance (roads) between breeding areas and terrestrial habitat, and collection of adults by humans. Habitat alteration associated with forestry and mining do not appear to have serious long-term impacts on salamander populations.

Study Location: northwestern Montana
Habitat Description: PSME-dominated
Summary: The relative abundance of metamorphosed and larval long-toed salamanders was examined in both intact sites and sites that had been harvested with new forestry or overstory removal harvest techniques. Both harvest treatments reduced the abundance of salamanders to 25% of the intact stands. Salamanders that survived the treatments were larger than those found on intact sites. The author attributes this pattern to the ability of larger salamanders to withstand dessication, the risk of which is higher in treated areas. Larval salamanders did not exhibit a clear pattern of response to harvest, but were more abundant in smaller ponds where diversity of invertebrate predators and competitors was the lowest.

Study Location: western Montana
Habitat Description: PSME, PICO, LAOC, PIPO,PIEN
Summary: Long-toed salamander populations were examined in intact, environmentally harvested, and overstory-removal harvest sites. Logged stands contained fewer salamanders regardless of harvest type; the number of salamanders on intact sites was three times as high as the number on logged sites. Lower amphibian numbers were linked to a decrease in the number of large, live trees, and not to changes in understory vegetation, snags or debris which were not affected with logging. The authors believe that the decrease was due to changes in the physical environment, including increased temperatures and decreased moisture.
