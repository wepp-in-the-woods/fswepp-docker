Summaries of Specific Studies
Diller, Lowell V.; Wallace, Richard L. 1996. Comparative ecology of two snake species (Crotalus viridis and Pituophis melanoleucus) in southwestern Idaho. Herpetologica. 52(3): 343- 360.

Study Location: southwestern Idaho
Habitat Description: sagebrush, greasewood
Summary: Activity patterns, body temperature, habitat and diet were compared between the western rattlesnake and gopher snake. Overlap in resource use was high. Western rattlesnakes were found primarily in rocky habitats, while the gopher snake was more widely distributed.  Similarly, the rattlesnake was more specialized in diet (Townsend's ground squirrels) than the gopher snake.
