Summaries of Specific Studies
Marcellini, D.; Mackey, J.P. 1970. Habitat preferences of the lizards Sceloporus occidentalis and S. graciosus (Lacertilia, Iguanidae). Herpetologica. 26: 51-56.

Study Location: northern California
Habitat Description: PSMA, manzanita shrubs, grass
Summary: Habitat preferences were determined for the northern sagebrush lizard and the northwestern fence lizard. The sagebrush lizard was found to be completely terrestrial, preferring shrubby and open areas. The northwestern fence lizard was partially arboreal and had more varied habitat preferences.

Morrison, Michael L; Hall, Linnea S. 1999. Habitat characteristics of reptiles in pinyon-juniper woodland. Great Basin Naturalist. 59(3): 288-291. 

Study Location: White Mountains, California
Habitat Description: pinyon-juniper
Summary: Lizard abundance was correlated to habitat in a pinyon-juniper woodland. Western whiptails were found near slope bottoms and had more bare ground, fewer pinyon trees, and more juniper trees. Sagebrush and western fence lizards were abundant everywhere, though western fence lizard tended to be associated with dense patches of pinyon trees. 

Rose, Barbera R. 1976. Habitat and prey selection of Sceloporus occidentalis and S. graciosus. Ecology. 57: 531-541.

Study Location: California
Habitat Description: mixture: foothill woodland, yellow pine (PIPO) forest, chaparral
Summary: Resource use and habitat selection were studied for sympatric populations of sagebrush and western fence lizards. An isolated population of sagebrush lizards was also examined for comparison. The species overlapped in prey selection, though the sagebrush lizard tended to select smaller prey. There was distinct habitat selection, and within a habitat, between structural microhabitats. The western fence lizard was found more in grass-oak woodlands, and creek areas, while the sagebrush lizard preferred the more exposed habitats like a wide creek bottom, rock outcrops, and talus slopes. Western fence lizards were frequently found on logs or bushes, which sagebrush lizards tended to be found on rocks or rock outcrops.
