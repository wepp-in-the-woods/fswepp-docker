Larsen, Karl W. 1987. Movements and behavior of migratory garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis. Canadian Journal of Zoology. 65: 2241-2247.

Study Location: northern Alberta/Northwest Territories
Habitat Description: boreal forest/Populus
Summary: Migrational movements of the common garter snake were documented. Emerging snakes moved to the closest freshwater marsh. Movements occurred on a constant bearing. Daily movements ranged from < 50 m to over 1 km. Overnight retreats included brush piles, logs, tree root systems, and clumps or willow or grass. Stomach contents were also documented; amphibians were the most common food item.
