Smith, Geoffrey R. 1996. Habitat use and fidelity in the striped plateau lizard Sceloporus virgatus. American Midland Naturalist. 135:68-80.

Study Location: Chiricahua Mountains, southeastern Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO/oak woodland
Summary: Habitat preferences and fidelity to habitats, slope, and substrate were examined for the striped plateau lizard. The substrates most commonly used by striped plateau lizards included rocks and logs; trees were never used. Most of the lizards were observed in woods habitat as opposed to rock slide habitat. Individuals tended to use one type of substrate, one type of habitat, and one slope in a given year. Substrate preference changed for individuals from year to year more often than it stayed the same, while habitat and slope remained constant. The author suggests that habitat and slope would be a more appropriate scale than substrate for considering potential differences in individuals.

Study Location: Chiricahua Mountains, southeastern Arizona
Habitat Description: pine-oak woodland and slide habitat
Summary: Observations were made on lizard habitat and substrate use on different slopes and habitat types. Habitat use between woodland and slide habitat did not vary by month, while substrate use did. The use of rock substrates decreased while the use of ground and log substrates increased throughout the activity season. The author attributes such a shift to changes in thermoregulation.

Study Location: Chiricahua Mountains, southeastern Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO/oak woodland
Summary: Striped plateau lizards differed in life history traits based on their habitat. Lizards on north-facing slopes were larger and grew faster than those on south slopes. Those living in covered woods grew faster than those on open slides. Survivorship was generally higher in woods than in slides. Females living in woods or south-facing slopes tended to reproduce more often in their first year. Woods, which had more trees and logs than slides, had much higher arthropod prey than slides.
