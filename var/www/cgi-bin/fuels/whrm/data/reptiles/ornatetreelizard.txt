Response to Disturbance
captured in greater abundance in forest burned by stand-replacing wildfire compared to unburned forest (Cunningham et al. 2002)

Study Location: central Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO and mixed conifer at high elevations, interior chaparral and Sonoran desert scrub at lower elevations
Summary: Reptile species were trapped in burned and unburned chaparral and forest plots for 3 years after a wildfire. This study found that the majority of founders were fire-survivors. Relative abundance of animals was 10 times greater in burned areas; species richness and diversity were also higher. In the forested areas, reptile abundance was 4-9 times greater in burned than unburned forest. The relative abundance of individual species in burned and unburned forest is presented. The overall preference for burned areas could be attributed to a variety of factors, including an increase in food resources. The results of this study are short-term in nature; inference is limited and additional work should be done to further examine the patterns found.

Study Location: Colorado
Habitat Description: pinyon-juniper
Summary: Microhabitat differences within an assemblage of phyronosomatine lizard species were characterized. The microhabitat of the ornate tree lizard was different from all others in that it used a higher perch height and more vertical substrate (dead standing and prone trees), indicative of its arboreal nature. The sagebrush lizard used areas with more flatland, more prone dead trees, and less rock, indicative of its preference for more open, sandy areas within the woodland.  No significant distinguishing microhabitat variables were found for the eastern fence lizard or the side-blotched lizard.

Study Location: Colorado
Habitat Description: pinyon-juniper
Summary: Primary objectives included quantifying the phyrnosomatid lizard preference for dead trees, examine differences in use among species, and to explore conservation implications of findings. The eastern fence lizard, ornate tree lizard, sagebrush lizard and the side-blotched lizard all used dead trees more than expected based on availability. The ornate tree lizard used dead standing wood more than dead prone wood (it did use both), but there was no significant difference for the other species.

Study Location: Colorado
Habitat Description: pinyon-juniper
Summary: Differences in the distribution and behavior were quantified for the eastern fence lizard, ornate tree lizard, and the side-blotched lizard in two habitats in pinyon-juniper woodland. Density and community interaction was highest on rock ridges dissecting the woodland than in surrounding flat, open areas. Larger lizards resided in the rock habitat. Juveniles were found more often in the surrounding open areas. The authors attribute the patterns to aggressive exclusion and predation of hatchlings in the rocky habitat.

Study Location: southeast Arizona
Habitat Description: creekbed with pine/oak woodland
Summary: Observations on body size and habitat use are described for the ornate tree lizard for a creekbed site that contained both open slide and closed wood habitat. This population used both north and south slopes equally. They were present in the habitat types in proportion to availability. Individuals in the woods habitat were longer and heavier than those from the open slide habitat. The author hypothesizes that this pattern could result from greater food abundance in the wooded habitat, or from behavioral interactions between large and small individuals.
