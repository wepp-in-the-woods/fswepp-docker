Distribution
western USA from eastern Washington, southern Idaho, southern Montana and extreme western North Dakota to northwestern New Mexico and northern Baja California
General Habitat
sagebrush plains, also stands of greasewood or other desert shrubs, open juniper or pine woodlands with brushy cover, may occur in rocky areas
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Canopy Cover
low canopy cover (Rose 1976); has higher abundance and reproductive success in low cover areas (Germaine and Germaine 2003)
Specific Habitat Preferences
brushy, rocky areas; occurs in areas with low canopy cover, low duff cover, low rock and log density, and high forb cover
Nestsite Characteristics
bury eggs in loose soil at the base of a shrub
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
may forage on logs and snags
Diet
stalk a variety of insects and other invertebrates
Predators
snakes (racers and striped whipsnakes), avian predators
Shelter Habitats
use shrubs, snags or logs for cover when disturbed
Response to Disturbance
no information available

Study Location: northern Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: The relative abundance, demography, and reproductive success of sagebrush lizards and western skinks were assessed in a PIPO forest. Sagebrush lizard were widely distributed, but reproductive success and hatchling abundance were highest in the most open cover and stand types, and lowest in pure ponderosa cover and dense ponderosa stands. Western skink abundance differed among stand types by age class; overall they were more abundant in forest cover types than meadows. Both species were present in plots with lower percent duff cover. Increased tree density, canopy closure, and litter accumulation influenced distributions of both lizards. Abundance and reproduction appeared to be optimized in habitat with features most similar to that present prior to fire suppression and in areas containing a deciduous tree component.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: shrub-steppe: big sagebrush, bitterbrush, rabbitbrush, needle-and-thread grass, cheatgrass
Summary: Northern sagebrush lizards showed some shrub species preference in habitat, mainly for tall shrub species. Animals chose areas with higher bare soil coverage and significantly lower coverage of grass, litter, and lichen. Sandy soil types were also preferred.

Study Location: Colorado
Habitat Description: pinyon-juniper
Summary: Microhabitat differences within an assemblage of phyronosomatine lizard species were characterized. The microhabitat of the ornate tree lizard was different from all others in that it used a higher perch height and more vertical substrate (dead standing and prone trees), indicative of its arboreal nature. The sagebrush lizard used areas with more flatland, more prone dead trees, and less rock, indicative of its preference for more open, sandy areas within the woodland.  No significant distinguishing microhabitat variables were found for the eastern fence lizard or the side-blotched lizard.

Study Location: Colorado
Habitat Description: pinyon-juniper
Summary: Primary objectives included quantifying the phyrnosomatid lizard preference for dead trees, examine differences in use among species, and to explore conservation implications of findings. The eastern fence lizard, ornate tree lizard, sagebrush lizard and the side-blotched lizard all used dead trees more than expected based on availability. The ornate tree lizard used dead standing wood more than dead prone wood (it did use both), but there was no significant difference for the other species.

Study Location: northern California
Habitat Description: PSMA, manzanita shrubs, grass
Summary: Habitat preferences were determined for the northern sagebrush lizard and the northwestern fence lizard. The sagebrush lizard was found to be completely terrestrial, preferring shrubby and open areas. The northwestern fence lizard was partially arboreal and had more varied habitat preferences.

Study Location: White Mountains, California
Habitat Description: pinyon-juniper
Summary: Lizard abundance was correlated to habitat in a pinyon-juniper woodland. Western whiptails were found near slope bottoms and had more bare ground, fewer pinyon trees, and more juniper trees. Sagebrush and western fence lizards were abundant everywhere, though western fence lizard tended to be associated with dense patches of pinyon trees.

Study Location: California
Habitat Description: mixture: foothill woodland, yellow pine (PIPO) forest, chaparral
Summary: Resource use and habitat selection were studied for sympatric populations of sagebrush and western fence lizards. An isolated population of sagebrush lizards was also examined for comparison. The species overlapped in prey selection, though the sagebrush lizard tended to select smaller prey. There was distinct habitat selection, and within a habitat, between structural microhabitats. The western fence lizard was found more in grass-oak woodlands, and creek areas, while the sagebrush lizard preferred the more exposed habitats like a wide creek bottom, rock outcrops, and talus slopes. Western fence lizards were frequently found on logs or bushes, which sagebrush lizards tended to be found on rocks or rock outcrops.
