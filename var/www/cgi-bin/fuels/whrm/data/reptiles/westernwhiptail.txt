Distribution
western USA as far north as Oregon and Idaho and south into Mexico, with many sub-species
General Habitat
deserts and semiarid habitats, including deserts, montane pine forests, woodland and streamside growth
Home or Activity Range
< 1 ac (O'Neil et al. 2001)
Canopy Cover
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
sparse plants, open areas for running, avoids dense grasslands and thick shrub growth, slope bottoms, avoiding dense pinyon but favoring dense juniper (Morrison and Hall 1999)
Nestsite Characteristics
eggs are laid underground
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
ground-forager
Diet
grasshoppers, Lepidoptera (adults and larvae), beetles, spiders, Homoptera, bugs, termites, scorpions, lizards
Predators
no information available
Shelter Habitats
run to a shrub and move under its shelter to sneak away from the other side; also retreat to burrows
Response to Disturbance
captured in forest burned by stand-replacing wildfire- not in unburned forest (Cunningham et al. 2002)
Sources of Information used in the Model
Burkholder and Walker 1973, Morrison and Hall 1999
General Sources of Background Information
Burkholder and Walker 1973, Storm and Leonard 1995, Morrison and Hall 1999, reviewed in O'Neil et al. 2001, Cunningham et al. 2002, Stebbins 2003

Study Location: southwestern Idaho
Habitat Description: not stated; includes sagebrush species
Summary: In southwestern Idaho, the whiptail lizard inhabited low hills and flat areas dominated by sparse vegetation, with some shrub cover. Lizards used rodent burrows or dug burrows at the base of shrubs for protection. Shrubs also provided areas for foraging and open areas were used for basking.

Study Location: central Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO and mixed conifer at high elevations, interior chaparral and Sonoran desert scrub at lower elevations
Summary: Reptile species were trapped in burned and unburned chaparral and forest plots for 3 years after a wildfire. This study found that the majority of founders were fire-survivors. Relative abundance of animals was 10 times greater in burned areas; species richness and diversity were also higher. In the forested areas, reptile abundance was 4-9 times greater in burned than unburned forest. The relative abundance of individual species in burned and unburned forest is presented. The overall preference for burned areas could be attributed to a variety of factors, including an increase in food resources. The results of this study are short-term in nature; inference is limited and additional work should be done to further examine the patterns found.

Study Location: White Mountains, California
Habitat Description: pinyon-juniper
Summary: Lizard abundance was correlated to habitat in a pinyon-juniper woodland. Western whiptails were found near slope bottoms and had more bare ground, fewer pinyon trees, and more juniper trees. Sagebrush and western fence lizards were abundant everywhere, though western fence lizard tended to be associated with dense patches of pinyon trees.
