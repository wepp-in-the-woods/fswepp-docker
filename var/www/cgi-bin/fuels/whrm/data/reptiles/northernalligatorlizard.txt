Summaries of Specific Studies
Gomez, D.M.; Anthony, R.G. 1996. Amphibian and reptile abundance in riparian and upslope areas of five forest types in western Oregon. Northwest Science. 70:109-119.

Study Location: central Coast Ranges, Oregon
Habitat Description: 5 forest types, from young to old PSME (includes TSHE), as well as one deciduous forest type
Summary: Amphibian and reptile populations were studied in five forest types. Amphibian species richness was the highest in pole stands, followed by old growth. Abundance was highest in the deciduous forest type. Reptile species richness and abundance was highest in the shrub forest type. Stream and upslope habitats were similar in species richness, while more amphibians were caught in stream habitats and more reptiles were caught in upslope habitats. Capture rates for different species are given by forest type.

Study Location: southeastern British Columbia
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME, aspen
Summary: Northern alligator lizards and western skinks often used the same habitat, and no seasonal migration was observed. Both species were rarely found in the open, hiding more often under rocks than vegetation or logs. They remained close to shrubs and forest edges. Most lizards associated with grass and moss. Northern alligator lizards are associated with clearings.
