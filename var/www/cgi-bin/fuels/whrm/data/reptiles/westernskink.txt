Germaine, Stephen S.; Germaine, Heather L. 2003. Lizard distributions and reproductive success in a ponderosa pine forest. Journal of Herpetology. 37(4): 645-652.

Study Location: northern Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: The relative abundance, demography, and reproductive success of sagebrush lizards and western skinks were assessed in a PIPO forest. Sagebrush lizard were widely distributed, but reproductive success and hatchling abundance were highest in the most open cover and stand types, and lowest in pure ponderosa cover and dense ponderosa stands. Western skink abundance differed among stand types by age class; overall they were more abundant in forest cover types than meadows. Both species were present in plots with lower percent duff cover. Increased tree density, canopy closure, and litter accumulation influenced distributions of both lizards. Abundance and reproduction appeared to be optimized in habitat with features most similar to that present prior to fire suppression and in areas containing a deciduous tree component.

Study Location: Inyo-White Mountains, California
Habitat Description: pinyon-juniper
Summary: Habitat associations were studied for sympatric populations of Gilbert's and western skinks in a pinyon-juniper woodland. The only variable that differed between the trapping of the two species was slope. Both skink species were captured in areas of greater shrub litter, less juniper litter, and less coarse gravel. The litter is often used for burrowing.

Study Location: southeastern British Columbia
Habitat Description: PIPO, PSME, aspen
Summary: Northern alligator lizards and western skinks often used the same habitat, and no seasonal migration was observed. Both species were rarely found in the open, hiding more often under rocks than vegetation or logs. They remained close to shrubs and forest edges. Most lizards associated with grass and moss. Northern alligator lizards are associated with clearings.
