# Literature
Distribution
northern Baja California north to the Puget Sound in original range; now rare in Puget Sound region
General Habitat
permanent and intermittent waters including marshes, streams, rivers, ponds and lakes
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Canopy Cover
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
large amounts of emergent logs,  boulders or emergent vegetation for basking
Nestsite Characteristics
most nests within 100 yards of water; bury eggs in sand or hardpan and conceal with soil and low vegetation
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
no information available
Diet
omnivorous; diet includes insects, crayfish, other aquatic invertebrates, fishes, tadpoles, frogs, carrion, filamentous algae, lily pads, tule and cattail roots
Predators
river otter, mink, coyote, fox
Shelter Habitats
will dive in water, also seek shelter behind shrubs and trees
Response to Disturbance
damming caused patches of unsuitable habitat where turtle abundance was low (Reese and Welsh 1998)
Sources of Information used in the Model

Summaries of Specific Studies
Holland, Dan C.; Goodman, Robert H. Jr. 1996. Clemmys marmorata (Western pond turtle) Terrestrial habitat use. Herpetological Review. 27(4): 198-199.

Study Location: California
Habitat Description: rock crevice near water
Summary: An unusual use of terrestrial habitat was noted for the western pond turtle, when a group of animals were found using a rock crevice as a shelter. Western pond turtles often seek refuge under rocks, logs, submerged and emergent vegetation, or in undercut banks.

Reese, Devin A.; Welsh, Hartwell H. Jr. 1998. Habitat use by western pond turtles in the Trinity River, California. Journal of Wildlife Management. 62(3): 842-853.

Study Location: California
Habitat Description: not stated
Summary: Habitat associations of the western pond turtle were examined in a dammed and undammed tributary of the Trinity River. In both locations, turtles selected for deep water with low velocities and the presence of underwater refugia. Turtles were associated with basking structures on the dammed portion, while they were associated with dense canopy cover and higher stream temperatures in the undammed section. The importance of large woody debris for cover and protection is stressed. Dense streambank canopy also appears to be important (appears to be riparian vegetation, not necessarily tree canopy).
