eastern Nevada, Utah, Arizona, northeast Colorado
General Habitat
extensive conifer forests, including PP- but only when large rocks or cliffs are present; pinyon pine-juniper slopes
Home or Activity Range
no information available
Canopy Cover
No information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
open sunny forests with an abundance of herbaceous and shrubby plants and many logs, snags, stumps, rocks and cliffs
Nestsite Characteristics
underground, in old logs, rocks, and cavities in snags
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
logs, debris, snags, well developed shrubby and herbaceous layers, rocky habitats, areas with cone-producing trees
Diet
omnivores: seeds, nuts, fruits, bulbs, roots, herbiage, insects, other animal matter
Predators
snags, downed logs and woody debris for predator avoidance
Shelter Habitats
No information available
Response to Disturbance
highest density on intensely thinned PIPO stands (Goodwin and Hungerford 1979)
Sources of Information used in the Model

General Sources of Background Information

Study Location:  Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description:  PIPO
Summary:  Small mammals were trapped in PIPO forest stands that had undergone a variety of treatments, including strip shelterwood cutting, clear-cutting, severe thinning, and no treatment. Habitat relationships and diet composition are given for a variety of small mammals. The populations of some small mammals, particularly deer mice, were higher on treated plots than untreated plots; the presence of slash and other debris as well as the prevalence of food items (forbs and grasses) seems to be responsible for this pattern.

Habitat Description:  review
Summary:  Habitat needs of a variety of northern goshawk prey are identified by a literature review. Management recommendations are made in regard to nesting, foraging, and other life history attributes.

Rompola, Kevin M.; Anderson, Stanley H. 2004. Habitat of three rare species of small mammals in juniper woodlands of southwestern Wyoming. Western North American Naturalist. 64(1): 86-92.

Study Location:  southwestern Wyoming
Habitat Description:  juniper, big sagebrush, pinyon pine, mountain mahogany
Summary: Habitat characteristics were identified for cliff chipmunks, pinyon mice and canyon mice in a juniper-pinyon pine woodland. Cliff chipmunks were present in rocky slopes and cliffs where grasses and forbs were abundant for foraging. Pinyon mouse densities were related to rocky slopes and cliffs, in areas where canopy closure was high and forb density was low, though the authors believed in general that pinyon mice in their study area were occupying sub-optimal habitat.
