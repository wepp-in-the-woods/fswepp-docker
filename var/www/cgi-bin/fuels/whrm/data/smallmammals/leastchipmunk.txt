Distribution
Canada, non-coastal western USA
General Habitat
upland aspen stands; coniferous forests at upper elevations; spruce-fir forests with openings, associated with rocky or mesic habitats
Home or Activity Range
&lt 2.5 ac (O'Neil et al. 2001)
Canopy Cover
no information available
Specific Habitat Preferences
open sunny forests with an abundance of herbaceous and shrubby plants and many logs, snags, stumps, rocks and cliffs; avoids bare ground
Nestsite Characteristics
underground, in old logs, rocks, and cavities in snags
Foraging Habitat Characteristics
logs, debris, snags, well developed shrubby and herbaceous layers, rocky habitats, areas with cone-producing trees
Diet
omnivores: seeds, nuts, fruits, bulbs, roots, herbiage, insects, other animal matter
Predators
Mexican spotted owl
Shelter Habitats
snags, downed logs and woody debris for predator avoidance; burrows most oftened placed under large rocks
Response to Disturbance
no information available
Sources of Information used in the Model

General Sources of Background Information

Study Location: south-central Colorado
Habitat Description: spruce-fir forest bordered by dry subalpine meadows
Summary: Location and contents of burrows of golden-mantled ground squirrels and least chipmunks were studied in Colorado. Both species placed burrows under large rocks more than expected, though structure varied between species.

Study Location: southern Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO (60%), PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Abundance of small mammals was associated with generalized habitat types within the sup-alpine zone. Moisture and stand maturity were two habitat features that separated patterns of abundance of various species. Specific habitat associations are given for 8 species of small mammals. The southern red-backed vole was confirmed as a suitable indicator of old-growth forest; the masked and dusky shrew may be as well.

Study Location: review
Habitat Description: review
Summary: Habitat needs of a variety of northern goshawk prey are identified by a literature review. Management recommendations are made in regard to nesting, foraging, and other life history attributes.

Study Location: range of Mexican spotted owl; case studies in northern Arizona and New Mexico
Habitat Description: not stated; PIPO
Summary: Literature review and synthesis of data from past studies concerning the ecology of prey of the Mexican Spotted Owl, including information on owl diet, identification of prey that might influence owl fitness, and quantification of habitat correlates of prey species. The authors found variation in diet regionally. Reproductive success of spotted owls was not linked to any single prey species, rather to many species in combination, or total prey biomass. However, certain species may be more important in specific regions. Overall, food resources were quite variable among vegetation communities and through time. Owl food is most abundant during the summer when young are being raised. Prey biomass decreases in late fall and early winter. Habitat correlates are presented from one study in northern Arizona (deer mouse, brush mouse, Mexican woodrat) and one in New Mexico.
