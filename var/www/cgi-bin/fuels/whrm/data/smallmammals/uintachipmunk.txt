General Sources of Background Information

Summaries of Specific Studies
Raphael, Martin G. 1988. Habitat associations of small mammals in a subalpine forest, southeastern Wyoming. In: Management of amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals in North America symposium: proceedings; Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-166. Fort Collins, CO: USDA, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station. 359-367.

Study Location: southern Wyoming
Habitat Description: PICO (60%), PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Abundance of small mammals was associated with generalized habitat types within the supalpine zone. Moisture and stand maturity were two habitat features that separated patterns of abundance of various species. Specific habitat associations are given for 8 species of small mammals. The southern red-backed vole was confirmed as a suitable indicator of old-growth forest; the masked and dusky shrew may be as well.

Study Location: review
Habitat Description: review
Summary: Habitat needs of a variety of northern goshawk prey are identified by a literature review. Management recommendations are made in regard to nesting, foraging, and other life history attributes.
