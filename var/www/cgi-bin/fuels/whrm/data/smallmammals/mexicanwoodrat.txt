Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Small mammals were trapped in PIPO forest stands that had undergone a variety of treatments, including strip shelterwood cutting, clearcutting, severe thinning, and no treatment. Habitat relationships and diet composition are given for a variety of small mammals. The populations of some small mammals, particularly deer mice, were higher on treated plots than untreated plots; the presence of slash and other debris as well as the prevalence of food items (forbs and grasses) seems to be responsible for this pattern.

Study Location: range of Mexican spotted owl; case studies in northern Arizona and New Mexico
Habitat Description: not stated; PIPO
Summary: Literature review and synthesis of data from past studies concerning the ecology of prey of the Mexican Spotted Owl, including information on owl diet, identification of prey that might influence owl fitness, and quantification of habitat correlates of prey species. The authors found variation in diet regionally. Reproductive success of spotted owls was not linked to any single prey species, rather to many species in combination, or total prey biomass. However, certain species may be more important in specific regions. Overall, food resources were quite variable among vegetation communities and through time. Owl food is most abundant during the summer when young are being raised. Prey biomass decreases in late fall and early winter. Habitat correlates are presented from one study in northern Arizona (deer mouse, brush mouse, Mexican woodrat) and one in New Mexico.
