Response to Disturbance
often eat PIPO seedlings/roots and can thwart reforestation efforts (Verts and Carraway 2000)

Summaries of Specific Studies
Maguire, Chris C. 2002. Dead wood and the richness of small terrestrial vertebrates in southwestern Oregon. USDA Forest Service Gen. Tech. Rep. PSW-GTR-181: 331-345.

Study Location: Umpqua National Forest, southwestern Oregon
Habitat Description: mature PSME, with past history of thinning or salvage logging
Summary: The association between small vertebrate richness and coarse woody debris volume was tested, with a positive correlation demonstrated across all taxa and also within the taxonomic groups of small mammals, insectivores, and amphibians. A number of individual species appear to be associated with coarse woody debris; the majority of these associations were positive. No evidence of an association between snag volume and small vertebrate richness was found. Because the coarse woody debris volumes in the study area were well above regional guidelines, the author predicts reduced small vertebrate richness in those areas where coarse woody debris guidelines are strictly followed.
