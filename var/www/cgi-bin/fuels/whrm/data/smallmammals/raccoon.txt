Study Location: review of western Oregon and Washington
Habitat Description: intensively managed and unmanaged PSME
Summary: A comprehensive review of the importance of snags as wildlife trees in managed and unmanaged PSME forests. Includes information on the ecological role of snags and cavity users, wildlife snag requirements, snag management, and guidelines for selecting wildlife trees to meet logging safety requirements. Much detail is presented on calculating the number of snags needed to maintain specific densities of cavity-users. Forestry practices that impact snag production and retention are also outlined. The economic role of snags and cavity-using wildlife is addressed.
