Home or Activity Range
&lt 1 ac (O'Neil et al. 2001)
Canopy Cover
to not have complete upper forest canopy cover (Hayward and Hayward 1995)
Specific Habitat Preferences
alder stands and sites with high water table, logs >7.5 cm diameter, high forest complexity, increasing number of canopy layers, older forest, less grass cover, large diameter snags, edge habitat Hayward and Hayward (1995) found a positive association with large snags and a negative association with upper forest canopy cover, heavy grass cover, and density of medium-sized trees, but this species was combined with the masked or common shrew in analysis
Nestsite Characteristics
no information available

Mexican spotted owl

Response to Disturbance
most abundant in uncut plots, followed by unburned clearcut, least abundant in slash-burned clearcut (Hooven and Black 1976), more abundant in clearcut than young stands (Corn et al. 1988)
Sources of Information used in the Model

In: Management of amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals in North America symposium: proceedings; Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-166. Fort Collins, CO: USDA, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station. 340-352.

Study Location: Oregon and Washington Cascade Mountains
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: Abundance of small mammals was associated with seral stage and moisture of PSME forests. Habitat associations are given for a number of species. Comparisons between clearcut and young forests were made for a few species.

Cumulative effects of forest practices in Oregon: literature and synthesis. Salem, OR: Oregon Department of Forestry. 145 p.

Study Location: Oregon
Habitat Description: variety
Summary: Synthesis of the direct impacts of forest practices on wildlife populations in Oregon. Wildlife habitat and the ecological role of disturbance are theoretically outlined. A gradient approach to habitat is discussed, using the following gradients: edge density and contrast (Table 9.1, 9.3), seral stage (Table 9.4, 9.5), canopy cover (Table 9.6), floristic composition (Table 9.8, 9.10), dead wood (Table 9.11), special habitat features (caves, cliffs, talus) (Table 9.13, 9.14, 9.15), riparian areas (Table 9.17). Species-specific responses to these gradients are reviewed for managed and unmanaged forests.

Study Location: Frank Church Wilderness, central Idaho
Habitat Description: PICO-dominated, also PIPO, PSME, ABLA, PIEN
Summary: Small mammal populations were sampled in a wilderness area in central Idaho. Spruce-fir forests had the highest abundance of small mammals, while PICO forest had the lowest. Species richness was low in all habitats, though it was highest in PICO forest. Habitat associations are given for some small mammals. The patchy distribution of small mammals in this study area mimics the patchy nature of forests in this region.

Study Location: western Oregon (Cascades)
Habitat Description: PSME; also TSHE, THPL, ABGR
Summary: Changes in small mammal populations were documented in two clearcut (one with slash burned) and one uncut PSME stand. Shrews and chipmunks were adversely impacted by logging, while deer mice and Oregon creeping voles were affected favorably by both logging and slash burnings

Study Location: northwest Montana
Habitat Description: ABGR, LAOC, PIPO, BEPA, PSME, PIEN, ACGL
Summary: The habitat use patterns and food habitats of montane, vagrant, and masked shrews were studied. The vagrant shrew was most commonly captured on mesic sites, while the masked shrew was found more often on xeric sites. Montane shrews were infrequently captured. Marked masked and vagrant shrews did not differ in movement patterns, while both commonly used fallen trees as runways and as cover. Microhabitat use differed significantly between species. Differences suggest that the vagrant and masked shrews partition space within the habitat at both large and small scales. No significant difference in prey items was found between species.

Spencer, Albert W.; Pettus, David. 1966. Habitat preferences of five sympatric species of long-tailed shrews. Ecology. 47(4): 677-683.

Study Location: Colorado
Habitat Description: marsh, mixed conifer forest (subclimax PICO, also spruce and fire), clearcut
Summary: The habitat preferences of five species of sympatric shrews were analyzed from sites in Colorado. Dwarf shrews were found more than expected in forested and clear-cut habitats, but less than expected in a marsh. Vagrant shrews were found more than expected at clearcut and marsh habitats, but less at forested and intermediate habitats. Pygmy shrews exceeded expectation in the forest and marsh-forest intermediate habitats, and were deficient everywhere else. Common shrews were found more than expected in the marsh and forest-clearcut types but were deficient everywhere else. The authors hypothesize that vagrant and dwarf shrews are less dependent, physiologically, on a moist environment, than the common or pygmy shrew. The common and vagrant shrew populations appeared to interact, with similar population fluctuations, habitat preferences, and habitat segregation at one location.

Study Location: range of Mexican spotted owl; case studies in northern Arizona and New Mexico
Habitat Description: not stated; PIPO
Summary: Literature review and synthesis of data from past studies concerning the ecology of prey of the Mexican Spotted Owl, including information on owl diet, identification of prey that might influence owl fitness, and quantification of habitat correlates of prey species. The authors found variation in diet regionally. Reproductive success of spotted owls was not linked to any single prey species, rather to many species in combination, or total prey biomass. However, certain species may be more important in specific regions. Overall, food resources were quite variable among vegetation communities and through time. Owl food is most abundant during the summer when young are being raised. Prey biomass decreases in late fall and early winter. Habitat correlates are presented from one study in northern Arizona (deer mouse, brush mouse, Mexican woodrat) and one in New Mexico.
