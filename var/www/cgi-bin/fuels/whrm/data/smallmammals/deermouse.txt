Study Location:  Utah Co., Utah
Habitat Description:  PSME and aspen interspersed with herbaceous and shrub-dominated meadows
Summary:  Habitat associations of four small mammal species (deer mouse, western jumping mouse, western redbacked vole, montane vole) were examined for montane sites in Utah. Species microhabitat preferences are given. Microhabitat preferences shifted from fallen logs and brush in early summer to areas of herbaceous growth in mid and late summer. Females occupied more structured microhabitat than males (higher levels of fallen trees, trees, and shrubs).

Study Location:  Black Hills, South Dakota
Habitat Description:  PP, pine-grassland savanna
Summary:  Bird and deer mouse abundance was examined 1 and 2 years post-prescribed fire. Bird species composition was similar between burned and control plots. However, 7 bird species (American robin, Mountain bluebird, Solitary vireo, Yellow-rumped warbler, Western tanager, Dark-eyed junco, Chipping sparrow) were more abundant on burned plots the first year post-fire. In the second year post-fire, only one species was more abundant on the burns (Vesper sparrow), while 2 were more common on the controls (American robin, red-breasted nuthatch). Deer mice were similarly more abundant on burned plots the first year post-fire, but were not so the second year. The major difference in vegetation post-fire was the reduction of litter and small pines in the burned areas. The authors attribute the observed patterns of wildlife abundance to a temporary increase in the quantity or quality of local food supply as opposed to the documented changes in vegetative structure.

Study Location:  Bridger-Teton National Forest, Wyoming
Habitat Description:  PIEN-ABLA, PICO, PSME, PIFL
Summary:  Deer mouse and red-backed vole populations were monitored in sites that had been clearcut or had undergone selective logging. Selective logging removed 54% of the trees but retained mesic conditions. Clearcutting removed 84% of the trees and the resulted in a transition to xeric condition. As time since treatment progressed, voles were more common on uncut and selectively logged sites, whereas deer mice were more common on the clearcut sites. There was no difference between sites in sex-ratios, timing of reproduction, litter size, and body measurements.

Study Location:  northern Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Deer mice were less abundant in high density stands of ponderosa pine (live trees and small snags); more abundant in high forb cover and Gambel oak tree basal area.  Author predicts that deer mice will continue to increase in density in treated units for several years following treatment; then populations will stabilize.

Study Location: west slope of Oregon Cascades
Habitat Description: PSME
Summary: There was no significant difference in species richness among young, mature and old-growth PSME stands in the Oregon Cascade Range. Trowbridge's shrew was the most abundant small mammal captured. Trowbridge's shrew, the shrew-mole, the deer mouse, and the red tree vole all were associated with older stands. The coast mole was only found in mature and old growth stands in one year. Tree squirrel abundance was positively correlated with snags. Temporal and spatial differences in habitat use were indicated by associations with forest vegetational and physical characteristics. The authors state that young and mature stands in this study contained many characteristics of old growth stands as they were allowed to naturally regenerate. Therefore, caution should be exercised in extrapolating results, as these stands did not contain conditions representative of stands managed for timber production.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Small mammals were trapped in PIPO forest stands that had undergone a variety of treatments, including strip shelterwood cutting, clearcutting, severe thinning, and no treatment. Habitat relationships and diet composition are given for a variety of small mammals. The populations of some small mammals, particularly deer mice, were higher on treated plots than untreated plots; the presence of slash and other debris as well as the prevalence of food items (forbs and grasses) seems to be responsible for this pattern.

Study Location:  northwestern New Mexico
Habitat Description:  range from grass/sagebrush at low elevations to conifer forests containing PIPO, PSME, Picea sp., Abies sp., and aspen
Summary:  Habitat relationships of the sympatric deer, pinyon, brush and rock mouse were studied in northwest New Mexico. Subdivision of habitat by vegetational type is an important mechanism for coexistence in these species. Measures of the three-dimensional structure of habitat were correlated with the total number of species occurring in microsympatry. Mechanisms related to foraging activities that would enhance the coexistence of these species are also discussed.

Study Location: Coconino National Forest, Arizona
Habitat Description: PIPO
Summary: Relationships between small mammal species and wildfire severity categories were examined in northern Arizona. Average number of species was similar among high and moderate severity burn plots as well as controls, though species composition differed. Deer mice were more abundant on high-severity plots compared to moderate-severity plots. Patterns of habitat correlation for deer mice were not consistent across fire severities or spatial scales, suggesting that habitat use patterns differ between fire severities. The author suggests that deer mice are responded to habitat variables that are limiting in the specific severity type under consideration.

Study Location:  west-central Idaho
Habitat Description: dominated by DF and PP; scattered stands of ABGR, LP, PIEN
Summary:  Small mammals were trapped from 1-3 years after diameter-cut logging. Deer mouse populations were not different between logged and unlogged plots. Yellow-pine chipmunks were higher on logged sites, while Gapper's red-backed voles disappeared from the small mammal community after logging. The major changes to to the vegetation included a reduction in large-diameter trees and a loss of shrub cover due the logging activities and slash burning. Herbaceous vegetation recovered more quickly.

Study Location: Alberta
Habitat Description: PIGL, PIEN, PICO, ABLA, PIAL, aspen
Summary: Macrohabitat was assessed for deer mice, heather voles, red-backed voles, long-tailed voles and meadow voles. Deer mice were most abundant in rock fields and talus slopes, and also in dry aspen and rocky alpine meadows. Red-backed voles were most common in open spruce-fir forest, as well as other coniferous forest types. Long-tailed voles were most abundant in subalpine meadows and deciduous riparian areas, as well as rocky alpine areas. Heather voles were most abundant in coniferous riparian areas. Meadow voles were most abundant in subalpine meadows.

Study Location:  northwestern Montana
Habitat Description: THPL, TSHE zone; early successional class dominated by PICO, also LAOC, PSME, PIMO, BEPA, ABLA, ABGR; late successional stages as climax THPL-TSHE
Summary: Populations of southern red-backed voles and deer mice were examined in four successional stages of cedar-hemlock forest. Abundance of both species increased with stand age. Macro- and micro- habitat associations were not consistent. Deer mice behaved as a macrohabitat generalist, but exhibited stronger microhabitat selection than the voles. The southern red-backed vole demonstrated a strong relationship with stand age and old-growth conditions near the forest floor.

Study Location:  northwestern Montana
Habitat Description: ABLA habitat-types
Summary:  The effects of clearcutting on mammalian prey species of the wolverine were studied in northwestern Montana. Deer mice were more abundant in 5-year old clearcuts than 15-year old clearcuts and uncut forest. Redbacked vole densities were highest in uncut forest. Clearcuts provided diverse habitats for small mammals through different stages of succession, much like wildfire did at one point in time.

Study Location:  southern Wyoming
Habitat Description:LP (60%), PIEN, ABLA
Summary: Abundance of small mammals was associated with generalized habitat types within the sup-alpine zone. Moisture and stand maturity were two habitat features that separated patterns of abundance of various species. Specific habitat associations are given for 8 species of small mammals. The southern red-backed vole was confirmed as a suitable indicator of old-growth forest; the masked and dusky shrew may be as well.

Study Location:  northwestern California
Habitat Description:  DF forest
Summary: This study describes the relative abundance of amphibians, reptiles and mammals in six seral stages of forest in NW California. Seral stages preferred by individual species are given (Table 2). Late brush/sapling and old growth seral stages provided the most productive wildlife habitat. Habitat components that correlated with the relative abundance of 9 species are also presented. Species that would increase or decrease in numbers after harvest of old-growth DF forest are predicted.

Study Location:  south-central British Columbia
Habitat Description: PSME, PICO
Summary: This study tested the hypothesis that diversity of stand structure attributes and forest-floor small mammal communities increase from young pine to seed tree to old growth forest. Some vegetative attributes differed between forest type. Red-backed voles were most abundant in old growth forest, while northwestern chipmunks, heather voles, western jumping mice, montane shrews, and common shrews were more abundant in the treated stands. Meadow voles were more abundant in the seed tree stands. Deer mice, long-tailed voles, and short-tailed weasels were similarly abundant among all treatment types. Mean species richness and diversity was higher in the treated stands, suggesting that all stand types offer their own structural diversity to the forest landscape.

Study Location:  south-central British Columbia
Habitat Description: PICO, in a ABLA/PIGL climax zone
Summary: This study tested the hypotheses that the abundance and diversity of stand structural attributes, forest floor mammal communities, and relative habitat use of large herbivores will all increase from unthinned to conventionally thinned to chemically thinned stands of young PICO forest. Abundance and diversity of understory vegetation and small mammal communities were generally unaffected by stand thinning. Deer mice were most abundant in the chemically thinned stands, followed by unthinned and conventionally thinned stands. Heather voles were most abundant in the conventionally thinned stands. Other small mammals were similar between treatments. Mule deer habitat use was higher in conventionally thinned stands followed by chemically thinned stands over unthinned. Snowshoe hare pellets were highest in the unthinned stands, but also higher in the chemically thinned stands vs. the conventionally thinned stands. The patterns observed are attributed to the differences in stands structure that resulted from the treatment types.

Study Location:  range of Mexican spotted owl; case studies in northern Arizona and New Mexico
Habitat Description: not stated, presumably PIPO
Summary:  Literature review and synthesis of data from past studies concerning the ecology of prey of the Mexican Spotted Owl, including information on owl diet, identification of prey that might influence owl fitness, and quantification of habitat correlates of prey species. The authors found variation in diet regionally. Reproductive success of spotted owls was not linked to any single prey species, rather to many species in combination, or total prey biomass. However, certain species may be more important in specific regions. Overall, food resources were quite variable among vegetation communities and through time. Owl food is most abundant during the summer when young are being raised. Prey biomass decreases in late fall and early winter. Habitat correlates are presented from one study in northern Arizona (deer mouse, brush mouse, Mexican woodrat) and one in New Mexico.
